These materials show great promise for the development of cleaner power sources to address growing environmental concerns at a time of increasing global demand for energy. Noble metal-free MOF-derived onion slice-type hollow structured Co4S3 was developed and embedded with CdS nanoparticles for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The incorporation of Co4S3 with the CdS particles effectively accelerated charge separation and transfer in photocatalytic reactions due to the low density, hollow interior, and shell permeability of the onion-type composite. The optimized Co4S3/CdS photocatalyst led to an enhanced rate of H2 production of 12,360 μmol h−1 g−1 under simulated solar light irradiation; this value is 26-fold greater than that of the pristine CdS nanoparticles. The Co4S3/CdS composite exhibited remarkably stable photocatalytic performance for up to 65 h and could be reused in five successive cycles. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest H2 production rate achieved with cobalt sulfide-based CdS nanoparticle photocatalysts in the photocatalysis of water under simulated solar light irradiation. Owing to its low cost and high efficiency, this photocatalytic system should hold great potential for the development of highly efficient photocatalytic materials for use in various fields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Co4S3/CdS; Hollow nanostructures; Hydrogen; Metal-organic framework; Photocatalysis","Cadmium compounds; Cadmium sulfide; Catalysis; Cobalt; Cobalt compounds; Crystalline materials; Energy conversion; Hydrogen; Irradiation; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Organometallics; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Precious metals; Sulfur compounds; Co4S3/CdS; Cutting edge innovation; Hollow nanostructures; Metal organic framework; Photocatalytic hydrogen production; Photocatalytic materials; Photocatalytic performance; Photocatalytic reactions; Hydrogen production",2-s2.0-85032678839

It was found that the incorporation of ZIF-8 into Au/TiO2 could remarkably enhance the catalytic activity of Au/TiO2 both in dark and under visible light irradiation. The characterization result of Au/ZIF-8-TiO2 showed that the sheet of ZIF-8 was distributed on the surface of TiO2 microspheres to enhance the surface roughness of TiO2, which could effectively limit the migration and aggregation of Au nanoparticles (i.e., enhancing the dispersion of Au nanoparticles at support) due to its large surface area and porousness. Moreover, Au/ZIF-8-TiO2 owned a higher surface electron density of both Au nanoparticles and TiO2 as compared to Au/TiO2. It is proposed that ZIF-8 with abundant delocalized electrons of π bond could act as an electron donor for TiO2 and Au in the structure of Au/ZIF-8-TiO2, but it act as an electron transfer mediator to promote the electron transfer between Au and TiO2 induced by the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au nanoparticles under visible light irradiation. These behaviors would promote the adsorption and activation of CO and O2 at Au or TiO2 sites, resulting in the enhanced CO oxidation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electron transfer; Localized surface plasmon resonance of Au nanoparticles; Metal-organic frameworks; Oxidation of carbon monoxide; TiO2 supported Au catalyst","Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Crystalline materials; Electron transitions; Electrons; Gold; Irradiation; Light; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Organometallics; Oxidation; Plasmons; Precipitation (chemical); Self assembly; Surface plasmon resonance; Surface roughness; Titanium dioxide; Au nanoparticle; Deposition precipitation methods; Electron transfer; Electron transfer mediators; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Metal organic framework; Supported Au; Visible-light irradiation; Titanium compounds",2-s2.0-85032663130

Alkaline earth metal substituted MZr1-xNixO3-δ perovskites were synthesized by citrate gel method, characterized and evaluated for dry reforming methane. Characterization results show that the type of alkaline earth substituted at the A site of the perovskite oxide plays an important role in terms of structure, basicity, oxygen deficiency and Ni dispersion. Calcium substituted CaZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ catalyst shows superior activity in terms of high CH4 and CO2 conversion, while maintaining the activity even after 500 h of reaction. Mechanistic investigations were carried out using transient pulse experiments and insitu FTIR-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. These experiments reveal that redox property and basicity play important role in activation and sustaining the reforming reaction. Insitu FTIR measurements show that surface hydroxyl groups of the support are vital for high activity and durability of CaZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ catalyst. XRD and TGA analysis of catalysts after reaction show the structures are retained, but peaks pertaining to coke were observed on SrZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ and BaZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ catalysts. On the otherhand, CaZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ catalyst had only amorphous carbon even after 500 h of reaction. HRTEM studies revealed that SrZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ and BaZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ catalysts deactivated mostly due to the formation of carbon nanotubes with Ni embedded in them. Raman and XPS analysis helped in identifying types of coke precursors present on the catalysts. The investigation also illustrate that type of carbon formed depends on the basicity of perovskite oxide, metal to support interaction, Ni crystallite size, surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen defects. This study clearly demonstrated that CaZr0.8Ni0.2O3-δ is an excellent catalyst for dry reforming reaction with long life. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon deposition; Citrate gel method; Dry reforming; Nickel; Perovskites","Alkaline earth metals; Amorphous carbon; Barium compounds; Calcium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Coke; Crystallite size; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Methane; Nickel; Perovskite; Surface defects; Yarn; Carbon deposition; Citrate gel method; Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Dry reforming; Dry reforming-of-methane; Perovskite catalysts; Support interaction; Surface hydroxyl groups; Zirconium compounds",2-s2.0-85032690863

Nanoparticles containing both nickel and cobalt were well formed on the surface of HAP by conventional impregnation methods. No modification of HAP structure was observed after metals deposition. DRM reaction was carried out at 700–750 °C and around 1.6 bar, using a fixed-bed reactor which was fed with a mixture of 20%vol CH4, 20%vol CO2 and 60%vol N2. CH4 and CO2 conversion reached up to 60 and 68% at 700 °C, respectively, and 73 and 79% at 750 °C, respectively during long reaction times of 50–160 h. Water as a by-product could be quantified along the catalytic reaction indicating the implication of reverse water-gas-shift reaction.

Low loading of Ni/CeO2 was associated with high selectivity to CO over CH4, while higher Ni loading improved CO2 hydrogenation activity with a reduced CO selectivity. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis revealed Ni to be metallic for all catalysts including the CO-selective low loading 0.5% Ni catalyst, suggesting that the selectivity trend is due to structural rather than oxidation state effects. The loading amount of 1.5% Ni was selected for co-impregnation with Fe, based on the significant shift in product selectivity towards CH4 for that loading amount, in order to shift the selectivity towards CO while maintaining high activity. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) results indicated bimetallic interactions between Ni and Fe, and XANES analysis showed that about 70% of Fe in the bimetallic catalysts was oxidized. The Ni-Fe catalysts demonstrated improved selectivity towards CO without significantly compromising activity, coupling the high activity of Ni catalysts and the high CO selectivity of Fe. The general trends in Ni loading and bimetallic modification should guide efforts to develop non-precious metal catalysts for the selective production of CO by CO2 hydrogenation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 reduction; Metal oxide; Ni loading; Ni-Fe bimetallic catalysts; XANES",,2-s2.0-85032787759

Comparative trials in simulated water matrices with or without Cl− in the absence of natural organic matter (NOM) always led to a slower decay of parabens concentration and total organic carbon (TOC). This was mainly due to the superior regeneration of Fe2+ from photoreduction of Fe(III) complexes formed with NOM in real wastewater compared to that from Fe(OH)2+. In all matrices, a catalyst concentration as low as 0.20 mM Fe2+ was enough to ensure the production of [rad]OH in the bulk from Fenton's reaction. SPEF with BDD yielded a complete removal of parabens in 180 min and 66% mineralization at 240 min. This gave rise to the greatest mineralization current efficiencies reported so far, up to 1000%, with a low energy consumption of 84 kWh (kg TOC)−1. The synergy between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, which allowed the efficient dosage of [rad]OH and M([rad]OH) at low j, with simultaneous action of high UV power from sunlight justified such a good performance. Analogous apparent rate constants were determined for MeP, EtP and PrP. Slower decays were found with RuO2-based anode due to its lower oxidation power. As a result, the MCE was 425% as maximum, but a lower energy consumption of 52 kWh (kg TOC)−1 was needed.

Regeneration of the catalyst was attempted by either treating the poisoned catalyst with hydrogen, washing the catalyst with octanol or conducting a combined octanol wash-hydrogen treatment experiment, all at elevated temperatures and at atmospheric pressure. The combined regeneration experiment was the most effective, since the conversion and octanol selectivity were recovered to a significant extent.

Each kind of Fe-based materials could be functionalized in the most suitable catalysis field, wherever Mössbauer technique may play a unique role. For instance, Fe-N-C based materials are extensively investigated as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and Mössbauer spectroscopy application in this field has been utilized to identify the chemical nature of the active site on the Fe-N-C catalyst. Iron carbides are considered as the most active phase for FTS and Mössbauer technique is widely applied in determining the chemical phase of catalysts. Fe-based silicates, phosphates or polyanionic compounds are recognized as promising cathode materials for LIBs, for which Mössbauer technique has been mainly applied for tracking of the oxidation state and coordination environment change of Fe between charged and discharged states of the batteries. Similar phenomena can also be found in other catalysis fields. To give a clear understanding of which field is most suitable for a certain Fe-based catalyst and the best role of the Mössbauer technique in a certain catalysis field associated with the investigation of the mechanism, in this review, the recent advances of applying Mössbauer technique in catalysis are thoroughly summarized, including results from environmental catalysis and energy catalysis.

While oxygen vacancies tend not to align along the c-axis of monoclinic HfO2, oxygen vacancy chains along a-axis and b-axis are energetically favorable, with cohesive energies of 0.05 eV and 0.03 eV per vacancy, respectively. Nevertheless, with an increase of the cross section area, intensive oxygen vacancy chains become much more stable in hafnia, which yields phase separation into Hf-clusters and HfO2. Compared with disperse single vacancy chains, intensive oxygen vacancy chains made of 4, 6, and 8 single vacancy chains are energetically more favorable by 0.17, 0.20, and 0.30 eV per oxygen vacancy, respectively. On the other hand, while a single oxygen vacancy chain exhibits a tiny electronic energy gap of around 0.5 eV, metallic conduction emerges for the intensive vacancy chain made of 8 single vacancy chains, which possesses a filament cross section area of ∼0.4 nm2. This sets a lower area limit for Hf-cluster filaments from metallic conduction point of view, but in real hafnia resistive RAM devices the cross section area of the filaments can generally be much larger (&gt;5 nm2) for the sake of energy minimization.

In particular, it is linked to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Histopathological hallmarks of AD are intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular formation of senile plaques composed of the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) in aggregated form along with metal-ions such as copper, iron or zinc. Redox active metal ions, as for example copper, can catalyze the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) when bound to the amyloid-β (Aβ). The ROS thus produced, in particular the hydroxyl radical which is the most reactive one, may contribute to oxidative damage on both the Aβ peptide itself and on surrounding molecule (proteins, lipids, …).

Current research focuses on the realization of reliable PDC operation and its challenging integration into a gas turbine. The topic of pollutant emissions from such systems has so far received very little attention. Few rare studies indicate that the extreme combustion conditions in PDC systems can lead to high emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Therefore, it is essential already at this stage of development to begin working on primary measures for NOx emissions reduction if commercialization is to be feasible. The present study evaluates the potential of different primary methods for reducing NOx emissions produced during PDC of hydrogen. The considered primary methods involve utilization of lean combustion mixtures or its dilution by steam injection or exhaust gas recirculation. The influence of such measures on the detonability of the combustion mixture has been evaluated based on detonation cell sizes modeled with detailed chemistry. For the mixtures and operating conditions featuring promising detonability, NOx formation in the detonation wave has been simulated by solving the one-dimensional (1D) reacting Euler equations.

A facile, low-cost, and scalable strategy for producing nanostructured silicon remains a challenge. In this work, three natural clay minerals with different nanostructures, i.e., tabular halloysite, layered montmorillonite, and chain-layered palygorskite, were directly employed as precursors to synthesize porous nanostructured silicon via a combination of molten salt and magnesiothermic reduction. Results indicated that molten salt could efficiently absorb the massive heat generated from the exothermic reaction, which consequently inhibited the formation of high temperature phases (i.e., spinel and mullite) and the fusion of the generated silicon nanoparticles. Apart from acting as a reductant, metal Mg also consumed a part of the released heat through its vaporization to further lower the local reaction temperature. As a result, the as-synthesized nanostructured silicon showed large specific surface areas and enhanced porous architectures, e.g., 115.5 m2/g of specific surface area and 0.547 cm3/g of porosity for the sample obtained from palygorskite. Moreover, the microstructure and morphology of the resulting nanostructured silicon could be readily adjusted by properly choosing the clay mineral precursors and the added amounts of NaCl and Mg. Our strategy does not need to specially eliminate Al in clay minerals before reduction reaction, and greatly broadened the selection of clay minerals that can be directly used as silicon precursors, which would be beneficial to the practical production and wide applications of nanostructured silicon. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Clay minerals; Magnesiothermic reduction; Molten salt; Porous silicon nanomaterials","Chlorine compounds; Exothermic reactions; Fused salts; Kaolinite; Magnesium compounds; Minerals; Nanoparticles; Nanostructures; Porous silicon; Silicate minerals; Silicon; Sodium compounds; Specific surface area; High-temperature phasis; Large specific surface areas; Magnesiothermic reduction; Molten salt; Nanostructured silicon; Natural clay minerals; Practical production; Silicon nanoparticles; Clay minerals",2-s2.0-85032342907

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) is a sustainable and promising way to generate hydrogen. Despite of great achievements in photocatalytic HER research, its efficiency is still limited due to undesirable electron transfer loss, high HER over-potential and low stability of some photocatalysts, which lead to their unsatisfied performance in HER and anti-photocorrosion properties. In recent years, many spintronics works have shown their enhancing effects on photo-catalytic HER. For example, it was reported that spin polarized photo-electrons could result in higher photocurrents and HER turn-over frequency (up to 200%) in photocatalytic system. Two strategies have been developed for electron spin polarizing, which resort to heavy atom effect and magnetic induction respectively. Both theoretical and experimental studies show that controlling spin state of OH[rad] radicals in photocatalytic reaction can not only decrease OER over-potential (even to 0 eV) of water splitting, but improve stability and charge lifetime of photocatalysts. A convenient strategy have been developed for aligning spin state of OH[rad] by utilizing chiral molecules to spin filter photo-electrons. By chiral-induced spin filtering, electron polarization can approach to 74%, which is significantly larger than some traditional transition metal devices. Those achievements demonstrate bright future of spintronics in enhancing photocatalytic HER, nevertheless, there is little work systematically reviewing and analysis this topic.

In this work, HNO3-doped graphene/silicon solar cells were fabricated with the power conversion efficiency of 9.45%. Extensive characterization and first-principles calculations were carried out to establish an advanced technology computer-aided design (TCAD) model, where p-doped graphene forms a straddling heterojunction with the n-type silicon. In comparison with the simple Schottky junction models, our TCAD model paves the way for thorough investigation on the sensitivity of solar cell performance to graphene properties like electron affinity. According to the TCAD heterojunction model, the cell performance can be improved up to 22.5% after optimizations of the antireflection coatings and the rear structure, highlighting the great potentials for fabricating high efficiency graphene/silicon solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. © 2017","Doped graphene; Heterojunction; Solar cell","Antireflection coatings; Calculations; Computer aided design; Conversion efficiency; Efficiency; Electron affinity; Electronic design automation; Heterojunctions; Optoelectronic devices; Semiconducting silicon; Semiconductor junctions; Silicon solar cells; Solar cells; Advanced technology; First-principles calculation; Graphene properties; Other opto-electronic devices; Power conversion efficiencies; Schottky junctions; Solar cell performance; Transport mechanism; Graphene",2-s2.0-85032281543

Various ratios of macrocyclic Co complexes were used as the reductant to react with the GO, with which the surface functional groups of the GO were reduced and the macrocyclic ligand of the Co complexes underwent oxidative dehydrogenation, after which the conjugated macrocyclic Co systems were grafted onto the surface of the reduced GO to form GO/Co nanocomposites. The surface morphology, material structure, and composition of the GO/Co composites and their influences on the power-conversion efficiency of DSSC devices were comprehensively investigated.

Many factors affects the peeling of coating. Among them, the interfacial properties between coating and substrate plays a vital role. In this work, the β-Si3N4/diamond interface is conducted as the sample to study the changes in atomic structure and potential energy in the process of detachment by the first-principles calculations. The β-Si3N4/diamond (2 × 2) crystal unit is used as the calculated model. The detachment is simulated by moving up β-Si3N4 far from diamond by the 0.1 Å of each step. The results show that in the beginning of detachment, the bonds in the interface keep a constant length, rather than extension like spring. When the distance between β-Si3N4 and diamond reaches a certain distance, the interfacial bonds would suddenly break, and the elongated β-Si3N4 resumes its original statues indicating that the interface between two surfaces may exist a threshold value to control the peeling. When the external force is less than this threshold value, the peeling of coating would not occur. However, once the external force is greater than this one, the peeling would immediately present. The interface presents the brittle failure in the process of detachment, which is in good agreement with the experimental observation.

The spatial region of the deactivated SAM, which corresponds to process resolution, is adjustable by controlling the spatial propagation of the plasma.

However, their practical application is still seriously hindered by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the Li−S batteries system. Introducing anchoring materials into the cathode or separator, which can strongly attract LiPSs because of advisable binding energies, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttling effect for achieving the excellent cycling performance of Li−S batteries.

Among deposition mechanisms, the shadowing effect leads to the formation of a rough surface and a porous, columnar microstructure. Re-sputtered species may be re-deposited in the valleys of the films surface and thereby contribute to a reduction of roughness and to fill the underdense regions. Both effects are non-local and they directly compete to shape the final properties of the deposited films. Additional control of the bombarding flux can be obtained by ionizing the sputtered flux, because ions can be controlled with respect to their energy and impinging direction, such as in High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS). In this work, the relation between ionization of the sputtered species and thin film properties is investigated in order to identify the mechanisms which effectively influence the shadowing effect in Deep Oscillation Magnetron Sputtering (DOMS), a variant of HiPIMS. The properties of two Cr films deposited using the same averaged target power by d.c. magnetron sputtering and DOMS have been compared. Additionally, the angle distribution of the Cr species impinging on the substrate was simulated using Monte Carlo-based programs while the energy distribution of the energetic particles bombarding the substrate was evaluated by energy-resolved mass analysis. It was found that the acceleration of the thermalized chromium ions at the substrate sheath in DOMS significantly reduces the high angle component of their impinging angle distribution and, thus, efficiently reduces atomic shadowing. Therefore, a high degree of ionization in HiPIMS results in almost shadowing effect-free film deposition and allows us to deposit dense and compact films without the need of high energy particle bombardment during growth. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cr films; DOMS; IEDFs; Shadowing effect; Surface topography","Deposition; Film growth; Ionization; Magnetron sputtering; Metal ions; Metals; Sputtering; Surface topography; Topography; Columnar microstructures; CR film; D.c. magnetron sputtering; DOMS; High power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS); High-energy particles; IEDFs; Shadowing effects; Thin films",2-s2.0-85032017409

Morphological studies revealed that the surface of obtained HNCs is rough, homogeneous, and porous-like due to the embedding of CC NPs as well as sonication in comparison to the neat TG which has a smooth surface. The particle size reduction was observed for CC NPs in the matrix (from 57 to 10 nm), which is owing to the extraordinary effect of sonication on this process. Thermal stability of HNCs has been increased after using CC NPs from 8.5 wt% for TG to about 22 wt% for HNCs. The optical band gap of TG/CC HNC 5 wt% calculated to be 4.46 eV which is less than that of CC NPs (5.58 eV) and even TG (6.28 eV) and this result indicated that TG/CC HNC 5 wt% is relatively more conductive than CC NPs and TG.

An impregnation method was subsequently employed to load metals such as Cu, Co, Cr, Ag, and Ni on the optimized THS, followed by calcination in H2/N2 at 450 °C for 4 h. The morphological properties of the prepared samples were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV/vis). The SEM and TEM pictures showed that the Ti/ethanol ratio of 1:10 resulted in the formation of uniform hollow spheres. The XRD spectre revealed that phase transformation took place as the reflux temperature was increased, with pure anatase TiO2 hollow spheres being formed at 200 °C. The BET surface areas of the calcined photocatalysts were in the range of 80.6–116 m2/g−1. The UV/vis spectra of the photocatalysts showed that loading of transition metals reduced the band gap of the THS. The activities of the prepared catalysts were tested for hydrogen production via photocatalytic reforming of glycerol under solar irradiation. The improved hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic reforming of glycerol was attributed to: the high surface area which enhanced the adsorption of glycerol onto the surface of photocatalysts; high crystallinity and the reduced band gap which improved the solar light harvesting; the hollow chamber within the TiO2 spheres which produced multiple reflection of the light harvested, thus producing efficient electron/hole pair formation; and the detailed composition of the solids retarded the electron/hole recombination by trapping the electrons generated during the photo excitation of the photocatalysts, and thereby promoted their activity. © 2017","Biomass; Glycerol; Photocatalysis; Renewable hydrogen; Titania hollow spheres","Biomass; Calcination; Catalyst activity; Electron microscopy; Electrons; Energy gap; Glycerol; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen production; Image enhancement; Nitrogen compounds; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Scanning electron microscopy; Solar power generation; Spheres; Sulfur compounds; Titanium dioxide; Transition metals; Transmission electron microscopy; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Urea; X ray diffraction; Brunauer emmett tellers; Morphological properties; Multiple reflections; Nano-structured TiO2; Photocatalytic reforming; Production of hydrogen; Renewable hydrogens; Titania hollow spheres; Titanium compounds",2-s2.0-85031714423

Due to the existence of weak convection of liquid paraffin through metal foam during phase change process, the IHTC should be carefully determined for a low Reynolds number range (Re = 0-1), which however has been rarely addressed in the literature. In this paper, a direct simulation at foam pore scale is carried out to determine the IHTC between paraffin and metal foam at Re = 0-1. For this purpose, the cell structures reflecting realistic metal foams are first constructed based on the three-dimensional (3D) Weaire-Phelan foam cell to serve as the representative elementary volume (REV) of metal foam for direct simulation. Then, by solving the Navier-Stokes equations and energy equation for the REV, the influences of Reynolds number (Re), Prandtl number (Pr), foam porosity (ε), and pore density (PPI) on the dimensionless IHTC, i.e., the Nusselt number Nuv, are investigated. According to the numerical results, a correlation of Nuv at Re = 0-1 is proposed for metal foam/paraffin composite material, which covers both diffusion-dominated interstitial heat transfer region (Re ≤ 0.1) and convection-dominated interstitial heat transfer region (0.1 < Re ≤ 1). Finally, the applicability of this correlation in the two-energy equation model for solid-liquid phase change of paraffin in metal foam is validated by comparing the model predicted melting front with that of experimental observations made in this study. It is found that the IHTC correlation proposed in this study can be used in the two-energy equation model for well predicting the phase change process of paraffin in metal foam. © 2018 by ASME.","correlation; direct simulation; interstitial heat transfer coefficient; low Re; open-cell metal foam; paraffin; Weaire-Phelan foam cell","Cells; Correlation methods; Cytology; Heat transfer; Heat transfer coefficients; Metals; Navier Stokes equations; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Porosity; Prandtl number; Reynolds number; Rhenium; Composite phase change materials; Direct simulation; Foam cells; Open-cell metal foams; Representative elementary volume; Solid liquid phase change; Threedimensional (3-d); Two-energy equation model; Foams",2-s2.0-85031777316

Here, in order to effectively suppress Li dendrite growth without degrading the specific capacity, a three-dimensional (3D) pie-like porous current collector was prepared based on copper nanowires (CuNWs) and graphene (GE). The inter-spaces inside the CuNWs framework efficiently accommodate Li deposition. Meanwhile, the GE layer wrapped outside CuNWs functions as flexible interfacial protective layer that could protect extra Li deposition. Furthermore, the GE shell can also decelerate the oxidation of CuNWs in ambient atmosphere.

The dynamic behavior of its PTO force, which integrates friction and pressure forces, is a difficult constraint to include in an analytical or in a numerical model. In this paper, the PTO force characteristics of a hydraulic cylinder are experimentally and numerically investigated under different magnitudes of controlled excitation force. In order to characterize the dynamic behaviors of PTO force, the displacement, acceleration, and pressure in the cylinder chamber for given excitation forces are measured. The pressure force is calculated using the measured value of the pressure, and the friction force is calculated based on the equation of motion using measured values of the pressure, excitation force, and acceleration of the piston. Experimental results show clearly a strong nonlinear force-velocity characteristics, including stochastic and hysteretic behaviors. To model the hysteretic behavior, the modified LuGre model is used for the friction force and a new approach is proposed for the pressure force. To model the stochastic behavior of the friction and pressure forces, the spectral representation method is used. The systematically comparison between measured and simulated results shows that the numerical model captures most of dynamic behaviors of PTO force.

In the present work, we successfully synthesized Cu@Ag NPs paste, and they were successfully applied for joining Cu/Cu@Ag NPs paste/Cu firstly in air by the ultrasonic-assisted sintering (UAS) at a temperature of as low as 160 °C. Their sintered microstructures featuring with dense and crystallized cells are completely different from the traditional thermo-compression sintering (TCS). The optimized shear strength of the joints reached to 54.27 MPa, exhibiting one order of magnitude higher than TCS at the same temperature (180 °C) under the UAS. This ultra-low sintering temperature and high performance of the sintered joints were ascribed to ultrasonic effects. The ultrasonic vibrations have distinct effects on the metallurgical reactions of the joints, resulting in the contact and growth of Cu core and the stripping and connection of Ag shell, which contributes to the high shear strength.

Characterization with different techniques showed that the Th-MOF sample synthesized by UARM method had higher thermal stability (354 °C), smaller mean particle size (27 nm), and larger surface area (2.02 × 103 m2/g). Besides, in this novel approach, the nucleation of crystals was found to carry out in a shorter time. The synthesis parameters of UARM method were designed by 2k−1 factorial and the process control was systematically studied using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and response surface methodology (RSM). ANOVA showed that various factors, including surfactant content, ultrasound duration, temperature, ultrasound power, and interaction between these factors, considerably affected different properties of the Th-MOF samples. According to the 2k−1 factorial design, the determination coefficient (R2) of the model is 0.999, with no significant lack of fit. The Fvalue of 5432, implied that the model was highly significant and adequate to represent the relationship between the responses and the independent variables, also the large R-adjusted value indicates a good relationship between the experimental data and the fitted model. RSM predicted that it would be possible to produce Th-MOF samples with the thermal stability of 407 °C, mean particle size of 13 nm, and surface area of 2.20 × 103 m2/g. The mechanism controlling the Th-MOF properties was considerably different from the conventional mechanisms. Moreover, the MOF sample synthesized using UARM exhibited higher capacity for nitrogen adsorption as a result of larger pore sizes.

This model takes into account the coupling of gas, liquid and metal phases. Laser heat input is described using a cone heat source model with changing peak power density, its height being determined based on the keyhole size. Arc heat input is modeled as a double ellipsoid heat source. The arc plasma flow and droplet transfer are simulated through the two simplified models. The temperature and velocity fields for different laser powers are calculated. The computed results are in general agreement with the experimental data. Both the peak and average values of fluid flow velocity during hybrid welding are much higher than those of GMAW. At a low level of laser power, both the arc force and droplet impingement force play a relatively large role on fluid flow in the hybrid welding. Keyhole depth always oscillates within a range.

In order to improve the photovoltaic properties of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), we optimized the Nb doping level of the Nb-TiO2 BLs by controlling the Nb/Ti molar ratio (0, 5, 6, and 7) of the precursor solution for HUSPD. Compared to bare TiO2 BLs, the Nb-TiO2 BLs formed a cascading band structure using the positive shift of the conduction band minimum of the Nb-TiO2 positioned between fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and TiO2. This results in the increase of the potential current and the suppression of the electron recombination. Hence, it led to the improvement of the electrical conductivity, due to the increased electron concentration by the Nb doping into TiO2. Therefore, the DSSC fabricated with the Nb-TiO2 BLs at a Nb/Ti molar ratio of 6 showed superior photoconversion efficiency (∼7.50 ± 0.20%) as a result of the improved short-circuit current density. This is higher than those with the other Nb-TiO2 BLs and without BL.

Using linear regression analysis, this paper develops the empirical-statistical relation between these key parameters and geometrical characteristics of single clad tracks (i.e. clad height, clad width, penetration depth, wetting angle, and dilution) as a combined parameter (PαVβFγ). The results indicated that the clad width linearly depended on PV−1/3 and powder feeding rate had no effect on it. The dilution controlled by a combined parameter as VF−1/2 and laser power was a dispensable factor. However, laser power was the dominant factor for the clad height, penetration depth, and wetting angle so that they were proportional to PV−1F1/4, PVF−1/8, and P3/4V−1F−1/4, respectively.

We observed that a compact and stable SEI layer composed of Li2SO3 and Li2SO4 on top of lithium anode is formed during the initial discharge process due to the synergetic effect of shuttled polysulfides and LiNO3, which can effectively suppress the subsequent reaction between polysulfides in electrolyte and lithium metal and thus result in the alleviation of polysulfide shuttle effect.

The pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen groups are dominant among various N-containing groups in the samples. The 950 °C-activated sample (CANHCS-950) has the largest surface area (2072 m2 g−1), pore volume (1.96 cm3 g−1), hierarchical micro-mesopore distributions (1.2, 2.6 and 6.2 nm), hollow macropore cores (~91 nm) and highest relative content of pyridinic and graphitic N groups.

The result showed that Na2SO4 poisoning leads to a reduced denitration rate of the SCR catalyst and an increase in the SO3 generation rate. Na2O poisoning leads to a significant reduction in the denitration rate of the SCR catalyst and marginally improves the formation of SO3. The maximum of the SO3 generation rate for a Na2SO4-poisoned catalyst reached 1.35%, whereas it was only 0.85% for the SCR catalyst. When the SO2 was contained in flue gas, the denitration rate for the Na2O-poisoned catalyst clearly increased by more than 28%. However, the effect of SO2 on the Na2SO4-poisoned catalyst was very slight. The denitration rate of the SCR catalyst decreased with an increase in the Na content. The BET and XRD results showed that Na poisoning of the catalyst decreased the number of acid sites, the reducibility of the catalyst, the surface area, and pore volume. The H2-TPR and NH3-TPD results show that Na decreases the number of acid sites and the reducibility of the catalyst. The FT-IR and XPS results showed that Na2O poisoning led to the decrease of V5+[dbnd]O bonds and the consumptions of oxygen atoms. Na2SO4 poisoning can improve surface adsorbed oxygen, which was beneficial for the SO2–SO3 conversion reaction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Denitration; Selective catalytic reduction; SO3; SO4 2−; Sodium poisoning","Catalyst poisoning; Catalysts; Denitrification; Nitrogen removal; Sodium; Adsorbed oxygen; Conversion reactions; Generation rate; Oxygen atom; Pore volume; SCR catalysts; Selective catalytic reduction catalysts; Surface area; Selective catalytic reduction",2-s2.0-85031507822

How to design a visible-light-active photocatalyst is critical for efficient solar energy utilization. Many oxides including TiO2 are only photoactive in ultraviolet light and doping is an important strategy to extend the photoactive zone. Anion doping is superior to cation doping, which generates more harmful electron-hole recombination centers. Nitrogen doping is more effective than carbon/sulfur doping to achieve high visible-light response. Since 2001, nitrogen-doped TiO2 photocatalysts have attracted increasing attention due to their strong oxidizing power and considerable visible light response. Considering the fixed atomic environment in simple oxides, complex oxides are more attractive as photocatalysts because of their more flexible physical and chemical properties. To date, no review focuses on the designation strategies for nitrogen-doped simple/complex oxides with high visible-light photoactivity. In this review, the recent progress involving nitrogen-doped simple/complex oxides for photocatalysis is comprehensively summarized.

The high σ mainly results from the significant increment of carrier mobility μ which is mainly due to preferred edge-on orientation and high crystallinity of PEDOT chains.

However, the necessity to distinguish the polarity of asymmetric supercapacitors makes it more like rechargeable batteries and affects the convenience of practical applications. We herein report a novel flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) that can be charged without distinguishing the electrode polarity based on CVD-grown nickel nanoparticle@carbon nanotube (Ni@CNT) network films. The FASC is assembled by using the binder-free Ni@CNT as both the negative and positive electrodes but aqueous alkaline solution as the electrolyte. In such a design, one electrode side is involved with the Faradaic redox reactions between nickel nanoparticles and OH-, while the other side works via electric double layer charge accumulation at the interface of CNTs/electrolyte, enabling the device with an asymmetric feature and a high voltage of 1.8 V. Exactly because of the above, the FASC demonstrates almost the same charge/discharge profiles, stable cycling and comparable efficiency for powering small electronics even with frequently alternating the charging direction. With the integration of hydrogel electrolyte of PVA-KOH, our flexible quasi-solid-state FASC device delivers high volumetric energy density of 1.39 mWh cm−3 and power density of 440 mW cm−3, as well as excellent cycleability up to 10,000 times (100% capacitance retention).

Thermally-excited spin-wave (SW) excitations completely account for Ms(T) and the SW description of Ms(T) gives the values for the saturation magnetization and spin-wave stiffness at absolute zero of temperature, i.e., Ms(0) and D0, for nc-Ni samples of different d that are in excellent agreement with the corresponding values deduced previously from an elaborate SW analysis of the bulk magnetization data.

In particular H- or O-terminations lead to wide variations in their characteristics. To study the origins of such aspects in greater depth, different methods to achieve oxygen terminated diamond were investigated following a multi-technique approach. DFT calculations were then performed to understand the different configurations between the C and O atoms. Three methods for O-terminating the diamond surface were performed: two physical methods with ozone at different pressures, and an acid chemical treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, HRTEM, and EELS were used to characterize the oxygenated surface. Periodic-DFT calculations were undertaken to understand the effect of the different ways in which the oxygen atoms are bonded to carbon atoms on the diamond surface. XPS results showed the presence of hydroxyl or ether groups, composed of simple C[sbnd]O bonds, and the acid treatment resulted in the highest amount of O on the diamond surface. In turn, ellipsometry showed that the different treatments led to the surface having different optical properties, such as a greater refraction index and extinction coefficient in the case of the sample subjected to acid treatment. TEM analysis showed that applying temperature treatment improved the distribution of the oxygen atoms at the interface and that this generates a thinner amount of oxygen at each position and higher interfacial coverage. Finally, DFT calculations showed both an increase in the number of preferential electron transport pathways when π bonds and ether groups appear in the system, and also the presence of states in the middle of the band gap when there are π bonds, C[dbnd]C or C[dbnd]O. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DFT calculations; Diamond; HRTEM analysis; Surface O termination; XPS","Atoms; Carbon; Density functional theory; Diamonds; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron transport properties; Ellipsometry; Energy gap; Ethers; Optical properties; Oxygen; Ozone; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; DFT calculation; Different treatments; Extinction coefficients; Homoepitaxial diamond; HRTEM analysis; Multi-technique approach; Periodic DFT calculation; Temperature treatments; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85031730268

The lignocellulosic biomass was dissociated in ILs ([Bmim]Cl and [Bmim]AOC) aided by ultrasound waves. Sonication was performed at different frequencies (20, 28, 35, 40, and 50 kHz), a power of 100 W, a time of 30 min and a temperature of 80 °C. The changes in the structure and crystallinity of the cellulose were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The amounts of the total reducing sugars, glucose, cellobiose, xylose and arabinose in the hydrolysates were determined. The results of FT-IR, XRD and TGA revealed that the structure of cellulose of both biomass samples remained intact after the pretreatment, but the crystallinity decreased. The enzymatic and acid hydrolysis of the biomass samples pretreated with the ultrasound-IL result in higher yields of the reducing sugars compared with the IL-pretreated sample.

The synthesized cubic phase spinel NiFe2O4 nanomaterial possesses high specific surface area (148 m2g−1) with narrow mesopore size distribution. The effect of MWCNTs addition on the electrochemical performance of nanocomposite has been probed thoroughly in a normal three electrode configuration using 2 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature. Experimental results show that the addition of mere 5 mg MWCNTs into fixed NiFe2O4 precursors amount enhances the specific capacitance up to 1291 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is the highest reported value for NiFe2O4 nanocomposites so far. NiFe2O4/CNT nanocomposite exhibits small relaxation time constant (1.5 ms), good rate capability and capacitance retention of 81% over 500 charge-discharge cycles. This excellent performance can be assigned to high surface area, mesoporous structure of NiFe2O4 and conducting network formed by MWCNTs in the composite. Further, to evaluate the device performance of the composite, an asymmetric pseudocapacitor has been designed using NiFe2O4/CNT nanocomposite as a positive and N-doped graphene as a negative electrode material, respectively.

In general, arsenic contamination was found higher in South and Northeast China than in other regions, with means of 18.7 and 15.8 mg/kg, respectively. Vertically, arsenic concentrations were higher in top layer (0–15 cm) soils (median of 9.8 mg/kg) and decreased with soil depth (medians of 8.9 mg/kg at 15–30 cm and 8.0 mg/kg at 30–45 cm).

Since spin dependent interface scattering is the mechanism that governs GMR, these observations suggests that LMTP also originates from the spin dependent interface scattering of thermally induced current.

Difference of dynamic behaviors of the bubble between the cases in UVH and CH was compared respectively, and the effects of acoustic amplitude and ultrasonic frequency on the bubble dynamics were simulated numerically using the Runge-Kutta fourth order method with variable step size adaptive control. Finally, the cavitation intensity of grinding fluids under ultrasound was measured quantitatively using acoustimeter. The results showed that the grinding fluid subjected to ultrasound can generate many bubbles and further forms numerous groups of araneose cavitation bubbles on the surface of the honing stone. The oscillation of the bubble under UVH is more intense than the case under CH, and the maximum velocity of the bubble wall under UVH is higher two magnitudes than the case under CH. For lower acoustic amplitude, the dynamic behaviors of the bubble under UVH are similar to that case under CH.

Importantly, the mesoporous structure, large specific surface area, and small size endow the mesoporous In2O3 nanoparticles with highly sensing performance for formaldehyde detection. The response value to 10 ppm HCHO is 20 at an operating temperature of 280 °C, and the response and recovery time are 4 and 8 s, respectively. It is expected that the mesoporous In2O3 nanoparticles with large specific surface area and excellent sensing properties will become a promising functional material in monitoring and detecting formaldehyde. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Formaldehyde; Gas sensors; Hydrothermal; In2O3 nanoparticles; Mesoporous","Chemical sensors; Electron microscopy; Formaldehyde; Functional materials; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrothermal synthesis; Mesoporous materials; Nanoparticles; Pore size; Scanning electron microscopy; Specific surface area; Synthesis (chemical); Thermogravimetric analysis; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Formaldehyde detection; Hydrothermal; Large specific surface areas; Mesoporous; Mesoporous structures; Morphology and structures; Response and recovery time; Thermogravimetry analysis; Indium compounds",2-s2.0-85032688826

At first, one-dimensional α-MnO2 nanorods (NRs) were produced by a hydrothermal technique and then they were amended with stearic acid (SA) by a solvothermal process. In following, the NCs were made by adding different volumes of α-MnO2-SA NR (1, 3 and 5 wt%) in the PVP matrix through ultrasonic irradiation as a green, low-cost, fast, and useful technique. Structural and morphological descriptions confirm crystallinity of α-MnO2-SA NRs and showed that NRs have been separately dispersed in PVP matrix with rod-like morphology and diameter of about 40–60 nm. The use of modifier and ultrasonic waves is accountable for good homogeneities of NRs. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that thermal permanency of the obtained NCs has grown with increasing the α-MnO2-SA content. Also, the UV–vis absorption of NCs was enhanced with the incorporation of the modified α-MnO2 NR in PVP matrix.

To solve the issues of its volume expansion and low conductivity, a moderate amount of elemental titanium was introduced into the crystal structure of SnS2 to partially replace tin, providing lantern-like Ti0.25Sn0.75S2, which was firmly linked with one-dimensional multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to produce active materials for sodium-ion battery anodes. The electrochemically inert Ti-containing component provided a stable host structure during the insertion and extraction processes of sodium ions and enlarged the interlayer spacing of SnS2.

Our results indicate that, in case of MoO3 bulk, Li diffusion barriers in the interlayer and intralayer spaces are 0.55 eV and 0.58 eV respectively, which are too high to warrant fast Lithium-ion charge/discharge processes. While on MoO3 (010) surface, Li exhibits a diffusion barrier as low as 0.07 eV which guarantees an extremely fast Li diffusion rate during charge/discharge cycling. However, in MoO3/graphene monolayer, Li diffusion barrier is at the same level as that on MoO3 (010) surface, which also ensures a very rapid Li charge/discharge rate. The rapid Li charge/discharge rate in this system originates from the removal of the upper dangling O1 atoms which hinder the Li diffusion on the lower MoO3 layer. Besides this, due to the interaction between Li and graphene, the Li average binding energy increases to 0.14 eV compared to its value on MoO3 (010) surface which contributes to a higher voltage. Additionally, the increased ratio of surface area provides more space for Li storage and the capacity of MoO3/graphene composite increases up to 279.2 mAhg−1. The last but not the least, due to the high conductivity of graphene, the conductivity of MoO3/graphene composite enhances greatly which is beneficial for electrode materials.

Microaggregates isolated by dry-sieving served as control. While ultrasonic dispersion significantly disintegrated soil aggregates into smaller units, slaking in water did not.

In the CFD-DEM simulations of fluid-particle systems on sub-particle scale mesh, a smoothed void fraction method (SVFM) is developed to compute the void fraction field based on the particle position and volume. A diffusion function is obtained analytically as a spatial distribution function of particle volume in SVFM, which converges to the step-function-type distribution of particle volume in the sub-particle-scale divided finite volume method (DFVM) when the smoothing degree goes to 0. In validation by a spout fluidized bed when the cell size is less than the particle diameter, it is shown that SVFM is preferable to DFVM for the CFD-DEM simulation since it is in better agreement with the experimental measurements. Moreover, the CFD-DEM simulation using the SVFM on sub-particle scale meshes is performed for the benchmark problem of the HTR-10 reactor. The numerical results at the smoothing degree of η = 0.5 are in good agreement with the empirical code of THERMIX – which is based on experimental measurements. In addition, the discussion indicates that the smoothing degree in SVFM is recommended to be 0.5–0.7 according to the void fraction distribution of Voronoi-tessellation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CFD-DEM; Packed pebble bed; Particle; Particle radiation; Smoothing void distribution; Sub-particle",,2-s2.0-85032832457

Generally, the concentrations of ∑16PAHs in surface soil were 1.5 times higher than house dust, and ranged 767–6770 ng/g dry weight (dw) (median 1810 ng/g dw), and 747–4910 dw (median 1320 ng/g dw), respectively. High molecular weight-PAHs both in soil and dust were more abundant than low molecular weight-PAHs, suggesting the dominance of pyrogenic source. Moderate to weak correlation of TOC and BC with PAHs in soil and dust suggested little or no role of soil organic carbon in sorption of PAHs. Source diagnostic ratio and principal component analysis indicated fossil fuel combustion, traffic/vehicular emissions and combustion of biomass are the principal sources of PAHs contamination in Nepalese urban environment. The high average TEQ value of PAHs in soil than dust suggested high risk of soil carcinogenicity compared to dust. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass combustion; Persistent organic pollutants; Petrogenic; Principal component analysis; Pyrogenic; Toxicity equivalence quantity","Air pollution; Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbon; Combustion; Dust; Environmental Protection Agency; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Health risks; Houses; Hydrocarbons; Molecular weight; Organic carbon; Organic pollutants; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Principal component analysis; Risk assessment; Soils; Volatile organic compounds; Biomass combustion; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Petrogenic; Pyrogenic; Toxicity equivalences; Soil pollution",2-s2.0-85032685728

Spin-coated PPy/PU layers were micropatterned with predefined 3D geometries by ultrashort laser ablation. Then they were conformally coated by Matrix Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation, in order to restore their chemical and electrical integrity. The chemical structure of the laser-processed PPy/PU substrates was investigated by 2D and 3D mapping of the laser-processed areas, via Raman microspectroscopy. In vitro studies revealed that the micropatterned PPy/PU substrates facilitated the topological and electrical communication of the seeded osteoblasts.

The results show evidence of a snubbing friction force that is found to range from one thousandth to one tenth of the tension in graphene. Snubbing friction behavior is found to be exponential to the inclined angle and the friction coefficient and proportional to the tension in graphene.

Soil, water, wheat, and rice samples were collected from the Lihe River Watershed in the Taihu Region (east China). In this study area, many types of industrial plants, including ceramics factories, plants working with refractory materials, and chemical plants are densely distributed and cause serious heavy metal pollution. In addition, well-developed transportation and agricultural activities are also important sources of heavy metals. Thus, the concentrations of selected heavy metals including cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in the samples were analyzed to evaluate their potential integral risk (IR) to the health of the local population. Accordingly, the spatial distribution pattern of the IR values was determined in the study. The soil in the study area showed heavy Cd pollution, whereas the pollution by other elements was relatively slight. When the proportions of grain samples in which the concentrations exceeded the tolerance limits were examined, the grains were primarily contaminated with Pb, Ni, Cd, and Zn; and less contaminated with Cu and Cr. The drinking water of the local inhabitants was safe. The average IR value was 3.53 for adults and 3.91 for children, indicating that both adults and children may experience adverse health effects. The spatial distribution pattern of the IR values among the exposed populations in the study area showed high values in the eastern and middle parts, with maximum values > 5, and low values in the western part, with minimum values < 2.

DFT calculation results indicate that Hg0 adsorption on FeS2(100) and FeS2(110) surfaces is dominated by physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms, respectively. Mercury atom interacts strongly with Fe atom on FeS2(110) surface through the atomic orbital hybridization and overlap. HgS is chemically adsorbed on FeS2(100) and FeS2(110) surfaces. Electron density difference analysis implies that the significant charge accumulation around sulfur atom of adsorbed HgS molecule is closely associated with the strong interaction between gaseous HgS and pyrite surface.

To reduce bulky volume of solid residues after co-precipitation, calcination is necessary to investigate the chemical stability of targets. Calcination at 850 °C resulted in the high crystalization of HAp with formation of xCaO·B2O3 as a by-phase in which x increased with a decrease in the borate contents. After calcination, the lattice parameter a of HAp showed a reentrant curve and c showed a convex curve with an increase in borate contents.

In this study, the effects of Ag NPs on Paracoccus denitrificans under anoxic conditions were investigated, and the mechanism was explored by analyzing the transcriptional and proteomic responses of bacteria to Ag NPs. The presence of 5 mg/L Ag NPs led to excessive nitrate accumulation (232.5 versus 5.3 mg/L) and increased nitrous oxide emission. Transcriptional analysis indicated that Ag NPs restrained the expression of key genes related to denitrification. Specifically, the genes involved in denitrifying catalytic reduction and electron transfer were significantly down-regulated. Moreover, the expression of the genes responsible for polyhydroxybutyrate synthesis was enhanced, which was adverse to denitrification. Proteomic profiling revealed that the syntheses of the proteins involved in catalytic process, electron transfer, and metabolic process were inhibited by Ag NPs.

The films were characterized by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), DC/AC electrical conductivity and dielectric measurements in the frequency range (100 Hz- 1 MHz). The glass transition temperature, Tg, was increased by increasing the concentration of fullerene C60; this property reflects the increase of thermal stability by increasing the nanofiller content. The DC and AC electrical conductivities were enhanced by increasing C60 concentration due to the electron hopping or tunneling between filled and empty localized states above Tg. The relaxation time was determined from the αβ -relaxations and found to be attenuated by increasing the temperature as a typical behavior of amorphous polymers. The calculated values of thermodynamic parameters revealed the increase of molecular stability by increasing the doping concentration; this feature supports the application of PMMA/PVAc/C60 nanocomposite films in a wide scale of solar energy conversion applications such as luminescent down-shifting (LDS) coatings for photovoltaic cells. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AC/DC fields; Luminescent down-shifting coatings; PMMA/PVAc/C60 nanocomposites","Coatings; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Electric conductivity; Energy conversion; Fullerenes; Glass transition; Luminescence; Nanocomposites; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Plastic coatings; Polymer blends; Polymer films; Semiconductor doping; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Transmission electron microscopy; AC electrical conductivity; Dielectric measurements; Differential scanning calorimeters; Doping concentration; Electrical conduction; Electrical conductivity; Polymer nanocomposite; Thermodynamic parameter; Nanocomposite films",2-s2.0-85031815344

Meanwhile, the performance may also be influenced by adsorption of H2O on the surface of the material. In this work, the effect of H2O is studied by reducing plate-like array WO3 films under different pressure ratio of H2O/H2. It is controlled by changing the water temperature in the washing bottle through which the Ar/H2 (80:20) gas flows. The higher water vapor pressure not only decreases the content of W5+ but also increases the content of surface hydroxyl groups in the WO3 films. Moreover, the excess water vapor improves the crystallinity. The WO3 film shows hydrophobicity with adhesive property and high contact angle hysteresis after reduction, and the wettability increases with the increase of the pressure ratio of H2O/H2. Additionally, a built-in electric field may form by dissociation of the surface hydroxyl group and absorption of O− species, which promotes the charge separation, showing better photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance.

The goals of this study were to test various regression models for estimating soil salt content based on hyperspectral data, HJ-CCD images, and Landsat OLI data using; develop optimal band Difference Index (DI), Ratio Index (RI), and Normalization Index (NDI) algorithms for monitoring soil salt content using image and spectral data; and to compare the performances of the proposed models using a Bootstrap-BP neural network model (Bootstrap-BPNN) from different data sources. The results showed that previously published optimal remote sensing parameters can be applied to estimate the soil salt content in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR). Optimal band combination indices based on DI, RI, and NDI were developed for different data sources. Then, the Bootstrap-BP neural network model was built using 1000 groups of Bootstrap samples of remote sensing indices (DI, RI and NDI) and soil salt content. When verifying the accuracy of hyperspectral data, the model yields an R2 value of 0.95, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.38 g/kg, and a residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 3.36.

Countries with rapidly developing economies such as China are faced with significant soil pollution problems due to accelerated industrialization and urbanization over the last decades. This paper provides an overview of published scientific data on soil pollution across China with particular focus on organic contamination in agricultural soils. Based on the related peer-reviewed papers published since 2000 (n = 203), we evaluated the priority organic contaminants across China, revealed their spatial and temporal distributions at the national scale, identified their possible sources and fates in soil, assessed their potential environmental risks, and presented the challenges in current remediation technologies regarding the combined organic pollution of agricultural soils. The primary pollutants in Northeast China were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) due to intensive fossil fuel combustion. The concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and phthalic acid esters (PAEs) were higher in North and Central China owing to concentrated agricultural activities. The levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were higher in East and South China primarily because of past industrial operations and improper electronic waste processing. The co-existence of organic contaminants was severe in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, which are the most populated and industrialized regions in China. Integrated biological-chemical remediation technologies, such as surfactant-enhanced bioremediation, have potential uses in the remediation of soil contaminated by multiple contaminants. This critical review highlighted several future research directions including combined pollution, interfacial interactions, food safety, bioavailability, ecological effects, and integrated remediation methods for combined organic pollution in soil. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural soil; Combined organic contamination; Organochlorine pesticides; Phthalate esters; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Agriculture; Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Biochemistry; Bioremediation; Contamination; Developing countries; Environmental technology; Esters; Food safety; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Organic pollutants; Pesticides; Pollution; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Remediation; Risk assessment; River pollution; Soils; Waste incineration; Agricultural soils; Organic contamination; Organochlorine pesticides; Phthalate ester; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Spatial and temporal distribution; Surfactant-enhanced bioremediation; Soil pollution; organochlorine pesticide; phthalic acid ester; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; agricultural soil; critical analysis; organic pollutant; organochlorine pesticide; PAH; PCB; phthalate; soil pollution; soil remediation; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; agricultural soil; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; China; combined pollution; concentration (parameters); controlled study; electronic waste processing; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental risk; food safety; geographic distribution; interfacial interaction; microbial community; nonhuman; phytoremediation; plant microbe associated bioremediation; pollution; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; soil; soil microflora; soil organic contamination; soil pollution; surfactant enhanced bioremediation; trend study; waste management; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Tianjin; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",2-s2.0-85030787269

It was found that LEN was bound to ct-DNA with high binding afﬁnity (Ka = 2.308 × 105 M−1 at 283 K) through groove binding as evidenced by a slight decrease in the absorption intensity in combination with CD spectra. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔG &lt; 0, ΔH &gt; 0 and ΔS &lt; 0) of the LEN-DNA system obtained at three different temperatures suggested that the binding process was spontaneous and was primarily driven by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction. Furthermore, competitive binding experiments with ethidium bromide and 4′, 6-dia-midino-2-phenylindoleas probes showed that LEN could preferentially bind in the minor groove of double-stranded DNA. The average lifetime of LEN was calculated to be 7.645 ns. The φ of LEN was measured as 0.09 and non-radiation energy transfer between LEN and DNA had occurred. The results of the molecular docking were consistent with the experimental results.

The results classified economic benefits, intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, resource-related aspects, institutional set-up and passivity towards environmental quality as major entry points for integrated natural resource management. Although the economic benefit in the form of the affordability of nitrogenous fertilizers was found to be the most critical rationale for fertilizer use, passivity towards environmental quality emerged as a factor of interest.

These biomarkers are found in different forms including overexpressed proteins/surface antigens, metabolites, miRNA, and the entire cell as well. Several approaches have been adopted to detect such cancer biomarkers, where electrochemical sensors have widely been appreciated due to its high sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, and miniaturized point-of-care cancer diagnostics.

Scratch tests with a Berkovich sharp indenter were carried out on the surface of the coatings. A model to calculate the volume displaced during the scratch tests was proposed, and the contributions of the four main mechanisms that describe the local scratch behaviour were investigated. The analysis of the results showed that microploughing characterises the IN625 clads behaviour. The formation of M7C3 carbides in the composites’ matrix, arising from the partial fusion of the Cr3C2 particles during the deposition, transform the main scratch mechanism into a microcutting process. After exposure at high temperature, microploughing continues to be the main mechanism that describes the IN625 behaviour, but the formation of secondary phases constrains the plastic deformation, increasing the scratch resistance.

The recent progress on radiative cooling has many potential applications in efficient passive cooling. During the day, this strategy uses the maximized infrared emissivity via the atmospheric transparency windows for radiating heat and minimizing solar absorption. However, the realization of daytime radiative coolers with ideal selective mid-infrared emissivity is still a great challenge. Here, we firstly design and numerically demonstrate a near-ideal radiative cooler operating below the ambient temperature, achieving both broadband selective emissivity in the infrared atmospheric window and extremely low absorption in the entire solar spectrum, realizing a net cooling power exceeding 122 W/m2 at ambient temperature. The cooling effect can still persist under significant nonradiative heat exchange conditions. The design of multi-layer all-dielectric micropyramid structure in this work not only solves the shortcoming of poor mid-infrared selectivity in planar photonics device, but also overcomes the disadvantage of high solar absorption in metal/dielectric metamaterials.

At the same time, the presence of aniline fragments leads to the appearance of new S0 → S2 transitions of the charge transfer character in electronic spectra of BODIPYs. We also found a linear relationship between vertical energy of these charge transfer transitions and the electron donating power of an aniline fragment and electron accepting power of the BODIPY core depending on the number and position of methyl groups. The CC2 method provides the best overall description of the excitation energies in line with the experimental observations. On average, the quality of TD-CAM-B3LYP is almost equal to that of CC2, however the TD method with the CAM-B3LYP functional slightly underestimates the CT excitation energy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ab initio; BODIPY; Effect of substituents; Electronic spectrum; RI-CC2; TD-CAM-B3LYP","Aniline; Charge transfer; Excitation energy; Numerical methods; Ab initio; BODIPY; Effect of substituents; Electronic spectrum; RI-CC2; TD-CAM-B3LYP; Cams",2-s2.0-85029481958

It is found that the crystallization behavior of the confined PEOs varies with annealing temperature (Ta), annealing time (ta), and molecular weight of PEO. Notably, it is observed that the crystallization temperature (Tc) and melting temperature (Tm) of PEO increase with prolongation of ta, for PEO600K/PAN and PEO2K/PAN coaxial electrospun fibers.

Thus, this new thermoset SMP could become a novel solution.

We focus on the most hazardous anthropogenic emissions of coal power industry: sulfur and nitrogen oxides. The research findings show that these emissions may be several times lower if coal and oil processing wastes are mixed with water as compared to the combustion of traditional pulverized coal, even of high grades. The study focuses on wastes, such as filter cakes, oil sludge, waste industrial oils, heavy coal-tar products, resins, etc., that are produced and stored in abundance. Their deep conversion is very rare due to low economic benefit. Effective ways are necessary to recover such industrial wastes. We present the cost assessment of the changes to the heat and power generation technologies that are required from typical power plants for switching from coal, fuel oil and natural gas to CWSPs based on coal and oil processing wastes. The corresponding technological changes pay off after a short time, ranging from several months to several years. The most promising components for CWSP production have been identified, which provide payback within a year. Among these are filter cakes (coal processing wastes), which are produced as a ready-made coal-water slurry fuel (a mixture of flocculants, water, and fine coal dust). These fuels have the least impact on the environment in terms of the emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides as well as fly ash. An important conclusion of the study is that using CWSPs based on filter cakes is worthwhile both as the main fuel for thermal power stations and boiler plants and as starting fuel. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Anthropogenic emissions; Coal combustion; Coal water slurries containing petrochemicals; Sulfur and nitrogen oxides; Thermal power stations and boiler plants","Air pollution; Boilers; Coal; Coal dust; Coal industry; Coal slurries; Coal tar; Coal water mixtures; Economic and social effects; Fly ash; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuel oils; Fuels; Gas fuel analysis; Gas plants; Industrial wastes; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Petrochemicals; Pollution; Produced Water; Slurries; Sulfur; Thermal pollution; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste incineration; Wastes; Water pollution; Anthropogenic emissions; Boiler plants; Coal water slurry; Energy performance indicators; Impact on the environment; Oil and natural gas; Technological change; Thermal power stations; Coal combustion; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; coal combustion; coal-fired power plant; nitrogen oxides; power generation; slurry; sulfur; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; boiler; carbon footprint; climate change; coal power; combustion; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; environmental temperature; geothermal energy; petrochemical industry; priority journal; sedimentation; viscosity",2-s2.0-85029693974

Six heavy metals were analyzed, and the RDS index model was adopted to estimate the potential heavy metal load washed off by stormwater runoff. Analysis of variance revealed that the excavation and gravel filling of rain gardens and excavation of porous pavements were critical LID construction stages that contributed the largest masses of RDS per unit area to road surfaces. Although the concentration of heavy metals at LID construction sites was lower than at sites without LID construction, the load of heavy metals washed off from LID construction was much higher. In addition, the sizes of regions influenced by accumulated RDS from LID construction descended in the following order: arterial road (600–775 m) > collector road (150–200 m) > access road (100–150 m) > laneway (20–30 m).

Concerns have been expressed that this may hamper the transition to a low-carbon economy. We estimate the required extraction of Fe, Al, Cu, Ni, Cr, In, Nd, Dy, Li, Zn, and Pb until 2050 under several technology-specific low-carbon scenarios. Annual metal demand for the electricity and road transportation systems may rise dramatically for indium, neodymium, dysprosium, and lithium, by factors of more than three orders of magnitude. However, in the base year 2000 the dominant uses were often in other sectors. Since growth in these other, previously dominant sectors has been less pronounced, the overall growth in society's metal needs is much less dramatic than in the electricity and transportation sectors. Total annual demand for the researched metals would rise by a factor of 3–4.5, corresponding to compound growth rates of between 2% and 3%. Such growth rates are similar or lower compared with historical growth rate levels over the last few decades. Prolonged higher levels have existed for copper, for example, with production rising by 8% per year from 1992 to 2006. Yet this state of affairs does not give cause for complacency. The richest resources may have been used, production is showing a tendency towards becoming very large-scale, and development times have increased, all leading to greater risks of disruption. It is therefore crucial, when developing specific technologies, that the resource-specific constraints are analyzed and options for substitution are developed where risks are high. © 2017 The Authors","Constraints; Energy; Metals; Resources; Transition","Environmental management; Growth rate; Lead; Renewable energy resources; Constraints; Energy; Low-carbon energy systems; Resources; Road transportation; Three orders of magnitude; Transition; Transportation sector; Metals",2-s2.0-85032706817

Microstructural evolution in the aged weld metal (WM) was observed and its influence on the hardness and Charpy impact toughness were investigated. The as-welded WM exhibits a martensitic/bainitic microstructure with moderate hardness less than 350 HB and impact toughness value above 110 J/cm2. Aged WM exhibits deterioration of mechanical properties dependent on the temperature of aging. When the aging temperature is below 823 K, the WM shows little change in hardness but its impact toughness drops significantly. When the aging temperature is above 823 K, the hardness of the WM starts to decrease quickly while its impact toughness increases gradually. As the aging temperature increases to 923 K, its impact toughness further increases and recovers to a value comparable to that of the as-welded condition. Embrittlement occurring during aging at 773–823 K results from tempered martensite embrittlement (TME), which is caused by the decomposition of retained austenite. When the aging temperature exceeds 823 K, M23C6 carbides precipitate rapidly inside grains and at grain boundaries and MX carbides begin to precipitate inside grains. These cause the release of carbon from the matrix, reduction of lattice distortion, and accelerated recovery of laths causing the hardness to decrease rapidly and the impact toughness to increase. W-rich carbides are observed in a minority of grain boundaries in the WM aged at temperatures higher than 823 K, which may cause intergranular fracture and retard the improvement of impact toughness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Mechanical properties; Microstructure; T23 steel; Weld metal","Carbides; Carbon; Embrittlement; Fracture toughness; Grain boundaries; Hardness; Heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Welding; Charpy impact toughness; Intergranular fracture; Lattice distortions; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Post weld heat treatment; T23 steels; Tempered martensite embrittlement; Weld metal; Welds",2-s2.0-85032853462

Amongst various geometrical features that can be realized in weld-deposition based AM, the thin-walled features (i.e., features with one single deposition pass) are the toughest as the process has to overcome the bead-over-bead complexity. Based on geometric modelling and experimentation, this paper presents an efficient technique for producing the thin-walled metallic structures, including objects with undercut features. This is possible by adding extra degrees of freedom or by using higher order kinematics to the work piece and/or to the deposition head by suitably aligning the overhanging feature in-line to the deposition direction.

However, there is still a lack of statistical methods to automatically detect the onset of a defect and signal an alarm during the part's layer-wise production. This study contributes to this framework with two levels of novelty. First, it presents an in situ monitoring method that integrates the acquisition of infrared images with a data mining approach for feature extraction and a statistical process monitoring technique to design a data-driven and automated alarm rule. Second, the method is aimed at monitoring powder bed fusion processes for difficult-to-process materials like zinc and its alloys, which impose several challenges to the process stability and quality because of their low melting and boiling points. To this aim, the proposed approach analyzes the byproducts generated by the interaction between the energy source and the material.

Toxicity outcome in zebrafish is discussed in relation with the physicochemical characteristics of the abrasive particles and with the type and concentration profile of the slurry components pre and post-polishing, as well as the interactions between particle abrasives and additives. This work provides toxicological information of realistic CMP slurries and their polishing waste, and can be used as a guideline to predict the impact of these materials in the environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical additive; Chemical mechanical planarization; Interaction; Metal oxide particle; Toxicity; Zebrafish embryo","Abrasives; Additives; Amino acids; Cerium compounds; Chemical compounds; Metals; Polishing; Semiconductor device manufacture; Silica; Silicon compounds; Slurries; Surface chemistry; Toxicity; Chemical additive; Concentration profiles; Environmental and health effects; Integrated circuit chips; Interaction; Metal oxide particles; Physicochemical characteristics; Zebrafish embryos; Chemical mechanical polishing; Danio rerio",2-s2.0-85032669151

The blank is heated to a desired temperature using an industrial induction heater. The temperature value of the blank was measured using thermocouples and a pyrometer. The forming process at elevated temperatures is realized for a wide range of heating temperatures of 20–800 °C. The effect of overheating of the blank due to transfer of the blank from the heater to the stamping die using an industrial robot on the dimensional deviation of the drawpiece is considered. The geometry of the drawpieces was measured using an Atos 3D optical scanner (GOM, Germany). The smallest shape deviation of the drawpiece is obtained in the case of forming at 680 °C. To study the change of temperature during the heating and forming process, thermocouples and an optical pyrometer were used. The analysis of the microstructure of the blank material at different temperatures indicates that plastic strain in the temperature range of 20–800 °C causes an increase of banding of phase components of the microstructure. No evident effect of strain rate on the change of the 17-4PH steel microstructure is observed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AMS5604; Elevated temperature; Sheet metal forming; Stainless steel; Strut","Age hardening; Electromagnetic wave emission; Engines; Induction heating; Laser recording; Metal forming; Microstructure; Pyrometers; Pyrometry; Scanning; Sheet metal; Strain rate; Struts; Thermocouples; Turbines; AMS5604; Change of temperatures; Dimensional deviation; Elevated temperature; Heating temperatures; Optical pyrometers; Steel microstructure; Temperature values; Stainless steel",2-s2.0-85029469413

Most of these issues could be addressed by changing the conventional architecture of PEMFCs. The present work introduces a novel, net-shape flat architecture with unique capabilities. This netlike design increases the active area dramatically by bringing each channel in contact with three different electrodes. These capabilities are further investigated through a well-validated three-dimensional non-isothermal model in ANSYS Fluent. Comparing the polarization curves shows that, per unit active area, the net-style design has a performance significantly better than that of conventional (classical) PEMFCs. In addition, it shows more uniform distribution of oxygen, water, current and temperature. Moreover, it provides remarkably higher current and power densities. Owing to its netlike shape, the proposed multi-channel PEMFC is also considerably smaller and requires less bipolar plates per unit active area. As a result, the state-of-the-art design introduced in this work can enhance the performance of PEMFCs remarkably while reducing their size and the bipolar plate cost. The net-type stack can therefore be considered one of the promising designs for the next generation of PEMFCs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bipolar plate cost; Netlike fuel cell; Performance; Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell; Stack size; Three-dimensional non-isothermal simulation","Costs; Electrolytes; Fuel cells; Isotherms; Polyelectrolytes; Polymers; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Bipolar plates; Non-isothermal models; Nonisothermal simulation; Performance; Polymer electrolyte fuel cells; Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs); Stack size; Uniform distribution; Solid electrolytes",2-s2.0-85032206881

The tantalum market has experienced several disruptions and subsequent price swings in the past, implying problems with its supply chain resilience and stability. In this study, we trace the entire value chain of the tantalum industry from mining to the intermediate and the downstream industries. Our interest is to see how dependent the tantalum supply chain is on specific countries and regions, how exposed primary production is to disruptions, and what mechanism counteracts disruption. This study assesses the tantalum supply chain from a resilience perspective rather than an investigation of any specific disruption in the system. We analyze several resilience-promoting mechanisms such as: (a) diversity of supply, (b) material substitution, (c) recycling and (d) stockpiling. We evaluate each of these mechanisms, and find that even though diversity of supply and stockpiling mechanisms have been decreasing for years, the tantalum supply chain has been flexible in its response to disruption. We find a much larger supply from unaccounted artisanal and small mining sources than expected based on official statistics, and estimate the unaccounted production in Africa, which shows an almost 250 percent increase from around 600 tons in 2004 to more than 2000 tons in 2014.

We evaluated the mutual effects between GO and Ni (Ni(II)) with regard to their adsorption and co-adsorption on two minerals (goethite and hematite) in aqueous phase. Results indicated that GO and Ni could mutually facilitate the adsorption of each other on both goethite and hematite over a wide pH range. Addition of Ni promoted GO co-adsorption mainly due to the increased positive charge of minerals and cation–π interactions, while the presence of GO enhanced Ni co-adsorption predominantly due to neutralization of positive charge and strong interaction with oxygen-containing functional groups on adsorbed GO. Increasing adsorption of GO and Ni on minerals as they coexist may thus reduce their mobility in soil. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy data revealed that GO altered the microstructure of Ni on minerals, i.e., Ni formed edge-sharing surface species (at RNi-Fe∼3.2 Å) without GO, while a GO-bridging ternary surface complexes (at RNi-C∼2.49 Å and RNi-Fe∼4.23 Å) was formed with GO.

A previous investigation conducted in the same location recorded atmospheric lead (Pb) pollution after ~ 1845, with peak values recorded in the 1970s, and concluded that a North American source was most likely. To confirm the origin of the lead, we present new Pb isotope data from Sandhavn, together with a high-resolution record for mercury (Hg) deposition. Results demonstrate that the mercury accumulation rate has steadily increased since the beginning of the 19th century, with maximum values of 9.3 μg m− 2 yr− 1 recorded ~ 1940. Lead isotopic ratios show two mixing lines: one which represents inputs from local and regional geogenic sources, and another that comprises regional geogenic and pollution sources. Detrending the Pb isotopic ratio record (thereby extracting the effect of the geogenic mixing) has enabled us to reconstruct a detailed chronology of metal pollution. The first sustained decrease in Pb isotope signals is recorded as beginning ~ 1740–1780 with the lowest values (indicating the highest pollution signature) dated to ~ 1960–1970. The 206Pb/207Pb ratio of excess Pb (measuring 1.222, and reflecting pollution-generated Pb), when compared with the Pb isotopic composition of the Sandhavn peat record since the 19th century and the timing of Pb enrichments, clearly points to the dominance of pollution sources from North America, although it did not prove possible to further differentiate the emissions sources geographically. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric deposition; Hg; Isotopic residuals; Metal pollution; Pb isotopes; Peat","Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Hydrogen bonds; Isotopes; Lead; Mercury (metal); Meteorological problems; Mixing; Peat; Pollution; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric pollutants; Atmospheric pollution; Isotopic residuals; Mercury accumulation; Mercury contamination; Metal pollution; Pb isotopes; Air pollution; coal; lead 206; lead 207; mercury; petroleum; radioisotope; unclassified drug; arctic environment; atmospheric pollution; isotopic ratio; lead isotope; long range transport; mercury (element); nineteenth century; peat; pollutant source; pollutant transport; air pollution; Article; chronology; energy consumption; Greenland; industry; isotope analysis; North America; pollution transport; priority journal; wood; Arctic; Eurasia; Greenland; North America",2-s2.0-85029672677

Here, we report a systematic characterisation of charge carrier loss pathways in nanoparticulate OPVs prepared using poly(3-hexylthiophene) as a donor and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester as an acceptor material. Optical modelling of the nanoparticle active layer morphology indicates minimal losses from scattering and negligible plasmon effects from the discrete 40 nm particles. A comparison of the modelled internal absorption for the nanoparticle films confirms negligible differences in comparison to a standard bulk heterojunction active layer structure. By contrast, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE), determined with the aid of optically modelled internal active layer and parasitic non-active layer absorption, exhibited values of 24% for the nanoparticle device whilst the bulk heterojunction showed a value of 76%. Subsequent modelling of the EQE and IQE (supported by photoluminescence quenching measurements) indicated an exciton dissociation yield of 24% for nanoparticulate devices in comparison to 81% for the corresponding bulk heterojunction, in excellent agreement with the device internal quantum efficiencies. Transient measurements of charge transport and bimolecular recombination lifetime revealed a charge carrier drift length longer than the film thickness at short circuit conditions for both device structures. Impedance spectroscopy measurements confirmed very low photoinduced chemical capacitances at short circuit and returned charge collection efficiencies in excess of 80% for both devices, suggesting only minor charge collection losses in either device at short circuit.

SGT-012 and SGT-052 porphyrins, containing a strong donor unit, exhibited similar S-band absorption and a slightly red-shifted Q-band absorption compared to SGT-016 and SGT-053 porphyrins containing a weak bulky donor unit, respectively. To further extend the π-conjugation and absorption to a longer wavelength range, the triple bond at two meso-positions of the porphyrin core and a benzothiadiazole (BTD) strong electron acceptor was introduced to yield SGT-052 and SGT-053, resulting in a red-shift and broad visible region absorption ability. It was indicated that these modifications lead to the formation of a stronger intramolecular charge transfer complex, which is favourable for harvesting sunlight, than those of SGT-012 and SGT-016 porphyrins. To prevent undesirably reduced Voc caused by charge recombination processes and dye aggregation from porphyrin-sensitized solar cells, HC-Al of co-adsorbent was adopted to fabricate SGT-052- and SGT-053-based solar cells. The DSSCs with SGT-052 and SGT-053 exhibit better light harvesting ability than the DSSCs with SGT-012 and SGT-016 porphyrins, due to the formation of the stronger intramolecular charge transfer complex. Thus, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of SGT-052 and SGT-053-based DSSCs was extremely red-shifted to a wavelength of 800 nm, resulting in higher Jsc values of 15.3 and 14.6 mA cm−2, respectively. The DSSC utilising SGT-052 and HC-A1 exhibited a higher photovoltaic performance (ηeff ∼9.6%) than did other sensitizers. On the basis of SGT-052-based DSSC, its DSSCs co-sensitized with SGT-012 were prepared to improve the Jsc, Voc and power conversion efficiency (10.2%). © 2017","D-π-A structure; Donor bulkiness; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Porphyrins; The donor ability; π-conjugation extension","Aluminum compounds; Charge transfer; Conversion efficiency; Efficiency; Porphyrins; Self assembly; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Zinc; Charge recombination process; Donor ability; Donor bulkiness; Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies; Intra-molecular charge transfer; Photovoltaic performance; Power conversion efficiencies; Visible region absorption; Dye-sensitized solar cells",2-s2.0-85032869903

Based on the results, the recent environmental history of Lake Changdang can be divided into three periods. The first period from approximately 1906 to 1950, represents a natural state, with minimal anthropogenic impact on the lake. Human induced environmental change is recorded in the following stage, ca. 1950–1982, during which the trophic status of the lake increased slightly in response to inputs of agricultural waste and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) based fertilizers. In particular, the signs of eutrophication during this phase accelerated from ca. 1973, perhaps owing to large-scale using phosphate based chemical fertilizer around the lake at the time. A second phase of nutrient input in the most recent stage, ca. from 1982 to 2016, initiated by wastewater discharge from rapid urbanization and industrialization of the catchment, greatly enhanced the nutrient level in the lake. However, the central zone of the lake has yet to reach a phytoplankton-dominated stable state, with both algae and aquatic macrophytes tracking an increased trend in productivity driven by intermediate nutrient levels in the water of this zone. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Eutrophication; Human activities; Lake Changdang; Lipid biomarker; Nutrients","Agricultural wastes; Analytical geochemistry; Biomarkers; Catchments; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Heavy metals; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrients; Water quality; Anthropogenic effects; Anthropogenic impacts; Chemical fertilizers; Environmental change; Environmental history; Human activities; Lipid biomarkers; Wastewater discharge; Lakes; alkane derivative; brassicasterol; cholesterol; dinosterol; lead 210; nitrogen; phosphorus; silicon dioxide; sitosterol; sterol; unclassified drug; anthropogenic effect; biomarker; environmental change; environmental history; eutrophication; lacustrine deposit; lake water; lipid; nutrient; sediment core; Article; catchment; China; controlled study; environmental change; eutrophication; fertilizer application; human; industrialization; limit of quantitation; macrophyte; mass fragmentography; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; nonhuman; priority journal; river basin; sediment; urbanization; waste water management; Changdang Lake; China; Jiangsu; Taihu Basin; algae",2-s2.0-85029672194

The objective of this research work is to understand the underpinning interface science of interspersed graded ceramic/metal and ceramic/ceramic composites at the grain structure level for robust coatings and bulk material components for vehicle propulsion systems. This research enhances our understanding of the fundamental relationship between interface properties and the thermomechanical behavior in dissimilar materials for materials by design systems, and creates the ability to develop and fabricate materials with targeted macroscale properties as a function of their interfacial behavior.

In this study, the low-temperature ignition enhancement performance of fuel additives of various properties and concentrations in n-decane were investigated theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical results indicate that there exists an optimized relationship between the effective activation energy and vaporization rate. Based on the optimization study, a novel design method for composite fuel additives was proposed. With this method, a metallic organic compound blended with a low-boiling-point auxiliary, methoxydiethylborane/tetrahydrofuran (MDEB/THF) solution, was employed to modify the ignition performance of n-decane. Thermogravimetry analysis and droplet-hot plate impinging experiment were performed to characterize the vaporization rate, ignition temperature, and ignition delay time of n-decane-based hybrid fuels. The experimental results suggest that, at a high concentration of MDEB/THF fuel droplets, the minimal ignition surface temperature is reduced to 160 °C, which is approximately 500 °C lower than that of pure n-decane. The ignition delay time of the fuel droplet is diminished from 353 ms to 45 ms at a surface temperature of 500 °C.

Until now, the most efficient donor-free sensitizers are composed of oligo-thiophenes or covalently connected cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) units with one terminal of cyanoacetic acid as the anchoring group. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for improving the performance of CPDT based donor-free dyes by incorporating an electron-deficient quinoxaline unit into the π-chain. Three new donor-free dyes of SC1-3 with main difference of number and location of long alkyl chains are designed and synthesized. The incorporated electron-deficient quinoxaline unit is found to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer transition and weaken the deprotonation effect on absorption properties, resulting in an improved light harvesting efficiency relative to the reference dye CPDT-3. The influence of long alkyl chains on the optical and electronic properties as well as photovoltaic performance is systematically studied.

Most studies simulate or measure the variants by indirect methods and accept them as true results. The new computer-controlled, interactive brake pad friction tester presented in this study was developed for this purpose. The major components of the machine, which are operated simultaneously, include: a proportional pressure-controlled hydraulics power pack, a mechanical transmission system with electromagnetic clutch, and a brake and automation control with SCADA computer analysis interface. Compared to other friction testing machines, a very important innovation of the newly developed friction tester allows for the testing of the brake pad samples and measuring of the noise level both to be performed with high precision under real conditions. Moreover, this friction tester is capable of determining the friction coefficients; wear behavior, temperature, and life intervals of brake pad samples. This novel brake pad system is relatively cheaper and measures effective friction coefficients more accurately.

These two polymers show nearly identical absorption spectra in the long wavelength range, which can be ascribed to the identical backbones consisting of silafluorene and DBT moieties. Cz-PSF-DBT shows a higher open circuit voltage of 1.0 V due to its higher oxidation onset coming from the σ conjugation between the silica atoms at 9-position and carbazole substituents compared to TPA-PSF-DBT of 0.93 V. However, the power conversion efficiency of TPA-PSF-DBT is much higher than that of Cz-PSF-DBT. The AFM images show the finer morphology of TPA-PSF-DBT:PC71BM film than that of Cz-PSF-DBT:PC71BM film with a rough surface and a large phase separation, which greatly influence the exciton separation at the donor/acceptor interface.

Soil enzymes are involved in almost all biochemical reactions, but insufficient investigations were conducted to define its hormetic responses. The objective of this study is to investigate the hormetic responses across soil particle–size fractions with cadmium (Cd) as a stressor and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as a potential endpoint. Soils were treated by adding CdCl2·2.5H2O solution with 0, 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0 mg·kg− 1 of Cd, respectively. A low–power ultrasonic method was used to separate the bulk soil into 0.1–2, 2–63, 63–200 and 200–2000 μm fractions. In 2–63 μm, ALP activity at doses of 0.3–3.0 mg·kg− 1 of Cd was significantly higher than that of CK (0.0 mg·kg− 1 of Cd), showing a typical U–shaped dose–response with the amplitude of 72.3–118.6%. Similarly, ALP activity at 0.003–0.3 mg·kg− 1 of Cd was 36.4–66.1% higher than that of CK in 63–200 μm. However, no similar phenomenon was observed in 0.1–2 and 200–2000 μm fractions. This suggested that low doses of Cd induced the hormetic responses of soil ALP, particularly in 2–63 and 63–200 μm. In addition, analysis of the microbial community structure and diversity indicates that, at genus level, the relative abundance (RA) of Gillisia at 0.03–0.3 mg·kg− 1 of Cd was significantly higher than that of CK with the amplitude of 3.7–37.5% in 2–63 μm. The similar responses were observed that the RA of Pontibacter at 0.003–0.03 mg·kg− 1 of Cd was 4.0–85.4% higher than that of CK in 63–200 μm.

The pin surface morphology and dimensions were precisely controlled by controlling the laser processing parameters specifically the laser beam power, the pulse repetition frequency, and the overlap between scan tracks. The pin was inserted into a hub hole diameter of 10.05 ± 0.003 mm and pull out joint bond strengths were examined. The results of this study showed that surface thus altered provided improved control of the bond strength which is a particular novelty of this new interference fit joining method. Surface roughness, Ra, from 40 to 160 μm, melt pool depths from 0.4 to 1.7 mm, increases in the pin outer diameter from 0.5 to 1.1 mm, and pull out forces of up to 7.51 kN were achieved. The bond joint was found to re-grip before final failure providing a more secure joint and increased safety. This joining method allows for the possibility of joining different materials. The pulse repetition frequency was measured to be the most significant processing parameter for control of the resulting mechanical properties and the bond strength with a clear inverse relationship. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 laser processing; Interference fit; Moiré pattern; Press fit; Stainless steel; Surface texturing","Bond strength (materials); Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide lasers; Joining; Laser applications; Laser beams; Presses (machine tools); Pulsed lasers; Surface roughness; Surface treatment; CO2-laser; Interference fit; Laser processing parameters; Laser surface texturing; Press fits; Pulse repetition frequencies; Surface laser treatment; Surface-texturing; Stainless steel",2-s2.0-85029359970

While conventional resistive based metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors suffer from strong cross-sensitivity, optical sensing approaches offer intrinsic advantages to achieve gas selectivity based on wavelength specific interactions. This manuscript describes a novel method to achieve multicomponent gas sensing during gas exposure of H2, CO2, CH4 and CO in humid high temperature environments. A single sensor element comprised of a perovskite La0.3Sr0.7TiO3 (LSTO) oxide thin film layer coated on silica optical fiber was used. The sensing responses consisted of two wavelength-specific near infrared (NIR) mechanisms, namely broadband absorption associated with the metal oxide layer, and wavelength localized thermal emission responses associated with the hydroxyl defects within the silica fiber. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to couple the two mechanisms to achieve selective gas identification. Successful discrimination of H2 and CO2 on a single fiber sensor was achieved, where the results are both stable and reversible. This design demonstrates that by coupling multiple optical mechanisms on a single oxide coated fiber sensor, simple platforms can also achieve multi-component sensing functionality without the added complexity of a sensor array. Thus, it suggests a new approach to construct simple, robust and functional sensor designs capable of gas discrimination and quantification in multi-component gas streams. © 2017","Optical gas sensing; Oxide; Pca; Selectivity; Silica fiber",,2-s2.0-85027568890

Many factories of semi-liquid/semi-solid foods or pastes use penetrometry devices for quality control, typically measuring the resistance force at a single penetration velocity. Furthermore, the physical texture characterization obtained by penetrometry analysis has been found to correlate well with sensory attributes. Boujlel and Coussot (2012) have shown that a simple penetrometer can also be used to obtain relevant rheological parameters, by combining data from different penetration velocities or from the relaxation of the signal after the probe has stopped inside the product. In the present paper their approach is extended to a grid-shaped probe, which is suitable for semi-liquid products like mayonnaise. We have tested its use for our purposes for various fluids, from Newtonian to thixotropic viscoplastic fluids. These fluids were also characterized by conventional rheometry for comparison. The probe of the penetrometer was a grid comprising of woven metal cylinders. The probe was simplified in a CFD simulation which provided a correlation from which the rheological parameters could be extracted. The viscosity of Newtonian fluids was determined satisfactorily from these correlations. Likewise the flow index of shear thinning liquids could be computed relatively well. The yield stress of this set of selected materials was better determined from the flow curves obtained by the penetrometer than by the relaxation method.

The first step of such investigations was the full optimization of the cubic structure of perfect MgO crystal, followed by the structural optimization of the doped of MgO:Mn2+ system, using periodic density functional theory (DFT). The ab initio MR wave functions approaches, such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF), N-electron valence second order perturbation theory (NEVPT2) and spectroscopy oriented configuration interaction (SORCI), are used for the calculations. The scalar relativistic effects have also been taken into account through the second order Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH2) procedure. Ab initio ligand field theory (AILFT) allows to extract all LF parameters and spin-orbit coupling constant from such calculations. In addition, the ECM of ligand field theory (LFT) has been used for modelling theoptical absorption spectra. The perturbation theory (PT) was employed for the g factor calculation in the semi empirical LFT. The results of each of the aforementioned types of calculations are discussed and the comparisons between the results obtained and the experimental results show a reasonable agreement, which justifies this new methodology based on the simultaneous use of both methods. This study establishes fundamental principles for the further modelling of larger embedded cluster models of doped metal oxides. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ab initio calculations; Exchange charge model; MgO; Mn2+","Absorption spectra; Crystal structure; Density functional theory; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Hydrogen bonds; Large scale systems; Ligands; Light absorption; Magnesia; Magnesium compounds; Manganese; Optical materials; Perturbation techniques; Structural optimization; Wave functions; Ab initio calculations; Complete active space self consistent fields; Configuration interactions; Exchange charge models; Periodic density functional theory; Scalar-relativistic effects; Second order perturbation theory; Spin-orbit coupling constants; Calculations",2-s2.0-85032721400

One of the limitations is that the analytes are often present at small amounts, ranging from tens to hundreds of ng, thus making challenging low-uncertainty isotope ratio determinations. Here we present a new procedure for U, Cu and Zn purification and isotope ratio determinations in cultured human neuron-like cells exposed to natural U. A thorough study of the influence of the limiting factors impacting the uncertainty of δ238U, δ66Zn and δ65Cu is also carried out. These factors include the signal intensity, which determines the within-day measurement reproducibility, the procedural blank correction and the matrix effects, which determine the accuracy of the mass bias correction models. Given the small Cu and U amounts in the cell samples, 15–30 and 20 ng respectively, a highly efficient sample introduction system was employed in order to improve the analyte transport to the plasma and, hence, the signal intensity. With this device, the procedural blanks became the main uncertainty source of δ238U and δ65Cu values, accounting over 65% of the overall uncertainty. The matrix effects gave rise to inaccuracies in the mass bias correction models for samples finally dissolved in the minimal volumes required for the analysis, 100–150 µL, leading to biases for U and Cu. We will show how these biases can be cancelled out by dissolving the samples in volumes of at least 300 µL for Cu and 450 µL for U. Using our procedure, expanded uncertainties (k = 2) of around 0.35‰ for δ238U and 0.15‰ for δ66Zn and δ65Cu could be obtained. The analytical approach presented in this work is also applicable to other biological microsamples and can be extended to other elements and applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biological samples uranium; Cooper zinc; Isotopic analysis; Method development","Cells; Cytology; Dissolution; Metabolism; Zinc; Analytical approach; Biological samples; Isotopic analysis; Isotopic fractionations; Mass bias correction; Measurement reproducibility; Method development; Sample introduction; Isotopes",2-s2.0-85032385538

Many scholars and environmental activists have long hoped that global restrictions in mercury trade would drive up mercury prices and decrease mercury use and pollution in ASGM. However, in Indonesia, despite global mercury trade restrictions, recent increases in domestic mercury supplies through new cinnabar mining developments have made mercury less expensive and more available, destabilizing efforts at reducing mercury use. This article discusses implications of domestic cinnabar mining for controlling mercury in Indonesia's ASGM sector, highlighting obstacles to implementing the Minamata Convention, a treaty that aims to restrict mercury use. We link discussion of mercury mining to other socioeconomic processes, labour relations and power dynamics shaping mercury use in gold mining and hindering collectivised mercury-free technology uptake. Examining new evidence regarding the social metabolism of a changing extractive economy, we underscore why an integrated ecological economics paradigm – carefully grounding analysis in the context of local labour situations – is needed to challenge assumptions and inform new strategies for mercury reduction/elimination in ASGM. © 2017 The Authors","Artisanal gold mining; Cleaner technology; Ecological economics; Environmental governance; Marginalisation; Mercury pollution; Minamata Convention on Mercury; Small-scale gold mining","artisanal mining; ecological economics; environmental economics; environmental legislation; environmental management; environmental technology; gold mine; industrial regulation; international agreement; marginalization; mercury (element); mining; pollution control; pollution incidence; resource use; social characteristics; socioeconomic conditions; trade-environment relations; Indonesia",2-s2.0-85025465260

The dynamic optical properties of ferrofluids in the presence of magnetic fields are of particular interest due to their potential application as various optical devices. Although time-dependent light scattering by ferrofluids have been extensively studied, the effect of wavelength of incident light have been rarely considered. Here, for the first time, we investigated both the time- and wavelength-dependent light scattering in water based ferrofluids containing Fe3O4 nanoparticles under an external magnetic field. The field-induced response behavior of the prepared ferrofluid samples was determined and verified first by thermal conductivity measurement and numerical simulation. Double-beam UV–Vis spectrophotometer was employed to record the temporal evolution of transmitted intensity of incident light of various wavelengths passing through the ferrofluid sample and propagating parallel to the applied field. As expected, the light intensity decreases to a certain value right after the field is turned on due to the thermal fluctuation induced disorder inside the flexible particle chains. Then the light intensity further decreases with time until the appearance of a minimum at time τ0 followed by an inversed increase before finally reaches equilibrium at a particular time. More importantly, the characteristic inversion time τ0 was found to follow a power law increase with the wavelength of incident light (τ0 ∼ λα, where α = 2.07). A quantitative explanation for the wavelength dependence of characteristic time was proposed based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The simulation results are in good agreement with our experimental observations. The time-dependent light scattering in ferrofluids under different incident wavelengths was rationalized by considering both the coarsening process of the particle chains and the occurrence of resonance within the magnetic scatterers.

The degradation efficiency and kapp always rising at higher j and lower Co and CN while EC, EEO, and operating cost increased at higher j, Co and CN.

The residual substructures of post-shock Ti64 are dominated by planar slip. A few deformation twins is also formed in alloy shocked at 14.05 GPa. The lack of dislocation cells or cell-like structures, additional strengthening phases such as ω phase and high-density twins limits the further strengthening of this alloy through shock loading.

The formation of a larger bonded region was observed at larger edge angles, resulting in greater joint strength. In the latter stage of bonding time beyond 50 ms, the relative motion between the tool edge and the bonding material became predominant because of bond formation at the bonding interface.

Sound pressure level spectra were measured at three rotational speeds each with several mass flow rates. The experimental results reveal that the overall sound pressure level increases with the rotational speed but varies slightly with the flow rate. The largest overall sound pressure level occurs at the measuring point near the motor, implying that the motor is one of the most important noise sources of the test rig. The frequencies of the tonal components are respectively consistent with the shaft frequency, the blade passing frequency of the compressor impeller and the interaction frequency of the magnetic flux wave with rotor slots in the variable-frequency motor. For sampling points near the connected pipes, the broadband noises mainly arise from the internal random pressure fluctuation through a curve fitting analysis of the squared sound pressure versus the dimensionless frequency. A coherence analysis between the acoustical and vibrational signals implies that the structural vibration induced by the internal pressure loads is the primary contributor for the compressor noise. Particularly, the outlet pipe with the highest vibration level should be a major concern for noise reduction of the centrifugal compressor. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic measurement; Broadband noise; Centrifugal compressor; Coherence analysis; Tonal noise","Acoustic noise; Acoustic variables measurement; Acoustic wave transmission; Acoustics; Centrifugation; Curve fitting; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Acoustic measurements; Broadband noise; Coherence analysis; Dimensionless frequency; Interaction frequencies; Overall sound pressure level; Tonal noise; Variable frequency motors; Centrifugal compressors",2-s2.0-85032480934

Based on four indigenous electrotrophs (Ochrobactrum sp X1, Pseudomonas sp X3, Pseudomonas delhiensis X5 and Ochrobactrum anthropi X7) isolated from well developed Cd(II)-removal biocathodes of MECs, a quinoline-based Cd(II) fluorescent probe was used to imaginably and quantitatively map Cd(II) ions in electrotrophs, and its response to current and 2,4-DNP in MECs.

The experiment was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor with the combustion temperature in the range of 500–1000 °C. The results shown that the redistribution behavior of these toxic elements was greatly proportional to the combustion temperature, ash components and amounts. The adding of Fe, Ca, Mg, Na and K favour the retention of Sb and Se, while the presence of Si was represented against Sb and Se capture. Si, Al, Fe, Na and K have an appreciable effect on the retention of Pb, while the Pb capture by Ca and Mg was limited. The partial retention of these elements in ashes may be attributed to both physisorption and chemisorption. Among them, the formation of non-volatilized compounds may be the primary contribution for the retention of Sb, Se and Pb (except for Al). The negative Sb and Se captured by Si may be ascribed to the interactions between Si and other components which promote the retention of Sb and Se. The highly Pb retention by Si and Al in ashes may be explained by the formation of PbO·SiO2, PbO·Al2O3 and PbO·Al2O3·2SiO2.

Moreover, tool wear will influence the workpiece geometrical accuracy and surface quality. Aiming at improving the tool life in multi-axis milling of freeform workpieces made of Ni-based superalloy with a ball-end cutter, this paper introduces a new multi-axis milling strategy for freeform surfaces based on the idea of shifting the active cutting edge on the cutter. The proposed machining strategy tries to use different cutting edges on the cutter to cut the material for different portions of the workpiece surface as each edge element can only be used in the cutting for a short time. The relationships between the tool orientation, active cutting edge and cutter-workpiece engagement are established, and the tool wear rate is approximated in predicting the tool life for each edge element in the milling process. Both the cutter edge and cutter contact curve are divided into several segments according to the maximum cutting length of each cutter edge segment. Tool orientation is then planned based on the shifted active cutting edge. Cutting experiments are performed and their results show that a large improvement of tool life can be achieved by the proposed machining strategy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ball-end cutter; Hard-to-cut material; Multi-axis milling; Tool wear","Ball milling; Cutting; Milling (machining); Nickel; Superalloys; Wear of materials; Ball-end cutter; Cutting experiment; Geometrical accuracy; Hard to cut material; Machining strategy; Multi-axis milling; Ni-based superalloys; Tool wear; Cutting tools",2-s2.0-85029447750

To overcome these shortcomings, a Cr-substituted LiCoPO4 core with a conductive carbon layer cathode material is synthesized using the sol-gel method. The physical chemistry properties of these materials are systematically investigated by using various characterization methods. For instance, the XRD and Rietveld refinement results reveal that Cr successfully substitutes the Co within the LiCoPO4 core to form LiCo1-1.5xCrxPO4/C (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) without changing the olivine structure but exhibits a decrease in the unit cell volume with increasing Cr substitution.

The EDS and XPS results confirm that Cr is uniformly distributed on the surface and that the oxidation state of Cr is +3. FTIR spectra indicate that the antisite defect concentration decreases with increasing Cr substitution. Furthermore, Cr substitution significantly improves the electrochemical performances of LiCo1-1.5xCrxPO4/C (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) cathode. Notably, the LiCo0.94Cr0.04PO4/C delivers an initial discharge capacity of 144 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and shows a capacity retention of 71% after 100 cycles between 3.0 and 5.0 V. The CV and EIS results indicate that the polarization is reduced and that the electronic and ionic conductivities are improved by Cr substitution. The good electrochemical performances for Cr-substituted LiCoPO4/C electrodes are attributed to the lower antisite defect concentration, as the reduction of polarization, the improvement of electronic and ion conductivity and the uniform carbon layer. These features will accelerate the commercial application of LiCoPO4 towards the start-art of the high voltage lithium-ion batteries. © 2017","Cathode; Cr substitution; High voltage; LiCoPO4; Lithium-ion battery","Cathodes; Characterization; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Ionic conductivity; Ions; Lithium; Physical chemistry; Point defects; Polarization; Rietveld refinement; Silicate minerals; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Agglomerated nanoparticles; Cr substitutions; Electrochemical performance; Electronic and ionic conductivity; High voltage; Initial discharge capacities; LiCoPO4; Physical chemistry properties; Lithium-ion batteries",2-s2.0-85031290664

The inverse Hall-Petch relation between grain size and flow stress was found. The strain rate sensitivity shows increase with the decrease of grain size due to the enhancement of grain boundary (GB) mediated process.

The main aim of this study was to understand if the chemical composition of tree-ring wood can be used for monitoring spatial-temporal variability of pollutants in Terni, Central Italy, one of the most polluted towns in Italy. Tree cores were taken from 32 downy oaks (Quercus pubescens) located at different distances from several pollutant sources, including a large steel factory. Trace element (Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Hg, Mo, Ni, Tl, W, U, V, and Zn) index in tree-ring wood was determined using high-resolution laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). We hypothesized that the presence of contaminants detected in tree-rings reflected industrial activities over time. The accumulation of contaminants in tree-rings was affected by anthropogenic activities in the period 1958–2009, though signals varied in intensity with the distance of trees from the industrial plant. A stronger limitation of tree growth was observed in the proximity of the industrial plant in comparison with other pollutant sources. Levels of Cr, Ni, Mo, V, U and W increased in tree-ring profiles of trees close to the steel factory, especially during the 80's and 90's, in correspondence to a peak of pollution in this period, as recorded by air quality monitoring stations. Uranium contents in our tree-rings were difficult to explain, while the higher contents of Cu, Hg, Pb, and Tl could be related to the contaminants released from an incinerator located close to the industrial plant. The accumulation of contaminants in tree-rings reflected the historical variation of environmental pollution in the considered urban context. Pollution legacy in cities can be reconstructed through the analysis of urban trees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Laser ablation; Steel factory; Trace elements; Tree-rings; Urban trees",,2-s2.0-85032303537

By the FSP assisted laser cladding, the crack in laser cladding Ni-Cr-Fe coating was eliminated and the coarse networks of laser cladding coating was transformed into dispersed nanoparticles.

The relationships between the phosphate insulation coating microstructure and temperature resistance, corrosion resistance and magnetic properties of iron-based soft magnetic composites (SMCs) were studied by using SEM, TEM/EDS and FTIR.

The iron phosphate phase was identified as amorphous and its thickness increased from 30 nm to 60 nm as the phosphoric acid concentration was increased from 1 wt% to 2 wt%. When the phosphoric acid concentration was further increased to 5 wt%, the excess iron phosphate precipitates between the soft magnetic composite particles.

The initial permeability of the iron-based SMCs decreased with increasing phosphoric acid concentration due to thicker insulation layer formation.

Here we report that the luminescent properties of naphthalene diimides can be finely modulated by supramolecular cocrystal formation. Through the donor-acceptor interactions between the electron-deficient N,N′-di-(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide (DPNDI) molecules and electron-rich naphthalene derivatives (guest), a series of cocrystal complexes are successfully fabricated. These cocrystal complexes show guest-dependent color-tunable emissions, which originate from the excited state charge transfer interactions between the DPNDI and naphthalene derivatives in the solid state.

However, the understanding of the mechanisms by which PM exerts its adverse effects is still incomplete and comes mainly from studies in occupationally exposed populations. The aims of this study were to: (1) evaluate DNA damage in lymphocytes assessing the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay (CBMN-cyt) parameters; (2) identify aneugenic or clastogenic effects in lymphocytes of exposed populations using CREST immunostaining for micronuclei; (3) evaluate multi-elemental composition of atmospheric particulate matter; and (4) verify relation between the DNA damage and PM2.5 and PM10 levels around the mining area. Analysis revealed a significant increase in micronuclei frequency in binucleated (MNBN) and mononucleated (MNMONO) cells of individuals with residential proximity to open-pit coal mines compared to residents from non-mining areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated a highly significant association between PM2.5 levels, MNBN frequencies and CREST+ micronuclei induction in exposed residents. These results suggest that PM2.5 fraction generated in coal mining activities may induce whole chromosome loss (aneuploidy) preferentially, although there are also chromosome breaks. Analysis of the chemical composition of PM2.5 by PIXE demonstrated that Si, S, K and Cr concentrations varied significantly between coal mining and reference areas. Enrichment factor values (EF) showed that S, Cr and Cu were highly enriched in the coal mining areas. Compared to reference area, mining regions had also higher concentrations of extractable organic matter (EOM) related to nonpolar and polar compounds. Our results demonstrate that PM2.5 fraction represents the most important health risk for residents living near open-pit mines, underscoring the need for incorporation of ambient air standards based on PM2.5 measures in coal mining areas. © 2017","CREST; MNBN; MNMONO; Open-pit coal mining; PM10; PM2.5","chromium; organic matter; potassium; silicon; sulfur; coal mine; cytogenetics; enrichment; health risk; open pit mine; particulate matter; risk assessment; adult; air quality standard; ambient air; aneuploidy; Article; assay; chemical composition; chromosome breakage; coal mining; Colombia; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlational study; cytogenetics; cytokinesis block micronucleus cytome assay; DNA damage; female; health hazard; human; immunohistochemistry; lymphocyte; male; micronucleus; mononuclear cell; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; residential area; Colombia",2-s2.0-85032683282

The mass ratio of pulverized-coal in fuel-rich flow to that in fuel-lean flow (MRL) is a key parameter in fuel rich/lean combustion that affects the gas/particle flow characteristics and in turn the coal ignition and NOx formation. In this work, using a 1:40 scale model furnace and a particle dynamics anemometer measurement system, the effects of various MRLs (6:4, 7:3, 8:2 and 9:1) on the gas/particle flow characteristics in a 600 MWe down-fired boiler incorporating multiple-injection and multiple-staging were studied. The results demonstrate that airflows injected from the front-arch burners flow downwards along the front wall and then turn upward in the furnace center zone, forming a U-shaped flow pattern. Increasing the MRL significantly raises the maximum particle volume flux under the fuel-rich flow nozzle, which favors advanced pulverized-coal ignition and improves the fuel rich/lean combustion in the boiler. The velocity decay of the downward gas/particle flow is also accelerated. The particle volume flux in the hopper zone is gradually reduced while the location of the maximum particle volume flux gradually moves away from the hopper declined wall. This scenario avoids the downward flame flushing the furnace hopper and prevents both hopper wall overheating and tube bursts in the actual down-fired boiler. Based on these results, an MRL of 9:1 is recommended as optimal. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Down-fired boiler; Gas/particle flow; Multi-injection; Multi-staging; Pulverized-coal concentration",,2-s2.0-85032796067

In this study, aluminum (Al) nanoparticles with and without self-assembled monolayer surface functionalization were combined with kerosene to examine the changes in droplet regression behavior associated with manipulating particle surface chemistry. Aluminum nanoparticles were coated using a long-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid as the surface binding moiety to induce an oleophobic surface. The resulting particles are thus comprised of self-assembled monolayers of perfluorohexadecanoic acid (PFHD) (C15F31COOH) around the alumina (Al2O3) shell encapsulating the Al core. The PFHD serves many functions including altering particle wettability and acting as a surfactant that facilitates a stabilized dispersion of particles in kerosene. The Al-PFHD particles are more oleophobic compared with the more oleophilic surface associated with the amorphous alumina shell on aluminum particles. Mixtures with Al-PFHD exhibit a two stage burning behavior with average initial burn rate constant increased by about 121% when compared to pure kerosene. Further analysis using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) showed that Al-PFHD particles in kerosene exhibit evaporation at reduced temperatures that may enhance energy transport during droplet combustion by phase change and convection.

However, a significant amount of sodium species are also embedded in the Zhundong coals (ZDC), which has been a barrier for efficient utilization of them. In this work, to better understand the detailed behaviors of sodium species and the transformation mechanisms during direct coal liquefaction (DCL), chemical transformation of sodium species in a ZDC under different liquefaction atmospheres was investigated. As gasification of the direct coal liquefaction residue (DCLR) is commonly used to produce syngas that compensates for the cost of DCL, CO2 gasification reactivity of sodium-rich DCLR was examined as well. The results show that both H2 and hydrogen-donor solvents are essential for direct liquefaction of ZDC. Under H2 atmosphere, retention ratios of sodium species in DCLR were all slightly lower than those under N2 atmosphere. In the meantime, more CO2 were produced under H2 atmosphere. As for transformation of sodium species during DCL, it is suggested to be closely related with the atmosphere, since more exchangeable sodium species were converted under H2 atmosphere. Additionally, sodium nitrate was found as one of the water-soluble sodium species in ZDC and sodium-containing silicates could be formed at high temperatures. More importantly, the water-soluble sodium species in DCLR are proved to have catalytic effects on CO2 gasification reactivity of DCLR. Through careful calculations, a quantitative linear equation has been established between the water-soluble sodium species content and the reactivity index, which can be used to finely predict gasification reactivity of DCLR derived from ZDC. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical transformation; CO2 gasification; Direct coal liquefaction; Sodium species; Zhundong coal",,2-s2.0-85032485842

However, low surface area and restacking of reduced graphene nanosheets still limit the performance of the supercapacitors based on GO-derived aerogels. In this work, graphene-coupled polyaniline (PANI) nanosheets (GO@PANI), which were synthesized through interfacial polymerization method, were used to co-assemble with GO towards hierarchical-graphene-coupled PANI aerogels by hydrothermal strategy. The resultant new hybrid aerogels exhibited a typical three-dimensional (3D) porous structure with rich graphene/PANI heterostructure and high specific surface area of up to 337 m2/g. As electrodes for symmetric and asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitors, the aerogels delivered areal capacitances of up to 453 and 679 mF/cm2, respectively, which are superior to those of most GO- and/or PANI-derived aerogel-based supercapacitors. This excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic contribution of the local conductivity of graphene layers sandwiched between PANI layers and long-distance conductivity of 3D graphene frameworks.

To address this challenge, the authors have proposed a novel integrated data analytics model by combining two powerful evolutionary techniques, Gene Expression Programming and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system. The proposed integrated approach was able to capture the dynamics of mass finishing process more accurately compared to that of other commonly available data analytical models. Tribological analysis of the model showed that an optimal surface finish of mass finished part can be achieved in mass finishing process by regulating the process time and media type.

The novel element is the non-linear programming optimisation model that directly co-adjusts the multi-robot coordination during the trajectory optimisation, which allows optimising these as one problem.

An experimental validation is done for a real-world case study that considers the multi-robot material handling system of a multi-stage tandem press line.

Plants have the ability to reduce non-point source PM pollution through retention on leaves and branches. Studies of the dynamic processes of PM retention by plants and the mechanisms influencing this process will help to improve the efficiency of urban greening for PM reduction. We examined dynamic processes of PM retention and the major factors influencing PM retention by six trees with different branch structure characteristics in wind tunnel experiments at three different wind speeds. The results showed that the changes of PM numbers retained by plant leaves over time were complex dynamic processes for which maximum values could exceed minimum values by over 10 times. The average value of PM measured in multiple periods and situations can be considered a reliable indicator of the ability of the plant to retain PM. The dynamic processes were similar for PM10 and PM2.5. They could be clustered into three groups simulated by continually-rising, inverse U-shaped, and U-shaped polynomial functions, respectively. The processes were the synthetic effect of characteristics such as species, wind speed, period of exposure and their interactions. Continually-rising functions always explained PM retention in species with extremely complex branch structure. Inverse U-shaped processes explained PM retention in species with relatively simple branch structure and gentle wind. The U-shaped processes mainly explained PM retention at high wind speeds and in species with a relatively simple crown. These results indicate that using plants with complex crowns in urban greening and decreasing wind speed in plant communities increases the chance of continually-rising or inverse U-shaped relationships, which have a positive effect in reducing PM pollution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Leaves; Particulate matter; PM retention processes; Wind tunnel","Air pollution; Forestry; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Wind; Wind tunnels; Branch structure; Environmental problems; Leaves; Particulate Matter; Plant communities; Polynomial functions; Retention process; Wind tunnel experiment; Plants (botany); atmospheric pollution; leaf; particulate matter; tree; wind forcing; wind tunnel; wind velocity; air pollution; Article; controlled study; dynamics; nonhuman; particulate matter; plant community; plant leaf; tree; tree crown; velocity; wind",2-s2.0-85032277291

We fabricated a super-hydrophilic surface by anodic oxidation of a zirconium vertical rod, so called completely wettable surface (CWS), which had surface microstructures with super-hydrophilicity. The CWS results in a decrease of the cooling time tcool as compared with the Bare Zirconium surface (BZS) results under small ΔTsub (tcool ∼ 50% decrease for ΔTsub = 0, 15, and 40 K, respectively). However, its surface effect is limited in the case of large ΔTsub (tcool ∼ within 5% for ΔTsub = 60 and 75 K). The fast quench on the CWS under ΔTsub, explained by the increase in minimum film-boiling temperature TMFB and rewetting velocity U, is due to the liquid-solid contact. We evaluate the contact area Ac and volumetric absorption rate of the liquid dV/dt by conducting liquid absorption experiments. The increase in Ac and dV/dt contribute to an increase in q″c, by forming the liquid film at the liquid-solid contact spot. The orders of the time scale between capillary-wicking and liquid-solid contact are comparable.

Fractal theory was used to quantitatively determine the effect of microalgae on the morphological texture of co-pyrolysis char. The result indicated that both the Nannochloropsis and Chlorella promoted the release of volatile from low-rank coal. Different synergistic effects on the thermal parameters and yield of volatile were observed, which could be attributed to the different compositions in the Nannochloropsis and Chlorella and operating condition.

However, the irreversible restacking during synthesis restricts its development and practical applications. Here, Ti3C2Tx/SCNT self-assembled composite electrodes were rationally designed and successfully synthesized by introducing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SCNTs) as interlayer spacers to decrease the restacking of the Ti3C2Tx sheets during the synthesis process. SCNTs can not only increase the specific surface area as well as the interlayer space of the Ti3C2Tx electrode, but also increase the accessible capability of electrolyte ions, and thus it improved the electrochemical performance of the electrode.

A designed ATP split aptamer (A1) was first functionalized with a weakly fluorescent coumarin derivative due to an azide group (azido-coumarin). The second DNA strand (A2) was covalently linked with triphenylphosphine, which could selectively and efficiently reduce azido to amino group through the Staudinger reaction. The A2 was then hybridized with a half of another designed longer DNA strand (T1). The second half of T1 was a split aptamer and selectively recognized ATP with A1 to form a sandwich structure. The specific interaction between ATP and the aptamers drew the two functionalized DNA strands (A1 and A2) together to initiate the interchain Staudinger reduction at fmol-nmol concentration level, hence produced fluorescent 7-aminocoumarin which could be used as an indicator for the presence of trace ATP. The reaction process had a concentration dependent manner with ATP in a large concentration range. Such a strategy of interchain Staudinger reaction can be extended to construct biosensors for other small functional molecules on the basis of judiciously designed aptamers. © 2017","Adenosine triphosphate; Fluorescence enhancement; Split aptamer; Staudinger reaction","Adenosinetriphosphate; Biomolecules; DNA; Molecules; Phosphates; Aptamers; Concentration levels; Concentration ranges; Concentration-dependent manners; Coumarin derivatives; Fluorescence enhancement; Functional molecules; Staudinger reactions; Fluorescence",2-s2.0-85029822128

The resistive based sensor consists of an aerosol jet deposited interdigitated nano-particle silver electrode structure overlaid with a thin film of Nafion® acting as a humidity sensitive layer. The fabricated sensor displayed a strong response to changes in relative humidity over the tested range (40% RH–80% RH) and showed a low level of hysteresis whilst undergoing cyclic testing.

The concentrations of CO and CO2 in the emissions from the combustion of filter cakes have been measured directly for the first time. They are the biggest volume of coal processing wastes. There have been many discussions about using these wastes as primary or secondary components of coal-water slurries (CWS) and coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals (CWSP). Boilers have already been operationally tested in Russia for the combustion of CWSP based on filter cakes. In this work, the concentrations of hazardous emissions have been measured at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000°С. The produced CO and CO2 concentrations are shown to be practically constant at high temperatures (over 900°С) for all the coal processing wastes under study. Experiments have shown the feasibility to lowering the combustion temperatures of coal processing wastes down to 750–850°С. This provides sustainable combustion and reduces the CO and CO2 emissions 1.2–1.7 times. These relatively low temperatures ensure satisfactory environmental and energy performance of combustion. Using CWS and CWSP instead of conventional solid fuels significantly reduces NOx and SOx emissions but leaves CO and CO2 emissions practically at the same level as coal powder combustion.

The microstructure-based model was applied to predict the low cyclic fatigue behavior of IN718 alloy at 400 °C which exhibits a bilinear Coffin-Manson relationship under the assumption that this behavior is triggered by a transition from highly localized plasticity at low cyclic strain ranges to more homogeneous deformation at high cyclic strain ranges.

Three humic-like fluorescent components were distinguished, including one carboxylic-like fluorophore C1 (λex/λem= (250, 310) nm/428 nm), and two phenolic-like fluorophores, C2 (λex/λem= (300, 460) nm/552 nm) and C3 (λex/λem= (270, 375) nm/520 nm). The Lagergren pseudo-second-order model can be used to describe the adsorption kinetics of the HA fluorescent components. In addition, both the Freundlich and Langmuir models can be suitably employed to describe the adsorption of the HA fluorescent components onto MWCNTs with significantly high correlation coefficients (R2&gt; 0.94, P&lt; 0.05). The dissimilarity in the adsorption affinity (Kd) and nonlinear adsorption degree from the HA fluorescent components to MWCNTs was clearly observed. The adsorption mechanism suggested that the π-π electron donor−acceptor (EDA) interaction played an important role in the interaction between HA fluorescent components and the three MWCNTs. Furthermore, the values of the thermodynamic parameters, including the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°) and entropy change (ΔS°), showed that the adsorption of the HA fluorescent components on MWCNTs was spontaneous and exothermic. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Adsorption; EEM-PARAFAC; Humic acid; Multi-walled carbon nanotube","carboxylic acid; fluorescent dye; humic acid; multi walled nanotube; phenol derivative; adsorption; carbon nanotube; factor analysis; fluorescence; humic acid; reaction kinetics; thermodynamics; adsorption kinetics; analysis; Article; correlation coefficient; energy; enthalpy; entropy; fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy; fluorescence spectroscopy; isotherm; molecular interaction; nonlinear system; parallel factor analysis; thermodynamics",2-s2.0-85031811261

In freshwater ecosystems in urbanised areas where family diversity is often low, new insights into ecosystem condition and impacting factors are likely through species-level assessments. Here we compare morphological identification to HTS based identification of macroinvertebrate families by considering 12 sites in an urban river system. Some taxa detected morphologically were not detected by HTS and vice versa. However, this had only a small impact on computed family-level metrics of ecological condition. We detected multiple species using HTS in the Chironomidae, Coenagrionidae, Hydrobiidae, Leptoceridae, Ceratopogonidae, Corixidae, Veliidae, Oligochaeta and Acarina. The highest species diversity was found in the Chironomidae, and for many of these species we had prior knowledge of their likely pollution sensitivity. In the Chironomidae, we showed that species level data was congruent with expectations based on measured levels of pollutants at sites and other family level metrics. Importantly, we also identified many species in the same family that differed in their distribution and likely pollution sensitivity in this urban river system. Therefore, HTS provided similar levels of information to traditional methods at the family level, but also generated new information for more accurate condition monitoring at the species level. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biological monitoring; Chironomidae; DNA barcoding; High-throughput DNA sequencing; Macroinvertebrates; Metabarcoding","Condition monitoring; Cost effectiveness; DNA; DNA sequences; Ecology; Ecosystems; Gene encoding; Pollution; Rivers; Throughput; Urban growth; Water; Biological monitoring; Chironomidae; DNA barcoding; DNA Sequencing; Macroinvertebrates; Metabarcoding; River pollution; Acari; Ceratopogonidae; Chironomidae; Coenagrionidae; Corixidae; Hydrobiidae; Leptoceridae; Veliidae",2-s2.0-85032682083

BS 8001:2017 tries to reconcile the far-reaching ambitions of the CE with established business routines. The standard contains a comprehensive list of CE terms and definitions, a set of general CE principles, a flexible management framework for implementing CE strategies in organizations, and a detailed description of economic, environmental, design, marketing, and legal issues related to the CE. The guidance on monitoring CE strategy implementation, however, remains vague. The standard stipulates that organizations are solely responsible for choosing appropriate CE indicators. Its authors do not elaborate on the links between CE strategy monitoring and the relevant and already standardized quantitative tools life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow cost accounting (MFCA). Here a general system definition for deriving CE indicators is proposed. Based on the system definition and the indicator literature a dashboard of new and established quantitative indicators for CE strategy assessment in organizations is then compiled. The dashboard indicators are mostly based on material flow analysis (MFA), MFCA, and LCA. Steel cycle data are used to illustrate potential core CE indicators, notably, the residence time of a material in the techno-sphere (currently 250–300 years for steel).

This work addresses the effects of hydrogen passivation on the electronic band gap of silicon carbide nanowires (SiCNWs) grown along the [1 1 0] direction by means of Density Functional Theory. We compare the electronic properties of fully hydrogen-passivated SiCNWs in comparison to those of SiCNWs with a mixed passivation of oxygen and hydrogen by changing some of the surface dihydrides with Si–O–Si or C–O–C bonds. The results show that regardless of the diameter and passivation, most of the nanowires have a direct band gap which suggests an increased optical activity. The surface C–O–C bonds reduce the electronic band gap energy compared to that of the fully H-terminated phase, while the nanowires with Si–O–Si bonds have a larger band gap. The calculation of formation energies shows that the oxygen increases the chemical stability of the SiCNWs.

Organized inference related to the interactions of microbes and potential processes has assisted in understanding approaches and concepts for inhibiting the growth of methanogens and profitable scale up design. Thus, here in we review the current developments and also the improvements constituted for the reduction of microbial H2 losses to methanogens. Firstly, the greatest challenge in achieving practical applications of MECs; undesirable microorganisms (methanogens) growth and various studied techniques for eliminating and reducing methanogens activities in MECs were discussed. Additionally, this extensive review also considers prospects for stimulating future research that could help to achieve more information and would provide the focus and path towards MECs as well as their possibilities for simultaneously generating H2 and waste remediation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electron transfer; Hydrogen production; MECs reactor design; Methanogens; Microbial electrolysis cell (MECs); Wastewater","Carbon; Cesium compounds; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Methanogens; Microbial fuel cells; Microorganisms; Regenerative fuel cells; Wastewater; Biotechnological tools; Current limitation; Electron transfer; Microbial electrolysis cell (MECs); Reactor designs; Value-added chemicals; Waste biomass; Waste remediation; Hydrogen production; hydrogen; biomass; electrolysis; electron transport; growth inhibition; methanogen; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; microbial electrolysis cell; microbial fuel cell; nonhuman; Review; waste water",2-s2.0-85031928208

Owing to the low thermal conductivity (TC) of polymers, inserting particles with ultra-high TC into the polymer matrix makes it possible for polymer composites to possess high ETC. The ETC of polymer composites is determined by several factors, including the particle and matrix properties and microscopic structures. Modelling methods are powerful tools to understand how these factors influence the ETC of polymer composites. Modelling methods can be combined with experimental data and can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the impact of various factors on the ETC. Moreover, modelling methods can be used as a guide for the choice and design of particle-filled composites for engineering applications. Herein, we review the recent research on ETC models of polymer composites. First, the classical theoretical models of ETC for polymer composites are introduced.

However, a significant portion of fertilizers are lost, increasing agricultural cost, wasting energy and polluting the environment, which are challenges for the sustainability of modern agriculture. To meet the demands of improving yields without compromising the environment, environmentally friendly fertilizers (EFFs) have been developed. EFFs are fertilizers that can reduce environmental pollution from nutrient loss by retarding, or even controlling, the release of nutrients into soil. Most of EFFs are employed in the form of coated fertilizers. The application of degradable natural materials as a coating when amending soils is the focus of EFF research. Here, we review recent studies on materials used in EFFs and their effects on the environment. The major findings covered in this review are as follows: 1) EFF coatings can prevent urea exposure in water and soil by serving as a physical barrier, thereby reducing the urea hydrolysis rate and decreasing nitrogen oxide (NOx) and dinitrogen (N2) emissions, 2) EFFs can increase the soil organic matter content, 3) hydrogel/superabsorbent coated EFFs can buffer soil acidity or alkalinity and lead to an optimal pH for plants, and 4) hydrogel/superabsorbent coated EFFs can improve water-retention and water-holding capacity of soil.

Plants can be therefore exposed to ENMs but controversial data in terms of fate and toxicity are currently available. Furthermore, there is a current lack of information on complex interactions/transformations to which ENMs undergo in the natural environment as for instance interacting with existing toxic compounds. The aim of the present study was to assess the behavior and biological effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (n-TiO2) (Aeroxide P25, Degussa Evonik) and its interaction with cadmium (CdCl2) in plants using radish seeds (Raphanus sativus L. Parvus) as model species. Radish seeds were exposed to n-TiO2 (1–1000 mg/L) and CdCl2 (1–250 mg/L) alone and in combination using a seed germination and seedling growth toxicity test OECD 208. Percentage of seed germination, germination index (GI) and root elongation were calculated. Cell morphology and oxidative stress parameters as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities (CAT) were measured in radish seeds after 5 days of exposure. Z-Average, PdI and Z-potential of n-TiO2 in Milli-Q water as exposure medium were also determined. DLS analysis showed small aggregates of n-TiO2, negative Z-potential and stable PdI in seed's exposure media. Germination percentage, GI and root length resulted affected by n-TiO2 exposure compared to controls. In particular, n-TiO2 at 1 mg/L and 100 mg/L did not affect radish seeds germination (100%) while at concentration of 10 mg/L, 200 mg/L, 500 mg/L, and 1000 mg/L a slight but not significant decrease of germination % was observed. Similarly root length and GI resulted significantly higher in seeds exposed to 10 mg/L and 200 mg/L compared to 1 mg/L, 100 mg/L, 500 mg/L, 1000 mg/L and control (p &lt; 0.05). On the opposite, CdCl2 significantly abolished germination % and GI compared to control seeds and a concentration dependent decrease on root elongation was observed against controls (p &lt; 0.05). As well, significant decrease of germination %, GI and root elongation was observed in seeds co-exposed to n-TiO2 and CdCl2 at the highest concentrations (1000 mg/L n-TiO2 and 250 mg/L CdCl2) compared to co-exposed seeds at low concentration (1 mg/L n-TiO2 and 1 mg/L CdCl2) and controls (p &lt; 0.05). Root elongation significantly increase compared to control at the lowest co-exposure concentration (p &lt; 0.05). Similarly at intermediate concentrations of 10 and 100 mg/L in co-exposure conditions, n-TiO2 did not affect CdCl2 toxicity. Concerning antioxidant enzymes, a significant increase of CAT activity in seeds exposed to single high n-TiO2 concentration (1000 mg/L) was observed while n-TiO2 (1 mg/L), CdCl2 (1 and 250 mg/L) and co-exposure resulted significantly decreased compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Regarding GST activity, a slight increase in seeds exposed to 1000 mg/L n-TiO2 but no significantly was observed, however both n-TiO2 and CdCl2 alone (1 and 250 mg/L, respectively) or in combinations caused a significant decrease in GST activity (p &lt; 0.05). Therefore, overall data support the hypothesis that the presence of n-TiO2 do not affect the toxicity of CdCl2 at least at the highest concentration (100 and 250 mg/L) in radish seeds. Morphological alterations in nuclei, vacuoles and shape of radish root cells were observed upon single Cd exposure and not abolished in the presence of n-TiO2. Nevertheless, although n-TiO2 seems not to reduce Cd toxicity at high concentration (up to 250 mg/L), interactions cannot be excluded based on obtained results. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cadmium; Ecotoxicity; Seed germination; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles","cadmium; catalase; glutathione transferase; titanium dioxide nanoparticle; cadmium; enzyme activity; germination; morphology; nanoparticle; oxidative stress; root vegetable; seed; titanium; toxicity; Article; concentration response; controlled study; germination; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phytotoxicity; plant growth; plant seed; radish; root length; Raphanus sativus",2-s2.0-85032491934

In this study, the influences of hydrogen flow during graphene growth and the cooling rate on the defect density and barrier properties of a graphene coating have been investigated. A thorough microscopic and spectroscopic investigation revealed that (i) slow cooling hindered the formation of graphene coating irrespective of the presence or absence of hydrogen flow, and (ii) under rapid cooling condition, absence of hydrogen flow restricted wrinkle formation on the resultant coating. Diminished wrinkle formation in absence of hydrogen flow significantly improved the durability of the resultant coating.

Currently, they are not fully utilised due to low biofuel yields from biological processes while thermo-chemical conversion technologies and transesterification processes suffer from certain drawbacks of conventional heating. Consequently, several technologies have been studied to improve biofuel production from lignocellulosic and waste materials, with microwave (MW) irradiation gaining increased interests over the years. This study reviewed the use of MW irradiation for assisting biofuel production from biological and thermo-chemical conversion processes as well as biodiesel production from the transesterification process. The principles underlying MW irradiation were initially described followed by the several benefits of MW over conventional heating and the different effects of MW irradiation on pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass and waste materials such as defragmentation of lignocellulosics, organic matter solubilisation and enhanced hydrolysis. Although MW irradiation generally enhanced biofuel production from biological processes, the extra biofuel (bio-ethanol, bio-methane or bio-hydrogen) produced could not compensate for the energy input due to MW irradiation, resulting in negative efficiencies for the pre-treatment technique. Regarding MW-assisted thermo-chemical conversion of biomass and waste materials to biofuels, it can be deduced that MW-heating is much more beneficial as opposed to conventional heating based on the products quality and yields obtained but the energy efficiency aspects of MW-heating are contradictory among studies. As for MW-assisted biodiesel production from the transesterification process, studies are almost unanimous as to the benefits of MW-heating over conventional heating such as reduced processing times or increased biodiesel yields. Finally, this article discussed some of the challenges of MW irradiation such as formation of inhibitors on biological processes, energy efficiency of the technology, technical aspects viz. poor dielectric properties of some substrates as well as difficulties for large-scale implementation of the technology before concluding on the future directions of MW-irradiation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biodiesel production; Fermentation; Lignocellulosic biomass; Microwave pre-treatment; Thermo-chemical conversion techniques",,2-s2.0-85030839050

Binary Ti alloys were prepared by arc-melting of titanium and one of the transition metals (Au, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Nb, V, and Zr). Ti alloys containing 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 wt% alloying elements were microarc-oxidized in an electrolyte containing Ca and P ions under a constant current using a DC power supply. During the microarc oxidation (MAO) treatment, the potential vs. time curves were strongly affected by the alloying element type and content. The pore size, thickness, and crystallinity of the oxide layer increased as the final potential was increased. Colored oxide layers were obtained for the Ti alloys containing 3d (Cr, Cu, Mn, and V) and 5d (Au) transition metals. Their colors were dependent on the alloying metal type and content. In the L*a*b coordinate for color measurement adopted by the Commission Internationale d'Eclairage (CIE), the oxide layer of Ti-5Cr/MAO exhibited the highest average b* value of 19.81 (p &lt; 0.05). The oxide layer of Ti-2.5Cu/MAO showed the next highest average b* value of 16.73. The oxidation state of 3d transition metals contributed to colorization of the microarc-oxidized Ti alloys. The characteristic colors of MAO-treated Ti alloys were rendered by the chemical binding state of alloying elements: yellow color for Cr3+, red color for Cu+, yellow color for Mn4+ and yellow color for V5+. The purple color of the MAO-treated Ti-Au alloy surface originated from Au nanoparticles.

With carbon content increasing from 0.008 wt% to 0.073 wt%, the volume fraction and average size of MC and M23C6 carbides increased significantly. The morphology of MC remained dispersed blocky shape while the morphology of M23C6 changed from continuous thin strip to granular. But no obvious variations were observed in the quantity, size and morphology of γ′ phase. During heat treatment, the hot-rolled grains grew up quickly and the grain growth rate of 0.008% C alloy was almost three times higher than that of 0.073% C alloy. The reason was that the MC carbides effectively inhibited the grain growth. After stress rupture test at 750 °C/300 MPa and 750 °C/400 MPa, the stress rupture life was in parabolic curve relationship with carbon content, 0.034 wt% and 0.045 wt% C alloys had higher stress rupture lives than other alloys. With the increase of carbon content, the ductility increased firstly and then reached relatively stable status, the fracture mode gradually varied from intergranular fracture to intergranular dimple mixed fracture. The change of stress rupture properties with carbon content was closely related to carbides and the grain size, which would be analyzed in this paper. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbides; Carbon; Grain size; Ni-Cr-W-Fe alloy; Stress rupture properties",,2-s2.0-85032291176

Then, the IUCM for three-layer materials is solved with jump and sinusoidal temperature boundaries, and the obtained temperatures and the outlet heat fluxes are compared to the solutions obtained by the finite volume method as well as other two existing lumped parameter models. The comparison shows that the IUCM reduces the relative mean outlet heat flux error by more than 50% compared to the other models in the studied cases. Applying the IUCM together with the genetic algorithm offers the optimal geometrical structures of three-layer materials, where the optimal structure reduced the outlet heat per unit area by more than 50% compared to the feasible structures.

In this study, the optimal corrosion parameters were determined to be 1.5 mol/L NaOH for 10 min, which resulted in the best capillary performance parameter (K/Reff) of 6.98 µm—an increase of approximately 207% compared to the one with no corrosion. This study demonstrates that the combination of P–E process and chemical corrosion method is a convenient and effective means to enhance the capillary performance of grooved aluminium wicks and the heat transport capability of AFHPs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminium flat-plate heat pipes; Capillary performance; Grooved wick","Acetone; Aluminum; Corrosion; Fabrication; Heat convection; Infrared imaging; Plates (structural components); Sodium compounds; Capillary performance; Chemical corrosion; Corrosion parameters; Flat plate; Grooved wick; Heat transport capability; Solution concentration; Wick structures; Heat pipes",2-s2.0-85032032771

Then, the ZnO surface before and after H doping was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The ZnO surface exhibited metal–OH bonding states and the oxygen vacancy increased with the UV irradiation time. In addition, the surface roughness of the ZnO thin film decreased from 1.634 to 1.385 nm because of the increasing hydrophilicity as the oxygen vacancy increased, reducing the trap sites and electron scattering at the channel/insulator interface, thus improving the TFT performance.

It was found that the introduction of electroplating sludge reduced the bulk density and compressive strength, and increased the mass loss, linear shrinkage, porosity ratio and water absorption. It was observed compressive strength declined from 23.5 to 15.5 MPa, and water absorption increased from 2.7 to 3.46% with the addition of electroplating sludge up to 10 wt%.

There is a pressing need to produce these materials more sustainably. This paper proposes a Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) approach to assess the implementation of green chemistry principles as applied to the protocols for nanoparticles synthesis. In the presence of multiple green and environmentally oriented criteria, decision aiding is performed with a synergy of ordinal regression methods; preference information in the form of desired assignment for a subset of reference protocols is accepted. The classification models, indirectly derived from such information, are composed of an additive value function and a vector of thresholds separating the pre-defined and ordered classes. The method delivers a single representative model that is used to assess the relative importance of the criteria, identify the possible gains with improvement of the protocol's evaluations and classify the non-reference protocols. Such precise recommendation is validated against the outcomes of robustness analysis exploiting the sets of all classification models compatible with all maximal subsets of consistent assignment examples.

Precipitation in fast contacting mixers of two precursors, boehmite and NH4-dawsonite, were investigated in order to obtain different and enhanced solid features. The mixing devices, a sliding surface mixing device (SSMD) and a rotor-stator mixer (RSM), were operated continuously. Micromixing was characterized by using a competitive parallel reaction system (iodide-iodate). It was possible to achieve micromixing time from 1 to 200 ms according to the type of mixer and the operating conditions. The micromixing times assessed experimentally are in correct agreement with the theoretical ones. For boehmite precursor, the micromixing time had not a decisive influence on the crystallite size. Better control of the particle surface area was obtained considering the shear rate level, maybe due to a disordered aggregation. Conversely, reduction of the crystallite size with a decrease of the micromixing time was observed with NH4-dawsonite. A possible explanation lies in a higher local supersaturation, leading to a more intense primary nucleation. Moreover, it was possible to adjust the pore volume of the NH4-dawsonite's aggregates with the operating conditions to quite a large extent (0.2 up to 0.8 cm3 g–1). © 2017","Boehmite; Fast-contacting mixer; Iodide-iodate reaction; Micromixing; NH4-dawsonite; Precipitation","Alumina; Corundum; Crystallite size; Mixers (machinery); Precipitation (chemical); Shear deformation; Boehmite; Dawsonite; Iodide iodates; Micro-mixing; Operating condition; Particle surface area; Primary nucleation; Textural properties; Mixing",2-s2.0-85031506484

Hence the present work focus on preparation and characterization of thermal transport phenomena of pure and Ba/Ca substituted perovskite LaFeO3 orthoferrite system. The conventional solid state reaction technique is utilized for the preparation of LaFeO3 and La0.9M0.1FeO3 (M = Ca and Ba) compounds. Crystal structure analyses of the prepared samples are analyses using Rietveld refinement process which confirms the orthoferrite crystal structure of all the prepared compounds with induced distortion in position of atoms by the incorporation of substituent atoms. The electronic structure calculations are performed by VASP. As the LaFeO3 compound is a strongly energy correlated system, the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are performed by DFT + U (Hubbard function) method. The computed band gap values are compared with the energy gap values calculated from UV–Vis spectral analysis. Electrical conductivity measurement and Arrhenius behavior for the temperature range of room temperature to 650 K are analyzed and the drift increase in conductivity with respect to temperature is due to the thermally activated mobility of charge carriers. Temperature dependent thermopower analysis is also examined using homemade seebeck coefficient measurement system. The calculation of thermoelectric power factor reveals that the Ba substituted LaFeO3 compound show highest power factor value of 3.73 μW/K2 cm at higher temperature and the superior power factor values observed in the Ba substituted compound determine the material's capability in power generating devices based on thermoelectric effect. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Band gap; DFT; Electrical transport; Power factor; Rietveld; Thermoelectrics","Arsenic compounds; Barium compounds; Calcium; Characterization; Crystal atomic structure; Density functional theory; Electric power factor; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Iron compounds; Lanthanum compounds; Rietveld method; Rietveld refinement; Solid state reactions; Spectrum analysis; Thermoelectric power; Thermoelectricity; Electrical conductivity measurements; Electrical transport; Electronic structure calculations; Power factors; Seebeck coefficient measurement; Solid-state reaction techniques; Thermoelectric power factors; Thermoelectrics; Crystal structure",2-s2.0-85032478907

The mean concentration of most metals, except As and Mn, exceeded their corresponding background values, with the mean concentration of Cd being 8 times that of its background. Spatially, for most heavy metals, except As and Mn, the high concentration areas were mainly within the 5th ring road, especially the northern area. The geo-accumulation index of Cd and Cu indicated moderate contamination at many sites. The entire study area was prone to potential ecological risks, with higher risks within the 4th ring road. Cd caused high potential ecological risk at most sites. According to the health risk assessment results, the non-carcinogenic risks that human beings suffered from heavy metals were insignificant. However, the carcinogenic risks due to Ni and Cr exceeded the acceptable level. Based on the source apportionment using positive matrix factorization, four factors were defined for the heavy metals. Factor 1, which was traffic-related exhaust, accounted for 34.47% of the concentration of heavy metals. The contributions of Factors 2 and 3 were approximately 25% each.

The mechanical toughness of the graphene coupled with the firm connection between nano-Sn and graphene sheet contributes the enhanced durability of the Sn@Gr anode.

However, the process of water splitting is greatly hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is kinetically sluggish and requires large overpotentials. Herein, we report an active and stable OER catalyst by electrodeposition of ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanosheets on three-dimensional interwoven nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs). The Ni(OH)2 nanosheets grown on the N-CNTs afforded a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of only 254 mV, smaller than the commercial IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, the as-prepared catalyst shows long-term durability almost without degradation over 100 h.

It is based on the recently proposed methodology of the congruent vapor-liquid (CVL) – diagram following from the developed earlier model of the fluctuational thermodynamics (FT). Both CXC-branches are predicted by the quite different (i.e. asymmetric and non-“symmetrized” artificially) FT-correlations. They are completely conformed in the asymptotic CP-region not only to the non-classical (with the exponent β≈1/3) projection of CXC on the (T,ρ)-plane but also to the well-known classical Clausius-Clapeyron approximation of the vapor-pressure curve in the (P,T)-plane. The respective interrelations between two phase-dependent factors of thermodynamic similarity introduced, originally, by Riedel (Ri) and Trouton (Tr) in the classical principle of corresponding states (PCS) are estimated without any fitting. We show that neither any analytic expansion (it fails near CP) nor the known non-analytic Wegner's expansion (it diverges far from CP) are necessary to predict with the reasonable accuracy the entire range of CXC including its CP. The only input data for this aim are the standard low-temperature measurements of one-phase liquid performed at atmospheric pressure.

Simultaneously, the adsorption performance of proposed complex toward H2S molecules were studied as well, for the purpose of comprehending the combined effect of catalytic behavior for Pt clusters and adsorbing ability for CNT. All the results are obtained in the basis of density functional theory. The calculated results indicated that the dopant of Pt3 cluster can effectively enhance the conductivity of carbon nano-support and electron affinity. In the meanwhile, Pt3-CNT that has good sorption upon H2S molecules is a promising sensing material to be exploited as gas sensors for detecting the presence of hydrothion.

The as-obtained composite, with a Fe3O4 core of 150 nm, has plenty of Ag NPs of 15 nm adhered onto the PTA layer outside the core. The PTA layer, like the famous polydopamine complex, possesses excellent adhesive capacity to load more Ag NPs tightly and has specific antibacterial activity due to the numerous catechol groups. Therefore, remarkable bactericidal activity was achieved and 31.25 mg L−1 of Fe3O4@PTA@Ag disinfectant could inactivate more than 99% of the tested strains within 60 min. At the same time, the catechol groups also endow the PTA layer with reduction ability so that additional reductant is unnecessary during the formation of Ag NPs and the PTA complex can be fabricated much more rapidly. As a result, the magnetic composite can be synthesized simply with less cost. Moreover, the composite has a high magnetic saturation value of 55.47 emu g−1 owing to the Fe3O4 core and the magnetic separation ability can play an important role in the recovery of the disinfectant. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Antibacterial activity; Facile synthesis; Magnetic nanosilver composite; Tannic acid-metal polymer",,2-s2.0-85028034170

The valence band offset (VBO) and corresponding conduction band offset (CBO) for the Al2O3/4H-SiC interface without any passivation were extracted to be 2.16 eV and 1.49 eV, respectively. With a LaSiOx IPL, a VBO of 1.79 eV and a CBO of 1.86 eV could be obtained across the Al2O3/4H-SiC interface.

Although both of these nutrients could be recovered from the sludge line, &gt; 70–75% of the N and P is discharged into the water line. Efforts to improve the nutrient recovery ratios have focused on developing low-cost technologies that use sorption processes. In this study, a natural zeolite (clinoptilolite type) in its potassium (K) form was impregnated with hydrated metal oxides and used to prepare natural hybrid reactive sorbents (HRS) for the simultaneous recovery of ammonium (NH4 +) and phosphate (PO4 3 −) from treated urban waste water. Three unfertile soils (e.g., one acidic and two basic) amended with N-P-K charged HRS were leached with deionized water (e.g. to simulate infiltration in the field) at two- and three-day time intervals over 15 different leaching cycles (equivalent to 15 bed volumes). The N-P-K leaching profiles for the three charged hybrid sorbents exhibited continuous nutrient release, with their values dependent on the composition of minerals in the soils. In the basic soil that is rich in illite and calcite, the release of potassium (K+) and ammonium (NH4 +) is favoured by-ion exchange with calcium (Ca2 +) and accordingly diminishes the release of phosphate (PO4 3 −) due to its limited solubility in saturated calcite solutions (pH 8 to 9). The opposite is true for sandy soils that are rich in albite (both acidic and basic), whereas the release of NH4 + and K+ was limited and the values of both ions measured in the leaching solutions were below 1 mg/L. Their leaching solutions were poor in Ca2 +, and the release of PO4 3 − was higher (up to 12 mg P-PO4 3 −/L). The nutrient releases necessary for plant growth were provided continuously and were controlled primarily by the soil mineral dissolution rates fixing the soil aqueous solution composition (e.g. pH and ionic composition; in particular, the presence of calcite is a determinant for nutrient release, especially in alkaline soils). The N-P-K charged HRS sorbents that were used for soil amendment may be an alternative for avoiding nutrient leaching and reaching the goals of soil sustainability in agriculture and reducing the nutrient overloading of surface waters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonium; Nutrients release; Phosphate; Potassium; Resource recovery; Soil amendment; Zeolite","Alkalinity; Calcite; Calcium; Deionized water; Ion exchange; Leaching; Metal recovery; Natural resources; Nitrogen removal; Phosphates; Potassium; Recovery; Soils; Solutions; Sorbents; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Zeolites; Ammonium; Aqueous solution composition; Composition of minerals; Dynamic experiment; Low cost technology; Nutrients release; Resource recovery; Soil amendment; Nutrients",2-s2.0-85028567934

The Co0.85Se NSs/G film demonstrates good flexibility, and the Co0.85Se NSs are uniformly anchored on the graphene to form “sheet-on-sheet” nanostructures with strong interfacial interactions. The hybrid lamellar film demonstrated excellent electrochemical performances when used as a binder-free anode for LIBs and SIBs. As an anode material for LIBs, the Co0.85Se NSs/G film exhibited a high initial reversible capacity of 680 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and an excellent cycling stability and rate performance. The specific capacity of the Co0.85Se NSs/G film shows almost no fading from 0.05 to 0.5 A g−1, and the capacities were maintained at 613.3 and 522.7 mA h g −1 at 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively.

Here, we demonstrate a facile synthetic strategy to engineer a one-dimensional (1D) hierarchically ordered mesoporous TiO2 nanofiber bundles (TBs) by using low-cost natural collagen fibers as the biotemplate. The as-prepared TBs are mainly constructed by hierarchical organization of ordered nanofibers (∼50–100 nm in diameter) each of which composed of well-crystallized TiO2 nanoparticles with a particle size of ∼10–20 nm, endowing a well-defined mesoporous structrue of the TBs along with a large specific surface area of 100.89 m2 g−1. This 1D hierarchical mesoporous structure is not only able to offer shortened ion diffusion paths, but also to ensure efficient electrolyte penetration for ion access and keep the structure integrity. As a result, the TBs-based anode materials show excellent electrochemical lithium and sodium storage prorperties. When evaluated in a lithium ion cell, TBs delivery a high discharge capacity of 120 mAh g−1 under 5C rate, and exhibits long-term cycling stability with an extremely low capacity decay of 0.03% over 500 cycles. Even for sodium ion cell tests, a remarkable capacity of nearly 130 mAh g−1 is also achieved at a current density of 200 mA g−1, suggesting the reversible sodium storage capability of the TBs.

CFRP composite panels were manufactured with different upper layers: (I) pure epoxy overflow layer, (II) pure copper powder filler layer, (III) mixture copper and stainless steel powder filler layer, and (IV) aluminium mesh layer. The top layers of the CFRP substrates were manufactured during the forming process. Arc Spray, one of the TS processes, was used to deposit zinc coating onto the manufactured CFRP panels. The substrates were sandblasted before the TS process to enhance the adhesion of the deposited zinc to the substrate. The quality of the coatings including adhesion and mechanical properties was investigated using tensile adhesion and bending test, respectively. The porosity, microstructure, morphology and surface fracture of the metallised CFRP coupons were characterized using optical and electronical microscopy techniques. The results obtained revealed that pure epoxy top layer did not resist to sandblasting prior to TS process, contrary to the substrates with fillers and mesh top layer.

Therefore, in this work we analyzed total mercury [THg] and methylmercury [MeHg] concentrations in top predator fish and in their main prey to test whether their feeding habits influence [Hg]. Results indicate that [THg] and [MeHg] varied by foraging habitat and they increased with greater percentage of benthic diet and decreased with pelagic diet in Lake Nahuel Huapi.

However, detailed theoretical research is still rare. This study presents a microscopic view to reveal the interaction mechanism between O2 and perovskite based on the first-principles calculation. The results show that O2 is adsorbed on the (100) surface of MAPbI3 perovskite mainly by Van der Waals force. O2 adsorption makes the MAPbI3 surface generate a small number of positive charges, which leads to the increase of the work function of the MAPbI3 surface. This is in agreement with the experimental measurement. And increased work function of MAPbI3 surface is not beneficial to electron transfer from perovskite to electronic extraction layer (such as TiO2). Comparison of the density of states (DOS) of the clean (100) surface and the adsorbed system shows that an in-gap state belonging to O2 appears, which can explain the phenomenon observed from experiments that electron transfers from the surface of perovskite to O2 to form superoxide. The theoretical power conversion efficiency of the system with and without O2 adsorption is evaluated, and it turns out that the power conversion efficiency of the system with O2 adsorption is slightly lower than that of the system without O2 adsorption.

No diatom MMI of wetland condition has been developed to assess AMD impacts related to mining activities. Previous approaches to diatom-based MMI development in wetlands have not accounted for natural variability. Natural variability among depressional wetlands may influence the accuracy of MMIs. Epiphytic diatom MMIs sensitive to AMD were developed for a range of depressional wetland types to account for natural variation in biological metrics. For this, we classified wetland types based on diatom typologies. A range of 4–15 final metrics were selected from a pool of ~ 140 candidate metrics to develop the MMIs based on their: (1) broad range, (2) high separation power and (3) low correlation among metrics. Final metrics were selected from three categories: similarity to reference sites, functional groups, and taxonomic composition, which represent different aspects of diatom assemblage structure and function. MMI performances were evaluated according to their precision in distinguishing reference sites, responsiveness to discriminate reference and disturbed sites, sensitivity to human disturbances and relevancy to AMD-related stressors. Each MMI showed excellent discriminatory power, whether or not it accounted for natural variation. However, accounting for variation by grouping sites based on diatom typologies improved overall performance of MMIs.

Simultaneous PM2.5 and PM10 samples were collected between July 2013 and July 2014 and chemically analysed to determine concentrations of several species: OC (organic carbon) and EC (elemental carbon) via thermo-optical analysis, 9 major ions via IC, and 23 metals via ICP-MS. Data was processed through mass closure analysis and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model characterizing seasonal variabilities of nine sources contributions. Organic and inorganic secondary aerosol accounts for 43% of PM2.5 and 12% of PM2.5–10 with small seasonal changes. SIA (secondary inorganic aerosol) seasonal pattern is opposite to that of SOC (secondary organic carbon). SOC is larger during the cold period, sulphate (the major contributor to SIA) is larger during summer. Two forms of nitrate were identified: NaNO3, correlated with chloride depletion and aging of sea-spray, mainly present in PM2.5–10; NH4NO3 more abundant in PM2.5. Biomass burning is a relevant source with larger contribution during autumn and winter because of the influence of domestic heating, however, is not negligible in spring and summer, because of the contributions of fires and agricultural practices. Mass closure analysis and PMF results identify two soil sources: crustal associated to long range transport and carbonates associated to local resuspended dust.

With PRS, aluminium based nanosheet like materials (AlNs) were synthesised for the ultrasonic removal of Congo Red (CR) and Crystal Violet (CV) dyes. PRS was characterised by UV, EEM and NMR spectral analysis. AlNs were characterised by FTIR, XRD, TGA, BET, SEM, AFM, TEM and XPS analysis. The point of zero charge of AlNs was found to be 5.4. The BET analysis ensured that the average pore diameter and total pore volume of AlNs as 8.464 nm and 0.11417 cc/g respectively. The efficacy of AlNs for the removal of toxic dyes was tested by performing Response surface methodology (RSM) designed experiments. The effect of sonication time, dosage and initial concentration on dye removal was studied at an optimised pH value. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models were examined. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 121.951 and 105.263 mg/g for CR and CV respectively. The kinetic models like pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich and intra-particle diffusion were examined to understand the mechanism behind it. The results revealed that the use of ultrasonication enhanced the mass transfer. The experimental studies on the influence of ultrasound power indicated a positive relation with the removal efficiency. The results of thermodynamic study revealed that the process was spontaneous and exothermic for both the dyes. The increase in ionic strength increased the removal efficiency for both CR and CV. RSM predicted the optimum adsorbent dosages as 0.16 g for 50 mg/L of CR and 0.12 g for 100 mg/L of CV dye solutions.

Through the application of SEM-EDS+MPST technology and data-fittings, functions are established to quantitatively reveal the weighted relationships of total amount of carbon in matrix (PC-matrx) and hardness value (HV0.1) with volume fractions and equivalent diameters of M23C6 carbides and Laves phase (VM23C6, VLaves dM23C6 and dLaves) for the P91 components after service exposures at 530–550 °C and 3.53–17.4 MPa for 57,000–63,000 h, respectively.

This is mostly due to the formation of hundreds, or even thousands, of both intermediate and final products. The considered AO/RPs, involving free radical reactions, include photolytic and photocatalytic processes, Fenton reactions, sonolysis, ozonation, application of ionizing radiation and several wet oxidation processes. The main attention is paid to the most commonly occurring PFCs in the environment, namely PFOA and PFOS. The most powerful and widely exploited method for this purpose is without a doubt LC/MS/MS, which allows the identification and trace quantitation of all species with detectability and resolution power depending on the particular instrumental configurations. The GC/MS is often employed for the monitoring of volatile fluorocarbons, confirming the formation of radicals in the processes of C‒C and C‒S bonds cleavage. For the direct monitoring of radicals participating in the reactions of PFCs decomposition, the molecular spectrophotometry is employed, especially electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The UV/Vis spectrophotometry as a detection method is of special importance in the evaluation of kinetics of radical reactions with the use of pulse radiolysis methods. The most commonly employed for the determination of the yield of mineralization of PFCs is ion-chromatography, but there is also potentiometry with ion-selective electrode and the measurements of general parameters such as Total Organic Carbon and Total Organic Fluoride.

The Al-Pb solid-liquid interface was found previously [Phys. Rev. Lett, 110, 096102 (2013)] to exhibit solid-liquid interfacial premelting at temperatures below the Al melting point. Because the Al(111) free surface does not exhibit premelting, the spreading of a Pb droplet is accompanied by a simultaneous surface transition from a faceted to a premelted Al substrate. Here, we examine how the coupling of the droplet spreading to the premelting affects the spreading kinetics and compare the results to two standard limiting mechanisms of droplet spreading: hydrodynamic spreading, in which the spreading energy dissipation is dominated by viscous relaxation, and kinetic spreading, where interfacial friction dominates. These two mechanisms predict different power-law dependency for the droplet radius versus time. For temperatures where premelting is present (between 875 K and the melting point of aluminum), kinetic spreading is observed at intermediate times. Because Pb droplets only partially wet the surface, the droplet radius at long times relaxes exponentially to the equilibrium droplet shape. Spreading simulations of a faceted system at 625 K [below the Al(111) roughening temperature] show that this system is consistent with a hydrodynamic spreading mechanism. However, when we examine a system at 922.38 K in which premelting is artificially suppressed by introducing harmonic constraints to give surface vibrations consistent with the Al(111) free surface, we observe a kinetic spreading mechanism - as in the premelted system. When premelting is suppressed, the equilibrium contact angle is observed to be significantly larger than when premelting is present even at the same temperatures. Thus, we conclude that the presence of the premelting layer has a significant effect on the thermodynamics Al(111)/Pb solid-liquid interface, but little effect on the mechanism of spreading. We also observe that the structure of the droplet contact line in the presence of the premelting layer is described by two contact angles (instead of the usual one) due to the presence of the additional premelting layer, and resembles structures seen in reactive wetting systems. © 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.","Droplets; Molecular-dynamics simulation; Solid/liquid interfaces; Surfaces; Wetting","Binary alloys; Contact angle; Drops; Energy dissipation; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Kinetics; Lead; Lead alloys; Liquids; Melting point; Molecular dynamics; Phase interfaces; Surfaces; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Wetting; Harmonic constraint; Interfacial friction; Molecular dynamics simulations; Roughening temperature; Solid/liquid interfaces; Spreading kinetics; Surface transitions; Viscous relaxation; Aluminum",2-s2.0-85032024033

This paper proposed a theoretical model to calculate the anisotropic effective elastic constants of a wire mesh material, and finite element method (FEM) is also carried out to validate the proposed model. Considering the effect of wire waviness and the discontinuity between the warp and weft wires, the analytic expressions of effective elastic modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio were obtained. The results show a good agreement between the theoretical and FEM, revealing that the theoretical method gives a reliable prediction. The in-plane effective elastic modulus is higher about one order of magnitude than the out-of-plane modulus. Conversely, the out-of-plane shear properties are superior to the in-plane properties. The effective modulus are significantly affected by wire radius R, opening length L and the ratio R/L. With the increase of R/L, the effective modulus of variant directions increases with different modalities. The wire waviness leads to much more in-plane stiffness-knockdown of wire mesh with thicker wires. Meanwhile, the out-of-plane stiffness is found to be weakened by the tiny contact area between the warp and weft wires.

The wear behaviour and the mechanism of the blades and seal coatings were studied. The maximum possible temperature (MPT) and the temperature rising rate (TRR) at the rubbing surface, which were both directly related to the mechanical strength of coating and blade, were identified as two key factors influencing the blade wear performance and the coating abradability. The MPT of Al-hBN coating was limited to a rather low level and the coating temperature resistance was poor. Hence, the coating was initially softened and blade wear was reduced or even replaced by adhesion of Al-hBN coating. The MPT of NiAl-hBN coatings could be relatively high and the TRR of NiAl-hBN was much smaller than the blade. Hence, the blade lost its mechanical superiority over the coating and was severely damaged. A dimensionless number NT was proposed based on the thermal-physical parameters of blade and coating to represent MPT and TRR and predict the degree of blade wear.

A nonlinear spring-bead model is developed, where the mechanical properties of the sinusoidal beam are described by a nonlinear spring and the mass is concentrated at the bead.

Based on the nonlinear spring-bead model, the quasi-static and dynamic behaviors of PTCS are theoretically and numerically studied, which shows abundant dynamic behaviors depending on the loading rate and damping coefficient. For a 2-layered PTCS, there are four deformation patterns, that is the snap through deformation of the sinusoidal beams for relatively small loading rate and damping coefficient, the uniform deformation for relatively large damping coefficient, and the pulse deformation of the springs near bi-stable configurations for relatively large loading rate and small damping coefficient. While, for the multilayer PTCS, their dynamic behaviors are much more complicated due to the combined deformation of the multiple sinusoidal beams.

A fatigue test machine was used to apply the transverse displacement to the bolted joints during the self-loosening test. Finite element analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of preload and thread locker on the self-loosening from the perspective of thread wear. The investigations show that the self-loosening can be caused by the fretting wear occurring at the thread without the rotation of the nut. The fretting wear becomes more and more severe as the number of loading cycles is increased. This leads to a gradual reduction of clamping force. The increment of preload alleviates the thread wear through reducing the relative slip between the threads of the bolt and the nut. Thereby, the anti-loosening ability of bolted joints is improved. The bolted joints using the thread locker exhibit the best anti-loosening ability since the thread locker can inhibit the thread wear through preventing the relative slip and separating the threads of the bolt and the nut. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bolted joints; Finite element modeling; Fretting; Self-loosening; Transverse cyclic loading",,2-s2.0-85031915575

In contrast, the adhesion force analysis revealed additional Lewis acid-base interactions between the oxidized and non-oxidized VAlN surfaces and carboxyl groups present in the surface of PS after an oxidative oxygen beam treatment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adhesion; Colloidal probe; Hard coating; HPPMS; Oxidation; VAlN","Adhesion; Electron energy analyzers; Electron energy levels; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Electron scattering; Energy dissipation; Hard coatings; Oxidation; Polarization; Probes; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectrum analysis; Ultrahigh vacuum; Van der Waals forces; Adhesive properties; Colloidal probes; Hamaker coefficients; HPPMS; Lewis acid-base interaction; Oxygen incorporation; Reflection electron energy loss spectroscopies; VAlN; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85030327753

The results showed that quantities of Au nanoparticles of which the diameter ranged about 1–2 nm were distributed evenly on the surface of ZnO microspheres. Gas sensing measurements revealed that the ZnO microspheres decorated with ultra-small Au nanoparticles (Au-ZnO microspheres) showed ultrasensitive and selective detection to acetylene. The Au-ZnO microspheres exhibited ultra-higher response to acetylene (311.3–100 ppm acetylene) at a lower optimal working temperature (183.5 °C) compared with pure ZnO microspheres. Meanwhile, The Au-ZnO microspheres displayed a fast response/recovery speed (about 1 s and 20 s, respectively). Besides, the Au-ZnO microspheres also showed good stability and repeatability over a two-month testing period.

Electron Beam Melted Ti6Al4V samples, with a simplified geometry close to that of acetabular cups, were finished by machining. Wet and cryogenic machining with a different number of finishing passes were used to create different surface and sub-surface conditions. The Ti6Al4V samples were wear-tested against ASTM 1537 Co-Cr-Mo alloy using a commercial tribometer in a simulated implant environment. A change in the wear response was found as a function of the part surface topography and properties that resulted from the given machining operations. A correlation between the machining parameters and wear volume loss was assessed and discussed. Cryogenic cooling was the most promising of the evaluated machining approaches because it generated lower wear volume compared to wet conditions thanks to a hardened and more compressed surface and to the generation of a profile characterized by a reduced skewness, which revealed to be the most influencing texture parameter in enhancing the wear resistance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Surface; Titanium; Tribology",,2-s2.0-85032438170

The use of NG serves as nucleation sites, thereby facilitating the growth of AgNWs. The specific material design of the as-prepared NG-AgNW hybrids involves some advantages, including a continuous AgNW-graphene conducting network. Since AgNWs are electrically conductive, it provides an electrical contact with NG sheets which can effectively help the charge transport process and limit the variations in volume during the lithiation/de-lithiation processes. Apart from this, the insertion of metallic Ag nanowires into a percolated NG network increases the interlayer distance of NG sheets and prevent its restacking. Moreover, the more porous nature of the hybrid structure accommodating the large volume changes of AgNWs. As an anode material for LIBs, the NG-AgNW hybrid displays a remarkable initial discharge capacity of 1215 mAh g−1 and attains a stable capacity of 724 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. The electrode exhibits a stable reversible capacity of 714, 634, 550 and 464 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 Ag−1 respectively. The reversible capacity (710 mAh g−1) at 0.1 Ag−1 is recovered after the cycling at various current densities confirming outstanding rate performance of the material. In addition, the coulombic efficiency, the NG-AgNW anode retains nearly 99% after the second cycle, further indicating its excellent reversibility. The hybrid material exhibits better cycling stability, greater rate capability, capacity retention and superior reversible capacity than that of bare AgNW and NG sheets.

The preparation involved amine functionalization of PAN powder, electrospinning of the powder to form a nanofibrous mat with a large surface area, and compression of the mat to obtain dense membranes for facilitated transport of humid CO2. The functionalization step was carried out with different routes: amination with hexamethylene diamine or ethylene diamine, and basic hydrolysis. The final amine content in the polymer could be tuned varying the reaction type and conditions, although high functionalization degrees led to crosslinking, which made the powder insoluble. The dry CO2 uptake was measured at various stages of the preparation, in order to assess separately the effect of chemical functionalization and surface area enhancement on the material capture ability. Such tests indicated that both chemical and morphological changes of the neat polymer enhanced the dry CO2 sorption capacity, although the increase of surface area yielded the largest improvement. CO2 permeation tests in humid conditions were carried out on the compacted membranes, indicating that the materials functionalized via direct amination exhibit a behavior compatible with the facilitated transport mechanism, with CO2 permeability reaching 83 Barrer, increasing by 17 times with respect to the dry state value, at a relative humidity of 50%. Membranes functionalized via hydrolysis did not show such a behavior, maybe because the amine functionalities were consumed by an unwanted reaction. The procedure can be further improved by optimizing each processing step, or changing the order of the steps. The electrospinning process seemed the key factor of the approach, as the large surface area of electrospun mats allowed to obtain membranes with a higher permeability than the original ones, and a large availability of amine groups useful for humid CO2 capture. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 capture; Electrospinning; Facilitated transport; Gas separation; Nanofiber mat",,2-s2.0-85031740734

In this work, we reported the effects of the large lattice mismatch and film thickness on the epitaxial growth and magnetic properties of FePt films on ZrxTi1−xN (0 0 1) intermediate layer. FePt films with different thickness were deposited on ZrTiN intermediate layers with various doping concentration of TiN in ZrN. The increase in doping concentration of TiN caused a decrease in the lattice parameters of ZrTiN intermediate layer. It was found that (0 0 1) epitaxy of FePt 10 nm films was only achieved on ZrTiN intermediate layer when the TiN composition was ≥25 vol%, while (0 0 1) texture of 5 nm films was achieved on ZrTiN intermediate layer with a minimum of 50 vol% TiN composition. The in-plane lattice constants of FePt and Zr0.70Ti0.30N (25 vol% TiN) were 3.870 Å and 4.476 Å, respectively, which resulted in a lattice mismatch as large as 15.7%. These large lattice mismatch heterostructures adopted 7/6 domain matching epitaxy. The magneto-crystalline anisotropy of FePt films was improved with the increase in lattice mismatch. Intrinsic magnetic properties were extrapolated for FePt (30 nm)/Zr0.70Ti0.30N (30 nm)/TaN (30 nm)/MgO, and the Ms(0 K) and K1(0 K) were 1042 emu/cc and 5.10 × 107 erg/cc, respectively, which is comparable to that of bulk L10 FePt. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Binary alloys; Film growth; Iron alloys; Lattice constants; Lattice mismatch; Magnetic properties; Magnetism; Platinum alloys; Semiconductor doping; Titanium alloys; Titanium compounds; Titanium nitride; Zirconium alloys; Different thickness; Domain matching epitaxy; Doping concentration; Electronic device; Heteroepitaxial films; In-plane lattices; Intermediate layers; Large lattice mismatch; Epitaxial growth",2-s2.0-85029292702

Series of model, synthetic dry flue gases were used to elucidate the effects of HCl, SO2, NO and their proportions in the gas on mercury behaviour. Three samples of fly ash collected from a MSWI facility were characterized and evaluated both for Hg heterogeneous oxidation and Hg removal in a laboratory scale device. The results obtained in this study showed that homogeneous mercury oxidation in the models MSWI and coal combustion flue gas atmospheres was 52 ± 5% and 25%, respectively. SO2, NO and HCl have a synergetic effect in Hg oxidation in presence of oxygen, but the main differences found are mainly caused by the strong influence of HCl and the likely inhibitory oxidation effects of SO2. Surface area together with carbon and chloride content of the fly ashes were correlated with their capacity for Hg-heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption. The sample of fly ash with relatively high content of unburnt carbon and chlorine, and with BET surface (2.42 m2/g) was able to remove up to 100% of Hg0 (g) during 300 min. The results obtained in this study provide a complete overview of the behaviour of mercury during MSWI processes and may help to clarify the fate/behaviour of mercury in a filter (e.g. electrostatic precipitator) providing a deeper knowledge about the impacts of fly ash properties on mercury fate in waste incineration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Capture; Fly-ash; Mercury; Oxidation; Waste to energy","carbon; chloride; chlorine; coal; hydrochloric acid; mercury; nitrogen oxide; oxygen; sulfur dioxide; adsorption; coal combustion; filter; fly ash; heterogeneity; homogeneity; incineration; mercury (element); mitigation; oxidation; pollutant removal; Article; atmosphere; combustion; environmental impact; flue gas; fly ash; gas waste; incineration; laboratory; model; oxidation; surface area; waste-to-energy; waste-to-energy plant",2-s2.0-85032282651

The results show that the HUF changes are related to the corrosion process. Hydrogen uptake is mainly affected by the precipitated particles in the pre-transition stage; alloys with a larger amount of particles tend to absorb more hydrogen, regardless of the alloying composition. However, oxide morphologies play a dominant role in the hydrogen uptake during a post-transition oxidation. At this stage, the HUF increases sharply to a high level due to the formation of large in size parallel cracks in the oxide layers. The evaluation of the hydrogen uptake behavior of the Zr-1.0Cr-0.4Fe alloy suggests that although the large amount of the fine precipitated particles in this alloy leads to a higher HUF in the initial pre-transition stage, eventually, after long-term exposure, this alloy will have a lower final hydrogen content due to its lower corrosion rate and the effect of the protective oxide film. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrogen uptake; Oxide morphology; Parallel cracks; Precipitated particles; Zirconium alloys","Chromium alloys; Corrosion; Corrosion rate; Cracks; Hydrogen; Molybdenum alloys; Niobium alloys; Oxide films; Ternary alloys; Tin alloys; Zirconium alloys; Alloying compositions; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen contents; Hydrogen uptake; Long term exposure; Oxide morphologies; Parallel crack; Protective oxide films; Iron alloys",2-s2.0-85031016358

The results show that the emission rate of arsenic gradually increases with increased burning temperature, with a threshold of approximately 700 °C to 800 °C in the process of temperature increase. Then, the relationships among the arsenic emission rate and combustion environment, original arsenic content, combustion time, burning temperature, air flow and amount of arsenic fixing agent are discussed, and it is found that except for the original arsenic content, the rest of the factors have a nonlinear relationship with the emission rate of arsenic. That is, up to a certain level, they all contribute to the release of arsenic, and then their impact is minimal. The original arsenic content in coal is proportional to the arsenic emission rate.

Taking advantage of the large size and high aspect ratio of GnPs, a relatively low percolation threshold of ∼2.99 vol% is obtained with highly increased in-plane and through-plane electrical conductivity. The fitting of experimental data to the percolation theory indicates that GnPs are three dimensionally dispersed within the polymer matrix.

In this study, the arsenic (As) occurrence of the coal from Wangjiazhai coal mine in China and the corresponding migration law in the dissociation process were investigated. Accordingly, it was proposed for the vibrated dense medium fluidized bed (VDMFB) to be utilized, where it was suitable to separate the fine coal for As removal. The fluidization characteristics and the improvement of fluidization quality under the collaborative effect of vibration amplitude (A), vibration frequency (f) and air velocity (Ua) were also explored. It was discovered that the fluidized bed density was uniform and beneficial to separate coal through settling velocity when the fluidization number, Nv, was 1.0–1.83 with A of 0.5–3 mm and f of 5–30 Hz. Moreover, the bed density was driven to periodically fluctuate in a low range, based on the periodic vibration energy input in the bed. Furthermore, thirteen separation experiments for fine coal with various parameter combinations were executed through the Box-Behnken RSM method. The results demonstrated that the three operation parameters importance on the segregation degree of As content (SAs) was as follows: vibration amplitude &gt; air velocity &gt; vibration frequency.

The kinetic modeling data revealed that the adsorption of AO has a good adjustment to the pseudo-second-order model. Langmuir isotherm model is better fitted for adsorption data and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 909.1 mg/g at 313 K. The negative values of ΔG showed the spontaneous nature of the AO adsorption onto ZnO-AC. The results indicated the adsorption was pH dependent which is mainly governed by electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding and π–π interaction. Reusability test showed a low decrease in the removal performance of ZnO-AC due to the mesopore filling mechanism confirmed by BET analysis after adsorption. Also, thermal regeneration could deposit AO dye on the surface of the composite leading to the efficiency decrease. Finally, the effect of various parameters such as pH, temperature, contact time and initial dye concentration was studied using response surface methodology (RSM). The model predicted a maximum AO removal (99.42 ± 0.57%) under the optimum conditions, which was very close to the experimental value (99.32 ± 0.18%). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Activated carbon; Adsorption mechanism; Regeneration; Response surface methodology; Wastewater pollutant; Zinc oxide","activated carbon; adsorption; aqueous solution; composite; dye; experimental design; experimental study; isotherm; optimization; oxide group; parameterization; performance assessment; reaction kinetics; shell; thermodynamics",2-s2.0-85032675209

In this protocol, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) which could produce excellent ECL emission, were loaded onto Ni(OH)2 with the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical and stacked lamellar structure. Taking advantages of high conductivity and large specific surface area of Ni(OH)2, the better electrochemical and ECL behavior of Ni(OH)2/NGQDs were presented. As another part of immunosensor, the Fe3O4@MnO2 composites with wider ultraviolet absorption range were successfully assembled. The absorption spectra of Fe3O4@MnO2 precisely overlapped with the ECL spectra of NGQDs, leading to the significant decrement of ECL signal. Herein, the sandwich-type immunosensor was developed based on the quenching mechanism between NGQDs (ECL donor) and Fe3O4@MnO2 (ECL acceptor). The system was optimized to realize reliable determination of PSA concentration within the linear range of 10−5–10 ng/mL and a detection limit of 5 fg/mL (S/N = 3).

Among various materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique physicochemical, electrical, and mechanical properties that make them suitable for potential applications as environmental adsorbents, sensors, membranes, and catalysts. Depending on the intended application and the chemical nature of the target contaminants, CNTs can be designed through specific functionalization or modification processes. Designer CNTs can remarkably enhance contaminant removal efficiency and facilitate nanomaterial recovery and regeneration. An increasing number of CNT-based materials have been used to treat diverse organic, inorganic, and biological contaminants. These success stories demonstrate their strong potential in practical applications, including wastewater purification and desalination. However, CNT-based technologies have not been broadly accepted for commercial use due to their prohibitive cost and the complex interactions of CNTs with other abiotic and biotic environmental components. This paper presents a critical review of the existing literature on the interaction of various contaminants with CNTs in water and soil environments. The preparation methods of various designer CNTs (surface functionalized and/or modified) and the functional relationships between their physicochemical characteristics and environmental uses are discussed. This review will also help to identify the research gaps that must be addressed for enhancing the commercial acceptance of CNTs in the environmental remediation industry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon nanotubes; Contaminants; Desalination; Environmental remediation; Soil remediation; Surface functionalization/modification","Adsorbents; Biological materials; Carbon; Chemical modification; Contamination; Desalination; Design; Environmental technology; Impurities; Membranes; Nanotubes; Pollution; Soil conservation; Soil pollution; Yarn; Biological contaminants; Environmental cleanup; Environmental remediation; Functional relationship; Physicochemical characteristics; Soil remediation; Surface Functionalization; Wastewater purification; Carbon nanotubes",2-s2.0-85028515983

These changes are expected to have important environmental and ecological consequences. However, high spatiotemporal variability has been reported in previous studies, and the underlying mechanisms remain inadequately understood. This study assessed variation in the properties of stream water DOM within watersheds across a gradient of agricultural land use with grazing pasture lands as the dominant agricultural type in the southeastern United States. We collected water samples under baseflow conditions five times over eight months from a regional group of first- to fourth-order streams. Samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, DOM quality based on absorbance and fluorescence properties, as well as DOM biodegradability. We found that air temperature and antecedent hydrological conditions (indicated by antecedent precipitation index and stream water sodium concentrations) positively influenced stream water DOC concentration, DOM fluorescence index, and the proportion of soil-derived, microbial humic fluorescence. This observation suggests that elevated production and release of microbial DOM in soils facilitated by high temperature, in conjunction with strong soil-stream hydrological connectivity, were important drivers for changes in the concentration and composition of stream water DOM. By comparison, watersheds with a high percentage of agricultural land use showed higher DOC concentration, larger proportion of soil-derived, humic-like DOM compounds, and higher DOC biodegradability. These observations reflect preferential mobilization of humic DOM compounds from shallow organic matter-rich soils in agricultural watersheds, likely due to enhanced soil erosion, organic matter oxidation and relatively shallow soil-to-stream flow paths. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DOM biodegradability; DOM optical property; Excitation emission matrix-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC); Flow path; Microbial DOM; Stream water","Agriculture; Biodegradability; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Dissolution; Ecology; Fluorescence; Land use; Optical properties; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Soils; Stream flow; Water analysis; Watersheds; Dissolved organic matters; Flow path; Hydrological connectivity; Microbial DOM; Organic matter oxidation; Parallel factor analysis; Spatiotemporal variability; Stream water; Rivers; dissolved organic matter; sodium; agricultural land; biodegradation; climate effect; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; flow field; land use; lotic environment; mobilization; streamwater; water quality; watershed; agricultural land; air temperature; Article; biodegradability; climate; concentration (parameters); filtration; fluorescence; grazing; hydrology; land use; oxidation; pastureland; precipitation; priority journal; soil erosion; United States; water sampling; watershed; United States",2-s2.0-85029178238

In this study, using fluorescence analysis, we investigated the seasonal dynamics of DOM characteristics in Changshou Lake, which is a typical inland lake in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area. We also discuss the environmental implications of DOM for mercury (Hg) dynamics. Based on the origins of two end-members, the variations in DOM observed in this study in Changshou Lake suggest that hydrological processes (e.g., terrestrial inputs resulting from runoff and humic-like component residences) and biological activities (e.g., microbial and algae growth) are the two main principal components controlling the seasonal dynamics of DOM characteristics. Furthermore, the dynamics of dissolved Hg co-varied with variations in DOM properties, rather than with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. This indicates that the previously reported simple correlations between DOC and Hg were not comprehensive and may lead to misunderstanding the interactions between DOM and Hg. Therefore, we recommend that when using DOM-Hg correlations to evaluate the role of DOM in the environmental fate of Hg, especially in field investigations of the spatial and temporal distribution of Hg, the properties of DOM must be taken into account. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Changshou Lake; Dissolved organic matter; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Mercury; Methylmercury; Three Gorges Reservoir Area","concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; environmental fate; fluorescence; fluorescence spectroscopy; mercury (element); methylmercury; microbial activity; principal component analysis; seasonal variation; Changshou Reservoir; China; Sichuan; Three Gorges Reservoir; algae",2-s2.0-85032669307

Suva, a Pacific Island city with substantial input from combustion sources, is used as a case-study. Elemental concentration was determined, by ion beam analysis, for PM2.5 samples from Suva, spanning one year. Sources of PM2.5 have been quantified by positive matrix factorisation. A review of recent literature has been carried out to delineate the mortality risk associated with these sources. Risk factors have then been applied for Suva, to calculate the possible mortality reduction that may be achieved through reduction in pollutant levels. Higher risk ratios for black carbon and sulphur resulted in mortality predictions for PM2.5 from fossil fuel combustion, road vehicle emissions and waste burning that surpass predictions for these sources based on health risk of PM2.5 mass alone. Predicted mortality for Suva from fossil fuel smoke exceeds the national toll from road accidents in Fiji.

The thermal stability and impact sensitivity were also investigated. For 1, 1D energetic MOF had an outstanding thermal stability (Tp &gt; 300 °C) and insensitivity (IS &gt; 24.5 J). In addition, the non-isothermal kinetics parameters, critical temperature of thermal explosion, entropy of activation, enthalpy of activation and free energy of activation were discussed in detail. For 2, it was revealed that the each Cd(II) cation is located in a unique hepta-coordination environment. Noticeably, tetrazole-ring of AFT group presents typical monodentate coordination mode, and ODH molecule presents typical tridentate and tetradentate coordination modes, featuring a one-dimensional chain structure.

Different characterisations of i-TBC are required to understand the formation of its microstructure leading to the final properties. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the integrity of Cu-Cu and Cu-FeNi36 interfaces as well as copper microstructure evolution throughout all elaboration steps: (i) first cold rolling, (ii) heat treatment and (iii) second cold rolling. First cold rolling did not lead to a bonding of Cu-Cu interfaces in the thermal bridge. Moreover, heterogeneity of Cu grain microstructure was observed with formation of ultra-fine grained structure close to junctions of Cu and FeNi36. The heat treatment led to a degradation of different interfaces adherence and to a complete copper recrystallization. Finally, the second cold rolling ensured an efficient solid welding of Cu-Cu interfaces and led to a heterogeneity of strain hardening of copper. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cold rolling; Cold welding; EBSD; i-TBC; Strain hardening; Thermal bridge","Binary alloys; Bridges; Cold welding; Copper; Hardening; Heat treatment; High temperature applications; Iron alloys; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Power electronics; Strain hardening; Ternary alloys; Thermal expansion; Welding; Copper microstructures; EBSD; Grain microstructure; Micro-structure evolutions; Power electronic modules; Simultaneous use; Thermal bridge; Ultra-fine-grained; Cold rolling",2-s2.0-85031018619

This has been attributed in part to accumulated environmental pollutants especially radioactive substances and the use of nuclear power plants worldwide. However, the outcome of chronic exposure to low doses of a radionuclide such as uranium remains unknown. Recently, a paradigm shift in the perception of risk of radiotoxicology has emerged through investigating the possibility of transmission of biological effects over generations, in particular by epigenetic pathways. These processes are known for their crucial roles associated with the development of several diseases. Objective The current work investigates the epigenetic effect of chronic exposure to low doses of uranium and its inheritance across generations. Materials and Methods To test this proposition, a rodent multigenerational model, males and females, were exposed to a non-toxic concentration of uranium (40 mg L−1 drinking water) for nine months. The uranium effects on were evaluated over three generations (F0, F1 and F2) by analysing the DNA methylation profile and DNMT genes expression in ovaries and testes tissues. Results Here we report a significant hypermethylation of testes DNA (p &lt;0.005) whereas ovaries showed hypomethylated DNA (p &lt;0.005). Interestingly, this DNA methylation profile was significantly maintained across generations F0, F1 and F2. Furthermore, qPCR results of both tissues imply a significant change in the expression of DNA methyltransferase genes (DNMT 1 and DNMT3a/b) as well. Conclusion Altogether, our work demonstrates for the first time a sex-dependance and inheritance of epigenetic marks, DNA methylation, as a biological response to the exposure to low doses of uranium. However, it is not clear which type of reproductive cell type is more responsive in this context. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chronic low-dose; DNMTs; Epigenetic; Global DNA methylation; Gonads; Multigenerational model; TET; Uranium","DNA; DNA methyltransferase; uranium; animal experiment; animal tissue; controlled study; DNA methylation; epigenetics; female; gene expression; gonad; inheritance; long term exposure; male; nonhuman; ovary; priority journal; rat; Review; sex difference; testis",2-s2.0-85031994440

The underlying physics of improving ductility remains to be further uncovered. Here we report a new finding in β-Ti alloy single crystal micropillar compression that the plasticity can be substantially improved by means of increasing strain rate, while mechanical strength simultaneously exhibits striking “faster is stronger” fashion. The results reveal that the improvement of micropillar plasticity upon higher loading rate can be ascribed to the wider deformation band, in contrast to equivalents under quasi-static mode. The microscopic examination shows that cross slip induced by screw dislocations governs the plasticity improvement, which is further validated by crystallographic analysis and first principle energy landscape calculations.

The high degradation percentage of 5 ppm MO with 1.5 g/L LNO was 94.3% after 4 h with a stirring speed of 500 rpm. Reactions under nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide conditions were performed with efficiencies of 19.6%, 7.1%, and 96.8% respectively after 6 h to understand the mechanism.

Their thermal property information is limited, lacking experimental data on key properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat, and CTE of the component fiber. This paper presents, for the first time, the thermal property data on kenaf fiber reinforced composites, and an approach to obtain the composite thermal properties based on constituent properties. Individual, plant-based fibers were measured independently and were then used to inform successful predictions of the effective thermal conductivity of the fiber reinforced composites. A unit cell model has been developed to predict the thermal properties of a planar, randomly oriented kenaf fiber-reinforced composite (near 22% volume fraction loading), which includes the effect of void content on the predicted thermal conductivity. A lower-level model is also developed for individual fiber thermal properties based on its constituents (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). To validate this multi-level model, experimental measurements of the thermal diffusivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and specific heat for the composite, the matrix, and the fibers were performed in the range from 30 °C to 160 °C, based on TMA, DSC, LFA, and transient electro-thermal (TET) techniques. Model results compare favorably with the experimental data, and are consistent with FEM modelling results based on fiber properties and fiber constituent materials (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). This approach provides the basis for understanding component contribution to the fiber properties, as well as a technique to obtain fiber composite thermal property based on component properties.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problems at low magnetic Reynolds number (Rem) but finite flow Reynolds number (Re) are considered, so the fluid flow is affected by the magnetic field which remains unaltered by the fluid flow. The base functions to approximate the variables of the problem are the particular solutions of an auxiliary Stokes flow field in which a multiquadric (MQ) radial basis function (RBF) is applied as source term. The nonlinear equations resulting from the discretization in a fully implicit finite-difference form are solved by a variable step Newton–Raphson method. The capability of the numerical scheme to simulate MHD problems for different geometries is shown by solving the one-sided lid-driven cavity and the backward facing step flows in the presence of horizontal and vertical magnetic fields, respectively. The existence of simultaneous steady-state solutions in the four-sided lid-driven cavity (4S-LDC) problem is studied with the MASPS for Re between 0 and 1000 and Hartmann numbers (Ha) up to 10. Critical Reynolds numbers (Rec), corresponding to stationary and Hopf bifurcations, are evidenced. Bifurcation diagrams are constructed based on simultaneous solutions and their stability analyses. The increase of Ha modifies the bifurcation diagram and causes the displacement of bifurcation points towards higher Re.

Effects of Al content on wetting kinetics and microstructures of the re-solidified filler metal were studied in this important system of dissimilar substrates. Experimental results have confirmed that the wetting of Zn–xAl filler metal on stainless steel features the trend of triple-line kinetics. In the main spreading phase, the spreading radius and time can be correlated with a power law of Rn ∼ t, n = ∼0.4. The content of Al in the filler metal has a minimal effect on the value of n for the investigated range of Al concentrations. However, the spreading area of the filler metal after re-solidification decreases with an increase of the content of Al. Moreover, the thickness of the Fe–Al intermetallic layer at the cross-section increases with an increasing Al content. © 2017 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

Using scanning electron microscope (SEM), several powder particle morphologies were identified in the stainless s steel CX feedstock powder where the spherical morphology was found to be the dominant one. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique detected austenite and martensite phases in both stainless steel CX powder and as-built sample, whereas no carbide peak appeared on the XRD patterns. Moreover, lath or needle-like martensite phase was observed in the microstructure of the as-built sample. The level of porosity was very low in the as-built sample, indicating the manufacturing of a nearly fully dense sample. Furthermore, a high ultimate tensile strength together with a good elongation to fracture was obtained for the horizontally-built stainless steel CX sample. Finally, examination of the fracture surfaces after tensile tests confirmed the ductile failure mode of the samples, in which the pull-out of the scan tracks and coalescence of the voids resulted in the tear and final rupture.

This effect is not predictable by the standard conventional models. It is proposed that increasing the boride-forming elements in the base superalloy which promotes in situ boride precipitation at the diffusion-affected zone can accelerate the diffusion flux of the boron into the base superalloy, leading to faster isothermal solidification.

As-deposited Ti-5Al-2.5Sn exhibits a columnar prior-β microstructure with martensitic α′ needles filled inside and a small amount of grain-boundary α (αGB) stripes precipitated at the prior-grain boundaries. After subtransus heat treating at 600 °C to 750 °C for 2 h, incomplete recrystallization of the as-deposited microstructure occurs and the recrystallized α grains with equiaxed morphology nucleate mainly through grain boundary migration of the stripe-like αGB, leading to a duplex microstructure composed of the soft recrystallized α and 75.1–97.6% high-strength α′. After subtransus heat treating at 850 °C to 950 °C for 2 h, complete recrystallization of the as-deposited microstructure occurs and the coarsening of recrystallized α grains becomes more pronounced at 950 °C. By contrasting, an excessively coarsened widmanstatten microstructure composed of α laths with lengths up to several hundred micrometers has been obtained after supertransus heat treating at 1100 °C for 2 h. Both of the as-deposited and heat-treated samples exhibit relatively weak textures, resulting in very little mechanical anisotropies. Because of the dominant α′ microstructure, as-deposited possesses ultrahigh tensile strengths but also a poor elongation (7.7–8.2%) in comparison to the conventionally-fabricated Ti-5Al-2.5Sn. After the heat treatments, tensile strengths gradually decrease whereas elongation increases first and then decreases with the elevating annealing temperature, reaching its peak at 750 °C (14.4–15.2%). Finally, it has been proved that both elongations and tensile strengths of the 650–850 °C/2 h heat-treated samples can exceed those of the conventionally-fabricated Ti-5Al-2.5Sn.

Accordingly, our analytical framework develops a transaction cost explanation for the extent to which participatory procedures help stakeholders to identify partners and initiate collaboration, and for the causal link between the attributes of these stakeholders and their partnerships. The p2 model is implemented to investigate partnership networks of the key actors that govern the management of the Gironde estuary, the study case.

How these ions migrate across the IEMs with simultaneous metal reduction on the cathodes, however, is not yet fully understood. Therefore, two proton exchange (N117 and N212), a cation exchange (CEM) and an anion exchange (AEM) membranes were studied to evaluate the suitability of IEMs as separators of MFCs for reduction of mixed Cr2O7 2−, Cu2+ and Cd2+ at each metals of either 10 mM or 1.0 mM, as a model for a wide variety of metals in practical electroplating and mining industries. It was found that circuit current directed reduction of more metals on the cathodes with less migration across the IEMs, compared to the more metal transport in the absence of circuit current. CEM was the most beneficial for less cross-over of Cr2O7 2− from one side, and CH3COO− and PO4 3− from the other side, despite slight more migration of Cu2+ and Cd2+ than that of AEM. A higher metal concentration with each of 10 mM led to more metal transport through the IEMs than that of 1.0 mM. This study demonstrates the dependency of migration and reduction of Cr2O7 2−, Cu2+ and Cd2+ on electric field, type of IEM and metal concentration, and thus provides a new insight into metallurgical MFCs for remediating Cr2O7 2−, Cu2+ and Cd2+ co-contamination with simultaneous metal recovery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ion exchange membrane; Metal recovery; Metallurgical microbial fuel cell","Alkaline fuel cells; Cadmium; Cadmium compounds; Cathodes; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Computational electromagnetics; Electric fields; Electrodes; Fuel cells; Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Metal ions; Metallurgy; Metals; Microbial fuel cells; Molecular biology; Recovery; Separators; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Anion exchange; Cation exchanges; Cross over; Metal concentrations; Metal reduction; Metal transport; Microbial fuel cells (MFCs); Proton exchange; Metal recovery",2-s2.0-85030852777

A serial of LiNixCo1-2xMnxO2 samples were prepared via a solid state reaction and subsequently characterized by XRD in conjunction with structural refinement, XPS depth profiling, and AC impedance spectroscopy. Slightly different expansion rates are observed for lattice parameters (a and c/3) with varying of Ni content, which is attributed to the increase of average metal-ion radius and an increase of eg electron that enhances the columbic repulsion between transition metal and oxygen atoms. XPS depth profiling results show that surface composition is significantly deviated from bulk, in which Ni and Mn atoms tend to enrich in the surface region, while Co element is relatively deficient. Further, surface element segregation is alleviated by the increase of Ni/Mn content.

The objective of this study is to systematically investigate the synergistic effects of eight dispersion parameters on the size and stability of indium tin oxide (ITO) NPs in heptane. The matrix of experimentation was designed using an L18 Taguchi method. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the experimental results revealed that the most significant factors on the size and stability of NPs were the mass of ITO NPs and the volume of the dispersing agent. Taguchi signal-to-noise (SN) ratio analysis was used to determine the optimal factor levels for the preparation of well-dispersed and stable NP suspensions.

Joint toxicity was predicted and compared using the concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models with different assumptions in the toxic action mode in toxicodynamic processes through single and binary metal mixture tests. Results showed that the CA and IA models presented varying predictive abilities for different metal combinations. For the Cu–Cd and Cd–Pb mixtures, the CA model simulated the observed survival rates better than the IA model. By contrast, the IA model simulated the observed survival rates better than the CA model for the Cu–Zn and Cu–Pb mixtures. These findings revealed that the toxic action mode may depend on the combinations and concentrations of tested metal mixtures. Statistical analysis of the antagonistic or synergistic interactions indicated that synergistic interactions were observed for the Cu–Cd and Cu–Pb mixtures, non-interactions were observed for the Cd–Pb mixtures, and slight antagonistic interactions for the Cu–Zn mixtures.

The sensor operates in dynamic temperature mode combined with a number of adaptive signal processing algorithms. Artificial neural networks were proven to be more effective among the other adaptive algorithms implemented in this study. Identification of individual gases by a single sensor, averaged over all the gases and concentrations, resulted in only 13.2% false recognitions. Most of the failures were attributed to NO2 detection in 0.01–0.1 ppm concentrations range. The ability of a single sensor to identify gas mixtures in a complex background was tested on the example of CO + H2 mixture in air, which simulates smoldering in the early stages of fire. The algorithm showed the ability to identify and quantify CO + H2 mixture with less than 10% error rate, even in constant presence of background gas (NO2 1.4 ppm). Chemical modification of SnO2, increasing sensor response and sensitivity to individual components of the mixture, was proven to be beneficial for improvement of identification and quantification of gas mixture. Significant improvement in quantification accuracy (decrease in relative error from 7 to 2.5%) was achieved by utilizing a 3 sensor array in combination with an adaptive data processing algorithm, compared to the use of a single sensor alone.

This paper focuses on the design, fabrication, and experimental characterization of a novel additively manufactured air–water heat exchanger for dry cooling of power plants. The heat exchanger consists of manifold-microchannels on the air side and rectangular channels on the water side in a cross-flow configuration. By using additive manufacturing, the manifold-microchannel heat exchanger can be fabricated as a single component, which eliminates the assembly process. Three prototype heat exchangers were fabricated using direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) out of stainless-steel (SS17-4), titanium alloy (Ti64), and aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg). Air-side heat transfer coefficients in the range of 100–450 W/m2 K at pressure drops of 50–2000 Pa were recorded for the titanium alloy heat exchanger for air flow rate ranging from 1.89 L/s to 18.9 L/s.

The physical, chemical and optical properties of the resulted samples were thoroughly characterized. The photocatalytic performance of h-BN/g-C3N4 composites were evaluated under visible light irradiation using antibiotic tetracycline (TC) and rhodamine B (RhB) as target pollutants.

The dye concentration of co-sensitized TiO2 film was higher than that of individual dye-sensitized TiO2 film, leading to improved photovoltaic performance with the panchromatic light harvesting of JH-1 and SQ2 (350–720 nm). Optimum molar ratio of individual dye, dye concentration and adsorption kinetics onto the TiO2 photoelectrode, and ideal thickness of HS-TiO2 layer have been investigated. A flexible DSSC co-sensitized with the molar ratio of 60:40 (JH-1:SQ2) and TiO2 film thickness of 6 μm yielded a high photocurrent density of 12.32 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.754 V, a fill factor of 0.68, and a power conversion efficiency of 6.31% under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). Interestingly, the co-sensitizers did not compete with each other for the absorption. Both the open circuit photovoltage and the photocurrent density were unexpectedly increased with co-sensitization which means that enhancement in photocurrents can be achieved without sacrificing the open circuit photovoltage for the co-sensitized solar cells, once the electron recombination and dye aggregation are retarded by the co-sensitization. © 2017","Co-sensitization; Flexible dye-sensitized solar cell; Metal-free organic dye; Unsymmetrical squaraine dye","Electromagnetic wave absorption; Flexible electronics; Heterojunctions; Light; Light absorption; Open circuit voltage; Photocurrents; Solar cells; Steel beams and girders; Titanium compounds; Titanium dioxide; Co-sensitization; Enhanced light absorptions; Flexible dye sensitized solar cell; Open-circuit photovoltage; Organic dye; Photovoltaic performance; Power conversion efficiencies; Squaraine dyes; Dye-sensitized solar cells",2-s2.0-85032865687

DED is a highly flexible additive manufacturing process wherein a metal powder mixed with a foaming agent is sprayed while a high-power laser is used to simultaneously melt the powder mixture into layered metal foams. In this study, a mixture of a carbon steel material (P21 powder) and a widely used foaming agent, ZrH2, is used to fabricate metal foams. The effects of various process parameters, such as the laser power, powder feed rate, powder gas flow rate, and scanning speed, on the deposition characteristics (porosity, pore size, and pore distribution) are investigated. The synthesized metal foams exhibit porosities of 10% or lower, and a mean pore area of 7 × 105 μm2. It is observed that the degree of foaming increases in proportion to the laser power to a certain extent. The results also show that the powder feed rate has the most pronounced effect on the porosity of the metal foams, while the powder gas flow rate is the most suitable parameter for adjusting the size of the pores formed within the foams. Further, the scanning speed, which determines the amounts of energy and powder delivered, has a significant effect on the height of the deposits as well as on the properties of the foams. Thus, during the DED process for fabricating metal foams, the pore size and distribution and hence the foam porosity can be tailored by varying the individual process parameters.

The results showed that the PCM-based heat sink could inhibit the temperature excursions during the heating period, and that the performance could be improved almost monotonously with increasing the filling height ratio. However, the performance improvement was found to become saturated approaching the full-filling case, regardless of the pore size and heating power. A new parameter, i.e., the filling effectiveness, was defined to help make a trade-off analysis between the performance gain and cost saving. As can be assessed by the filling effectiveness, the 2/3 partial filling was demonstrated to be more economical than full filling because the save in cost of materials and system weight is obvious with only a negligible sacrifice in the gain of performance improvement.

Moreover, this material exhibits good redox reversibility under the condition of multiple reduction and re-oxidation cycles, as confirmed by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. A protonic fuel cell (PFC) built with this newly developed material shows a comparable electrocatalytic activity in both C2H6 and H2 atmospheres while a considerably high power density of 377 mW cm−2 is achieved in H2 and 268 mW cm−2 in C2H6 at 750 °C. In addition, C2H4 yield in the cell with Co-SMCFO as anode is considerably improved (11.9%–37.8% at 650–750 °C) with respect to the widely used chromium oxide. The good electrochemical performance, the improved C2H6 partial dehydrogenation ability and the negligible carbon formation in the Co-SMCFO anode are the strong indications that the SMCFO is a promising catalyst for the cogeneration of C2H4 and electricity, and can also be potentially utilized in the PFC directly fueled with hydrocarbon. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anode catalyst; Ethane dehydrogenation; in situ exsolution; Metal nanoparticle; Protonic fuel cell","Anodes; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Dehydrogenation; Electrodes; Ethylene; Fuel cells; Metal fuels; Nanoparticles; Oxygen vacancies; Synthesis (chemical); Thermogravimetric analysis; Anode catalysts; Electrical conduction; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrochemical performance; Ethane dehydrogenation; Exsolution; Protonic; Structure transformations; Metal nanoparticles",2-s2.0-85028336394

Next, the effects of pH, P, Cl, NO3, and four Fe-chelators were investigated by using thermodynamic modelling and by examining changes in root elongation rate of soybean (Glycine max cv. Bunya). The literature review identified that the solution concentrations of metals in soils were low, ranging from (µM) 0.069–11Cd, 0.19–15.8 Cu, 0.000027–0.000079 Hg, 1.0–8.7 Ni, 0.004–0.55 Pb, and 0.4–36.3 Zn.

The main phenomena including the adhesion of the plastic to the metal sheet and the development of bubbles (on the plastic surface) depend on the temperature reached by the polymer at the interface. Such a temperature should be higher than the softening temperature, but lower than the degradation temperature of the polymer. However, the temperature distribution is difficult to be measured by experimental tests since the most polymers (which are transparent to the laser radiation) are often opaque to the infrared wavelength. Thus, infrared analysis involving pyrometers and infrared camera is not suitable for this purpose. On the other hand, thermocouples are difficult to be placed at the interface without influencing the temperature conditions. In this paper, an integrated approach involving both experimental measurements and a Finite Element (FE) model were used to perform such an analysis.

The metal nanoparticles are characterized by XRD, electron microscopy (SEM, HRTEM) and XPS to determine their crystal structure, particles size, composition and morphology. The electrochemical measurements provide data concerning surface properties of the PdAu particles, including surface fraction of Pd and Au and the reactivity towards hydrogen sorption/desorption processes. The metal particles of low bulk Au-content (Au/Pd &lt;1) are of high monodispersity and of smaller size than their monometallic Pd and Au counterparts, synthesized by the same method. At higher bulk Au-content (Au/Pd &gt;1), the particle size increases approaching almost the size of Au particles. An enrichment of Pd toward the surface of all the Pd100-XAuX particles occurs, much pronounced in the samples H series. The activity of catalysts (based on the current densities, and TOF values) in the electrooxidation of formic acid (FA) is correlated with the bulk and surface composition of the Pd100-XAuX particles. The high monodispersity of the metal particle size in the studied catalysts made it possible to observe relation between FA electrooxidation activity and surface composition of the PdAu particles.

These technologies are based on an airborne power ultrasonic transducer (APUT) constituted by a pre-stressed Langevin-type transducer, a mechanical amplifier and an extensive plate radiator. In order to produce the desired effects in industrial processing, the transducer has to vibrate in an extensional mode driving an extensive radiator in the desired flexural mode with high amplitude displacements. Due to the generation of these high amplitude displacements in the radiator surfaces, non-linear effects like frequency shifts, hysteresis or modal interactions, among others, may be produced in the transducer behavior. When any nonlinear effect appears, when applying power, the stability and efficiency of this ultrasonic technology decreases, and the transducer may be damaged depending on the excitation power level and the nature of the nonlinearity.

The influences of hold current I on the dynamic characteristics and power losses of a HSV have been investigated through the finite-element methods (FEM). The simulation results show that as the driving current I decreases, the opening response characteristics of a HSV deteriorate, the proportion of different power losses decrease in different levels, the energy utilization efficiency of a HSV increases. In the energy distribution of a HSV, core loss accounts for the highest proportion, followed by solid loss and copper loss. Useless energy is mostly due to core loss.

This review seeks to find sustainability characteristics of the uses of rice husk ash from power plants. It also reviews how rice husk ash is produced from different power generation technologies. Characteristics of rice husk ash are affected by different factors such as sources, preparation methods and combustion technologies. Different forms of rice husk ash, amorphous and crystalline, suit different applications. Ash from moving grate technology is suggested for use as adsorbent while that from fluidized bed is suggested for use as filler in polymeric composites and in the synthesis of innovative ceramic compounds. The ash from suspension fired technology is suggested for use in the construction industry and zeolite production. In addition to technical viability, using rice husk ash to substitute conventional products helps gain both environmental and economic benefits. Despite claiming sustainable applications of rice husk ash, many research papers report only technical performances of the products. This paper draws out sustainability characteristics of different rice husk ash applications using the “triple bottom line” framework. Potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, cost saving and employment generation of rice husk ash use options have been investigated. Results from the review suggest that using the ash to replace charcoal is the most sustainable option when comparing with other alternatives such as Portland cement, commercial silica and lime. This option could help to reduce GHG up to 1005 kg CO2eq/t product, to save cost up to 8000 THB/t product, as well as to help generate employment for about 5 person-years/M THB spent in the sector. However, to make the sustainability assessment more comprehensive, other sustainability indicators such as fossil fuel depletion, human toxicity, ecotoxicity, particulate matter formation, total net profit (TNP), total value added (TVA), and incomes of workers are also needed to be considered in future research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Review; Rice husk ash; Sustainable; Thailand; Utilization","Charcoal; Construction industry; Cost reduction; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Portland cement; Reviews; Toxicity; Waste utilization; Particulate matter formations; Power generation technology; Rice husk ash; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable; Sustainable utilization; Thailand; Sustainable development",2-s2.0-85006789252

The power generation system is pinpointed as the mitigable key source of the unsustainability of the polyol ether production under the strict process constraints imposed by the energy transition.

Despite large differences in Tl levels of the waste materials (1–500 mg kg−1), generally small changes in ε205Tl values have been observed. However, isotopically lighter Tl was recorded in fly ash (ε205Tl ∼ −4.1) than in slag (ε205Tl ∼ −3.3), implying partial isotope fractionation during material processing. Thallium isotope compositions in the studied soils reflected the Tl contamination (ε205Tl ∼ −3.8), despite the fact that the major pollution period ended more than 30 years ago. Therefore, we assume that former industrial Tl inputs into soils, if significant, can potentially be traced using the isotope tracing method. We also suggest that the isotope redistributions occurred in some soil (subsurface) horizons, with Tl being isotopically heavier than the pollution source, due to specific sorption and/or precipitation processes, which complicates the discrimination of primary Tl. Thallium isotope analysis proved to be a promising tool to aid our understanding of Tl behavior within the smelting process, as well as its post-depositional dynamics in the environmental systems (soils). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fractionation; Isotopes; Soil; Thallium; Waste","Fly ash; Fractionation; Industrial wastes; Isotopes; Metallurgy; Pollution; Slags; Smelting; Soils; Thallium; Trace elements; Wastes; Zinc; Environmental systems; Isotope compositions; Isotope fractionation; Isotope tracing methods; Material processing; Metallurgical processing; Metallurgical waste; Precipitation process; Soil pollution; isotope; thallium; zinc; concentration (composition); contaminated land; industrial waste; isotopic composition; isotopic fractionation; metallurgy; mineral processing; pollutant source; precipitation (chemistry); sorption; thallium; trace metal; zinc; Article; controlled study; fractionation; industrial waste; isotope tracing; metallurgy; mining; precipitation; soil pollution",2-s2.0-85029603960

Specifically, two different housing materials are considered, one made of metal and the other made of acrylics. For the metal housing case, the PCM exhibits a melting front isolated both from the battery and housing wall with accelerated melting in the B∼C stage, accounting for the isothermal temperature plateau observed in both the numerical modeling and experimental measurements. For the acrylic housing case, the unmelted PCM instead adheres to the inner wall of housing all the way, melting at the rate slower than the metal housing case. In both housing cases, the numerically predicted liquid fractions are found to agree with our experimentally visualized results.

In this paper, a three-dimensional transient model is developed to investigate the weld bead profile transformation considering the keyhole and molten pool dynamic behaviors in high power laser welding. In the model, multiphase including the solid phase, liquid metal phase, metal vapor phase and air phase is considered. A variety of physical factors are taken into accounts such as melting and solidification, evaporation and condensation, fluid flow, Marangoni shear stress, recoil pressure and surface tension. An adaptive hybrid heat source model is used to fit well with evolution of the keyhole. Volume of fluid (VOF) method is adopted to track the multiphase interface. The weld bead profiles can be classified into three types and the welding process parameters are closely related to the weld bead profile transformation. The simulation results show that the fluid flow, temperature field and mechanical equilibrium in the molten pool are the essential factors that affect the weld bead profile transformation. The relationship among the welding process parameters, mechanical equilibrium, fluid flow and weld bead profile transformation is analyzed.

Starting with the review on thermoelectric generators, it shows that thermoelectric is gaining more attention since the past decade. Generally, the research conducted on the thermoelectric generators concentrate on the material development, mathematical and numerical model development as well as the application of thermoelectric generators. For this article, attention is given to the application research of the thermoelectric generators. From the survey conducted, most of the application research carried out is based on intermittent electrical power generation (e.g. the direct use of solar energy available or waste heat recovery). Hence, it opens an opportunity for the research on the application of thermoelectric generators by utilising a heat source that is continuously ready for thermal-electrical energy conversion, such as phase change material, geothermal heat or solar pond. In the later section, the review is continued by introducing solar pond, a facility that has been used as a supply of low-grade heat source at the remote area or industrial process heating. The research on the fundamentals of solar pond and its applications, but not limited to, the power generation has also been summarised. The ultimate idea of this review is to provide an insight that a thermal-storage based heat source (e.g. in this review, the solar pond) could be useful for small-scale electric power generation, despite its ordinary function as low-grade heat source provider via heat extraction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Power generation; Renewable energy; Solar energy; Solar pond; Thermoelectric",,2-s2.0-85027873931

The photovoltaic performances of the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl): indene-C60 bisadduct (P3HT: ICBA) were evaluated to elucidate the associated roles of SPAN(SH)@GNP NH (nanohybrid) buffer layer in the polymer solar cell (PSC) device architecture: ITO (Indium Tin Oxide)/SPAN(SH) or SPAN(SH)@GNP(X%) NH/Zinc Oxide (ZnO)/Al. The use of SPAN(SH)@GNP buffer layer significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the fabricated PSC. Notably, buffer layer containing 1.66 wt% of GNP with respect to the weight of SPAN(SH), (ITO/SPAN(SH)@GNP(1.66%)/P3HT: ICBA/ZnO/Al) exhibited an excellent improvement in the PCE (5.20%), which is much higher than that of the PCE (4.25%) with SPAN(SH) (ITO/SPAN(SH)/P3HT: ICBA/ZnO/Al). It has been demonstrated that the very strong near field of the GNP not only distributes laterally in the buffer layer but also vertically extends into the adjacent P3HT: ICBA (active) layer yielding an enhanced exciton generation in the active layer. The synergistic effects of energy level alignment, decreased interfacial resistance, effective hole extraction and increased surface area between the buffer/active layer, resulted in significant increase in the PCE. Our findings indicate that it is imperative to design the structure of the conducting polymer to have adequate interactions with the PNP for achieving strikingly enhanced PCE. © 2017","Conducting polymers; Solar cell; Sulfonated polyaniline","Buffer layers; Conducting polymers; Fiber optic sensors; Gold; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Polyaniline; Polymer solar cells; Solar power generation; Synthesis (chemical); Tin oxides; Energy level alignment; Interfacial resistances; ITO (indium-tin oxide); Photovoltaic performance; Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2 ,5-diyl); Power conversion efficiencies; Solar cell performance; Sulfonated polyaniline; Solar cells",2-s2.0-85028720951

The printing process is optimized into several directions using as an example binary mixtures of Zn2+ and Fe3+ salts as precursors. Firstly, temporary barrier layers from eicosane are printed to confine the spots to a particular region and to allow larger drop sizes without merging of neighboring droplets. Secondly, a glycerol droplet is printed before the application of metal salts to serve as a carrier liquid that is non-volatile at room temperature. The metal salt solutions are printed from ethylene glycol solutions into the carrier droplets. With these precautions, the drop remained as liquid phase on the substrate with their lateral position locked by the eicosane grid. This avoids problems with the early crystallization of metal salts between successive printing and ensured complete mixing of the precursor solution. The liquid drops are then thermally processed by temperature-programmed heating up to 600 °C allowing the sequential drying of the spots, evaporation of the grid structures and formation of ferrites. The same procedure is used to cover macroscopic electrodes with a large number of spots of identical composition to verify hits in laboratory photoelectrochemical cells and to use photocurrent transient and chopped light voltammetry for their further characterization. Structural characterization of the composition (Zn0.17Fe0.83Ox) with highest activity is performed by Raman and photoelectron spectroscopy.

Therefore, it is relevant to focus primarily on the reduction of losses. Dealing with underground cable systems, it is essential to properly select the conductor for the expected service in the grid, because the metal core determines the amount of losses during the lifespan of the power link. Based on the scenario of a typical French underground circuit, the paper presents the calculations of cable losses, and illustrates a method to assess the optimal economic conductor taking into account the entire life span of the system, leading also to the best environmental solution with minimised losses. The French TSO has been developing models and methodology over the last decade in order to perform LCA on transmission systems. Leading the Cigré Working Group B1.36 [8], RTE has contributed to establish in 2015 a methodology dedicated to LCA for underground cables. In addition, a case study was carried out. This significant work allows the transmission system operators to identify the main environmental impacts of underground cables, their sources, as well as improvement targets. Electricity losses are identified as responsible for the main impacts (climate change for instance), while the extraction and the manufacturing phase of the metal components represent the outlines of mineral depletion impact. To overcome those environmental issues, different alternatives have to be compared, both to reduce losses and the mineral depletion. The study field needs to be extended to a more global scope, in order to integrate the whole benefits of the grid.

With the aid of high definition camera and infrared camera, the phase and temperature fields of paraffin-foam and pure paraffin samples are captured to visualize the detailed melting phenomena. The local temperatures of both paraffin and copper foam matrix are measured by the thermocouples to study the thermal response characteristic and local thermal non-equilibrium effect. The experimental results reveal multiple pore-scale physical processes including the evolution of solid-liquid phase change interface, volume expansion of paraffin, motion of solid paraffin and release of air bubbles from paraffin. Under the combined influences of these physical processes, it shows that copper foam with a high porosity of 0.974 effectively extends the phase change interface and improves the thermal response rate of paraffin. As a result, the melting rate of paraffin has increased by more than two times, while the reduction in the amount of latent heat is only 2.6%. Moreover, significant effect of local thermal non-equilibrium between paraffin and copper foam is found during the melting process of paraffin-copper foam sample. Finally, through generalizing results from present experimental measurements, a correlation for dimensionless melting time of the paraffin-copper foam sample at pore scale is developed.

Cu/Al2O3 proved to be optimal among the monometallic examined. It was observed that even in the absence of H2, CO was effectively converted. Upon H2 presence, a fraction of oxygen is utilized for the latter, which results in the decrease of CO turnover. Cu–Mn/Al2O3 surpassed other single and mixed metal oxide catalysts which could be due to a combination of surface desorption capacity and redox properties. The oxygen storage capacities (OSC) were in the order of Cu–Mn/Al2O3 &gt; Cu–Ni/Al2O3 &gt; Cu/Al2O3 &gt; Mn/Al2O3 &gt; Ni/Al2O3, in an agreement with reactivity. The efficiency at low process temperatures was enhanced by adding H2O vapors, nonetheless, decreased at high-end range due to the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS). Also, the rate of CO conversion was high utilizing Cu–Mn/Al2O3; furthermore, even upon applying H2O and CO2.

Phase change materials (PCMs) have been studied due to their ability to absorb thermal energy with minimal temperature increase. This work investigates the performance of metallic PCMs (Fields’ metal (32.5Bi/51In/16.5Sn wt%) and 49Bi/18Pb/12Sn/21In wt%) acting as an integrated thermal buffer for high power 19 ms pulses. Two commercially available organic PCMs (PureTemp 29® and PureTemp 58®) and a dielectric gel (Sylgard 527®) were used for comparison. The studied materials were deposited directly in contact with the heat-dissipating surface of a custom micro-fabricated heater chip with an embedded resistance temperature detector (RTD) for in-situ temperature measurement. PCMs were subjected to 19 ms pulses and a maximum heat flux of 338 W/cm2 (relative to heat source area). The Bi/Pb/Sn/In PCM was able to reduce temperature rise during the pulse by 60 °C (63%) for 120 W and 81 °C (68%) for 160 W using the dielectric gel as baseline. In comparison the best performing organic PCM, PureTemp58, only reduced temperature rise by 16 °C (17%) and 17 °C (14%) for 120 W and 160 W, respectively.

However, the preparation of low-cost Pt-based catalysts with satisfactory catalytic performance still faces many challenges for its commercialization on large scale. Here, Pt catalysts assisted by carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are reported. The synergistic effect of carbon quantum dots and Pt metals is similar to a bi-component catalyst, such as PtRu. First, carbon quantum dots derived from Vulcan XC-72 carbon black are synthesized by mixed acid etching. Then, carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) is soaked in carbon quantum dots solution for several days to obtain carbon black modified by carbon quantum dots (XC-72-CQDs). Finally, Pt catalysts are supported on XC-72-CQDs (Pt/XC-72-CQDs) through a simple chemical reduction method. For methanol electro-oxidation reaction, the catalytic performance of Pt/XC-72-CQDs is compared with commercial PtRu/C (30% Pt + 15% Ru). Results show that a typical product (Pt/XC-72-CQDs5) exhibits a better catalytic activity than PtRu/C. In cyclic voltammetry test, the specific activity of Pt/XC-72-CQDs5 is 1.06 mA cm−2 Pt and 477.6 mA mg−1 Pt, while that of PtRu/C is 0.77 mA cm−2 Pt and 280.6 mA mg−1 Pt. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dots; Methanol oxidation; Platinum; Synergy; Water activation","Binary alloys; Carbon black; Catalyst activity; Catalyst supports; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Cyclic voltammetry; Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC); Electrooxidation; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Mergers and acquisitions; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Nanocrystals; Oxidation; Platinum; Ruthenium alloys; Semiconductor quantum dots; Carbon dots; Chemical reduction methods; Low operating temperature; Methanol electrooxidation; Methanol Oxidation; Portable power sources; Synergy; Water activation; Platinum metals",2-s2.0-85029351822

We use a cost method developed to allow for uncertainty in the input assumptions to analyse three demonstrated R2R compatible manufacturing sequences and two potential optimised sequences. Using these novel methods, we have identified and quantified key cost barriers; high cost materials P3HT and PCBM, the use of evaporation for the rear metal deposition, and the transparent ITO coating.

A potentially valuable recycling track may be represented by alkaline activation for the production of sustainable precast elements based on geopolymeric binders. In this work, three mineral admixtures, namely blast furnace slag, silica fume and metakaolin, were used to synthesize binary alkali activated binders whose major volumetric fraction was waste fly ash. Three curing temperatures (20, 40, 60 °C) were also considered. Early age kinetics and properties development were assessed by means of strength development and ultrasonic pulse velocity. Residual compressive strength after exposure at high temperature was also assessed in order to highlight typical geopolymeric thermal resistance which is generally observed for higher value raw materials. Furthermore, microstructural analysis was carried out by means of scanning electron microscopy.

Topography evolution of surface defects on these two types of metallic substrates was thoroughly investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was showed that root mean square roughness values (at 50 × 50 μm2 scanning scale) on both rough substrates reduced to ∼5 nm after coating with SDP-layer. The smoothing effect was mainly attributed to decrease of the depth at grain boundary grooving on the electro-polished metallic substrate.

The popular “egg box model” is referred to in the case of polyphenols-metal interaction. The unique feature of two consecutive chelation site per repeat that provides a favourable entropic contribution to the inter-chain association is produced by this model governed by electrostatic interactions.

UV–vis and Cyclic voltammetry confirmed the growth and band gap energies of the nanocomposite. NiO/MgO nanocomposite was found to be excellent photocatalysts for the degradation of methylene orange and methylene blue under the illumination of artificial light irradiation. The experiments demonstrated that MB in aqueous solution was more efficiently photo-degraded (87%) than MO (73%) using NiO/MgO nanocomposite as photocatalysts within 10 min of exposure.

A reliance on observational data to provide empirical evidence for the effects of different stressors on FA, in combination with increasing attempts to use FA in environmental research, underscore the need for careful examination of the relationships between environmental stress and FA. We experimentally tested the hypotheses that (i) heavy metal and drought stress increase the leaf FA in plants, and that (ii) plants persisting in heavily polluted sites possess greater stress tolerance and therefore show smaller increases in leaf FA in response to heavy metals than do plants from unpolluted sites. We collected mountain birch, Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii, seeds from eight polluted and ten unpolluted sites and reared the seedlings in a sophisticated greenhouse (phytotron). We compared leaf FA between control seedlings, seedlings irrigated with water containing copper and nickel sulphates, and seedlings exposed to drought. Leaf FA showed no response to either heavy metals or drought, despite significant impacts of these treatments on seedling height, leaf size and photosynthetic efficiency. This FA result was independent of the level of pollution at the site of seed origin and consistent for FA values based on low and high accuracy measurements of leaf width, as well as for FA values based on measurements of the widths and areas of leaf halves. Our findings add to accumulating evidence regarding inconsistent relationships between FA and abiotic stress, thereby questioning the indicatory value of FA. We strongly recommend that the use of FA as an indicator of environmental stress be limited to study systems for which the existence of cause-and-effect relationship between the stressing impact and the changes in FA is confirmed by controlled, blinded experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii; Bioindication; Blinded measurements; Heavy metal resistance; Research methodology","Drought; Greenhouses; Heavy metals; Pollution; Betula pubescens; Bioindication; Cause-and-effect relationships; Environmental researches; Heavy metal resistance; High-accuracy measurements; Photosynthetic efficiency; Research methodologies; Plants (botany); bioindicator; deciduous tree; drought stress; environmental stress; experimental study; fluctuating asymmetry; heavy metal; leaf; measurement method; morphology; pollution effect; Betula pubescens; Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa",2-s2.0-85029176958

Later on, the specific features of solvation of molecular species and added ions in these designer amphiphilically nanostructured solvents are systematically revised. These solutes are selectively placed in the nanodomains of the bulk solvent depending on their relative solvophobicity degree, which is the reason behind the versatility of these liquids for dissolving a huge amount of substances if appropriately tuned.

However, monometal oxides have a serious problem of rapid deactivation due to agglomeration between each particle after several redox cycles. In order to solve this problem, bimetal oxides based on Mn, which undergoes no deactivation, were synthesized. Mn-based bimetal oxygen carrier particles Fea-Mnb-Ox, Coa-Mnb-Ox, Nia-Mnb-Ox, and Cua-Mnb-Ox were synthesized by using a sol–gel method. The range of a and b in the particle label obtained in this study is 0.5–2.5, depending on the metal content added. The chemical and physical properties of the prepared particles were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), CH4-/CO-temperature programmed desorption, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The XRD results showed that the prepared particles comprised two- or three-phase mixed metal oxides. The Fe2.0-Mn1.0-Ox particle was in the phases of Fe2Mn1O4 and Fe20.16Mn11.84O48, respectively, and the Co2.0-Mn1.0-Ox particle had the phase of Co2Mn1O4.

After removing the adsorbed oxidative debris by base washing, the obtained BW-NS-rGONRs exhibited high electrical conductivity and rich defect active sites, endowing the BW-NS-rGONRs enhanced electrocatalytic activity for TNT reduction. The electrochemical sensing platform established from the BW-NS-rGONRs showed a highly sensitive and selective response to TNT with a wide linear range from 0.0008 to 5.1 ppm and a detection limit of 0.1 ppb. Moreover, the BW-NS-rGONRs-based TNT detection platform demonstrated good cyclic stability and reproducibility. Most importantly, the BW-NS-rGONRs-based sensing platform can be successfully used for TNT determination in tap water and lake water samples. The superb sensing performance is attributed to the abundant active sites from dual doping of N and S atoms, the enhanced electrical conductivity and full exposure of the active sites of BW-NS-rGONRs after base washing treatment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene; Catalyst; Electrochemical sensor; Graphene nanoribbon; Heteroatom doping; TNT","Carbon; Catalysts; Chemical detection; Debris; Doping (additives); Electric conductivity; Electrochemical sensors; Graphene; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanoribbons; Nitrogen; Sulfur; Washing; Yarn; 2 ,4 ,6-trinitrotoluene; Electrical conductivity; Electrocatalytic activity; ELectrochemical detection; Electrochemical sensing; Graphene nano-ribbon; Heteroatoms; High electrical conductivity; Explosives detection",2-s2.0-85031489562

Specimens of both gear geometries, which were made of tempered and nitrided alloyed steel, were tested on an FZG testing machine, and results confirmed the theoretical foundations of S-gears. Lastly, the rack profile is defined by a parabolic-type function, which in turn defines the path of contact and finally gears with arbitrary number of teeth. This concept is considered for polymer gears as well. A special testing machine was built to enable testing of small plastic involute (E-) and S-gears. Initial results combining gear pairs made of polyacetal and nylon confirm the theory of S-gears.

In the present study, two different morphologies of TiO2 (nanosphere and nanorod) with varying Zn and Mn co-doping were synthesized by solvothermal and hydrothermal methods to examine their photocatalytic efficiency by methylene blue degradation. The co-doped photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, Raman, FTIR and UV–vis DRS. Further, a comparison has been made with co-doped TiO2 nanospheres and TiO2 nanorods, where Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 nanorods show higher photocatalytic activity compared to nanospheres. This higher photocatalytic activity of co-doped TiO2 is attributed to its polymorphic phases, as they act as heterojunctions for TiO2. Further, being 1-D nanostructure, the TiO2 nanorods exhibit the straight diffusion path for charge carriers, which reduces the recombination possibilities.

This paper demonstrates a path for further power scaling that is based on broad stripes with fewer than 15 cascades. Although the confinement factor Γ for this design approach is lower than for designs with 30 to 40 cascades, the ability to efficiently extract heat from the top and bottom of the lasers more than offsets the Γ disadvantage.

Coal-fired power plants are one of the main sources of electrical energy due to the low cost of coal compared to other fossil fuels. However, one of the major problems of the coal-fired power plant is the exhaust emission of fine particulate matter. Most of the coal power plants and other process industries generally use electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) because of their effectiveness and reliability in controlling particulate matter. The dust particles from the flue gas are separated using flow dynamics and an electrical force induced by the ESP. Baffles and plates are used to obstruct the flue gas flow and to increase residence time to force particle deposition. ESPs are the most reliable control devices to capture the fine particles and their efficiency is also high. However, the precipitator has some serious limitations when capturing smaller size dust particles, especially those less than 2.5 micron. Another drawback is the collection of dust from low-temperature flue gas. In this chapter, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of flow distribution inside the ESP has been discussed which can be useful for collecting smaller particles regardless of operating temperature. A case study is presented showing a wide variety of flow simulation by inserting different shapes of baffles inside the ESP and their effect on particle collection. The collection efficiency of the particles affected by different flow distributions and the possible modifications in the existing ESPs used in the power plants are also discussed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Collection efficiency; Computational fluid dynamics (CFD); Electrostatic precipitator (ESP); Flow distribution",,2-s2.0-85030671762

The principal drawback preventing its commercial application lies in its limited absorption of the visible light (400–700 nm), while it is active under UV irradiation (≤387 nm). Supporting noble metals in the form of nanoparticles on TiO2 increases its activity in the visible range. However, both the synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles and their deposition on TiO2 are multi-step processes that often require organic solvents. Here, we deposit Ag nanoparticles from AgNO3 on the surface of micrometric TiO2 with H2O as a solvent and under ultrasound irradiation at 30 W cm−2. Ultrasound increases the surface amount of Ag on TiO2 with heterogeneous size distribution of Ag nanoparticles, which are bigger and overlaid (1–20 nm vs. 0.5–3 nm) compared to the sample obtained in traditional conditions (TEM images).

Consequently, there is a need to better understand management approaches that deliver multiple ecosystem services from agricultural land. There is global interest in sustainable soil management including the re-evaluation of existing management practices. Liming is a long established practice to ameliorate acidic soils and many liming-induced changes are well understood. For instance, short-term liming impacts are detected on soil biota and in soil biological processes (such as in N cycling where liming can increase N availability for plant uptake). The impacts of liming on soil carbon storage are variable and strongly relate to soil type, land use, climate and multiple management factors. Liming influences all elements in soils and as such there are numerous simultaneous changes to soil processes which in turn affect the plant nutrient uptake; two examples of positive impact for crops are increased P availability and decreased uptake of toxic heavy metals. Soil physical conditions are at least maintained or improved by liming, but the time taken to detect change varies significantly. Arable crops differ in their sensitivity to soil pH and for most crops there is a positive yield response. Liming also introduces implications for the development of different crop diseases and liming management is adjusted according to crop type within a given rotation. Repeated lime applications tend to improve grassland biomass production, although grassland response is variable and indirect as it relates to changes in nutrient availability. Other indicators of liming response in grassland are detected in mineral content and herbage quality which have implications for livestock-based production systems. Ecological studies have shown positive impacts of liming on biodiversity; such as increased earthworm abundance that provides habitat for wading birds in upland grasslands. Finally, understanding of liming impacts on soil and crop processes are explored together with functional aspects (in terms of ecosystems services) in a new qualitative framework that includes consideration of how liming impacts change with time. This holistic approach provides insights into the far-reaching impacts that liming has on ecosystems and the potential for liming to enhance the multiple benefits from agriculturally managed land. Recommendations are given for future research on the impact of liming and the implications for ecosystem services. © 2017","Agriculture; Crop response; Ecosystem services; Soil acidity; Soil management","Agriculture; Agronomy; Biodiversity; Carbon; Crops; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Food supply; Forestry; Heavy metals; Land use; Nutrients; Crop response; Ecosystem services; Nutrient availability; Plant nutrient uptake; Soil acidity; Soil management; Soil physical conditions; Sustainable soil management; Soils; boron; calcium; chlorine; heavy metal; iron; magnesium; manganese; molybdenum; nickel; phosphorus; potassium; sulfur; trace element; zinc; acidity; agricultural land; biodiversity; crop; ecosystem service; liming; management practice; soil fertility; soil management; adsorption; agricultural land; air quality; biomass production; carbon storage; crop improvement; denitrification; ecosystem; environmental impact; food security; grassland; harvest; herbage; land use; nitrate leaching; nitrification; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen mineralization; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant growth; priority journal; Review; soil acidity; soil degradation; soil liming; soil management; tillage; United Kingdom; water quality; United Kingdom; Aves",2-s2.0-85028732205

In this paper, we propose a bilayer heterojunction solar cell comprised of a perovskite layer combining with a IV-VI group semiconductor layer, which can give a conversion efficiency even higher than the conventional perovskite solar cell. Such a scheme uses a property that the semiconductor layer with a direct band gap can be better in absorption of long wavelength light and is complementary to the perovskite layer. We studied the semiconducting layers such as GeSe, SnSe, GeS, and SnS, respectively, and found that GeSe is the best, where the optical absorption efficiency in the perovskite/GeSe solar cell is dramatically increased. It turns out that the short circuit current density is enhanced 100% and the power conversion efficiency is promoted 42.7% (to a high value of 23.77%) larger than that in a solar cell with only single perovskite layer. The power conversion efficiency can be further promoted so long as the fill factor and open-circuit voltage are improved.

Here, we present TiO2-based highly efficient ultraviolet (UV) photodetection by achieving its nanocrystal assembled film having high surface defects. The sol-gel derived TiO2 films have been subjected to a post-growth annealing at 500 °C in air (SA) and vacuum (SB) and one subjected to UV treatment (SC) to tune the surface defects. The UV photoresponse results show that the nanocrystal assembled UV cured TiO2 film shows as high as 1.7 × 103 UV-to-visible rejection ratio and photo-to-dark current ratio of 1.2 × 104 under 10 V bias and 10 μW incident light power. Most interestingly, unprecedently high photo-to-dark current ratio of the order of ∼104 at as low as 1 V bias condition and only 10 μW incident light without device fabrication has been observed. Moreover, the films show stable response cyclibility under UV radiation.

The changes in corrosion forms were arranged on a water quality region map. Passivity was maintained by adding 3.7 × 10−2 M or more of Na2B10O16 to artificial seawater with a dilution ratio of 100-fold or more.

Indeed, oxygen may dope the phase by entering in its structure or generate secondary oxide phases which may improve or decrease the global figure of merit of the sample. In this study, an ab initio method is used to predict the behavior of the NiTiSn phase in the presence of oxygen. For that, the thermodynamic database containing enthalpies of formation at 0 K of the intermediate phases of the Ni-O-Sn-Ti system is calculated. This base will allow us to predict multiphased regions as a function of the composition of an alloy. The enthalpy of formation of the NiTiSn phases containing oxygen atoms is then compared to the enthalpy of formation of the multiphased regions with the same composition. Using this methodology, thermodynamics can predict if oxygen will enter the structure or if a multiphased alloy is thermodynamically more favorable. Results show that oxygen will decompose the NiTiSn half-Heusler into titanium oxide and nickel stannides. On the basis of the literature review, it seems that the presence of metallic titanium oxides will decrease the Seebeck coefficient and the thermal conductivity but will highly improve the electrical conductivity.

Meanwhile, for WLMF heating method, temperature uniformity of a heated lithium-ion battery cell is also acceptable by decreasing heating power, thickness of a lithium-ion battery cell or increasing stand time after heating. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Heating method; Lithium-ion battery; Temperature uniformity; Transient heating model","Battery management systems; Electric batteries; Finite element method; Heating; Ions; Lithium; Secondary batteries; Temperature distribution; Battery thermal managements; Discharge performance; Environment temperature; Heating method; Heating power; Low temperatures; Temperature uniformity; Transient heating; Lithium-ion batteries",2-s2.0-85030869946

However, provided a metal-complex with sufficient stability, soft ionization techniques such as electrospray offer a means to quantify and probe the characteristics of such systems using mass spectrometry. Unfortunately, the gas-phase species observed in ESI-MS systems do not always reflect the solution phase distributions due to the inherent electrochemical mechanism of the electrospray process, ion transfer from ambient to low pressures conditions, and other factors that are related to droplet evaporation. Even for simple systems (e.g. hydrated cations), it is not always clear whether the distribution observed reflects the solution phase populations or whether it is simply a result of the ionization process. This complexity is further compounded in mixed solvent systems and when multiply charged species are present. Despite these challenges, the benefits of mass spectrometry with respect to speed, sensitivity, and the ability to resolve isotopes continue to drive efforts to develop techniques for the speciation of metal complexes. Using an electrospray ionization atmospheric pressure ion mobility mass spectrometer (ESI-apIMS-MS), we demonstrate an approach to stabilize simple uranyl complexes during the ionization process and mobility separation to aid speciation and isotope profile analysis. Specifically, we outline and demonstrate the capacity of ESI-apIMS-MS methods to measure mobilities of different uranyl species, in simple mixtures, by promoting stable gas phase conformations with the addition of sulfoxides (i.e. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dibutyl sulfoxide (DBSO), and methyl phenyl sulfoxide (MPSO)). Addition of these sulfoxides, as observed in the mass spectrum and mobility domain, produce stable gas-phase conformations that enable the observation of the counter anion pair while minimizing the range of ligand exchange events as the ionized complex enters the gas-phase. Other enhancements include improved data acquisition times by applying multiplexing approaches to the IMS Bradbury-Nielsen (BN) gate to realize increased ion transmission and improve ion statistics measured at the m/z detector. Analyte identification using this approach is based on a multitude of combined measured gas-phase ion metrics, which include mass measurements, isotope profiling, and experimentally determined reduced mobilities measured at the low-field limit (<2 E/N). Though geared initially towards uranyl complexes, this approach may find application in fields where both chemical speciation and isotopic profiles provide diagnostic information for a given metal. © 2017","Chemical-speciation; Electrospray ionization; Ion mobility-mass spectrometry; Uranium speciation","Atmospheric ionization; Atmospheric pressure; Chemical speciation; Conformations; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Dimethyl sulfoxide; Electrospray ionization; Gas dynamics; Gases; Ionization; Ionization of gases; Ions; Isotopes; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Metal complexes; Organic solvents; Population distribution; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Uranium; Uranium compounds; Analyte identifications; Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Electrochemical mechanisms; Gas phase conformations; Ion mobility-mass spectrometry; Mixed-solvent systems; Spectroscopic technique; Traditional approaches; Ion mobility spectrometers",2-s2.0-85029381106

These arise mainly in the off-gas from sintering plant, yet also other operations, such as continuous casting, and hot and cold rolling could generate albeit minor amounts of dioxins. In this contribution it is verified in how far the incineration of hot rolling sludge (HRS) could contribute to such emissions and, if so, how these could be suppressed at low cost. Spent anion exchange resin (SAER) appeared as a dioxins suppressant during combustion tests of hot rolling sludge in a bench-scale tubular furnace. The reduction efficiency (RE) of PCDD/F and I-TEQ-generation attained 91.1% and 90.2%, respectively, with the addition of 2.5 wt.% resin, and the highest dioxins RE reached 97.8% with 10 wt.% resin addition. The PCDD/PCDF ratio raised markedly when adding resin, indicating stronger suppression for PCDF- than for PCDD-formation. However, further research is still needed to establish the effect of resin on PCDD/F formation and inhibition during full-scale experiments. The off-gas released by sludge and resin co-combustion was also monitored and the residue analysed by Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS); the results revealed that the SO2 concentration in the off-gas was higher during co-combustion than when burning HRS only. Likewise, the sulphur content in the combustion residue rises with resin addition. Still, the suggestion that suppression of PCDD/F formation should be ascribed to the poisoning of catalytic metal by S-containing compounds seems to be invalidated by the high initial S/Cl-ratio of HRS, even before SAER addition. These surprising findings were further analysed by a scrutiny of fingerprints obtained at the five distinct dosages tested. The relative amount of 2,3,7,8-PCDD/F was remarkably depressed by inhibitor addition and the relative importance of the chlorophenols route strongly expanded. Several reaction schemes, showing the results of further signature analysis are presented and are expected to throw more light on the mechanism of formation and its suppression. © 2017","Hot rolling sludge; Inhibition; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF); SO2; Spent anion exchange resin","Actinides; Cold rolling; Combustion; Continuous casting; Enzyme inhibition; Heating furnaces; Incineration; Ion exchange resins; Ions; Organic pollutants; Sintering; Spectrometers; Steelmaking; Anion exchange resins; Combustion residues; Dibenzofurans; Energy dispersive spectrometers; Full-scale experiment; Mechanism of formation; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins; Reduction efficiency; Hot rolling; ammonia; anion exchange resin; chloride; chlorophenol; dioxin; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; resin; sulfur; catalysis; chlorophenol; combustion; dioxin; efficiency measurement; experimental study; incineration; industrial emission; ion exchange; iron and steel industry; PCDD; PCDF; reduction; resin; sludge; sulfur compound; sulfur dioxide; Article; catalysis; combustion; concentration process; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; exhaust gas; finger dermatoglyphics; hazardous waste; heavy metal poisoning; hot rolling sludge; incineration; industrial sludge; nonhuman; reaction analysis; sludge",2-s2.0-85029719091

In 2013, China signed the Minamata Convention affirming that mercury emissions should be controlled more strictly. Therefore, an evaluation of the costs associated with atmospheric mercury emission reductions from China's coal combustion is essential. In this study, we estimated mercury abatement costs for coal combustion in China for 2010, based on a provincial technology-based mercury emission inventory. In addition, four scenarios were used to project abatement costs for 2020. Our results indicate that actual mercury emission related to coal combustion in 2010 was 300.8 Mg, indicating a reduction amount of 174.7 Mg. Under a policy-controlled scenario for 2020, approximately 49% of this mercury could be removed using air pollution control devices, making mercury emissions in 2020 equal to or lower than in 2010. The total abatement cost associated with mercury emissions in 2010 was 50.2 × 109 RMB. In contrast, the total abatement costs for 2020 under baseline versus policy-controlled scenarios, having high-energy and low-energy consumption, would be 32.0 × 109 versus 51.2 × 109, and 27.4 × 109 versus 43.9 × 109 RMB, respectively. The main expense is associated with flue gas desulfurization. The unit abatement cost of mercury emissions in 2010 was 288 × 103 RMB/(kg Hg). The unit abatement costs projected for 2020 under a baseline, a policy-controlled, and an United Nations Environmental Programme scenario would be 143 × 103, 172 × 103 and 1066 × 103 RMB/(kg Hg), respectively. These results are much lower than other international ones. However, the relative costs to China in terms of GPD are higher than in most developed countries. We calculated that abatement costs related to mercury emissions accounted for about 0.14% of the GDP of China in 2010, but would be between 0.03% and 0.06% in 2020. This decrease in abatement costs in terms of GDP suggests that various policy-controlled scenarios would be viable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Abatement cost; Air pollution control device (APCD); China; Mercury emission reduction; Monte Carlo simulation","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air pollution control equipment; Coal; Cost reduction; Costs; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Intelligent systems; Mercury (metal); Monte Carlo methods; Pollution; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; Abatement costs; Air pollution control devices; Anthropogenic mercury emissions; China; Flue gas desulfurization; Mercury emission inventories; Mercury emissions; United nations environmental programme; Coal combustion",2-s2.0-85027549352

In nature, plants, fungi, and microorganisms release exudates, which can alter the physical and chemical properties of soil minerals including asbestos minerals. We examined whether exudates from bacteria and fungi at environmentally relevant concentrations can alter chrysotile, the most widely used asbestos mineral, and lower its toxicity. We monitored the release of iron from chrysotile in the presence of organic acid ligands and iron-specific siderophores derived from bacteria and fungi and measured any change in fiber toxicity toward peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice. Both fungal and bacterial siderophores increased the removal of iron from asbestos fibers. In contrast, organic acid ligands at environmentally relevant concentrations neither released iron from fibers nor helped in siderophore-mediated iron removal. Removal of plant-available or exchangeable iron did not diminish iron dissolution by both types of siderophores, which indicates that siderophores can effectively remove structural iron from chrysotile fibers. Removal of iron by siderophore lowered the fiber toxicity; fungal siderophore appears to be more effective than bacterial siderophore in lowering the toxicity. These results indicate that prolonged exposure to siderophores, not organic acids, in the soil environment decreases asbestos fiber toxicity and possibly lowers the health risks.

Mg-MOF-74 is a distinguished adsorbent amongst porous materials owing to its high CO2 uptake under flue gas conditions. In this study, a vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) process composed of five steps (pressurization, feed, rinse, blowdown, and purge) for separating CO2 from a CO2/N2 mixture using Mg-MOF-74 was mathematically modeled. Two- and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were developed using a user-defined-function (UDF, written in C) linked to the ANSYS Fluent program. The models have been validated against published pressure swing adsorption experimental data. The regeneration (blowdown and purge) time has been tuned to explore the performance improvement for the VPSA process.

It greatly promotes the research and development of thermal dissipation materials. Due to its extremely high in-plane thermal conductivity, graphene have shown great potential in thermal management. In this work, a subtle “molecular welding” strategy was realized for the fabrication of flexible, ultrathin, but highly conductive graphitized-graphene/polyimide (g-GO/PI) hybrid films. PI was applied as a solder to weld the micron-sized graphene platelets up through the covalent bonding and to fill up the voids between the graphene layers. This is believed as the key to the considerable enhancement of the in-plane thermal conductivity of g-GO/PI hybrid films. It was worth noting that an enhancement of 21.9% in the in-plane thermal conductivity was achieved for the “molecular welded” g-GO/PI hybrid film as compared to the pristine g-GO film.

High energy supply is required especially in the developing countries to sustain the lifestyle due to the growth in the world's population and techno-economic city. In fact, the sources of fossil fuel-based energy are limited and the use of fossil fuels can lead to the environmental pollution problem. Accordingly, the combustion of fossil fuels sources will give rise to the global warming issue, i.e., the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide resulting in erratic weather patterns, such as floods, draughts, etc. In the last two decades, solar photovoltaic cells have been used as the alternatives to generate renewable, sustainable and green energy. High dye absorption rates, efficient charge separation of exciton, and free charge carrier formation as well as large area production at low costs contribute to the emerging photovoltaic technologies. Generally, the materials involved in photoanode section (acting as the platform for the electron collection) are the main key to produce high-efficiency photovoltaic cells. Currently, multijunction based solar panels showed the highest performance of 40% efficiency as compared to that of the conventional Si based solar panels with 22–27% efficiency. Apart of that, DSSCs sensitized by the silyl-anchor and carboxy-anchor dyes have attained the highest efficiency of 14%. In recent years, the metal doping or binary oxide photo-catalyst systems, particularly graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites, have attracted much attention due to their extraordinary characteristics, i.e., (i) photocatalyst activity enhancement, and (ii) accelerated electron mobility to reduce the charge recombination. The high efficiency of the graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites in DSSCs’ reaction basically requires a suitable architecture that minimizes electron loss during excitation state and maximizes photon absorption. In order to further improve the immigration of photo-induced charge carriers during excitation state, considerable efforts have to be exerted to further improve the charge mobility and maximize the dye loading. It has also been reported that the properties of graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites primarily depend on the nature of the preparation method, and the role of optimum dopants content incorporated into the graphene photoanode to improve the dye molecules loading and minimize the charge recombination. Therefore, we review recent achievements for different nanoarchitecture of TiO2, as well as graphene-TiO2 composite nanostructured based photoanode in DSSCs performance with future prospects and challenges.

Substituent at the N3-position prevented the degradation of imidazolium, and bulky and rigid adamantyl substituent was the most effective. The 1-adamantyl-2-methyl-3-ethylimidazolium cation (AdMEIm) exhibited the highest alkaline stability among the six cationic ions, which is stable under 5 M NaOH aqueous solution at 80 °C for 168 h.

However, the precise control on sodium content as well as the incorporation mechanisms is yet comprehensively understood. We propose a facile wet chemistry oxidation approach for large area homogeneous Mo oxidation and allow for uniform sodium incorporation in a controllable manner. Eventually the oxidized Mo substrate in an optimal condition leads to a relative increase of 8% of conversion efficiency in the final solar device compared with the non-oxidized sample. We thoroughly examine the surface chemistry of the Mo substrate with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after a systematic H2O2 oxidation treatment. A qualitative analysis show that the predominant Mo trioxides as a reservoir can adjust alkali elements contents in Cu(in,Ga)Se2 films. Upon oxidation, the narrowing down of Mo grain boundaries has now suppressed the over sufficient sodium incorporation compared to uncontrolled diffusion from soda lime glass. Also, the emergence of potassium element in the thin film improves the electrical properties. Thermodynamic calculation indicate that the K2MoO4 as an intermediate from K2O and MoO3 reaction is a preferable reaction path compared the Na2O reaction and thus enhanced potassium ion diffusion.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements show that the (NH4)6Mo7O24 molecule decomposes and forms the molybdenum oxide (MoOX) molecule when undergoing thermal annealing treatment. In this study, PSCs with the MoOX layer as the HEL exhibited better photovoltaic performance, especially under weak light illumination intensity (from 100 to 10 mW cm−2) compared to poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)-based PSCs.

The model parameters are known to vary according to the operating conditions, such as the battery state of charge (SOC). Therefore, online recursive ECM parameter estimation is one means that may help to improve the modelling accuracy. Because a battery system consists of both fast and slow dynamics, the classical least squares (LS) method, that estimates together all the model parameters, is known to suffer from numerical problems and poor accuracy. The aim of this paper is to overcome this problem by proposing a new decoupled weighted recursive least squares (DWRLS) method, which estimates separately the parameters of the battery fast and slow dynamics. Battery SOC estimation is also achieved based on the parameter estimation results. This circumvents an additional full-order observer for SOC estimation, leading to a reduced complexity. An extensive simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed method against the LS technique. Experimental data are collected using a Li ion cell.

A molecular marker-based chemical mass balance (MM-CMB) model was applied to estimate the relative contributions from the following primary sources to the organic carbon (OC) component of PM: mobile sources (combined gasoline and diesel vehicles), wood smoke, vegetative detritus, road dust and ship emissions. A source profile of aircraft emissions was not included in the model; however its contribution was estimated from un-apportioned primary OC in the MM-CMB model (“other OC”) after accounting for the contribution of secondary organic carbon (SOC) to OC.

To further reduce costs, a new technology called intense pulsed light is being implemented to eliminate expensive high energy thermal processes and encourage higher throughput. The technology also includes opportunities for devices that contain thermally limited materials. The technique was originally explored when the photovoltaic industry was quite small, and has only recently begun to gather interest as the printed electronics industry realized gains. This review discusses the use of intense pulsed light in photovoltaic manufacturing, detailing the process from a photonic physics perspective, the relevant heat transfer mechanisms, as well as its impact on the major photovoltaic sectors. Demonstrations of generation 1: crystalline silicon solar cells, generation 2: thin film solar cells, and emerging technologies: hybrid organic solar cell applications are discussed.

As government incentives are reduced or withdrawn the incorporation of battery storage, to lower building electricity grid imports through increased on-site PV self-consumption, is an option to sustain rooftop PV uptake. This study combines a life cycle assessment approach and discounted cash flow analysis to assess the CO2 and financial impact of adding battery storage to a PV assemblage in the context of future incentive withdrawal, electricity system decarbonisation and changing technology costs. An example non-domestic building in the UK with a 20 kW mono-crystalline silicon PV and lithium-ion battery storage is modelled. With electricity grid decarbonisation in line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the PV and battery system here reduces the building's CO2 emissions by 17% (19tCO2) compared with the grid-only reference over a 30year lifetime. The analysis also highlights that adding battery storage does not necessarily increase C02 savings achieved by PV alone for the building, if grid decarbonisation is considered. PV systems without batteries in the UK are however found to be viable in 2020 without government incentives. For system considered here the battery costs of &lt;£334/kWh available capacity are needed in 2020 for batteries to positively affect the financial performance of PV. The study therefore concludes that UK battery costs have to continue to reduce rapidly, or additional revenue from providing electricity system services is needed to make batteries financially attractive in lower insolation areas like the UK. Policy to reduce electricity system CO2 through building integrated battery uptake requires better understanding of the net system CO2 impact in line with other changes in electricity generation and demand. © 2017 The Authors","Battery storage; Financial analysis; Life cycle assessment; Organisational barriers; PV","Buildings; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Finance; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Monocrystalline silicon; Battery storage; Climate Change Agreements; Electricity generation; Financial analysis; Financial performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Non-domestic buildings; Organisational; Lithium-ion batteries",2-s2.0-85029684769

As long as the molar ratios of thiourea to cadmium sulfide ([TU]/[CdSO4] molar ratios) were below 50, dense CdS films formed on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers. Upon elevating the [TU]/[CdSO4] molar ratios, a large number of CdS particles precipitated in the bulk solutions, leading to the formation of holes on CdS films and a reduction in the film thickness. These phenomena imply that elevating the concentration of thiourea facilitates homogeneous nucleation and suppresses the growth of CdS films.

The investigation confirms that Ba2ZnSe3 possesses large birefringence, considerable anisotropy in the optical response, and the absorption edge occurs in the visible region. The estimated optical band gap of Ba2ZnSe3 is about 2.70 eV, and the EPc and EPv are about −0.145 V(vs.NHE) and +2.605 V (vs.NHE), respectively. Thus, Ba2ZnSe3 possesses a high negative reduction potential of excited electrons due to its higher CB position, and hence, the location of the CBM and VBM accommodates the redox capacity. Thus, the Ba2ZnSe3 photocatalyst is expected to exhibit superior activity in visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution. The electronic band structure shows high k-dispersion bands around the Fermi level, which implies low effective masses and, hence, the high mobility carriers enhance the charge transfer process. It was found that Ba2ZnSe3 possesses a great effective mass difference between electron (e−) and hole (h+), which can facilitate the e− and h+ migration and separation, and finally improve the photocatalytic performance. The observed large mobility difference in Ba2ZnSe3 is useful to the separation of e− and h+, reduction of the e− and h+ recombination rate, and improvement of the photocatalytic activity. Thus, Ba2ZnSe3 could be a good photocatalyst due to rapid generation of e−– h+ pairs with photoexcitation, and a high negative reduction potential of excited electrons due to its higher CB position. The excellent photocatalytic performance of Ba2ZnSe3 is due to hyperpolarizablity formed by ZnO4 tetrahedra and co-parallel BaSe7 polyhedra groups, and the layer structure favors the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance. The presence of the distorted (ZnO4)4− tetrahedral causes to increase the efficiency of the photocatalytic performance almost to double in comparison to other chalcogenide crystals. Based on these results, one can conclude that Ba2ZnSe3 satisfies all requirements to be an efficient photocatalyst.

Surface modification is of crucial importance to the surface properties of aluminum and its alloys since high coefficient of friction, wear characteristics and low hardness have limited their long term performance. Laser surface alloying is one of the most effective methods of producing proper microstructure by means of non-equilibrium solidification which results from rapid heating and cooling. In this paper, the influence of different processing parameters, such as laser power and scanning velocity is discussed. The developments of various material systems including ceramics, metals or alloys, and metal matrix composites (MMCs) are reviewed.

For the chemical characterization, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of phenolic components in the methanol extracts was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-UV-ESI-MSn). Total phenolic, flavonoid and phenolic acid contents were also studied. Concerning the biological effects, antioxidant (DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging; ferric (FRAP) and cupric (CUPRAC) reducing power; phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelating assays), enzyme inhibitory (cholinesterase, tyrosinase, amylase, glucosidase, lipase, and elastase) and cytotoxic effects (A-549 and MCF-7 cell lines) were evaluated.

Optimal welding parameters were defined based on experiments using orthogonal arrays design to ensure highest relative independence of the upper and lower fusion zones (FZ). Balance of ferrite and austenite was found to be completely disrupted. To counterbalance excess α-ferrite formed in the lower fusion zone, laser-Metal Inert Gas (MIG) tandem welding was introduced for butt welding of 2205/X65 bimetallic sheets. Microstructures and corrosion properties of welded joints were investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and potentiodynamic tests. Metallographic observations indicated that MIG arc followed the rear of laser beam reheated the laser weld in the front. This resulted in increased austenite nucleation and growth in the FZ region of the flyer layer. Thermal power of MIG arc and laser arc distance were important factors, which affected grain size and alloy element content in ferrite and austenite.

The receiver of the collector is fabricated enveloping a metal absorber tube using an evacuated glass tube. Depending on the level of evacuation, the glass envelope reduces the convection heat loss from the tube almost to zero. However, sometimes the envelopes are broken, damaged or removed that causes potential convection loss from an open-to-air receiver tube. On the other hand, the solar irradiance profile around the receiver tube is likely to be highly nonuniform. In order to study the heat transfer mechanism of an exposed receiver tube of a standard PTC under the actual optical and environmental conditions, a 3-dimensional Computational Conjugate Heat Transfer (CCHT) model of the receiver tube was developed. The CCHT model was developed applying finite volume technique of computational fluid dynamics integrating with a verified Monte Carlo ray tracing optical model. The CCHT model was verified extensively, and different heat loss models were developed to investigate the heat loss characteristics. The convection heat loss from the outer surface of the receiver tube was observed very high as it was exposed to a high-temperature gradient with its surroundings. Therefore, it is obvious that the receiver tube should be enveloped and evacuated properly.

The phase analysis of microstructure on sealing layer was investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy spectrum analysis (EDS) to study the formation mechanism of sealing pores. The influence of laser power and welding rate on sealing edge porosity was researched. The results show that the sealing layer has evenly distributed bilayer structure of wetting layer with few pores caused by the residual gases between the solder particles (external) –melting layer with a large number of mutually disconnected isolated pores (inside). As the increase of laser power, the interface layer is compact and smooth and the pores decline in numbers. When the power exceeds a certain value, the interface becomes unsmooth with the increasing number of pores. The phenomenon of surface defects and blocky structures is generated with lower welding speed and greater energy output. On the other hand, the blocky structures, unmelted solders, pores and cracks are formed by the higher welding speed and smaller energy output. Therefore, the pore defect can be effectively avoided and reduced by the reasonable control of laser power and welding rate. © 2017","Laser brazing; Pores; Sealing edge; Vacuum glazing; Wetting layer","Brazing; Glazes; Scanning electron microscopy; Soldering alloys; Spectrum analysis; Surface defects; Welding; Wetting; Bi-layer structure; Energy spectrum analysis; Formation mechanism; Laser brazing; Pores; Solder particles; Vacuum glazing; Wetting layer; Vacuum brazing",2-s2.0-85031125489

However, it is found that most of nanomaterials-based SAs cannot stably generate gain-guide solitons in positive group-dispersion fiber lasers, which is urgently expected to fully understand the inherent reasons. In this paper, we numerically and experimentally investigate the effects of nanomaterial saturable absorption (e.g. modulation depth and saturation optical power) on gain-guide soliton in positive group-dispersion Er3+-doped fiber laser (PGD-EDFL). By numerically solving the Ginzburg–Landau equation, the evolutions of both the mode-locked optical spectrum and pulse duration as a function of modulation depth and saturation optical power are analyzed, respectively. In experiment, we firstly prepare five nanomaterial SAs with the similar insertion loss, which have the different modulation depth from 1.80% to 23.36%, and the different saturation optical power from 8.8 to 536 W. We then perform the experimental comparison by incorporating the five SAs in a same PGD-EDFL cavity, respectively. The experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical ones. Our result reveals that: (1) a low modulation depth cannot support the formation of gain-guide soliton, (2) as the modulation depth increases, the spectral bandwidth of gain-guide soliton increases, the pulse duration decreases and the pulse chirp becomes large, (3) the saturation optical power has the weak influences on the gain-guide soliton performances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fiber lasers; Gain-guide soliton; Mode-locked lasers; Nanomaterials","Fiber lasers; Fibers; Modulation; Nanostructured materials; Passive mode locking; Saturable absorbers; Semiconductor quantum wells; Solitons; Experimental comparison; Ginzburg-Landau equations; Group dispersions; Mode-locked laser; Modulation depth; Passively mode-locked fiber lasers; Saturable absorption; Spectral bandwidth; Mode-locked fiber lasers",2-s2.0-85019921465

Here, copper isotope fractionation by a mature phototrophic biofilm during Cu surface adsorption and incorporation was studied in batch reactor (BR) and open drip flow reactor (DFR) systems at ambient conditions. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (both Near Edge Structure, XANES, and Extended Fine Structure, EXAFS) at Cu K-edge of the biofilm after its interaction with Cu in BR experiments allowed characterizing the molecular structure of assimilated Cu and quantifying the degree of CuII to CuI reduction linked to Cu assimilation. For both BR and DFR experiments, Cu adsorption caused enrichment in heavy isotope at the surface of the biofilm relative to the aqueous solution, with an apparent enrichment factor for the adsorption process, ε65Cuads, of +1.1 ± 0.3‰. In contrast, the isotope enrichment factor during copper incorporation into the biofilm (ε65Cuinc) was highly variable, ranging from −0.6 to +0.8‰. This variability of the ε65Cuinc value was likely controlled by Cu cellular uptake via different transport pathways resulting in contrasting fractionation. Specifically, the CuII storage induced enrichment in heavy isotope, whereas the toxicity response of the biofilm to Cu exposure resulted in reduction of CuII to CuI, thus yielding the biofilm enrichment in light isotope. EXAFS analyses suggested that a major part of the Cu assimilated by the biofilm is bound to 5.1 ± 0.3 oxygen or nitrogen atoms, with a small proportion of Cu linked to sulfur atoms (NS &lt; 0.6) of sulfhydryl groups. XANES analyses showed that the proportion of CuII vs CuI, compared to the initial CuII/CuI ratio, decreased by 14% after the first hour of reaction and by 6% after 96 h of reaction. The value of ε65Cuinc of the biofilm exhibited a similar trend over time of exposure. Our study demonstrates the complexity of biological processes associated with live phototrophic biofilms, which produce large and contrasting isotope fractionations following rather small Cu redox and speciation changes during uptake, storage or release of the metal, i.e., favoring heavy isotopes during complexation with carboxylate ligands and light isotopes during reduction of CuII-O/N to CuI-sulfhydryl moieties. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Copper; Exopolymeric substances; Fractionation; Isotope; Phototrophic biofilm; Sorption; X-ray absorption spectroscopy","adsorption; biofilm; copper; isotopic fractionation; redox conditions; speciation (chemistry); X-ray spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85030838973

About one third of the fuel combustion energy is wasted through exhaust gasses. Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) could improve engine efficiency by recovering a part of exhaust gasses energy. In this study, the potential use of an open loop Brayton cycle with a volumetric compression expansion machine for exhaust gas waste heat recovery was investigated. The use of the Brayton cycle system with only two main elements, a heat exchanger and a volumetric machine, could be very interesting due to its compactness and versatility. However, the publications on this subject are scarce. The present paper aims at bridging this knowledge gap by studying the cycle viability for passenger car application characterized by low temperatures, variable working conditions and several restrictions of available space and weight. The simulated vehicle was a Ford Mondeo family car with an Ecoboost 2.0 engine. The main components of the Brayton cycle WHR system model were a heat exchanger and an alternating piston machine that was used both as a compressor and as an expander. Theoretical studies were conducted in the compression-expansion machine model in order to determine the main parameters that influence the cycle and optimize those parameters in order to obtain the maximum recuperated power. The conclusion was that the cycle viability is not clear because cycle losses are in the same order of magnitude as the recuperated power. Considering future improvements of the compression-expansion machine and the heat exchanger, the recuperated power could be positive. Nevertheless, it is hard to expect that recuperated power would be sufficient to justify the application of this WHR system in the vehicle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Brayton cycle; Internal combustion engine; Waste heat recovery; WHR","Automobile engines; Automobile manufacture; Brayton cycle; Combustion; Engines; Fuels; Gases; Heat exchangers; Integrated circuits; Internal combustion engines; Machine components; Timing circuits; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Car manufacturers; Compression-expansion; Engine efficiency; Future improvements; Low temperatures; Simulated vehicles; Theoretical study; Volumetric compressions; Waste heat utilization",2-s2.0-85029391930

During the synthesis process, a plasma diagnostic was performed by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). We have observed that the structure of Cu-N layers strongly depends on these parameters. The interpretation of the obtained results of the phase composition was based on OES measurements, focusing mainly on elementary processes in plasma. The duration of target sputtering in each pulse of plasma, controlled by the frequency of power modulation, has been pointed out as the cause of observed differences in the phase composition of the layers. The results of the reported study proved the correct selection of the parameters of Cu3N synthesis.

Total suspended particulate (TSP) was sampled with a dilution system, then characterized for total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon (IC), water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the main soluble ions. Gas monitoring shows that CO and NO emission factors are higher for lower quality pellet. Low quality pellet emission factors are also higher for TSP and soluble ions, thus the pollutants linked to pellet ash content. On the other hand, carbonaceous component emission factors are higher for higher quality pellet; nevertheless, at nominal load, lower quality pellet emits more toxic PAHs. The higher stove power restricts instead the emissions of incomplete combustion products: CO, TSP and carbonaceous components. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows to have a complete overview of the obtained results: the effect of operating phase on emission factors is less strong then pellet quality, even if the pollutants produced by low heat power are more hazardous than the ones connected with pellet quality.

The temporal change in the particle dispersion proceeded stably after passage of a long time. The dispersion of the ultrasonic irradiation was suggested to occur by the erosion from the surface of the cluster one by one due to the bulk cavitation as well as the division into smaller particles because of the inner cavitation, and that of the mechanical stirring mainly by the division into smaller clusters due to the shear stress flow.

However, the knowledge of cobalt-based perovskite for aqueous phase oxidation still remains equivocal and insufficient. In this study, we discovered that Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) perovskite was exclusively effective for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation to produce free radicals, whereas the BSCF was inert to activate peroxydisulfate (PDS) and hydrogen peroxide. The BSCF/PMS exhibited superior performance to the benchmark Co3O4 nanocrystals and other classical PMS activators such as α-MnO2 and spinel CoFe2O4, meanwhile achieving an impressive stability with manipulated cobalt leaching in neutral and basic environment. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed the evolution of massive sulfate radicals (SO4[rad]−) and hydroxyl radicals ([rad]OH) during the oxidation. A comprehensively comparative study of BSCF and Co3O4 nanocrystals was performed, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammograms (CV) in PMS solution as well as hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD) tests. The results unveil that the cobalt-based perovskite, BSCF, exhibited a better electrical conductivity and redox potential than the spinel cobalt oxide to interact with PMS. More importantly, the oxygen vacancies and less-electronegativity A-site metals may secure cobalt sites with a lower valence state for donating electrons to PMS simultaneously for radical generation.

Enhancement of heat transfer in heat exchanger can achieved by means of several techniques. These techniques are grouped into the active and passive method. In the active methods, system need some external power, however, passive method utilize surface modification either on heated surface or insertion of swirl devices in the flow field. Active methods are very complex because of external power supply, although these methods have great potential and can control thermally. Passive methods include artificial roughness, extended surface, winglets, insertion of swirl devices in the flow which alters the flow pattern causes to disturb the thermal boundary layer, and consequently high heat transfer. Passive methods are dominant over active methods because its can easily employed in existing heat exchangers.

The crystal structure of the catalyst also greatly influences the photocatalytic activity of BiOX: 1) The relative photo-oxidation power of O2 •− radicals or HO[rad] radicals involved in this study were different which were quantitatively detected using typical radical trapping agent, separately; 2) The relative oxidation power of photogenerated holes (h+) in this study were in the order of BiOCl &gt; BiOBr &gt; BiOI, which may be ascribed to lowering the valence band maximum edge of BiOX through incorporation of halides as the atomic number of halides decreased.

For the illustrated case studies, the results obtained by this method are comparable to those obtained in the literature. It is shown that the calculation procedure proposed in this paper is simple, and the results obtained are accurate. In addition, the calculation of the steam turbine capital cost and environmental footprints are considered in the targeting procedure to provide decision makers with a more complete picture of the designed sites.

The FEM-based method generates a random array of three-dimensional orthogonal parallelepipeds to simulate the stochastic distribution of the asperities across the contact interface. The effect of the contact pressure is studied in detail, since once the contact materials and the topology of the contact area are settled, the contact pressure plays a critical role in determining the electrical constriction resistance. The proposed model is based on two critical variables, the contact pressure and the surface roughness of the mating surfaces, which must be measured in the laboratory to calibrate the model. Results provided by the FEM-based model are compared with experiments for three geometries, thus validating the accuracy of the proposed approach. Although the apparent contact areas of the analyzed specimens have a rectangular shape, the proposed method is also applicable to determine the electrical constriction resistance of other geometries. It is also proved that depending on the pressure applied to the contact interface, the electrical constriction resistance can be almost independent of the apparent area of contact. Although the aim of this work was to generate an electrical constriction resistance model for power connectors, it is also applicable to many other power devices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Apparent contact area; Conducting contact area; Constriction resistance; Finite element method","Electric connectors; Electric variables measurement; Stochastic systems; Surface roughness; Apparent contact area; Constriction resistance; Contact areas; Contact pressures; Critical variables; Metallic rough surfaces; Rectangular shapes; Stochastic distribution; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85029457372

The effluent concentrations of the colloidal particles and the exponents derived from the experiment are inconsistent with those obtained from 2D network models simulation in their researches. In this study, a straining-dominant deep bed filtration (DBF) model is proposed based on 3D network simulation. The effects of simulation parameters such as lattice type, lattice coordination number z, pore size distribution (PSD), and particle capture scheme on DBF were investigated. Consistent with the power law formula and the normalized effluent concentrations (Ce/C0), simulation results indicate that the exponents increase with increasing coordination number z. The change in the PSD parameters alters the flux and weight of path type linked to node, thereby influencing the numerical simulation of staining-dominate DBF on 3D networks. The effects of capture scheme and coordination number on the simulated normalized effluent concentration could be due to variations in the total capture probability for different lattices with the same PSD. The results were obtained from simulation on hexagonal close packing (HCP) and 2D triangular lattices under the optimal conditions.

This study aims to shed more light on the combined effect of lightweighing and electrification by assessing different lightweight designs and electric powetrians from the environmental perspective using a life cycle analysis coupled with an emphasis on energy expenditures and carbon dioxide emissions. This paper discusses the life cycle assessment for several advanced powertrains namely; plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), battery electric vehicles (BEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) relative to the conventional gasoline operated internal combustion engine based power train vehicles. The main focus will be on the energy greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the material extraction and resources phase, manufacturing phase and use phase (operation and maintenance). While most of the current studies focus on the use phase that does not reflect the correct environmental impacts associated with advanced powertrains, thus the presented text applies a holistic LCA approach that covers pre-manufacturing, manufacturing, operational and end-of-life phases, plus another indirect phase to account for fuel extraction, refining and transportation to the end-users or customers. Based on the LCA emissions results, one may infer that environmental policies that reduce emissions rates from the electricity sector can mitigate this effect without completely eliminating it. Interestingly, the analysis show that lightweight vehicles with internal combustion engines have less impacts on the environment as a direct result of upstream emissions associated with electricity generation in United States. This scenario can differ in other countries with higher renewable and sustainable energy generated electric powers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Auto-bodies; Automotive; Electric vehicles; Life cycle analysis; Lightweight; Sustainability","Battery electric vehicles; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Ecodesign; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Engines; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Extraction; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Light weight vehicles; Manufacture; Powertrains; Sustainable development; Vehicles; Auto body; Automotive; Carbon dioxide emissions; Life cycle analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lightweight; Operation and maintenance; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",2-s2.0-85029669104

In general, the performance of these HEMTs is largely restricted by the significant overheating within the device, which would dramatically reduce the charge carrier mobility and thus lower the output current. To solve this problem, different thermal management strategies have been proposed and electrothermal simulations may play an important role here to save tremendous amounts of experimental efforts. However, existing electrothermal simulations are often oversimplified and do not include the details of electron and phonon transport. The large inaccuracies in temperature predictions can be misleading for the thermal improvement of these devices. In this aspect, coupled electron and phonon Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide the most accurate temperature predictions of the transistor region. To further take into account the heat spreading across the whole sub-millimeter device, the phonon MC simulations can be coupled with conventional Fourier's law analysis for regions away from the transistor. This hybrid electrothermal simulation minimizes the heavy computational load of MC simulations but still incorporates the detailed energy transport processes at different length scales. In this work, this new hybrid simulation technique is used to re-evaluate one widely studied thermal management strategy that coats a high-thermal-conductivity layer on top of a device to spread out the heat. Defined as the maximum temperature rise divided by the total heating power, the device thermal resistance is also computed using the temperature rise of acoustic phonons. Difference is found from calculations based on the Fourier's law.

The study also analyzes the effects of separation temperature, adsorption pressure, desorption pressure, CO2 concentration and percent of unused bed on the energy-efficiency of VPSA cycle. The examined performance parameters are CO2 working capacity, proportionality factor, energy consumption and second-law efficiency. The results show that the energy consumption is approximately 2.0–4.5 MJ/kg and the second-law efficiencies are 4–7% for VPSA cycles using the five adsorbent materials. The effect of adsorbent materials on the energy efficiency mainly depends on the proportionality factor of CO2 working capacity (β) of VPSA cycle, which is important to screen materials at the fixed cyclic boundary conditions and preliminary calculation of second-law efficiency for VPSA cycles.

An interfacial spring model was developed to predict wave propagation through layered media, and the results verified by finite element simulation. Two independent interfacial stiffness coefficients are required to model the experimentally observed principal signals, one for the base/build interface (η1) and one for the rest of the layers in the UAM stack (η).

The intrinsic reflection in 2D-PCWs is compensated by the backward-scattered waves from these scatterers, so that the overall reflection is greatly reduced and the insertion loss is improved accordingly. We first present the basic theory for the compensation method. Then, as a demonstration, we give four examples of extremely-low-reflection and high-transmission 90°bent 2D-PCWs created according to the method proposed. In the four examples, it is demonstrated by plane-wave expansion method and finite-difference time-domain method that the 90°bent 2D-PCWs can have high transmission ratio greater than 90% in a wide range of operating frequency, and the highest transmission ratio can be greater than 99.95% with a return loss higher than 43 dB, better than that in other typical 90°bent 2D-PCWs. With our method, the bent 2D-PCWs can be optimized to obtain high transmission ratio at different operating wavelengths. As a further application of this method, a waveguide-based optical bridge for light crossing is presented, showing an optimum return loss of 46.85 dB, transmission ratio of 99.95%, and isolation rates greater than 41.77 dB.

In this work, pure iron was studied as negative electrode of Fe-air batteries with and without Na2S added to the KOH alkaline electrolyte in order to bring new insight on the mechanisms of inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improvement of the electrochemical performances of the Fe electrode. Electrochemical (CV, galvanostatic discharge), spectroscopic (XPS, ToF-SIMS) and microscopic (SEM) analysis were applied to characterize the effect of the sulfide additive (Na2S) on the electrochemical behavior of Fe electrodes and their chemical and morphological modifications. Surface analysis performed by XPS and ToF-SIMS revealed the formation of a markedly thicker oxide/hydroxide layer. The mechanism of formation of this thick oxide/hydroxide layer is initiated by the adsorption of sulfur (Sads) at the oxide/metal interface that inhibits the HER during the first stages of electrochemical process and promotes subsequent anodic oxidation. With the Na2S electrolyte additive, Fe(0)/Fe(II) conversion/deconversion is suppressed and charge/discharge proceeds mostly by Fe(II)/Fe(III) conversion/deconversion with improved capacity owing to the porous morphology of the oxide/hydroxide layer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alkaline electrolytes; Fe-air batteries; Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); Iron electrode; Sulfide","Alkalinity; Chemical analysis; Chemical modification; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Potash; Secondary batteries; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Sodium compounds; Spectroscopic analysis; Sulfur compounds; Surface analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Alkaline electrolytes; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical process; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Iron electrodes; Morphological modification; Sulfide; Anodic oxidation",2-s2.0-85032686647

Here, we report a first attempt to investigate the reaction mechanisms of ZrH2, a promising candidate for fuels, in the combustion of HTPB propellants using ammonium perchlorate (NH4ClO4, AP) as the oxidizer. ZrH2 is determined to possess a good resistance to the direct oxidation by AP. Thus, it would dehydrogenate independently to generate H2 and metallic Zr, which is believed to be very favorable for decreasing the gaseous molecular masses. On the other hand, due to the attachment of gaseous reactants to it, ZrH2 was found to tune the decomposition behaviors of AP by enhancing the generation of NO in the high-temperature decomposition stage. More interestingly, the hydrogen released from ZrH2 is evaluated to promote the combustion reactions in gaseous phases and be responsible for the two-stage combustion behaviors of the corresponding propellant, which are distinct from those when metallic Al is used as the fuel.

This study reports on the effects of thermal treatment on the leachability of metals from such products. Black mass originating from alkaline and Zn–C batteries was thermally treated under four different atmospheres: O2, N2, H2 and air at different temperatures (300–950 °C). Samples without prior thermal treatment and solid residues after thermal treatment were subsequently leached with H2SO4. Leaching of the samples without the thermal treatment was done to determine the reference leaching conditions, which were established to be 0.5 M H2SO4 at 25 °C for 60 min. Subsequently, samples which had been thermally treated were leached using the aforementioned reference conditions. The effect of thermal treatment on the leaching of Mn and Zn was studied to determine which conditions may improve or hinder subsequent hydrometallurgical processing of alkaline batteries. The use of O2 during the thermal treatment led to formation of ZnMn2O4, which inhibited effective leaching. ZnMn2O4 was decomposed in N2 atmosphere and in the presence of C, improving further dissolution of Mn. The use of H2 led to formation of Mn3O4. This compound showed low dissolution, being possible to be separated from impurities such as Fe, Ni and K by leaching with 0.5 M H2SO4. To increase the purity of recovered Mn3O4, oxalic acid was used as reduction agent. A final solid product, Mn3O4, with a purity of 99.95%, was obtained.

Results reveal that the integration of CNT and polyaniline significantly improves the overall saccharide conversion and HMF yield. The PANI shell thickness and morphology are controlled by both reactant feeding ratio and polymerization reaction rate. A thinner and rougher PANI shell is favourable to enhance the overall microwave absorption, improve heat transfer efficiency to catalyst surface and thus reaction efficiency. The highest energy efficiency of 7.6 mmol kJ−1 L−1 is reached in 10 min with CNT/PANI catalyst (30 wt% CNTs) and 19 W input power. Moreover, the packing of polyaniline shell on CNT core facilitates its separation from reaction mixture and effectively prevents catalyst loss. These catalysts show excellent recyclability that the catalyst activity can be completely recovered by a simple re-doping process in 1.0 M sulfuric acid.

Given the low carrier concentration of ~1015 cm−3 at 300 K, the intrinsically low electrical conductivity actually hinders further enhancement of their thermoelectric performance. In this work, the isovalent Te-substitution of Se plays an effective role in narrowing the band gap, which notably increases the carrier concentration to ~1018 cm−3 at 300 K and the electron conduction activation energy has been lowered significantly from 0.33 to 0.14 eV.

Meanwhile, the suppressed lattice thermal conductivity derives from the introduced point defects by heavier Te atoms. The gradually decreased phonon mean free path reflects the increasingly intense phonon scattering. Ultimately, the ZT value attains 0.28 for Bi2O2Se0.96Te0.04 at 823 K, an enhancement by a factor of ~2 as compared to that of pristine Bi2O2Se.

Many countries have inclined to start large-scale research projects so that the microbial fuel cells could be installed to fulfill the power requirements of domestic as well as industrial sectors. The chemical energy stored in the algal biomass can be harnessed for sustainable production of fuels and other value-added products. Bioelectricity production using algae seems to be a wise approach to extract energy from sunlight in an economic and sustainable manner. It is achieved through integration of photosynthesis with microbial fuel cell (MFC). Algae have been used commonly in MFCs to reduce oxygen at cathode or as a substrate for bacteria. However, sufficient electric current can also be generated at anode, where cytochromes help indirect shuttling of electrons generated in photosystem II of the algal cells and can be called as photosynthetic algal microbial fuel cell (PAMFC). Despite being environmental friendly, low efficiency makes these neoteric systems unviable. Hence, a good understanding is needed for the bioelectrochemical mechanisms working behind the electron transfer from algae to electrode.

Creep cracks can sometimes be observed in such situations when the stress intensity factor range ΔK is around the fatigue crack growth threshold stress intensity factor ΔKth. A Time Dependent Failure Assessment Diagram (TDFAD) has been adopted in this study for predicting creep cracking in high-R cyclic loading conditions at elevated temperatures. In addition, attention is also paid to oxide-induced crack closure which is greatly influential at high temperatures. Three power plant steels with different chromium contents, namely 1%Cr, 9%Cr and 18%Cr steels, have been investigated at temperatures between 550 °C and 650 °C. The experiments were performed by reducing ΔK continuously to ΔKth. Good accordance has been found between fracture surface observations and the TDFAD approach predictions of creep crack initiation. Apart from creep cracking, high-R ΔKth values have also been found to be influenced by oxide-induced crack closure at elevated temperatures.

Therefore, the ambient-temperature diffusion and gettering of Pt atoms in GaN can hardly be observed.

The formation of denuded areas where the powder was removed during single line and island scans over several layers were imaged for the first time. The inclination of the laser plume was shifted from forwards to backwards by changing power and scan speed, resulting in different denudation regimes with implications to the heat, mass and momentum transfer of the process. As the build progressed, denudation became less severe than for a single powder layer, but the occurrence of sintered and fused powder agglomerates, which were affected by the plume, increased. Schlieren imaging enabled the visualisation of the Ar gas flow, which takes place in the atmosphere above the bed due to the plume, in addition to its interaction with affected particles. Numerical modelling was used to understand and quantify the observed flow behaviour, through the hydrodynamic treatment of the laser plume as a multi-component Ar-Fe plasma.

However, at high frequencies, the AC losses induced in the planar inductor and transformer windings become significant due to skin and proximity effects. This paper presents the design of a high-frequency planar transformer (HFPT) for an induction heating system. The aim of this design is to adapt the levels of voltage and current from the inverter to the resonant tank characteristics. We propose a planar structure of Litz in the primary of our HFPT to reduce the AC resistance of the planar conductor. The Litz structure is obtained with a technique of the turn's division in four tracks and their intersection so that the current passes all over the turn. For the single secondary turn, the choice of the section is based on an analytical study compared to a 2D finite element modeling (FEM), and is determined according to the shape that represents fewer losses and responds to our needs. 2D finite element modeling (FEM) was performed for three different primary turns’ structures; full coil, a turn with four parallel tracks and our Litz planar turn; to minimize losses. Simulation results show that the planar Litz conductor can lead to a lower AC resistance.

The influence of the diameter of the NW, the operating temperature and the humidity are studied in detail and corresponding sensing mechanisms are proposed. An increase in the gas response by a decrease of the NW diameter was observed. Also, by increasing the operating temperature to 200 °C an enhancement in the hydrogen gas response of about 3.5 times (from ≈400 to 1440 to 100 ppm) was obtained and was attributed to the increased catalytic properties of the Pd nanoparticles (NPs).

These changes were compared to Nafion 117 and Nafion 212. Average sulfonated inter-domain spacing through the film's thickness increased from 22.3 nm (C:H cast) to 30.5 nm (THF cast) that was estimated using SAXS. TEM revealed that PBC solution-cast films from C:H contained a random distribution of discrete sulfonated domains. An ordered PBC morphology consisting of lamella and hexagonally packed ion groups were created from a THF solution-cast film. These changes were attributed to favorable solvent-ionomer interactions during solvent evaporation and film densification. This ordered morphology led to increased conductivity (4.5 mS/cm versus 47.8 mS/cm), improved fuel cell power (19 mW/cm2 versus 160 mW/cm2), enhanced ionomer actuation (3.0 cm versus 6.9 cm), and modest self-discharge improvements for a vanadium redox-flow battery. This study demonstrates that morphology impacts ionomer physical properties, transport, and device function. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fuel cell, flow battery, and actuator function; Ionomer solution processing into films; Morphology; SAXS and TEM; Water swelling and ion transport","Actuators; Electric batteries; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Fuel cells; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ionomers; Ions; Morphology; Organic solvents; Physical properties; Transmission electron microscopy; Vanadium; X ray scattering; Degradation resistance; Electro-active actuators; Functional group distributions; Ion transports; Pentablock copolymers; Solution-cast films; Solution-processing; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Flow batteries; copolymer; cyclohexane derivative; heptane derivative; hydrogen; proton; tetrahydrofuran derivative; vanadium derivative; Article; electric battery; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; evaporation; molecular interaction; priority journal; proton transport; thickness; transmission electron microscopy; X ray crystallography; Actuators; Conductivity; Copolymers; Fuel Cells; Swelling; Tetrahydrofuran; Vanadium",2-s2.0-85029590139

Crud causes serious operational problems for LWRs, including axial power shifts, accelerated fuel clad corrosion, increased primary circuit radiation dose rates, and in some instances has led directly to fuel failure. Numerous studies continue to attempt to model and predict the effects of crud, but each assumes that it will always be present. In this study, we report on the development of crud-resistant materials as fuel cladding coatings, to reduce or eliminate these problems altogether. Integrated loop testing experiments at flowing LWR conditions show significantly reduced crud adhesion and surface crud coverage, respectively, for TiC and ZrN coatings compared to ZrO2. The loop testing results roughly agree with the London dispersion component of van der Waals force predictions, suggesting that they contribute most significantly to the adhesion of crud to fuel cladding in out-of-pile conditions. These results motivate a new look at ways of reducing crud, thus avoiding many expensive LWR operational issues. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Adhesion; Coatings; Dispersions; Dosimetry; Fuels; Nuclear fuel elements; Piles; Van der Waals forces; Experimental evaluation; Fouling deposit; Fuel cladding; Nuclear fuel rod; Operational issues; Operational problems; Primary circuits; Radiation dose rate; Light water reactors",2-s2.0-85031717590

The tetravalent doping was performed on hydrothermally grown akaganeite (β-FeOOH) nanorods on FTO (fluorine-doped tin-oxide) substrates via a simple dipping method for which the respective metal-precursor solution was used, followed by a high-temperature (800° C) sintering in a box furnace. The photocurrent density for the pristine (hematite) photoanode is ∼0.81 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, with an onset potential of 0.72 VRHE; however, the tetravalent dopants on the hematite nanostructures alter the properties of the pristine photoanode. The Si4+-doped hematite photoanode showed a slight photocurrent increment without a changing of the onset potential of the pristine photoanode. The Sn4+- and Ti4+-doped hematite photoanodes, however, showed an anodic shift of the onset potential with the photocurrent increment at a higher applied potential. Interestingly, the Zr4+-doped hematite photoanode exhibited an onset potential that is similar to those of the pristine and Si4+-doped hematite, but a larger photocurrent density that is similar to those of the Sn4+- and Ti4+-doped photoanodes was recorded. The photoactivity of the doped photoanodes at 1.23 VRHE follows the order Zr &gt; Sn &gt; Ti &gt; Si. The onset-potential shifts of the doped photoanodes were investigated using the Ab initio calculations that are well correlated with the experimental data. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning-electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed that both the crystalline phase of the hematite and the nanorod morphology were preserved after the doping procedure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of the tetravalent dopants on the hematite nanostructure. The charge-transfer resistance at the various interfaces of the doped photoanodes was studied using impedance spectroscopy.

Spectroscopy analysis has proven to be a rapid and effective means for predicting soil properties, in general, and NPK, in particular. However, different calibration methods, including preprocessing transformations (PPTs) and regression algorithms (RAs), considerably affect the performance of prediction models. In this study, raw spectrum and 21 PPTs, combined with three RAs, for a total of 66 calibration methods, were investigated for modeling and predicting soil NPK using hyperspectral VNIR data (400–1000 nm). The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of validation set was selected to evaluate the prediction accuracy and the ratio between the interpretable sum squared deviation and the real sum squared deviation (SSR/SST) of the validation set was also used to evaluate the explanatory power of the models. It was found that there is a tradeoff between RPD and SSR/SST values; under this tradeoff, the multiplicative scatter correction, combined with the back-propagation neural network, was preferred for predicting P (RPD = 2.23, SSR/SST = 0.81). The Savitzky-Golay filtering + logarithmic transformation, combined with the partial least squares – regression, was preferred for predicting K (RPD = 1.47, SSR/SST = 0.95). However, with extremely low RPD and SSR/SST values, the prediction of N was unreliable in this study.

Here a novel concept is presented, based on cylindrical ligno-cellulosic materials, available as agricultural residues or spontaneous vegetation. Giant canes (Arundo Donax L.) and maize (Zea Mays) stalks were used as porous separators (naturally tubular) for air-cathode MFC modules (GC-MFC and MS-MFC, meaning Giant Cane and Maize Stalk, respectively), with carbon cloth-based electrodes. The MFCs were operated across 100 Ω external load, enriching swine-farming wastewater with addition of sodium acetate (3 g L−1). Initially, these systems showed relatively high internal resistances (especially GC, with Rint = 5600 Ω), before the material was completely imbibed by the anolyte. After 10–20 days acclimation, despite sufficient electrolytic conductivity was established in both systems (internal resistance around 60–90 Ω), relatively low power densities (around 40 mW m−2, normalized by cathode's surface projection) were achieved, if compared to state-of-the-art MFCs, oriented to electricity harvesting. However, the generated electric field was enough to sustain electro-osmotic ions mobility and to establish high pH conditions (pH 11–12) at the cathode. Over 70 days of operation, electro-migration and deposition phenomena of valuable elements (Na, Ca, Mg, Mn, K, etc.) were observed, both inside the separator and on the cathode surface. Simultaneously, partial biodegradation of the ligno-cellulosic biomass, especially for MS, drove partial release of organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and other elements in the anodic chamber.

Although thermal stability of solar absorbers is typically examined under vacuum, high temperature air stability is required for practical applications in concentration solar power (CSP) technologies: solar tower systems receivers operate in air and, on the other hand, air stability is highly preferred in parabolic trough collector systems due to occasionally undesired losses of vacuum conditions. In this work, the effect of different layers combination, prepared by sputtering, on the optical performance after high temperature annealing has been investigated. Two different standard substrates (stainless steel and Inconel) have been explored. It is shown that silver layer, typically used in SSC as IR reflector, strongly affects the stack thermal stability in air, leading to important degradation. For SSC stacks with the Inconel/MoSi2-Si3N4/Si3N4 structure (onto Inconel substrate), a good thermal stability in air is obtained, leading to just a slight variation of the absorptivity after air annealing at 600 °C, probably due to partial Si3N4 oxidation. Best optical performance is achieved for the Inconel substrate, using and additional Al2O3 barrier on top, comprising the stack the following structure: Inconel/MoSi2-Si3N4/Si3N4/Al2O3. This combination exhibits very good optical performance, even after annealing at 700 °C in air.

In this paper, to simplify the P2D model, a series of polynomial functions are employed to approximate the electrolyte phase concentration profile, solid phase concentration profile, and non-uniform reaction flux profile, respectively.

Results indicate that the mechanical grinding destroys the lamellar structure of graphite, exposing massive newborn hydrophobic surfaces.

Previous studies on HAFBs demonstrate the enhancement in the load capacity at low speeds, reduction or elimination of the friction and wear during starts/stops, and enhanced heat dissipation capability. In this paper, the benefit of the HAFB is further explored to enhance the rotordynamic stability by employing a controlled hydrostatic injection. This paper presents the analytical and experimental evaluation of the rotordynamic performance of a rotor supported by two three-pad HAFBs with the controlled hydrostatic injection, which utilizes the injections at particular locations to control eccentricity and attitude angle. The simulations in both time domain orbit simulations and frequency-domain modal analyses indicate a substantial improvement of the rotor-bearing performance. The simulation results were verified in a high-speed test rig (maximum speed of 70,000 rpm). Experimental results agree with simulations in suppressing the subsynchronous vibrations but with a large discrepancy in the magnitude of the subsynchronous vibrations, which is a result of the limitation of the current modeling approach. However, both simulations and experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the controlled hydrostatic injection on improving the rotordynamic performance of AFB.

Therefore, the effects of citric acid on the size and morphology of various intermediate products and the final synthesized W-Cu nanocomposite powders were studied in detail. The results indicated that the calcined product synthesized from citric acid (0.02 mol) was comprised of favaginous mass particles with high specific surface area (24 m2/g).

The W-Cu nanocomposite powders from citric acid (0.02 mol) exhibited the well-distributed spherical particles of 30–50 nm. Citric acid was found to accelerate the reactivity of combustion products to induce a morphology with homogeneous and well-distributed W-Cu nanoparticles.

Among the various battery thermal management technologies, the air cooling is one of the most commonly used solutions. In this paper, the cooling performance of the parallel air-cooled BTMS is improved through using the secondary vent. Computational fluid dynamics is introduced to calculate the flow field and the temperature field, finally evaluating the cooling performance of the BTMS. Mathematical analysis is conducted to explore the influences of the inlet air temperature and the heat generation rate on the battery cell temperature. The analysis results demonstrate that the temperature rise and the temperature difference of the battery pack are independent of the inlet air temperature, and are proportional to the heat generation rate for the situation of the constant heat generation rate. Subsequently, the influences of the position and the size of the secondary vent on the cooling performance of the BTMS are investigated through using the typical numerical cases. The results show that the position of the secondary vent strongly affects the maximum temperature and the maximum temperature difference of the battery pack. When the vent is on the convergence plenum, it is suggested to be located against the cooling channel around the battery cell with the maximum temperature. Compared to the vent located on the convergence plenum, the one against the outlet performs better. In this situation, the maximum temperature of the battery pack is reduced by 5 K or more, and the maximum temperature difference is reduced by 60% or more compared to the BTMS without vent for the situation of the constant heat generation rate. Moreover, the cooling performance of the BTMS becomes better as the size of the secondary vent increased, and similar conclusion can be obtained when the heat generation rate is unsteady. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air cooling; Battery thermal management; Flow pattern; Secondary vent","Atmospheric temperature; Battery management systems; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Cooling systems; Electric batteries; Flow patterns; Heat generation; Secondary batteries; Temperature control; Thermal load; Thermal variables control; Vents; Air cooling; Battery thermal managements; Flow configurations; Heat generation rate; Inlet air temperatures; Mathematical analysis; Maximum temperature differences; Temperature differences; Thermal management (electronics)",2-s2.0-85030547284

Among different candidates, tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) is one of the most actively researched electrode materials due to its high theoretical capacity (1493 mAh g−1), abundance, inexpensive costs, and environmental friendliness. However, severe capacity decay from the volume expansion and low conductivity of SnO2 have hampered its use as a feasible electrode for LIBs. Rationally designed SnO2-based nanostructures with conductive materials can be an ideal solution to resolve such limitations. In this work, we have successfully fabricated porous SnO2-CuO composite nanotubes (SnO2-CuO p-NTs) by electrospinning and subsequent calcination step. The porous nanotubular structure is expected to mitigate the volume expansion of SnO2, while the as-formed Cu from CuO upon lithiation allows faster electron transport by improving the low conductivity of SnO2.

In the pure Na-ion cell, one Na per formula unit of LiV3O8 can be reversibly inserted at room temperature via a two-step process, while further intercalation leads to gradual amorphisation of the material, with a specific capacity of 190 mAhg−1 after 10 cycles in the potential window of 0.8–3.4 V.

The stamping process was decomposed into the 6 sub-steps to reflect the physical boundary conditions found in an actual stamping equipment. The temperature distributions of the actual stamping process were measured by two thermography cameras. The developed numerical procedure was then validated against the measured temperature distributions. Due to the limited accessibility to the actual equipment and high reflectivity of the involved material, the reflectivity index for the thermal imaging device (i.e., emissivity) was experimentally determined. A sample specimen made of the same material with the die material was built. The thermocouples were placed underneath the specimen surface through holes and used to directly measure the surface temperature distribution. The emissivity for the sample specimen was then determined by comparing the temperature measured by the thermocouples to the temperature measured by the thermographic camera. When the lubrication oils were spread on the sample specimen, the emissivity was set to a value 0.7. The thermal images were corrected based on the emissivity experimentally obtained and used to validate the finite element model simulation for the stamping process. With the validated finite element model, the investigation on the variation in the temperature and stress during each sub-step was performed. With the zero thermal expansion rate, the pure thermal effect on the temperature distribution was simulated. The pure thermal deformation in the Blank (i.e., target surface) was similar to the spring back distance after the blank was released from the molds. During the stamping process, the heat generation was obtained due to either friction between surfaces and plastic deformation of the target surface. We found that the plastic deformation played a critical role in the final temperature rise. © 2017","Automotive body part; Numerical modeling; Stamping process; Thermal deformation; Thermal imaging","Cameras; Electromagnetic wave emission; Image processing; Infrared imaging; Numerical models; Plastic deformation; Reflection; Stamping; Temperature distribution; Thermal expansion; Thermocouples; Thermography (imaging); Automotive body parts; Stamping process; Surface temperature distribution; Thermal deformation; Thermal imaging devices; Thermo-mechanical finite element models; Thermographic cameras; Zero thermal expansion; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85028964497

The erosive change of shape has been investigated in a multitude of experiments ranging from eroding flat plates to eroding full engines. The basic challenge to transfer the results from very simple tests to real life erosion remains. Up to date measurement techniques today allow closing this gap. The necessary experimental and analytical steps are shown. The erosion resistance of Ti-6Al-4V at realistic flow conditions with fluid velocities ranging from 200 to 400 m/s is used. The erodent used was quartz sand with a size distribution corresponding to standardized Arizona Test Dust A3 (1-120 μm). Flat plates out of Ti-6Al-4V were eroded at different impingement angles. The particle velocities and sizes were investigated using a high-speed laser shadowgraphy technique. A dimensional analysis was carried out to obtain nondimensional parameters suitable for describing erosion. Different averaging methods of the particle velocity were examined in order to identify a representative particle velocity. Compared to the fluid velocity and the mean particle velocity, the energy averaged particle velocity is found to be the best representation of the erosiveness of a particle stream. The correlations derived from the dimensional analysis are capable of precisely predicting erosion rates for different rig operating points (OPs).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the incorporation of N and P atoms into carbon frameworks of carbon microsphere (CMS), and co-doping has no obvious influence on its morphology.

Thus, it is necessary to design the advanced materials to detect or remove phosgene effectively. In fact, detection or adsorption of some small gas molecules are not the most difficult to actualize. Whereas, one of the primary challenges is the gas molecules desorption from the adsorbent for the purpose of recycling of substrate materials since the small gas molecules interacts strongly with the substrates. In this work, the interaction between the phosgene molecule and pristine or Mn-doped graphene sheets with different electric field and charge state are investigated by using first-principles simulations. Our results show that the adsorption energy of phosgene on Mn-doped graphene is dramatically weakened by applying an external negative electric field but is obviously enhanced by introducing a positive electric field. These processes can be easily controlled by transform the direction of the electric field. Thus, introducing an external electric field or charge in the system may be an excellent method to control the phosgene molecule adsorption and desorption on Mn-doped graphene sheet. All energy needed is just a small quantity of electricity, which satisfies well the requirement of green chemistry and sustainable development.

The influence of different parameters such as gas diffusion layer porosity, permeability, thickness, Poisson ratio, and density on the performance of a fuel cell with interdigitated gas distributor on both anode and cathode sides is studied. Obtained results show that there is an optimum range for clamping pressure, caused by assembly force, in which PEMFC performance is in its maximum state.

Two carbazole derivatives Cz–Bt (carbazole–benzothiadiazole) and Cz–Bt–BT (carbazole–benzothiadiazole–bithiophene) are electrosprayed, resulting in triangle and spike (2-D and 3-D pyramids) structures, respectively. These 2-D and 3-D pyramids differ due to an additional bithiophene unit at the molecular level, which has imparted a higher degree of rotational freedom. The effects of derivatives, solution concentrations and solvents vapor pressure on morphology are studied. Further, these submicron-size pyramids are characterized by enhancement in light absorption due to scattering and multi-reflection. It is observed that 2-D pyramids enhance up to 44.4%, whereas 3-D pyramids enhance up to 18.7% of light absorption.

All of them were prepared by room-temperature reactive magnetron sputtering and subsequently rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in nitrogen atmosphere. The optical properties and microstructure of VOx-based thin films were investigated. The results reveal that all samples are ascribed to pure VO2 (M), and the VOx-based thin films exhibit superior thermochromic properties with the solar modulation (ΔTsol) up to 12.75%, 15.65% and 18.02%, respectively. The phase transition temperature (Tc) is as low as 54 °C for multi-layer thin films without doping, which indicates that the film design could effectively enhance optical switching and depress the Tc. After thermal treatment in the air, the phase of V2O5 appeared at 325 °C, 275 °C and 375 °C for single-layer, triple-layer and multi-layer thin films, respectively, which indicates the multi-layer thin films show the best thermal stability. According to the degradation mechanism in this paper, the unbalance of interfacial stress and oxygen vacancies in VOx thin film accelerated the oxidation process, which results in the disappearance of thermochromic properties. Furthermore, the multi-layer thin films still show superior ΔTsol of 16.56% and Tc of 56 °C, when it was taken out at 400 °C and cooled quickly in air.

Multiple peaks observed in the O K-edge spectrum in the 532–548 eV range were likely related to O[sbnd]Si bonds. During the initial charge, when SiO-C occludes Li, a new peak related to Li[sbnd]O bonds appeared at 534 eV. During the initial discharge, this peak was maintained at potentials below 0.7 V vs. Li/Li+, but decreased at higher potentials, suggesting the presence of a phase change point near 0.7 V vs. Li/Li+. This change was also supported by the Li K-edge spectrum. An examination of the phase change after charge/discharge cycling at negative electrode termination potentials of 0.66 and 1.1 V vs. Li/Li+ confirmed that the phase structure was stable when cycling at potentials below the phase change point, but unstable at higher potentials.

From this point of view, we establish a comprehensive LIB evaluation system based on a multi-layer index and provide a comprehensive method for evaluating battery performance. The assessment system considers three aspects: environmental impacts, economic parameters, and electrochemical performances, with several indicators for each aspect. We use the footprint family of indexes to characterise the environmental impact of the battery. We analyse the comprehensive performance and evaluate the size of the market competitiveness with quantitative comparisons of the scores for each battery. A comprehensive assessment system with eleven indicators relating to the three aspects is built. As the indicators have different dimensions and units, we use a calculation method called entropy weight to normalise and nondimensionalise the indices; thus, a comprehensive evaluation value for each sample battery could be achieved. To realise the assessment system with practical samples, we choose four kinds of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, including LiFePO4/C, LiFe0.98Mn0.02PO4/C, FeF3(H2O)3/C and LiMn2O4/C, as study objects, and the average values of the comprehensive evaluation indexes for the four battery samples are0.034, 0.041, −0.027, and 0.052, respectively. The lower the comprehensive evaluation value is, the better the performance of the product will be. The FeF3(H2O)3/C battery has the best performance when combining 1 kg of battery cathode material. The results reflect the advantages and disadvantages of different types of battery in terms of processing, cost and environmental performance. The establishment of a comprehensive evaluation system for lithium-ion batteries is not only conducive to the scientific evaluation and optimisation of the wide variety of battery materials that are currently available but also to discovering battery materials with more competitive market prospects.

In this study, the contribution of the catalyst layer to the overall gas permeability of the electrode is experimentally investigated for different catalysts with a range of Pt loadings at various temperatures for air, oxygen and nitrogen gases. Results indicate that the gas permeability of the GDLs can be reduced by 58–77% with the presence of a catalyst layer. For the constant Pt loadings, the electrodes with higher Pt/C ratios (e.g., 60% Pt/C) show larger gas permeability than those with lower ratios (e.g., 30% Pt/C) due to their smaller thicknesses and higher porosity. Similarly, for the electrodes with the same type of catalysts, the gas permeability is higher for lower Pt loadings. Further, the effective gas permeability of the catalyst layers alone is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the GDLs. Additionally, operating at higher temperatures slightly enhances the permeability. Oxygen gas has a higher permeability than air and nitrogen, but the differences are small. These results highlight the importance of catalyst layer, hence the Pt loadings and Pt/C ratios, in determining the mass transport throughout the entire electrode in PEM fuel cells. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Catalyzed electrode; Gas permeability; Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell; Pt loading; Pt-carbon ratio","Carbon; Catalysis; Catalysts; Diffusion in gases; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Gas permeability; Gases; Nitrogen; Platinum; Polyelectrolytes; Polymer membrane electrodes; Polymers; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Solid electrolytes; Carbon ratio; Catalyst layers; Gas diffusion layers; Orders of magnitude; Oxygen and nitrogens; PEM fuel cell; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Pt loading; Gas permeable membranes",2-s2.0-85032669981

The approach consists in depositing a composite multifunctional electrocatalyst layer on the SOFC anode to work as an internal integrated fuel processor. This study investigates the direct oxidation of dry ethanol in the modified SOFC and provides an evaluation of cell performance. A protective layer based on a composite made of Ni-modified perovskite and gadolinia-doped ceria is coated on a conventional SOFC anode based on Ni-YSZ. Besides the oxygen storage properties of ceria, the composite electrocatalyst is characterized by the presence of dispersed Ni-alloy @ FeOx core-shell nanoparticles in the outer layers and surface basicity properties. Efficient dehydrogenation of ethanol, carbon deposition-free cracking reactions and internal reforming assisted by a H2/H2O “shuttle mechanism” appear as the key steps involved in the direct oxidation of the organic fuel at the modified SOFC anode.

In contrast, thermally stabilized Ag layers maintained low emissivity even at temperatures below 700 °C. In these layers, agglomeration and vaporization were suppressed by SiNx nano-particles dispersed in the Ag matrix and interfacial W adhesive layers, respectively. The interband absorption of β-FeSi2 layers at higher temperatures revealed that larger n and k in the infrared region due to thermally excited electrons induced no rise in emissivity of the multilayers, and the narrower band gap based on Einstein's model shifted the absorptance cut-off wavelength closer to the ideal value and hence resulted in a higher solar absorptance.

This work focused on the combustion characteristics of boron submicroparticles with and without plasma discharges in a hot environment supported by CH4/N2/O2 flat flame based on the optical diagnostics. The boron submicroparticles were dispersed by the nebulization method to control the agglomeration. The well-dispersed boron flame exhibited two different burning modes, depending on the ambient temperature. As the ambient temperature was above 1520 K, the boron flame showed definitely two-stage characteristics where the upstream of particle flow was yellow, corresponding to the first-stage flame, while the downstream was green and diffusive, corresponding to the second-stage flame. The first-stage and second-stage burn times were respectively in the range of 0.46–1.08 ms and 0.92–1.87 ms, as the ambient temperature decreased from 1752 K to 1520 K. The chemical kinetics-controlled mechanism was confirmed by the nearly linear size dependence of the burn time (d1 law). Nevertheless, as the ambient temperature was below 1520 K, the boron submicroparticles were partially burned or oxidized, exhibiting a mildly orange stream. This mild boron flame could be enhanced using a plasma discharge. The ignition delay time was shortened from 3.06 ms to 0.77 ms when the discharge was introduced at the ignition delay stage.

However, usually conventional instrumentation is unsuitable because of extremely high temperatures, and hot poisonous gases generated by the thermo-chemical processes of the boiling liquid. This paper proposes a novel method to detect such boiling liquid levels by monitoring the boiling/bubbling noise in the vessel using a waveguide. The principle of this method is that the axial modes of the air column and the liquid column in the closed vessel would change with change in liquid height. The sound pressure waves produced in the vessel due to bubbling and propagating along the vessel's axial direction can be captured by decomposition using two microphones in a waveguide co-axially attached to the vessel. These decomposed waves would show peaks at resonance frequencies corresponding to the vessel's axial modes, which would be used to calculate the liquid height. The proposed method was verified through extensive finite element simulations and experiments of boiling water over a wide range of conditions. The boiling water levels were correctly measured in each condition with an average accuracy of 98.8%. Thus, this waveguide system can continuously monitor boiling liquid levels based on the incident wave frequency and amplitude. Such a system has wide industrial applications, particularly in steel plants, where knowing the amount of molten steel during oxygen lancing faces many challenges. © 2017","Boiling; Bubbles; Decomposition; Modes; Resonance; Waveguide","Acoustic wave propagation; Boiling liquids; Bubble formation; Bubbles (in fluids); Decomposition; Finite element method; Industrial plants; Resonance; Steel foundry practice; Steelmaking; Water levels; Waveguides; Finite element simulations; High temperature; Incident wave frequencies; Industrial processs; Modes; Sound pressure waves; Thermo chemical process; Waveguide systems; Liquids",2-s2.0-85030852623

The Fourier-, Cattaneo-, and Jeffreys-types of thermal flux modes have been exploited to govern the heat transfer processes of adjacent regions. However, most of the existing studies consider using only one type of these thermal flux models to describe the thermal physics of the entire system such that the mathematical model may fail to precisely describe the physics within the multi-domain system, especially, when the mean free paths of different adjacent domains span in a large range with respect to the characteristic dimension of the material. To circumvent this issue, a generalized heat conduction model, termed C- and F-processes heat conduction model, with the consideration of perfect/imperfect thermal interface is proposed and formulated under the expression of a first-order time dependent differential-algebraic equation in which the interface conditions are treated as algebraic equations. The unified time integration of GSSSS-1 is extended to solve the resulting differential-algebraic system with Index 2 constraints.

Bismuth undergoes a complete and highly reversible alloying reaction, whereas antimony displays no electrochemical activity. Taking advantage of the complete Sb[sbnd]Bi solid solution, monophasic compositions Sb1-xBix were prepared by high-energy mechanochemical synthesis and characterized by X-ray diffraction and solid-state 25Mg nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The electrochemical magnesiation at low current rate shows a full alloying process of Sb1-xBix-based electrodes leading to monophasic Mg3(Sb1-xBix)2. This chemical association of antimony and bismuth enables a positive effect on the electrochemical magnesiation of the electrode and enables higher specific capacities compared to Bi-based electrodes. However, this synergy only operates in the nominal discharge since an irreversible capacity loss, which scales with the antimony content, is observed in the subsequent charge.

A transient numerical model is developed to study the heat transfer and melting behaviors, and the natural convection is accounted. To suppress the non-uniform heat transfer for the PCM melting enhancement, fins with the inclined angle of 0°,+15°,+30°,-15° and -30° are proposed. The melt fraction contours with the natural convection driven flow are performed and compared, as well as the temperature distributions. Results show that the fins in a downward angle of -15° accelerate the PCM melting faster than the others, as the part of heat is well transferred to the bottom of container along the fins and the original non-uniform melting caused by natural convection is reduced. Contrarily, the upward fins in +15° and +30° deepen the non-uniform heat distribution and slow down the melting. The saved PCM melting time is defined on the basis of the No Fin PCM case. It is found that saved melting time of PCMs with -15° fins increases 23.8% on the case of the 0° fins, while decreases 45.2% and 71.4% with the +15° and +30° fins. The fin length and heat flux input are also examined for the PCM melting. The fin length shows the significant influence on the PCM melting with the tilted fins. As the length ratio of fin to container increases to 0.75, the non-uniform melting is obviously suppressed due to the addition of the -15° fins, and temperature contours inside the PCM domain show much more uniform, by comparing with 0° fins. The PCM melting rate with -15° fins also increases greatly and the saved melting time rises about 62.7%. Besides, the enhancement ratio reveals that the melting enhancement by the fins mainly appears at the second half of the entire process, based on the PCM solid-liquid interface formed at the first half. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Angled fins; Heat transfer enhancement; Natural convection; Phase change materials; Thermal energy storage","Containers; Energy storage; Fins (heat exchange); Heat convection; Heat flux; Heat storage; Melting; Natural convection; Phase change materials; Phase interfaces; Thermal energy; Angled fins; Enhancement ratios; Heat Transfer enhancement; Numerical investigations; Rectangular enclosures; Solid-liquid interfaces; Temperature contours; Thermal energy storage systems; Heat transfer",2-s2.0-85030994544

We then investigate global technical efficiency, reduction potential, shadow prices and factors influencing the marginal abatement costs of CO2 emissions based on a quadratic directional output distance function. The empirical results show the following: (1) the global centres of gravity for CO2 emissions, energy consumption and capital stock have accelerated their shift to the Asian inland in the 21st century, but the global centre of gravity for the economy did not show the same trend. (2) Global technical inefficiency demonstrates a U-shape, with a turning point in 2007. Average annual total global CO2 emissions could be reduced by 4482.28 Mt, and the global marginal abatement costs of CO2 emissions are approximately 673.74–697.73 USD/t. (3) The relationship between economic development and marginal abatement costs is represented by a U-shaped curve. The world is currently in the climbing phase of this curve, implying that controlling CO2 emissions is becoming more costly. Moreover, energy structure, industrial structure, and CO2 emissions are negatively correlated with marginal abatement costs. Finally, the financial crisis has had a significant effect on marginal abatement costs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Directional distance function; Marginal abatement cost; Shadow price","Cost reduction; Costs; Economics; Energy utilization; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Carbon dioxide emissions; Directional distance function; Economic development; Industrial structures; Marginal abatement costs; Output distance function; Shadow price; Technical efficiency; Carbon dioxide",2-s2.0-85031923927

There are colossal challenges in reliably providing these resources amid growing population, increased urbanization and improved living standards causing increased demand for these resources. Development of new supply centralized systems comes at an exorbitant cost, whereas decentralized systems are touted as an attractive alternative. Grey water recycling and rain water harvesting at buildings level is such an alternative that can provide water for non-potable uses. However, there are technological challenges of optimally operating such systems while ensuring efficient use of associated energy. This paper introduces two control strategies; open loop optimal control and closed-loop model predictive control (MPC) strategies aimed at ensuring safe and reliable operation of the grey water recycling and rain water harvesting system while efficiently using associated energy. From the case study, the proposed system with either control strategy can save the cost of water and waste water by up to 32.3% and 29.5% respectively, while leading to 35.7% in energy cost savings and 31.5% in total operational cost savings in a month. Adoption of these systems would have a huge environmental effect in reducing demand for sewerage services, conservation of water hence reducing demand for potable water as well as increasing the energy efficiency. Furthermore, the system would increase the reliability and security of water supply. Despite the benefits, the system does not pay within its lifetime and therefore, government intervention is required so as to make it economically attractive. High cost of implementation coupled with low potable and waste water tariffs harbour adoption of these systems. Appropriate regulations, policies, incentives and public education are necessary to support such novel technologies in ensuring resource conservation, efficiency and security are achieved. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Demand side management; Energy-water nexus; Grey water; Life cycle cost analysis; Optimal control; Rain water harvesting",,2-s2.0-85031941399

The adsorption behaviors of TiClx (x = 4-0) and the interactions between pre-adsorbed H atom and TiClx are studied by calculating adsorption energies Eads and interaction energies HTi, respectively. The pre-adsorbed H atom significantly facilitates the adsorption of TiClx on pyrolytic carbon surface. Specially, TiCl3 adsorption on pyrolytic carbon surface converts from an endothermic process into an exothermic process due to the present of pre-adsorbed H atom. The calculation results of HTi show that the interactions between pre-adsorbed H atom and TiClx are attractive. The dissociation of TiCl4 on pre-adsorbed H pyrolytic carbon surface is an exothermic process, and TiCl4 → TiCl3 is the limited step. The dissociation barriers of each step are less than 1.5 eV except for TiCl → Ti, which does not need to overcome any barriers, that is to say, once TiCl is adsorbed on pre-adsorbed H surface the reaction of TiCl → Ti spontaneously occurs. It thus can be concluded that the dissociation of TiCl4 on pyrolytic carbon surface is a favorable process as long as H2 molecular have decomposed into atomic H and adsorbed on pyrolytic carbon surface, and the intermediate species (TiCl3, TiCl2 and TiCl) play an important role on the titanium CVD deposition. We also study the adsorption behavior of H atom and the dissociation behavior of H2 molecular on pyrolytic carbon surface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Density functional theory (DFT); Dissociation; PyC surface; TiCl4","Adsorption; Atoms; Chemical vapor deposition; Dissociation; Ionic liquids; Surface reactions; Adsorption behavior; Calculation results; Dissociation barrier; Endothermic process; Interaction energies; Intermediate specie; Theoretical investigations; TiCl4; Density functional theory",2-s2.0-85028724424

Density-functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Ag prefers to occupy the substitutional Ni site (AgNi) and behaves as an acceptor in NiO lattice. Compared with the pristine NiOx films, appropriate Ag doping can increase the optical transparency, work function, electrical conductivity and hole mobility of NiOx films. Moreover, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films grown on Ag:NiOx exhibit better crystallinity, higher coverage and smoother surface with densely packed larger grains than those grown on the pristine NiOx film. Consequently, the Ag:NiOx HTL boosts the efficiency of the inverted planar heterojunction PeSCs from 13.46% (for the pristine NiOx-based device) to 16.86% (for the 2 at.% Ag:NiOx-based device). Furthermore, the environmental stability of PeSCs based on Ag:NiOx HTL is dramatically improved compared to devices based on organic HTLs and pristine NiOx HTLs.

In this study, a multiple spin-coating process was used to increase the thickness of the ZrOx gate dielectric layer and reduce the large off-state current. The large off-state current of pentacene TFTs was decreased to 1 pA by a ZrOx gate thickness of 70 nm.

In order to improve the accuracy of the two-phase model for laminar convective heat transfer of nanofluids containing non-spherical nanoparticles, two new nanoparticle shape descriptors, flatness and elongation, were introduced. Compared with base fluid (water), nanofluids containing platelet shaped nanoparticles has the highest heat transfer enhancement, which is followed by nanofluids containing nanoparticles with cylinder, blade, sphere and brick shapes, respectively. Non-spherical nanoparticles with a suitable shape, small size and relatively high volume fraction are beneficial for enhancement of heat transfer in laminar forced convection. In developing region, a pair of Dean vortices formed and grew along the duct axis, which affected nanoparticle concentration distribution and heat and mass transfer. In fully developed region, convective heat transfer efficiencies of nanofluids are larger than 1 and vary with nanoparticle shape, size, volume fraction and Reynolds number. Enhancement of the convective heat transfer in nanofluids was attributed to the enhancement of effective thermal conductivity and effective viscosity, change of flow structure and reduction of thermal boundary layer thickness due to the presence of nanoparticles and their shapes. New correlations of Nusselt number and fraction factor with nanoparticle shape (sphericity, flatness and elongation), size and volume fraction were developed in order to predict convective heat transfer of nanofluids containing spherical and non-spherical nanoparticles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Convective heat transfer efficiency; Nanofluids; Nanoparticle shape; Two-phase approach","Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Ducts; Efficiency; Forced convection; Heat convection; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Nanoparticles; Reynolds number; Spheres; Thermal conductivity; Volume fraction; Convective heat transfer; Effective thermal conductivity; Enhancement of heat transfer; Forced convective heat transfer; Nanofluids; Nanoparticle concentrations; Nanoparticle shape; Two phase; Nanofluidics",2-s2.0-85029420391

Later, GE-based eutectic salt was prepared by dispersing 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 wt% of GE in the eutectic salt. It was observed that doping of GE has significantly enhanced the viscosity of base eutectic salt. This enhancement in GE-dispersed eutectic salt is mainly due to the presence of GE sheet network in the eutectic salt. Moreover, non-Newtonian behavior was observed for GE-dispersed eutectic salts at 70, 80 and 90 °C, whereas at 200 °C it behaves as a Newtonian fluid.

We propose a measurement method for the spatial SNR which is suitable for this purpose. It consists of measuring a series of images from which the spatial SNR is calculated. This allows a convenient and exact optimization of the SNR that does not rely on theoretical simplifications and is not specific to X-ray imaging. We demonstrate the measurement method for the example of choosing the optimal geometrical magnification for cone-beam inline X-ray phase contrast.

To achieve pollution emissions and energy reductions, this paper proposes a dynamic multi-objective mixed 0–1 model based on ecological coal mining, in which environmental technological investment and production adjustments are integrated into a dynamic system to seek ecological and economic equilibrium, and emissions reductions and energy conservation are controlled using double dynamic transfer equations. Different from previous papers, this model considers the effect of production adjustments and energy conservation on the environment and the economy with the aim of achieving global optimization through integrated planning. To solve the proposed model, a hybrid algorithm with a standard and an antithetic method-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSOs) is developed. A case study from Chaohua Colliery is presented to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization model.

The soil microbial fuel cell (MFC) simultaneously solves these problems with bioelectricity production. In this study, five types of surfactants were introduced to enhance the bioavailability of aged petroleum hydrocarbon in soils. The ampholytic surfactant (lecithos) was optimal due to the highest bioelectricity generation (0.321C d−1 g−1) and promoted hydrocarbon degradation (328%), while the nonionic (glyceryl monostearate) and cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) surfactants were inefficient. The surfactants induced a special microbial enrichment affiliated with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Acidobacteria (93%–99% of total) in soil MFCs.

The physicochemical properties of the modified (PAC-AS, PAC-AT and PAC-AC) and unmodified carbons (PAC) were systematically characterized. The nitrogen content, pHiep and basic foundational groups of the modified carbons increased however their surface areas decreased after modification. FTIR and XPS analyses revealed that N-containing groups such as [sbnd]NH, [sbnd]CONH[sbnd] and [sbnd]NH2 were effectively introduced on modified carbons' surfaces. Although PAC-AS and PAC-AT had lower surface area than PAC, their adsorption capacity were higher due to larger amount of N-containing groups. The adsorption kinetic data were simulated well by the Elovich equation and the equilibrium data were best fit to the Freundlich model for all PACs. The adsorption of AR 18 on PACs decreased with increasing pH values. The maximum AR 18 adsorption capacity followed an order of PAC-AS (115.93 mg/g) &gt; PAC-AT (104.23 mg/g) &gt; PAC (90.52 mg/g) &gt; PAC-AC (57.99 mg/g), indicating that AS and AT are promising activating agents for activated carbons to improve their AR18 adsorption performances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Acid red 18 dye; Adsorption; Microwave; N-containing functional groups; Organic acid ammonium","Activated carbon; Azo dyes; Chemical activation; Microwave irradiation; Microwaves; Organic acids; Solutions; Acid red; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption kinetics; Adsorption performance; Enhanced adsorptions; Phosphoric acid activation; Phragmites australis; Physicochemical property; Adsorption; acid red 18; activated carbon; ammonia; ammonium citrate; ammonium derivative; ammonium succinate; ammonium tartrate; carboxylic acid; dye; nitrogen; phosphoric acid; unclassified drug; adsorption; adsorption kinetics; aqueous solution; Article; chemical modification; chemical structure; controlled study; Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy; isotherm; mathematical model; microwave irradiation; microwave radiation; nonhuman; pH; Phragmites australis; physical chemistry; surface area; surface property; waste component removal; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85031716032

Density functional theory is used to identify representative ground and transition states of prototypical graphene clusters. In particular, we analyze the effect of heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen and boron) on the electron density distribution surrounding the carbon active sites. Hydrogen transfer, especially the much invoked quinone/hydroquinone transition, is found to be very sensitive to, and significantly facilitated by, their presence. Thus, for example, the energy barrier for H-transfer at an aromatic armchair edge is reduced from 84 kcal/mol to 61 kcal/mol in the presence of a phenolic group, and to 20 kcal/mol if a contiguous carbene-type site is available; in the presence of substitutional N and B the analogous barriers are 17 and 44 kcal/mol.

To alleviate these issues, an ideal strategy is developed to achieve active particle nanocrystallization and composite with conductive carbon materials, simultaneously. Therefore, ultrasmall Fe2GeO4 nanodots (∼4.6 nm) uniformly and tightly anchored on 3D interconnected N-doped ultrathin carbon nanosheets (3D Fe2GeO4/N-CNSs) were constructed via one-step high temperature calcination process.

As a result, the 3D Fe2GeO4/N-CNSs electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performances for both lithium-ion and sodium-ion battery anodes. When utilized for lithium-ion battery anode, the electrode delivered a highly reversible specific capacity (1280 mA h g−1 at 0.4 A g−1 after 180 cycles).

However, for many applications joint predictions of the multiple responses are needed. It is thereby not sufficient to validate the individual responses separately, which ignores correlation among multiple responses. Validation assessment for multiple responses involves comparison with multiple experimental measurements, which makes it much more complicated than that for single response. With considering both the uncertainty and correlation of multiple responses, this paper presents a new method for validation assessment of models with multivariate output. The new method is based on principal component analysis and the concept of area metric. The method is innovative in that it can eliminate the redundant part of multiple responses while reserving their main variability information in the assessment process. This avoids directly comparing the joint distributions of computational and experimental responses. It not only can be used for validating multiple responses at a single validation site, but also is capable of dealing with the case where observations of multiple responses are collected at multiple validation sites. The new method is examined and compared with the existing u-pooling and t-pooling methods through numerical and engineering examples to illustrate its validity and potential benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Area metric; Model validation; Multivariate output; Principal component analysis","Numerical methods; Area metric; Assessment process; Joint distributions; Model validation; Multivariate output; Potential benefits; Validation assessment; Variability information; Principal component analysis",2-s2.0-85031490246

An important policy question is how to optimally extract non-renewable resource stocks over time while taking possible substitutes and recycling into account. The present paper adds to the literature by developing a generic numerical optimisation model that can be used to simulate non-renewable resource management regimes and the effects of different policy instruments deployed at different stages of the resource's life cycle. By including recycling and substitution, the model extends the seminal cake-eating Hotelling model that dominates the non-renewable resource economics literature. In addition to being generically designed, the model can accommodate for non-competitive market settings, interacting policy instruments and environmental externalities at different stages of the material's life cycle.

Specimens from the trailing edge, middle, and leading edge positions of the tip, middle, and root sections on their hot (exterior) and cooled (interior) surfaces are analyzed for the precipitate size and morphology. The size and morphology are then linked to the temperature and stress/strain distribution in the blade. In general, the hot surfaces have larger precipitates that indicate a higher temperature exposure. In particular, the precipitate size is larger in the tip and middle sections than the root section, implying that the latter has a lower temperature.

The assessment was carried out on the basis of changes in selected physicochemical properties of engine oils occurring during actual operation. The direction and intensification of changes in such physicochemical properties as: the degree of oxidation, the degree of nitration, the degree of sulfonation, the carbon content, the basic number (TBN) and the percentage content of additives were analyzed.

The effect of residual chlorine, originating from the catalyst preparation procedures, on the activity and CO selectivity of the samples was demonstrated. It was shown that all Cl-containing Ni/CeO2 catalysts provided efficient CO cleanup. They provided the removal of CO from reformate gas to the level below 10 ppm with a selectivity up to 90%. The catalyst characterization by BET, XRD, XPS, HAADF-STEM, EDX-mapping, FTIR in situ and CO chemisorption techniques revealed that the decrease in chlorine content in the order Ni(Cl)/CeO2 ≥ Ni(Cl*)/CeO2 &gt; Ni/CeO2(Cl*) was accompanied by the increase of Ni dispersion that most likely provided high performance of Ni/CeO2(Cl*) in CO-SMET. The turnover frequencies of Ni surface atoms as well as activation energies in CO methanation were practically similar for all studied catalysts, indicating that Cl did not influence catalyst's activity and CO methanation proceeded by similar ways over Ni surface in both Cl-free and Cl-containing samples. The advanced performance of Cl-containing catalysts was associated with the inhibition of undesirable side reaction of CO2 methanation. The chlorine doping effect was attributed to the blockage of surface Ce3+-coupled oxygen vacancy sites by CeOCl species that inhibited ceria-assisted CO2 activation and hydrogenation. The CeO2 treatment with NH4Cl before Ni deposition allows to prepare highly active and selective CO-SMET catalyst with high nickel dispersion and Cl-modified ceria surface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cerium oxychloride; CO cleanup; Effect of chlorine doping; Hydrogen-rich gas; Nickel ceria catalysts; Reformate; Selective or preferential CO methanation","Activation energy; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Chemical activation; Chlorine; Deposition; Dispersions; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Oxygen vacancies; Ceria catalysts; Chlorine doping; CO cleanup; Co methanation; Hydrogen-rich gas; Oxychlorides; Reformates; Nickel",2-s2.0-85029677202

The use of these devices, however, exposes the users (“vapers”) and passive “vapers” to possible high concentration of fine and ultrafine particles (UFPs) which can deliver toxic and carcinogenic compounds. In the present work, an experimental campaign was carried out using dedicated instrumentation in order to characterize both the aerosol emitted from ECs and the exposure to second hand EC smoke in a typical indoor microenvironment in terms of particle number and surface area concentrations. Thus, the potential carcinogenic effects due to the inhalation of EC-generated aerosol was evaluated by means of an ad-hoc Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (ELCR) model able to take into account for the contribution of both sub-micron and super-micron particles, referring to the particle surface area, evaluated on the basis of their solid core only, by heating the aerosol at 300 °C. To this end, literature data of toxic compounds deposited on EC-generated particles (both with and without nicotine) and typical smoking behaviours of male and female Italian vapers were considered. The results showed that the particle number concentrations in EC mainstream aerosol (2.23–2.34×108 part. cm−3, mode at 34 nm) are higher than that in mainstream smoke of traditional cigarettes, while surface area concentrations in mainstream EC aerosol (2.48–3.35×1010 nm2 cm−3, at 300 °C)) are lower than that in traditional mainstream cigarettes smoke. The corresponding ELCR value of mainstream EC aerosol (6.11–7.26×10−6) is 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of mainstream traditional cigarettes smoke, and also lower than the guideline values defined by EPA and WHO.

This paper presents a novel method of synthesising the copper-manganese oxide (Hopcalite) catalyst that is used for the removal of volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases like carbon monoxide. Several samples prepared under different conditions, with and without ultrasound, were subjected to a series of characterisation tests such as XRD, BET, FE-SEM, EDX, TPR-H2, TGA and FT-IR in order to establish their chemical and physical properties. A series of catalytic tests using a micro-reactor were subsequently performed on the samples in order to substantiate the aforementioned properties by analysing their ability to oxidise compressed natural gas (CNG), containing methane and sulphur dioxide. Results showed that ultrasonic irradiation of the catalyst led to observable alterations in its morphology: surfaces of the particles were noticeably smoothed and an increased in amorphicity was detected. Furthermore, ultrasonic irradiation has shown to enhance the catalytic activity of Hopcalite, achieving a higher conversion of methane relative to non-sonicated samples. Varying the ultrasonic intensity also produced appreciable effects, whereby an increase in intensity results in a higher conversion rate. The catalyst sonicated at the highest intensity of 29.7 W/cm2 has a methane conversion rate of 13.5% at 400 °C, which was the highest among all the samples tested. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Co-precipitation; Copper manganese oxide; Methane oxidation; Sonochemical synthesis; Ultrasound","Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Characterization; Compressed natural gas; Copper; Coprecipitation; Greenhouse gases; Irradiation; Manganese; Manganese compounds; Methane; Oxides; Sonochemistry; Sulfur; Sulfur determination; Sulfur dioxide; Ultrasonics; Volatile organic compounds; Chemical and physical properties; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Conversion of methanes; Copper manganese oxides; Coprecipitation synthesis; Materials science and engineering; Methane oxidation; Sonochemical synthesis; Manganese oxide; copper; manganese oxide; methane; natural gas; sulfur dioxide; adsorption; Article; catalyst; desorption; field emission scanning electron microscopy; greenhouse gas; infrared spectroscopy; morphology; precipitation; priority journal; scanning transmission electron microscopy; surface area; synthesis; thermogravimetry; ultrasound; waste component removal; X ray diffraction",2-s2.0-85021647867

Golf ball like extended structures can be prepared in dilute oxalic solutions at 20 °C under high frequency ultrasound (200 kHz). An original approach carried out through iterative 3D reconstruction of sonicated surfaces is used to describe surface evolutions and characterize the formed microstructures. A combination of SEM, ICP-AES, contact-angle measurements, and 3D image analyses allows to characterize the roughness and mass loss evolutions, and investigate the mechanism of formation for such architectures. A screening of the sonication experiments clearly points out an ultrasound frequency dependency for the effects generated at the surface. 200 kHz sonication in 0.01 M oxalic acid provides an unprecedented manufacturing of Mg samples which result from a controlled and localized dissolution of the material and characterized by a strong wetting surface with a roughness of 170 nm. The additional formation of newly formed secondary phases appearing with surface dissolution progress is also deciphered.

Immobilization of zeolite into alginate foam converted macro-pores to meso-pores which lead to more compact structure. It resulted in less swollen composite in seawater medium and exhibited highly improved mechanical stability compared with alginate bead. Besides, Sr adsorption efficiency and selectivity were enhanced by immobilization of zeolite in alginate foam due to the increase of Sr binding sites (zeolite).

The five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) index is often used to determine the amount of BOM. However, standard BOD5 assays, centering on dissolved oxygen detection, have long testing times and often show severe deviation (error ≥ 15%). In the present study, the coulombic yield (Q) of a bio-electrochemical degradation process was determined, and a new index for BOM quantification was proposed. The Q value represents the quantity of transferred electrons from BOM to oxygen, and the corresponding index was defined as BOMQ. By revealing Q-BOM stoichiometric relationship, we were able to perform a BOMQ assay in a microbial fuel cell involved technical platform. Experimental results verified that 5–500 mg L−1 of BOMQ toward artificial wastewater samples could be directly obtained without calibration in several to dozens of hours, leaving less than 5% error. Moreover, the BOMQ assay remained accurate and precise in a wide range of optimized operational conditions. A ratio of approximately 1.0 between the values of BOMQ and BOD5 toward artificial and real wastewater samples was observed.

The resulting nanocomposites display much high photocatalytic activities for CO2 conversion and phenol degradation compared to bare α-Fe2O3 and g-C3N4.

We demonstrate that the ImMCs can significantly enhance the acid loading capability using the large lumens, bringing abundant proton-hopping sites and hence significantly enhanced proton conduction of membrane. In particular, 10 wt% ImMCs can afford a 78 wt% phosphoric acid loading and a consequent 75 times' increase of proton conductivity relative to the control membrane. Additionally, the cross-linked imidazole shells render membrane high acid retention ability. The acid release is almost stopped after immersing in water for 40 min, helping the membrane to retain as high as 62% of the initially loaded phosphoric acid. These features readily impart notably boosted hydrogen fuel cell performances to composite membrane under the desired conditions of elevated temperature and reduced humidity.

Specifically, many hollow carbon cells not only offer large void space for loading Te, giving rise to high mass loading of active materials, but also manifest a good contact between Te and carbon.

Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectra, Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are used for characterization of the PtPd-NPs/Cu2O-NPs/rGO. SEM images showed that vertical-standing arrays of Cu2O with an edge length up to 1 μm and thickness of about 20 nm are electrodeposited on the surface of rGO film. Also, PtPd needle-like NFs with visible and clear pricks totally covered the Cu2O-NSs/rGO surface.

Taking methanol oxidation as a catalytic reaction model in acidic medium, the catalytic activities of the prepared catalysts are studied through cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Interestingly, the proposed catalyst PtPd-NFs/Cu2O-NSs/rGO exhibited an outstanding electrocatalytic activity, lower onset potential and high level of poisoning tolerance toward methanol oxidation in acidic media. The obtained results can be ascribed to the synergetic effect between bimetallic PtPd, Cu2O, and rGO. Also, Cu2O nanostructure can be appeared as a catalytic mediator, facilitating the charge transfer and enhance the CO poisoning oxidation through spillover of OH to PtPd surface. Certainly, the unique shape and morphology of the Cu2O-NSs and PtPd-NFs have a significant influence on the catalytic behavior of the nanocomposite.

Chemical sensing also benefited, as many fluorophores that provide extreme sensitivity and selectivity absorb light in that region. Additionally, integration and smartphone-based sensing allow the sought portability and miniaturization for optosensor development. For manufacturing intrinsic O2-responsive GaN-based LEDs, we modified n-doped GaN substrates to tether a luminescent Ru(II) indicator dye. To achieve covalent attachment of the dye, the GaN surfaces were pre-activated with oxygen plasma and a ω-aminoalkyltrialkoxysilane layer was grown on top using each of six different silanes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) allow evaluation of the coating thickness and morphology. Single-photon timing (SPT) microscopy provides the luminescence lifetime (τ) of the resulting dye-silane-GaN smart hybrid materials. The emission of the surface-bound Ru(II) dye is quenched by n-GaN, yielding a τ of 0.60 μs for a 2.4 nm-thick 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane layer. Such quenching decreases exponentially with the silane layer thickness up to a τ of 2.30 μs (18 nm 4,7-diazaheptyltrimethoxysilane layer), thus confirming a previously suggested photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited dye to the semiconductor. After eliminating the disturbing PET, the O2 sensitivity of the modified GaN reaches a τN2/τO2 ratio of 1.8 for the thickest silane layer.

The Fuchs–Kliewer phonon of GaN(11¯00)–H gives rise to characteristic signatures of its single and multiple excitation in specular electron energy loss spectra. The loss intensities for multi-phonon scattering processes decrease according to a Poisson distribution. Vibrational spectra of this surface are invariant on the time scale of days reflecting its chemical passivation by the H layer. In contrast, vibrational spectra of pristine GaN(11¯00) are subject to a pronounced temporal evolution where spectroscopic weight is gradually shifted towards the multiple excitation of the Fuchs–Kliewer phonon. As a consequence, the monotonous decrease of the cross section for multiple quantum excitation as observed for the H-covered surface is not applicable. This remarkable effect is particularly strong in spectra acquired at low primary energies of incident electrons, which hints at processes occurring in the very surface region.

Their adsorptive desulfurization (ADS) performances were examined using dibenzothiophene from model fuels as an adsorbate. The results showed that the pore structure properties of these biochars are dominated by ZnCl2 chemical activation, the graphitization degrees are mainly governed by activation temperature, and the significantly increased surface acidic groups are primarily contributed from the HNO3 oxidation treatment. The biochar's abundant micropore characteristic is an indispensable prerequisite for its good ADS performance, and also its high graphitization degree and surface acidic groups play important roles in improving ADS performance.

Fluorescence emission spectra and XPS results confirm that existence of abundant zinc vacancies on ZnS. These zinc vacancies exhibit remarkable effects on modifying the electronic structure of ZnS as shown in UV–visible absorption spectra and Mott–Schottky plots. Zinc vacancies can raise valence band (VB) position that weaken the oxidative capacity of the holes to protect Zn-deficient ZnS from photocorrsion.

Five commercially available V2O5-WO3/TiO2 (VWTi) catalysts were tested. The degradation efficiency of PCDD/Fs in the simulated flue gas ranged 22.8–91.7% and was generally higher than that in the MSWI flue gas of 8.0–85.4%. The degradation efficiency of PCDD/Fs in the real flue gas of the MSWI plant was largely hindered by the complex composition of the flue gas, which could not be completely reproduced in the simulated laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the degradation of the higher chlorinated PCDD/Fs was easier compared to the lower chlorinated ones in the presence of the VWTi catalysts, which was primarily driven by the tendency of the higher chlorinated PCDD/Fs to be adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and further destructed due to their lower vapor pressure. In addition, powdered catalysts should be preferred over the honeycomb shaped ones as they exposed higher PCDD/Fs degradation efficiencies under equal reaction conditions. The chemical composition and a range of the relevant to the study properties of the catalysts, such as surface area, crystallinity, oxidation ability, and surface acidity, were analyzed.

The aim of this work is particularly to control the growth of ferrihydrite and consequently the morphology of hierarchical 3D nanostructured MCGO by a one-step facile ultrasonic chemical technique. In addition, this adsorbent is used to remove Disperse Blue 367(DB367) from dyeing effluent.

In addition, the growth mechanisms were also discussed. Eventually, the synthesized MCGO adsorbent has saturation magnetization of 120.06emu/g and an excellent DB367 adsorption capacity of 298.27 mg/g in 30 min.

Optical absorption, luminescence and thermal emission have been investigated as a function of the growth rate and the erbium content. From the luminescence characterization it can be concluded that erbium ions are present in the eutectic only in the garnet phase. Near infrared thermal emission has been measured at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1500 °C. Selective emission consisting of an emission band at 1540 nm and a weaker line at 970 nm, ascribed to the radiative de-excitation of the thermally excited Er3+ ions from the 4I13/2 and 4I11/2 multiplets to the 4I15/2 ground state respectively, has been detected in all the samples containing erbium. The influence of the erbium content, the microstructure and the temperature on the thermal emission has been investigated. The strongest selective emission has been obtained for samples with x=3 although it does not increase proportionally to the erbium content. The thermal emission becomes more intense when the temperature is increased but the selective emission seems to saturate at temperatures higher than 1300 °C. This effect is especially noticeable for x=3 and is attributed to thermally activated non-radiative de-excitation channels. It is suggested that these channels become effective through energy transfer among Er3+ ions and towards killers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Al2O3/Er3Al5O12; Directionally solidified eutectic ceramics; Optical absorption; Selective emitters; Thermophotovoltaic","Electromagnetic wave absorption; Energy transfer; Erbium; Eutectics; Excited states; Garnets; Ground state; Infrared devices; Ions; Light absorption; Luminescence; Microstructure; Al2O3/Er3Al5O12; Directionally solidified; Directionally solidified eutectics; Laser floating zone methods; Selective emissions; Selective emitters; Thermally activated; Thermophotovoltaics; Solidification",2-s2.0-85030169238

The samples were used as basic catalysts for aldol condensation of furfural and acetone. A relationship between physico-chemical properties and catalytic performance of potassium-containing Y zeolites was established using XRD, N2 physisorption, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO2‎ and CO2-TPD. Neither ion-exchange nor impregnation with KNO3 removed completely all acid sites in Y (Si/Al = 2.5). Moreover, K2O clusters were not formed under thermal activation of the samples prepared from the parent H-Y(2.5). As a consequence, both ion-exchanged and impregnated K-Y(2.5) possessed low activity in aldol condensation, but they had high ability to dehydrate reaction products. In contrast, thermal activation of USY zeolites (Si/Al = 15 and 40) impregnated with potassium resulted in the formation of K2O species which, according to CO2-IR spectroscopy and CO2-TPD, were strong basic sites. It was concluded that the lower amount of proton sites available for an ion-exchange together with the ‎larger mesopore volume and more defective crystalline framework promoted the accumulation of KNO3 in the USY zeolites during the impregnation step. Subsequently, K2O species were formed by thermal treatment. Impregnated and calcined USY zeolites possessed a superior catalytic activity in comparison with HY (Si/Al = 2.5). The presence of K2O species as strong basic sites in K-impregnated USY zeolites was favorable for both the high activity of the catalysts in aldol condensation and the occurrence of the second condensation step. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aldol condensation; Biomass; Dealumination; Furfural; Potassium; Y zeolite","Acetone; Aldehydes; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Catalysts; Chemical activation; Chemical properties; Condensation; Condensation reactions; Furfural; Impregnation; Ions; Ketones; Potassium; Silicon; Spacecraft instruments; Zeolites; Aldol condensation; Catalytic performance; Dealumination; Physicochemical property; Preparation method; Second condensation; Thermal activation; Y zeolites; Ion exchange",2-s2.0-85029637323

We consider the module of the Short Term Discrete Fourier Transform (STDFT) spectra obtained from the particular vibration sensors signal utterance as the 2D textured image. This is done by identifying the time scale of STDFT as the first dimension, and the frequency scale as the second dimension of the particular textured image. The obtained textured image is then divided into particular 2D texture patches, covering a part of the frequency range of interest.

The limit of detection for enrofloxacin in both matrices was 5 ng/mL and the assay time was 2 h. Further, the change in glucose concentration could be determined qualitatively by the naked eye using glucose test strips for high-throughput screening. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Enrofloxacin; Personal glucose meter","Bacteria; Escherichia coli; Metabolism; Physiology; Anti-bacterial activity; Bacterial metabolism; Enrofloxacin; Escherichia coli (E. coli); Glucose concentration; Glucose consumption; High throughput screening; Limit of detection; Glucose",2-s2.0-85026749411

The study of nonlinear effects in artificial media and engineering the nonlinear response of such media are crucially important for this progress. In the context of photonic integration, for instance, metamaterials promise pathways for light that are impossible in normal materials and offer new freedom in exploiting nonlinear processes. By incorporating nonlinear and tunable metamaterials, it will be possible to create functional metamaterials that display sensitive tuning and novel or enhanced nonlinear behavior.

The Bunsen reaction in the cycle dominates the following HI and H2SO4 decomposition section and even the whole SI flowsheet. In this work, the detailed kinetics of the Bunsen reaction at practical condition with HI recycled was studied. The effects of operating temperature and initial HI concentration on the overall reaction rate were explored. A SO4 2- production rate model was proposed based on three elementary reactions, and well described the kinetic process of Bunsen reaction. Both theoretical and experimental results indicated that increasing the initial HI concentration (0–3.08 mol/kgH2O) or operating temperature (303–358 K) enhanced the reaction rate, including the earlier appearance of liquid separation and thermodynamic equilibrium. But the recycled HI should be controlled within 6.17 mol/kgH2O, so as to make the separation of H2SO4 and HIx phase possible. The calculated apparent activation energy for kinetics-controlled reactions (4) and (5) were 8.536 and 21.516 kJ/mol, respectively.

In this research, a method has been proposed to simulate the release of natural gas from the rupture of high-pressure pipelines in any terrain. The process of gas releases from the rupture of a high-pressure pipeline is divided into three stages, namely the discharge, jet, and dispersion stages. Firstly, a discharge model is established to calculate the release rate of the orifice. Secondly, an improved jet model is proposed to obtain the parameters of the pseudo source. Thirdly, a fast-modeling method applicable to any terrain is introduced. Finally, based upon these three steps, a dispersion model, which can take any terrain into account, is established. Then, the dispersion scenarios of released gas in four different terrains are studied. Moreover, the effects of pipeline pressure, pipeline diameter, wind speed and concentration of hydrogen sulfide on the dispersion scenario in real terrain are systematically analyzed.

The elemental composition, morphology, and hydrophilicity of the synthesized PA-GO membrane were characterized to confirm intra- and inter-crosslinking reactions and understand membrane properties.

It reveals that the thermal conductivity of hybrid structure increases linearly with the length. Due to the different phonon properties between GNT and CNT, the thermal conductivity of hybrid structure appears as a sharp drop in comparison with the pure CNT. By controlling the percentage of GNT, this hybrid structure exhibits tunable thermal transport behaviors. Moreover, a dramatically thermal rectification phenomenon is observed when applying a tensile strain along the heat flow direction.

The objective of this study is to develop a program to predict the diffusion and migration processes of pollutants after water pollution accidents and apply it to the Heshangshan drinking water source area. Taking Cd as a typical pollutant, the results indicated that Cd concentrations at the water intake reached a maximum value of 1.2490 × 104 mg/L at 14.08 min after a hypothetical accident, and the time when the area lost the function of drinking water supply was from 8.35 min to 24.23 min after the accident. Regarding the drinking water source area, the Cd concentration exceeded the related standard during the period from 7.29 min to 41.47 min after the accident, which indicated that it was polluted seriously by the accident for that duration. Moreover, the pollutant entered into the study area at 7.00 min after the accident and had passed through at 45.63 min after the accident, which demonstrated that emergency measures should be taken for this duration.

In this method, products were electrodeposited on a stainless steel (316L) cathode from an additive-free 0.005 M Fe(NO3)3/FeCl2/SmCl3 aqueous electrolyte. The structural characterizations through X-ray diffraction, field-emission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray indicated that the deposited material has Sm3+-doped magnetite particles with average size of 20 nm.

This study was aimed at developing predictive models for determining whether patient LOS is within the standard LOS after surgery. This study analyzed the complete historical medical records and lab data of 896 clinical cases involving surgeries performed by general surgery physicians. The cases were divided into urgent operation (UO) and non-UO groups to develop a prolonged LOS prediction model using several supervised learning techniques. Several critical factors for the two groups were identified using the gain ratio technique. The results indicated that the random forest method yielded the most accurate and stable prediction model. Additionally, comorbidity, body temperature, blood sugar, and creatinine were the most influential variables for prolonged LOS in the UO group, whereas blood transfusion, blood pressure, comorbidity, and the number of ICU admissions were the most influential variables in the non-UO group. This study shows that supervised learning techniques are suitable for analyzing patient medical records in accurately predicting a prolonged LOS; thus, the clinical decision support system developed based on the prediction models may serve as reference tools for communicating with patients before surgery. The system may also assist physicians when making decisions regarding whether patients require more clinical care, thereby improving patient safety. © 2016 The Authors.

This study analytically and numerically investigated the behavior of thermal waves based on the Cattaneo-Vernotte model at an ideal interface. A stable, fast algorithm based on the alternative direction implicit method is introduced to solve the two-dimensional heat conduction problem. When thermal waves meet with an ideal interface, some energy is reflected back while the rest is conveyed across the interface, which are called the reflection and refraction of thermal waves. The changes of the profile and direction and the energy distribution between the reflection and refraction of the thermal waves are studied both analytically and numerically. Regardless of the boundary conditions imposed on the interface, the reflection angle is always identical to the incident angle, and the ratio of the sine of the refraction angle of the thermal waves to that of the incident angle is equal to the ratio of the thermal wave speeds in the two material layers. A theoretical equation to describe the relationships between the energy distribution and the material thermal properties shows that the thermal wave speeds in the materials, the specific heat and the incident angle determine the thermal energy transmittance ratio. Total reflection can occur for some conditions, and the nature of the energy conveyed by thermal waves is interesting and instructive. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative direction implicit method; Energy distribution; Ideal interface; Reflection and refraction; Thermal wave","Computerized tomography; Heat conduction; Refraction; Specific heat; Alternative direction implicit methods; Energy distributions; Non-Fourier effects; Reflection and refractions; Theoretical equation; Thermal wave; Transmittance ratio; Two-dimensional heat conduction problems; Interfaces (materials)",2-s2.0-85029500061

NOx emission yields from neat torrefied biomass were mildly higher than those from raw biomass, as the latter had higher nitrogen content per unit mass. There was no discernible trend in NOx emissions from the blends based on their nitrogen contents. HCl emission from torrefied corn straw was lower than that from its raw precursor, as the former had a lower chlorine content. The HCl emission yields from the blends of corn straw with coal were much higher than those from neat coal combustion. Finally, the HCl emission yield from blends of the high-sulfur coal with corn straw were higher than those from the blends of the same biomass with the low-sulfur coal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2; Coal-biomass blends; HCl; NOx; Pollutant emissions; Raw and torrefied biomass; SO2","Biomass; Bituminous coal; Blending; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Fuels; Gas emissions; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Acid gas emissions; Co-firing biomass; Drop tube furnaces; High heating rates; Hydrogen chloride; Linear Interpolation; Pollutant emission; Subbituminous coal; Coal combustion",2-s2.0-85029716251

For compressed natural gas (CNG) in SI engines, there is an engine efficiency sacrifice at low loads and high levels of hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions which cannot be solved without using after-treatment equipment. This equipment, however, is very expensive. Therefore, an additional fuel can enhance the characteristics of the combustion of natural gas, which can be added in the intake charge. Hydrogen is an effective gas for enhancing the flame rate regarding combustion in an SI-CNG engine, in addition to increasing engine stability. Small amounts of hydrogen improve performance and reduce exhaust emissions. Thus, a number of investigators have carried out research studies on SI engines with different ratios of HCNG. This paper is comprehensive overview of CNG, H2 and HCNG blends. The main topics discussed consist of the combustion fundamentals of natural gas, hydrogen and hydrogen-natural gas mixture. Natural gas and hydrogen usage as fuels and their characteristics have been analysed. The storage of hydrogen and HCNG is still challenging researchers and, therefore, their storage has been taken into consideration. Moreover, a comprehensive review has been performed of HCNG blends in order to understand the effect of hydrogen enriched CNG on performance and the emissions of SI engines. The combustion characteristics of HCNG engines are strongly dependent on the conditions of the engine. The air-fuel ratio, the time of injection, the compression ratio and speed play a major role in blending HCNG in an SI engine and have been discussed in this article. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuel; Diesel; Emissions; HCNG; Hydrogen; Natural gas; Performance","Alternative fuels; Blending; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Compression ratio (machinery); Engines; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Ignition; Internal combustion engines; Natural gas; Particulate emissions; Combustion characteristics; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Diesel; HCNG; Improve performance; Performance; Performance and emissions; Storage of hydrogen; Compressed natural gas",2-s2.0-85029720001

The lack of lattice translational symmetry of the vector potential in the presence of the magnetic field is considered by redefining the Green's function in terms of the Peierls’ phase factor. The equation of motion of the Green's function as a function of a magnetic wave vector was solved using perturbation theory, leading to expressions for the effective mass and the g-factor. We study the electronic structure of wurtzite GaN theoretically using the resulting k→·π→ method, where k→ is the electronic wave vector and π→ is the relativistic momentum operator by considering the conduction band edge and three valence bands. The k→·π→ Hamiltonians for the conduction band edge and the valence bands are diagonalized, considering the conduction band and one valence band at a time. We obtain electron and hole dispersions. Effects of other bands are considered by using perturbation theory. Resulting dispersions agree with the results of other calculations. In order to study the effective mass and the g-factor, we use the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained after the diagonalization.

The motivation was to improve the chronology of this recent section in connection with significant fluctuations observed in sediment accumulation rates, particle size distribution and primordial radioisotope (i.e. 40K and 232Th) composition. Previously only an extrapolation of a broad-range OxCal age-depth model, which was based on 8 AMS radiocarbon dates from the deeper part of a parallel sediment sequence and tentatively validated for the upper part using the double peaks of the 137Cs activity concentration distribution, was available for the studied section (1–24 cm). Parallel to the previous 137Cs measurement, 210Pb and 226Ra (for a more detailed, 210Pbex-based chronology), 241Am (for an additional time-marker), as well as 40K and 232Th concentrations have also been determined by gamma-spectrometry. In case of the 210Pbex-based chronology, due to a large deviation from a pure exponential distribution, the Constant Flux (CF) model has been used for the calculation of sediment ages and accumulation rates. Although the broad-range OxCal and the CF model were broadly similar down to 22 cm, the 210Pbex-based ages are clearly superior in terms of uncertainty in the uppermost 12 cm, while the broad-range model has smaller uncertainty below 20 cm (&gt;150 years). The CF model gave an average mass accumulation rate of (0.08 ± 0.03) g cm−2 yr−1 for sections 0–11 cm, and (0.03 ± 0.01) g cm−2 yr−1 for sections 12–22 cm, respectively. Significant changes have been observed in the depth distribution of both the particle size distribution and the elemental/isotopic composition of the sediment record, most likely related to the variation observable in the intensity and volume of precipitation in the catchment.

This study investigated the effect of ball milling at cryogenic temperatures on the reactivity and structure of Al–Ni composites. Stoichiometric mixtures of Al and Ni powders were milled both at room temperature and cooled by liquid nitrogen. Products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and x-ray diffraction. Aluminum and nickel were mixed on a finer scale in cryogenically milled powders compared to those prepared at room temperature. DSC traces of the cryogenically milled powder showed three exothermic peaks, while only two clearly resolved peaks were observed for the powders milled at room temperature. A low-temperature reaction preceding the first peak was detected only for the cryomilled material. Apparent activation energies, obtained by model-free analysis, were consistent with previous work on nanofoils. Ignition temperatures of powders prepared at room temperature decreased with increasing structural refinement. This effect was even stronger for the cryogenically milled powder. Energetic characteristics of the prepared materials were correlated with their respective structural refinement.

The effect of Ni/Co ratios on catalytic activity for HA degradation was further investigated, in which NiCo2O4 was proven to be the most efficient toward HA degradation (90% at 120 min vs. 50% for Co3O4 under the same conditions). Finally, the possible reaction mechanism was discussed, in which 1O2, SO4 [rad]− and [rad]OH, especially 1O2 as the dominant active oxygen species were identified and involved the catalytic process. Hence, PMS oxidation over NiCo2O4 provides a promising alternative for HA degradation due to its efficient catalytic activity. © 2017","Bimetal catalyst; Degradation; Humic acid; NiCo2O4; Peroxymonosulfate",,2-s2.0-85028608258

This paper presents a mathematical thermal model for predicting the drilling temperature in lunar regolith exploration. The proposed model combines a unique heat balance equation for the system of the drill tool and the drilled cuttings. Modeling of the drill tool-cuttings system assumes an axial temperature distribution along the drill tool and one-dimensional transient heat transfer problem in a semi-infinite plane is employed to calculate the temperature. Geometric features of the drill tool, thermal and mechanical properties of the drill tool and lunar regolith, drilling parameters, and penetration force are taken into consideration in the model. The theoretical investigation addresses the significance of heat generation by the penetration force and heat dissipation by the drilled cuttings. Convolution is utilized to establish the heat transfer processes along the drill tool. Using the presented thermal model, a thermal property test bed was employed to simulate drilling in an evacuated lunar environment, and experimental and computational temperatures were compared in penetrating a lunar regolith simulant with different drilling parameters. Experimental results indicated that the theoretical model was effective in predicting the drilling temperature in sampling the lunar regolith simulant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Drill bit; Heat transfer; Lunar exploration; Lunar soil simulant; Temperature prediction","Bits; Drills; Forecasting; Heat transfer; Lunar surface analysis; Moon; One dimensional; Soil testing; Temperature measurement; Thermography (temperature measurement); Heat balance equations; Heat transfer process; Lunar soil simulant; Mathematical thermal models; Temperature prediction; Theoretical investigations; Thermal and mechanical properties; Transient heat transfer; Lunar missions",2-s2.0-85029666145

We found that [EMIM][PF6] and [PMIM][PF6] exist in the solid state at room temperature. Hence, these ILs can effectively avoid the leakage of electrolytes. However, [BMIM][PF6] can be present in liquid state at room temperature as the melting point decreases, due to the increasing of alkyl chain (Cn, n &lt; 6) for the ILs. Compared to solid electrolyte gas sensors, sensors based on liquid electrolytes offer a reliable response and achieve sufficient ion mobility to sense oxygen.

Nitridation of the cleaned GaAs substrate was performed using N2 plasma source. Two approaches have been combined. Firstly, an AR-XPS (Angle Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) study is carried out to determine the chemical environments of the Ga, As and N atoms and the composition depth profile of the GaN thin film which allow us to summarize the nitridation process in three steps. Moreover, the temperature and time treatment have been investigated and show a significant impact on the formation of the GaN layer. The second approach is a refined growth kinetic model which better describes the GaN growth as a function of the nitridation time.

This paper reports an investigation into the mechanical stability of OSCs through bending and torsion testing of whole printed modules. Two types of modules are used that differ slightly in thickness as well as on the basis of the electrode materials: silver nanowires or carbon-based inks. Each type of module is subjected to two different mechanical modes of deformation, bending and torsion, of several thousand cycles per module using a purpose-built robotic device. Analysis of the distribution of stress in the devices performed by finite-element modeling predicts the locations of failure. Failure upon bending originates at the laser-cut edges of the modules from shear at the clamp/module interface leading to crazing of the plastic barrier encapsulant foils. This crazing leads to eventual delamination due first to decohesion of the active layer at the edge of the modules and later to deadhesion between the PEDOT:PSS (electrode) and P3HT:PCBM (semiconductor) layers. The torsion mode imposes greater stresses than the bending mode and thus leads to failure at fewer strain cycles. Failure during torsion occurs through crack propagation initiated at stress concentrations on the edges of the module that were imposed by their rectangular geometry and ultimately leads to bifurcation of the entire module. Rather than the differences in electrode materials, the differences in survivability between the two types of modules are attributed mostly to the thickness of the substrate materials used, with the thinner substrate used in the carbon-based modules (~160 µm) failing at fewer strain cycles than the substrate used in the silver-nanowire-based modules (~190 µm). Taken together, the results suggest ways in which the lifetimes of devices can be extended by the layouts of modules and choices of materials. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Barrier encapsulation; Conjugated polymer; Cyclic fatigue testing; Flexible electronics; Mechanical stability; Organic solar cell","Conducting polymers; Conjugated polymers; Crazing; Deformation; Electric resistance measurement; Electrodes; Failure (mechanical); Fatigue testing; Finite element method; Flexible electronics; Mechanical stability; Nanostructured materials; Nanowires; Organic solar cells; Polymer solar cells; Silver; Solar cells; Substrates; Torsion testing; Torsional stress; Cyclic bending; Electrode material; Mechanical deformation; Rectangular geometry; Robotic devices; Silver nanowires; Substrate material; Thinner substrates; Bending (deformation)",2-s2.0-85027893674

The PV-PCM configuration was numerically analysed in order to investigate the main performance parameters and its general thermal behaviour regarding passive cooled photovoltaic panels (a simplified one-dimensional finite difference code was applied for the numerical investigation). Two specific PV-PCM systems were compared (convectional organic PCM and pork fat), i.e. their performance response was examined by applying the simplified numerical model. Performance analysis was obtained for specific geographical location with Mediterranean climate conditions (City of Split, Croatia). The obtained results showed that there is no significant difference in performance benefit when the two considered PV-PCM systems are compared. The difference in annual simulated electricity delivery is negligible when comparing the PV-PCM systems, i.e. it was slightly less for the PV-pork fat configuration. The previous finding was important as it proved that pork fat has potential from a performance point of view. A general economic aspect was also addressed in order to check the pork fat's economic viability as a PCM material. It was found that in order to get reasonable LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity), the pork fat unit price should be below 0.50 €/kg for specific considered case. Regarding the current market price of pork fat, the considered passive cooling option is currently not economically viable for the general given circumstances. However, economic viability could be established in the case of active cooling configurations where waste heat could be utilized and which could lead to a more favourable LCOE. The main issue with pork fat is one related to the long-term degradation of its physical properties which certainly requires intense further experimental investigation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","LCOE; Numerical investigation; Passive cooling; PCM; Photovoltaics; Pork fat","Costs; Phase change materials; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Pulse code modulation; Waste heat; Experimental investigations; Geographical locations; LCOE; Levelized cost of electricities; Numerical investigations; Passive cooling; Photovoltaic applications; Photovoltaics; Meats",2-s2.0-85032004630

Reactive Bipolar Pulsed Dual Magnetron Sputtering (BPDMS) operating in mid-frequency range is a powerful technique for the deposition of dense coatings, free from morphological defects, at high deposition rate. In fact, the employ of mid-frequency voltage reversals allows suppressing arcs and, as a consequence, stabilizing the reactive sputtering process. Despite the success of the dual bipolar process, there are many aspects of this complex process that are not yet well understood, such as the influence of the target voltage waveforms and plasma parameters on the film growth. In order to fill this lack of knowledge, ZrN films were deposited by BPDMS with different voltage waveforms on the Zr targets and the influence of these deposition parameters on the films’ stoichiometry as well as on their structural and mechanical properties is investigated in this paper. In particular, it was found that, for duty cycle values below 33%, the hardness of the coating increases up to 31 GPa. The analysis of the chemical composition, performed by XPS, detects an almost constant value of stoichiometry along the depth-profile of each film and the N:Zr ratio increases from 1.06 to 1.20 as the duty cycle decreases. Therefore, when the N:Zr ratio is 1.06 we got a stoichiometric ZrN compound, while for N:Zr equal to 1.20 we obtained a lack of Zr atoms with respect to N atoms.

The ZnO-loaded honeycombs were characterized using FESEM, EDX and XRD indicating that the immobilized layer of nanostructured ZnO was highly-crystalline with a thickness of ∼1 µm. The synthesized nanostructured ZnO-loaded honeycombs and a commercial ZnO sorbent were applied for removal of sulfur compounds (H2S and COS) from syngas at 400 °C. The ZnO-nS showed significantly longer breakthrough time (BTTS) and higher total sulfur sorption capacity (48.7 mg g−1 ZnO, BTTS = 75.4 min) than the ZnO-nR (9–12 mg g−1 ZnO, BTTS = 23–25 min) and commercial ZnO sorbent (4.6 mg g−1 ZnO, BTTS = 6.8 min). The superior sorption capacity of ZnO-nS was attributed to the significantly better surface coverage and higher crystallinity of ZnO nanosheets on the honeycomb. The introduction of additional ZnO nanosheets layers (up to 3 layers) through repeated growth process increased the ZnO loading to ∼1.5 ± 0.1 mg mm−1 (from ∼0.9 ± 0.1 mg mm−1 in the single layer) but resulted in poorer performance (11.6 mg g−1 ZnO, BTTS = 24.6 min) compared to ZnO-nS. This was due to the increased internal mass transfer resistance and decreased density of the effective reactive sites. The mechanism of ZnO-nS formation is also proposed to provide further insights. Overall, the ZnO-nS showed better regenerability, lower mass transfer resistance, and higher sorption capacity compared to the commercial ZnO and ZnO-nR sorbents indicating that it has a promising potential for syngas desulfurization. © 2017 The Authors","Gasification; H2S removal; Honeycomb; Nanostructured ZnO; Syngas; ZnO nanosheets","Desulfurization; Gasification; Honeycomb structures; Mass transfer; Nanorods; Nanosheets; Silicate minerals; Sorption; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Synthesis gas; H2S removal; Honeycomb; Nanostructured ZnO; Syn-gas; ZnO nanosheets; Zinc oxide",2-s2.0-85030089618

In order to investigate these effects, a comprehensive analysis of velocity and temperature on the selected planes and points inside the domain were performed. Results showed that with an increase in seeds within the reactor, the flow slowed down more, the turbulence intensity reduced, and the extent of temperature inversion increased.

We investigate adsorption/desorption of cesium in both binary (Cs + one mineral) and ternary (Cs + two minerals) experiments to study component additivity and sorption reversibility over long time periods (500 days). Binary Cs sorption experiments were performed with illite, montmorillonite, and kaolinite in a 5 mM NaCl/0.7 mM NaHCO3 solution (pH 8) and Cs concentration range of 10–3 to 10–11 M. The binary sorption experiments were followed by batch desorption experiments. The sorption behavior was modeled with the FIT4FD code and the results used to predict desorption behavior. Sorption to montmorillonite and kaolinite was linear over the entire concentration range but sorption to illite was non-linear, indicating the presence of multiple sorption sites. Based on the 14 day batch desorption data, cesium sorption appeared irreversible at high surface loadings in the case of illite but reversible at all concentrations for montmorillonite and kaolinite. A novel experimental approach, using a dialysis membrane, was adopted in the ternary experiments, allowing investigation of the effect of a second mineral on Cs desorption from the original mineral. Cs was first sorbed to illite, montmorillonite or kaolinite, then a 3.5–5 kDalton Float-A-Lyzer® dialysis bag with 0.3 g of illite was introduced to each experiment inducing desorption. Nearly complete Cs desorption from kaolinite and montmorillonite was observed over the experiment, consistent with our equilibrium model, indicating complete Cs desorption from these minerals. Results from the long-term ternary experiments show significantly greater Cs desorption compared to the binary desorption experiments. Approximately ~ 45% of Cs desorbed from illite. However, our equilibrium model predicted ~ 65% desorption. Importantly, the data imply that in some cases, slow desorption kinetics rather than permanent fixation may play an important role in apparent irreversible Cs sorption. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Desorption; Irreversibility; Permeable membrane; Ternary system","Bins; Clay minerals; Desorption; Dialysis; Dialysis membranes; Kaolinite; Minerals; Sorption; Ternary systems; Adsorption/desorption; Batch desorption experiments; Concentration ranges; Experimental approaches; Irreversibility; Permeable membranes; Sorption and desorptions; Sorption experiments; Cesium; aluminum silicate; cesium 137; illite; inorganic compound; montmorillonite; unclassified drug; adsorption; cesium; concentration (composition); desorption; illite; kaolinite; membrane; montmorillonite; reaction kinetics; adsorption kinetics; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; desorption; membrane permeability; nonlinear system; priority journal",2-s2.0-85027402095

For all investigated solutes (benzene-D0 and -D6, toluene-D0, -D5, and -D8, cyclohexane-D0 and -D12), there was no significant observable fractionation effect between nondeuterated and perdeuterated isotopologues, resulting in a ratio of diffusion coefficients Dlight: Dheavy = 1.00 ± 0.01. In addition, isotope fractionation due to equilibrium partitioning of solutes between water and n-octane or gas phase was measured. The deuterated compounds are more hydrophilic than their light isotopologues in all cases, giving rise to fractionation coefficients αHpart = Koctane/water,H: Koctane/water,D = 1.085 to 1.15.

To understand how the physical properties of the constituents (e.g. matrix toughness and ductility) and the architecture of reinforcement (woven-ply) affect the fracture behavior of C/PPS laminates, it is useful to have analytical representation of the translaminar failure modes based on fracture mechanics concepts, the strain energy release rate G especially. Translaminar failure is determined by the combination of loading, location of defect and material heterogeneity (presence of matrix-rich regions at the crimp area in woven-ply laminates). When translaminar failure is initiated from an existing notch, a sequence of energy-absorbing events (fiber breakage, matrix cracking, fibers pull-out, fiber/matrix debonding) occurs in a region surrounding the notch tip. The knowledge of energy-absorbing processes is therefore important since they are responsible for the toughness of the composite. Depending on laminates' stacking sequence, the contribution of matrix behavior to strain energy release rate can be evaluated during damage in both brittle and ductile composite laminates subjected to high temperature conditions (T &gt; Tg) when matrix ductility and toughness are enhanced. Depending on the initial notch orientation (0 or 45°), the failure mode is either a mode I or a mixed mode (I + II). The acoustic energy associated with translaminar failure was correlated with the strain energy release rate during translaminar failure. The total strain energy release rate in quasi-isotropic (QI) laminates is 6 times as low as in angle-ply (AP) laminates, suggesting that large plastic deformation (due to a matrix-driven behavior and an enhanced matrix ductility at T &gt; Tg) are instrumental in dissipating a great portion of the mechanical energy brought to the specimen in AP laminates. The “material” effect is combined with a structural one (rotation of the fibers) at the crack tip, and leads to ductile failure. Both effects contribute to high fracture toughness in AP laminates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic emission; Damage mechanics; Fracture toughness; Mechanical testing; Thermoplastic resin","Acoustic emissions; Carbon; Crack tips; Cracks; Ductility; Energy absorption; Energy release rate; Failure modes; Fibers; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Fracture testing; Fracture toughness; Laminated composites; Laminates; Mechanical testing; Plastic laminates; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Strain energy; Strain rate; Thermoplastics; Weaving; Damage mechanics; Ductile composites; High temperature condition; Large plastic deformation; Material heterogeneity; Mechanical energies; Polyphenylene sulphide; Reinforced thermoplastics; Acoustic emission testing",2-s2.0-85029163708

Two technologies were considered in the assessment: organosolv of spruce woodchips (2nd generation) and corn wet milling (1st generation). Process models were developed to generate relevant data to assess the technical performance and derive inputs for the economic and environmental assessments. The economic assessment was carried out using Net Present Value (NPV) as indicator, while the environmental assessment followed a prospective cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) for 5 impact categories. The results indicate that when organosolv is integrated with an anaerobic digestion unit, the net energy requirements are lower than those of the wet milling process to produce an equivalent flowrate of C6 sugars. Assuming equivalent C6 sugar prices for the two technologies (300 €/t), the corn based technology shows positive NPV (178 M€) and lowest fixed capital investment requirements (55 M€). The organosolv technology (coupled to anaerobic digestion) also shows positive NPV (238 M€) at base case lignin prices (630 €/t), but higher fixed capital investment needs (236 M€). The economics of the organosolv process were found to be highly sensitive to sugar and lignin yields and prices as well as biomass feedstock costs. From an environmental perspective, the organosolv based routes show relatively better performance than corn wet milling, with 3 categories including climate change and non-renewable energy use showing lower impacts and 2 showing potentially higher impacts. Overall, the organosolv process (2nd generation) shows better performance from an environmental point of view in addition to a positive NPV. However, the inherent risks of new technologies and high investments associated with the 2nd generation technologies assessed in this work, mean that significant additional development, coupled with appropriate government support, are likely necessary before full-scale implementation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","C6 sugar; Corn wet milling; Environmental assessment; Lignin; Organosolv; Techno-economic assessment","Anaerobic digestion; Climate change; Costs; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental management; Investments; Life cycle; Lignin; Milling (machining); Sugars; Economic and environmental assessments; Environmental assessment; Full-scale implementation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Non-renewable energy use; Organosolv; Techno-economic assessment; Wet milling; Risk assessment",2-s2.0-85032001247

The analytically found zero-diffusion condition defines the state of thermal equilibrium at the surface. The diffusion of a water-like dipole molecule in the potential of graphite surface is simulated in the field-free conditions and in the presence of the alternating electric fields of various magnitude intensities and frequencies. Temperature dependence of the correction function exhibits field-induced variations of the effective Lennard-Jones energy parameter. It demonstrates maximum departure from the zero-field value at certain frequencies and intensities, which is associated with variations in the rotational dynamics. A concept of the amplitude–frequency resonance put forward to interpret the simulation results is explained using a heuristic reasoning and is corroborated by semi-quantitative considerations in terms of the Dissado–Hill cluster theory of dielectric relaxation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Desorption; Diffusion; Nonthermal microwave effects; Surface potential","Adsorption; Desorption; Dielectric relaxation; Differential equations; Electric fields; Equations of motion; Molecules; Stochastic systems; Surface potential; Temperature distribution; Alternating electric field; Deterministic component; Effective diffusion coefficients; Microwave electric field; Non-thermal microwaves; Stochastic differential equations; Temperature dependence; Translational diffusion; Diffusion",2-s2.0-85030715321

The past few decades have witnessed noticeable advances in the fundamental understanding of the mechanics of soft biological tissues. Furthermore, computational biomechanics, with an ever-increasing number of publications, has now become a third pillar of investigation, next to theory and experiment. In the present chapter we provide a brief review of some constitutive frameworks and related computational models with the potential to predict the clinically relevant phenomena of rupture of soft biological tissues. Accordingly, Euler-Lagrange equations are presented in regard to a recently developed crack phase-field method (CPFM) for soft tissues. The theoretical framework is supplemented by some recently documented numerical results, with a focus on evolving failure surfaces that are predicted by a range of different failure criteria. A peel test of arterial tissue is analyzed using the crack phase-field approach. Subsequently, discontinuous models of tissue rupture are described, namely the cohesive zone model (CZM) and the extended finite element method (XFEM). Traction-separation laws used to determine the crack growth are described, together with the kinematic and numerical foundations. Simulation of a peel test of arterial tissue is then presented for both the CZM and the XFEM. Finally we provide a critical discussion and overview of some open problems and possible improvements of the computational modeling concepts for soft tissue rupture. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Aortic dissection; Cohesive zone model; Crack phase-field; Extended finite element method; Failure criteria; Fracture; Rupture; Soft biological tissue",,2-s2.0-85029219071

The structural characteristics, CO formation and stability of a range of x CoFe2O4/NiFe2O4 (x = 20 − 100 wt%) modified with CeZrO2 were investigated through STEM and in situ XRD. Crystallographic changes during two consecutive H2-TPR and CO2-TPO cycles were followed using in situ XRD.

Due to the finite electron-blocking capacity of ions electrolyte layer and the weak interfacial energy between the ions electrolyte layer and electrochromic layers, typically five-layer inorganic all-solid-state ECDs generally suffer from poor optical memory. A seven-layer inorganic ECD with significantly improved optical memory is designed by means of the embedment of Ta2O5 layers between ions conductive layer and electrochromic layers. Compared with the typical five-layer ECD-1 (ITO/NiOx/LiNbO3/WO3/ITO), the seven-layer ECD-2 with the structure of ITO/NiOx/Ta2O5/LiNbO3/Ta2O5/WO3/ITO presents much less leakage current, larger optical modulation and higher coloration efficiency during electrochemical cycling. The further analyses reveal that the embedded Ta2O5 layers greatly increase the energy barrier between NiOx, WO3 and LiNbO3, imposing restrictions on the transfer kinetics of electrons contributing to the leakage current and enlarging the threshold potential available to ECD-2, which gives rise to a high coloration efficiency up to 98.0 cm2 C−1. Furthermore, the seven-layer ECD-2 maintains a stable optical modulation of approximately 52.5% for over 10,000 cycles, even though there is a compromise in response characteristic due to the Li+-ion trapping in electrochromic layers, which provides a further insight into the electrochromic degradation of inorganic all-solid-state complementary ECDs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Charge-transfer kinetics; Cyclic properties; Electrochromic device; Inorganic; Li+-ion trapping; Optical memory","Charge transfer; Electrochemical sensors; Electrochromism; Electrolytes; Energy conservation; Ions; Kinetics; Light modulation; Modulation; Optical data storage; Optical signal processing; Charge transfer kinetics; Coloration efficiencies; Cyclic property; Electrochemical cycling; Inorganic; Ion trapping; Optical memory effect; Response characteristic; Electrochromic devices",2-s2.0-85030788694

AZO thin films grown by radio frequency magnetron sputtering are annealed at different temperatures (250–650 °C) in air environment. The post-growth annealing improves the structural quality of the AZO films, as confirmed from the X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and micro-Raman analyses. The as-grown and annealed samples show strong photoluminescence (PL) in the UV (∼3.33 eV) and visible-NIR (1.6–2.2 eV). The UV PL peak is originated from the near band edge emission of crystalline ZnO, while the broad visible-NIR PL is associated with the radiative transition related to oxygen interstitial (Oi) defects in the ZnO structure. The PL peak intensity is strongly enhanced after annealing due to the partial removal of non-radiative defects. The high intensity visible-NIR PL of the annealed samples is used for the label-free enzyme-based detection of glucose with the help of glucose oxidase based on PL quenching via electron transfer mechanism. Our AZO thin films can efficiently detect ∼20 μM concentration of glucose in presence of glucose oxidase (GOx). We have attempted to quantify the nature of PL quenching based on the Stern-Volmer plot and explained the quenching mechanism as collisional quenching due to charge transfer in presence of a quencher. The Stern-Volmer plot of PL quenching of AZO thin film reveals the linear relationship between the quenching effect and the glucose concentration. Higher sensitivity of the sensor can be achieved by tuning the structure and doping density of the AZO films.

Their structure stems from the conjugation of the well-known tris(carboxy-arlyamine) anchoring moiety to a benzothiadiazole acceptor through a fluorene (PP1) or thiophene-fluorene linker (PP2). Appending a NDI secondary acceptor onto PP2 yielded a dyad (PP2-NDI). The push-pull structure is here particularly adapted to the sensitization of p-type semi-conducting materials. All three dyes were investigated by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, and their electronic properties were modelled by TD-DFT. In all cases, the new sensitizers exhibit adequate absorption features (spanning from 400 nm to 600 nm, extinction coefficients between 20000 and 27000 M−1 cm−1) and their thermodynamic parameters are all in favor of efficient interfacial charge transfers involving NiO. pDSC were constructed with all three dyes; high photoconversion efficiencies (PCE) were reached, especially in the case of dyad PP2-NDI (Jsc = 5.90 mA/cm2, Voc = 143 mV, FF = 33.8%, PCE = 0.29%), due to a combination of outstanding electronic properties and increased charge separation state lifetime.

Thus, the prevention of a complete depletion of non-renewable sources is supported and the effects of their utilization alleviated.

This interest was initiated when the adverse effects of fossil fuel on the environment such as greenhouse gas emission and global warming were unfolded. Multidisciplinary researches are being carried out in the research laboratories to provide effective clean energy solutions. Nanofluid, a colloidal mixture of nanoparticles in the base fluid, e.g., water, ethylene glycol, oil, offers efficiency improvements in many clean energy applications due to the improvement in its thermophysical property. In this chapter, use of nanofluid in various clean energy and energy efficiency applications is reviewed. Solar energy, the dominant clean energy source, is a potential field of application where nanofluid can be employed. Solar thermal collectors and solar water heaters are the ideal candidates for utilization of nanofluid for improving solar to thermal energy conversion. Thermal storage system employs phase change material (PCM) for storing thermal energy, and nanofluid may be added to the PCM for enhanced performance. Nanofluid can be used in carefully designed heat exchangers for extracting energy from geothermal resources. This mixture can also be used in waste heat collector to improve efficiency for its thermophysical property causing a heat transfer enhancement. Adding nanoparticles to the refrigerants improves the heat transfer characteristics of refrigerants and improves the performance of the refrigeration system from an energy efficiency perspective.

Frosting heavily impacts on the operating efficiency of equipments, and leads to considerable energy consumption for defrosting. This study reviewed anti-frosting techniques in refrigeration and air conditioning fields, including air dehumidification by solid/liquid desiccant, ultrasonic vibration, external electric/magnetic field, surface treatment, etc. Although air dehumidification is an effective method to delay frost formation, the problem of desiccant regeneration prevents this method from practical application. The methods of ultrasonic vibration and external electric/magnetic field are not suitable for large or medium-sized fin-tube evaporator, which result in additional investment and energy input. Besides, the anti-frosting effect of electric/magnetic field is not obvious and needs to be verified by more experiments. However, surface treatment has advantages of high efficient, low cost, environmental protection and practicability. In particular, the superhydrophobic surface shows excellent performance in frosting prevention and defrosting improvement.

We investigated Type D personality among patients with upper extremity musculoskeletal illness.

Results The categorical Type D personality and greater NA and SI were associated with pain interference above and beyond descriptive variables, but the interaction term between NA and SI was not. NA explained a larger proportion of the variance in pain interference than SI. DS14 showed a two-factor structure and high internal consistency in this sample. Conclusions The categorical Type D allows for identifying individuals who struggle with recovery from musculoskeletal injury.

Here, we focus on engineering PDI dimers with N-annulated bridges to construct bowl-shaped PDI dimers with the aim of improving efficiency, stereoscopic dimensions and the electron transfer abilities by introducing different functional linkers in N-annulated bridges.

The low-concentration BPA (20 mg/L) was degraded completely by the TiO2-rGH electrode in 5 h through the synergistic effect of adsorption-photoelectrocatalytic. The photogenerated charge on the surface of TiO2 is rapidly separated by the action of the applied electric field and the graphene sheet. The high conductivity of the graphene makes the TiO2-graphene hydrogel rapidly conducting the charge and solves the problem of poor conductivity of the semiconductor electrode. On the basis of these advantages, the TiO2-rGH has a cross-porous network structure that favors the anchor of more TiO2 nanocrystals, the specific surface area and reactive sites are greater than the thin film electrode, and the structure is conducive to significantly improving the BPA removal efficiency.

The rhizosphere serves as the one of most active microorganism habitats, however, the general understanding of the ecoenzymatic stoichiometry (exoenzymes) and microbial nutrient acquisition in rhizosphere soil is limited. Here, we investigated the vegetation communities and determined the soil physicochemical properties, microbial biomass, and enzymatic activities in rhizosphere under different vegetation and soil types in the arid area of the northern Loess Plateau. Type Ⅱ standard major axis (SMA) regression analysis showed that the plants played a more important role than soil properties in determining ecoenzymatic stoichiometry. Linear regression analysis displayed a microbial stoichiometric homeostasis (community-level) in rhizosphere. The Threshold Elemental Ratio (TER) revealed that the microbial nutrient metabolisms of rhizosphere were co-limited by N and P in the A. ordosica and A. cristatum communities of loess, and A. cristatum communities of feldspathic sandstone weathered soil. Binding spatial ordination analysis (RDA and CCA) demonstrated that soil physical properties (e.g., soil moisture, silt and clay contents) have more contribution to ecoenzymatic stoichiometry than the other investigated soil parameters, whereas soil nutrients (e.g., total organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) predominantly controlled microbial nutrient ratios. Therefore, the ecoenzymatic stoichiometry in rhizosphere is greatly regulated by plants and soil physical properties. The microbial N and P are co-limited under Gramineae plant in loess and feldspathic sandstone weathered soil regions.

Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) are an innovative technology to stimulate the anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons. In this work, single chamber BESs were used to assess the degradation of a BTEX mixture at different applied voltages (0.8 V, 1.0 V, 1.2 V) between the electrodes. Hydrocarbon degradation was linked to current production and to sulfate reduction, at all the tested potentials. The highest current densities (about 200 mA/m2 with a maximum peak at 480 mA/m2) were observed when 0.8 V were applied. The application of an external voltage increased the removal of toluene, m-xylene and p-xylene. The highest removal rate constants at 0.8 V were: 0.4 ± 0.1 days−1, 0.34 ± 0.09 days−1 and 0.16 ± 0.02 days−1, respectively.

The P3HT nanofibers, which were pre-grown in a separate system and possessed the π-stacked P3HT backbones in the length of fibrils, were perpendicular to the rGO surface in the solution and, consequently, they inclined onto the substrate during solvent evaporation. Through this inclination, the orientation of P3HT chains changed from face-on to edge-on. In rGO-f-TAA systems, for either short (80 nm) or long (420 nm) P3HT nanofibers, the P3HT nanofibers were attached from their sides onto the rGO. The appearance of (020) and (002) spots in selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns proved a fixed edge-on orientation even after solvent evaporation. Functionalization of rGO surface with 2-thiophene acetic acid altered the tethering tendency of P3HT chains from the thiophenic rings to the hexyl side chains. Via grafting the rGO with P3DDT and PTEt, the tethered P3HT nanofibers were perpendicularly fixed onto its surface with a face-on orientation having (002) and (100) spots even after solvent evaporation, resulting in the conductivity range of 9.9–10.9 S/cm. The pre-developed large single crystals were also employed to construct the donor-acceptor supramolecules with edge-on oriented P3HTs.

We validated the WRF-Chem simulations during the campaign period, and analyzed aerosol-warm cloud interactions by diagnosing both aerosol direct, indirect, and total effects. The results demonstrated that aerosol directly decreased downward shortwave radiation up to −44% (−282 W m−2) for this period and subsequently increased downward longwave radiation up to +15% (∼52 W m−2) in the presence of low-level clouds along the thematic area. Aerosol increased cloud fraction indirectly up to ∼24% with the increases of both liquid water path and the droplet number mixing ratio. Precipitation properties were altered both directly and indirectly. Direct effects simply changed cloud-precipitation quantities via simple updraft process associated with perturbed radiation and temperature, while indirect effects mainly suppressed precipitation, but sometimes increased precipitation in the higher relative humidity atmosphere or near vapor-saturated condition. The total aerosol effects caused a time lag of the precipitation rate with the delayed onset time of up to 9 h.

Their unique properties, including high mechanical stiffness, wide band gap, excellent thermal conductivity, and thermal stability, suggest many potential applications in various engineering fields. In particular, h-BN nanomaterials have been widely used as functional fillers to fabricate high-performance polymer nanocomposites. Like other nanomaterials, prior to their utilization in nanocomposites, surface modification of h-BNs is often necessary in order to prevent their strong tendency to aggregate, and to improve their dispersion and interfacial properties in polymer nanocomposites. However, the high chemical inertness and resistance to oxidation of h-BNs make it rather difficult to functionalize h-BNs. The methods frequently used to oxidize graphitic carbon nanomaterials are not quite successful on h-BNs. Therefore, many novel approaches have been studied to modify h-BN nanostructures. In this review, different surface modification strategies were discussed including various covalent and non-covalent surface modification strategies through wet or dry chemical routes. Meanwhile, the effects of these surface modification methods on the resulting material structures and properties were also reviewed.

This review is of interdisciplinary nature, addressing the emerging area of nanotechnology in papermaking focusing on resources, chemical synthesis and processing, colloidal properties, and deposition methods. An overview of different NMs used in papermaking together with their intrinsic properties and a link to possible applications is presented from a chemical point of view. After a brief introduction on NMs classification and papermaking, their role as additives or pigments in the paper structure is described. The different compositions and morphologies of NMs and NSMs are included, based on wood components, inorganic, organic, carbon-based, and composite NPs. In a first approach, nanopaper substrates are made from fibrillary NPs, including cellulose-based or carbon-based NMs. In a second approach, the NPs can be added to a regular wood pulp as nanofillers or used in coating compositions as nanopigments. The most important processing steps for NMs in papermaking are illustrated including the internal filling of fiber lumen, LbL deposition or fiber wall modification, with important advances in the field on the in situ deposition of NPs on the paper fibers. Usually, the manufacture of products with advanced functionality is associated with complex processes and hazardous materials.

In the human protein (hNgb), Cys46 and Cys55 form an intramolecular disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions, whose cleavage induces a helix-to-strand rearrangement of the CD loop that strengthens the bond between the heme iron and the distal histidine. Hence, it is conceivable that the intramolecular disulfide bridge modulates the functionality of human neuroglobin by controlling exogenous ligand binding. In this work, we investigated the influence of the Cys46/Cys55 disulfide bond on the redox properties and on the pH-dependent conformational equilibria of hNgb, using UV–vis spectroelectrochemistry, cyclic voltammetry, electronic absorption spectroscopy and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD). We found that the S–S bridge significantly affects the heme Fe(III) to Fe(II) reduction enthalpy (ΔH°′rc) and entropy (ΔS°′rc), mostly as a consequence of changes in the reduction-induced solvent reorganization effects, without affecting the axial ligand-binding interactions and the polarity and electrostatics of the heme environment. Between pH 3 and 12, the electronic properties of the heme of ferric hNgb are sensitive to five acid-base equilibria, which are scarcely affected by the Cys46/Cys55 disulfide bridge. The equilibria occurring at extreme pH values induce heme release, while those occurring between pH 5 and 10 alter the electronic properties of the heme without modifying its axial coordination and low spin state. They involve the sidechains of non-coordinating aminoacids close to the heme and at least one heme propionate. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cyclic voltammetry; Electronic absorption and MCD spectroscopies; Neuroglobin; Reduction potential; Reduction thermodynamics; UV–vis spectroelectrochemistry",,2-s2.0-85031902727

The lean and green concept however is still relatively new and it remains unclear for many as to how exactly lean thinking can contribute to the sustainability transformation of organizations. The objective of this research was to undertake a systematic literature review of how the implementation of lean and green initiatives could lead to sustainable business practice. This article includes an analysis of both conceptual and empirical research papers discussing various industrial contexts, and evaluation of: a) the impact of lean methods on environmental performance; and b) the variety of integrated lean and green models. The review highlights the ad hoc and limited use of lean thinking within corporate sustainability initiatives and the authors establish a ‘lean and green matrix’ that identifies opportunities to embed lean and green practices in five common work streams including waste, energy, emissions, water and chemical management. In addition to comparing different industries and their systems, this review provides a reference point for further investigation into lean and green practices. The findings contribute to the authors’ research agenda that aims to develop a replicable system for holistically exploring strategies in corporate environmental management and prioritising the most appropriate lean methods.

The studies dealing with plastics gasification are in general scarce. However, due to the knowledge acquired on biomass and coal gasification, the state of development of plastic gasification technologies is considerable and, in fact, several gasification studies have been performed at pilot scale units. Air gasification is the most studied and developed strategy and pursues the production of a syngas for energy purposes. In spite of the higher H2 content and heating value of the gas produced by steam gasification, this alternative faces significant challenges, such as the energy requirements of the process and the tar content in the syngas. Moreover, the co-gasification of plastics with coal and biomass appears to be a promising valorization route due to the positive impact on process performance and greater process flexibility. Other promising alternative is the pyrolysis and in-line reforming, which allows producing a syngas with high hydrogen content and totally free of tar. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gasification; Hydrogen; Reforming; Review; Syngas; Waste plastics","Catalytic reforming; Elastomers; Gasification; Hydrogen; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; Plastics; Pyrolysis; Reforming reactions; Reviews; Synthesis gas; Tar; Alternative process; Catalytic steam reforming; Energy requirements; Gasification technologies; Process flexibility; Process performance; Syn-gas; Waste plastic; Steam reforming",2-s2.0-85030109197

To extend its applications in tissue engineering, native BC is normally modified to enhance its properties. Generally, BC modifications can be made by either in situ modification during cell culture or ex situ modification of existing BC microfibers. In this review we will first provide a brief introduction of BC and its attributes; this will set the stage for in-depth and up-to-date discussions on modified BC.

In this study, a general one-pot solution-processed method is devised to grow uniform crystallized metal-doped TiO2 thin film as large as 15 × 15 cm2. The doping process can be controlled effectively via a series of doping precursors from niobium (V), tin (IV), tantalum (V) to tungsten (VI) chloride. As far as we know, this is so far the lowest processing temperature for metal-doped TiO2 compact layers, as low as 70 °C. The overall performance of PSCs employing the metal-doped TiO2 layers is significantly improved in term of hysteresis effect, short circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, power conversion efficiency, and device stability. With the insertion of metal ions into TiO2 lattice, the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 PSC leads to a ∼25% improved PCE of over 16% under irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G sunlight, compared with control device.

As compared to other nanostructured materials, nanoporous metals have many advantages, including their bicontinuous structure, tunable pore sizes, bulk form, good electrical conductivity, and high structural stability. Therefore, nanoporous metals represent ideal 3D materials with versatile functionality, which can be utilized in various fields.

In this study, both the RAC and the influence of ambient environmental factors were investigated in a river sediment system. Sixty-eight sediment samples were collected from the main river system in Shanghai, China. The total concentration and chemical speciation of Cu, Zn, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr, As, and Hg were determined in the samples. The influence of sediment environmental factors, such as acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), Fe &amp; Mn, and total organic carbon (TOC), on total metal concentrations and speciation was also investigated. The relationship between the main environmental media and distribution of HMs was discussed using PCA and NMDS. The transfer-transformation behaviors of Pb, Ni, and Cr were mainly controlled by AVS and TOC while Zn, Cu, and Cd were influenced by Fe &amp; Mn and TOC. The relationship between the RAC value of HM and environmental factors revealed that 7% of Cr, 23% of Ni, and 15% of Pb had a high risk of mobility at TOC values below 3.5% and sulfite contents below 10 mmol/kg.

Our results show that the most stable adsorption site for single metal atom on anatase TiO2 (101) surface is the bridge site formed by two twofold coordinated oxygen (O2c) atoms at the step edge. Due to the charge transfer from metal atoms to anatase TiO2 (101) surface, the work function of adsorbed surface is significantly smaller than the clean one, indicating enhanced surface activity. Fukui functions are highly localized around the isolated metal atoms, indicating that single metal atoms on anatase TiO2 (101) surface serve as the active reduction and oxidation sites in the photocatalytic process. Photo-induced electrons in the electronically excited TiO2 photocatalyst can be transferred to target species through the deposited single atoms. The band structures of host TiO2 are almost unchanged upon the adsorption, and the metal induced states are located in the band gap of the host. Remarkably, due to the metal atoms adsorption, the upward shift of conduction band edge will improve the reducing capacity of anatase TiO2. Moreover, when single metal atoms are adsorbed, potential energy of topmost surface Ti atoms turns to get close to the vacuum level, which significantly facilitates the electron transfer for hydrogen evolution.

Although the stabilizers are expected to contribute to improve the dispersion and stability of NMs, the results obtained clearly showed that no similar changes in toxicity and morphological properties of the nano-Ag can be expected after its stabilization with PVA. Thus, regarding human cell lines, the reduction in the average size of the PVA-nano-Ag was followed by a reduction or maintenance of its toxicity, but the opposite was observed for the aquatic species tested since an increase in the average size enhanced its toxicity. As far as nano-Cu is considered DMSO contributed for a better dispersion of this nanomaterial, however this was not translated in a similar toxicity/ecotoxicity modification. In summary, even for nano-Cu, for which few or no data exists regarding its toxicity after stabilization with organic compounds, it was confirmed with consistent data, that the toxicity of metallic NMs is a complex combination of average size, chemical composition, solubilization or persistence in suspension of the metallic forms, interaction with test medium components and sensitivity of test species and cell lines.

On the Fetet1-terminated Fe3O4 (111) surface, the most favored configurations are H2O2 decomposition and produce two OH groups, which have strong interaction with Hg atom to form an OH–Hg–OH intermediate. The adsorbed OH–Hg–OH is stable and hardly detaches from the catalyst surface due to the highly endothermic process. A large amount of electron transfer has been found from Hg to the produced OH groups and has little irreversible effect on the Fe3O4 (111) surface. On the Feoct2-terminated Fe3O4 (111) surface, the Feoct2 site is more active than Fetet1 site. H2O2 decomposition and Hg0 oxidation processes are more likely to occur due to that the Feoct2 site both contains Fe2+ and Fe3+ cations. The calculations reveal that Hg0 oxidation by the OH radical produced from H2O2 is energetically favored.

In this study, microcosms with different density of bloom cyanobacteria were constructed and quantitative PCR and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to analyze the microbes, environmental variables and the causal relationship to TN removal. Total bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing archaea and nirS gene abundances were indirectly influenced by cyanobacteria biomass and all of them had a direct effect on TN removal. SEM confirmed that cyanobacteria made a direct contribution to ammonium‑nitrogen (NH4 +-N) level in water and induced nitrification activity, which favored the process of denitrification by supplying substrate and aggravating the anoxic status.

The effects of the titanium isopropoxide precursor concentration, on the formation of dip coated anatase/rutile TiO2 nanorods composite were systematically explored. The growth of anatase on rutile TiO2 nanorods can be controlled by varying the titanium isopropoxide concentration. The morphological study reveals that anatase TiO2 nanograins formed on the surface of rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays through dip coating method. Photoelectrochemical analyses showed that the enhancement of the photocatalytic activities of the samples is affected by the anatase nanograins present on the rutile TiO2 nanorods, which can induce the separation of electrons and holes. To interpret the photoelectrochemical behaviors, the prepared photoelectrodes were applied in photoelectrochemical solar hydrogen generation and orange II dye degradation. The optimized photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm−2 and the 625 μmol hydrogen generation was observed for 10 mM anatase/rutile TiO2 NRs composites.

These methods provided a gradually clear picture of energy structural change. Spatially, Σ15PAH (11.3 to 95.5 ng/g) and Pb (10.2 to 74.6 μg/g) generally exhibited decreasing concentration gradient offshore; while the highest levels of PAHs and Pb were observed near the southern Taiwan Strait, which may be induced by accumulation of different fluvial input. Historical records of pollutants followed closely with the economic development of China, with fast growth of Σ15PAH and Pb occurring since the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. The phasing-out of leaded gasoline in China was captured with a sharp decrease of Pb after the mid-1990s. PAHs and Pb correlated well with TOC and clay content for core sediments, which was not observed for surface sediments. There was an up-core increase of high molecular PAH proportions. Coal and biomass burning were then qualitatively identified as the major sources of PAHs with DRs. Furthermore, shift toward less radiogenic signatures of Pb isotopic ratios after 1900 revealed the start and growing importance of industrial sources. Finally, a greater separation and quantification of various input was achieved by a three-factor PMF model, which made it clear that biomass burning, coal combustion, and vehicle emissions accounted for 40 ± 20%, 41 ± 13%, and 19 ± 12% of PAHs through the core. Biomass and coal combustion acted as major sources before 2000, while contributions from vehicle emission soared thereafter.

Under these conditions, ion transport is limited, and some of the electrode area is unavailable for adsorption, which results in a low capacitance. Increasing the temperature helps to increase the ionic movement, leading to enhanced adsorption and increased capacitance. In contrast, ion desorption (self-discharge) surpasses the capacitance improvement when ions gain a high amount of energy with increasing temperature. For example, temperatures as high as 70 °C cause a very high rate of ionic desorption in acetonitrile solutions in which the individual properties of the two electrolytes—tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEA BF4) and ethylmethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI BF4)—are not distinguishable. The capacitance improvement and self-discharge are balanced, resulting in a capacitance peak at mid-range temperatures, i.e., 35–45 °C, in the more viscous electrolyte, i.e., TEA BF4. The less viscous electrolyte, i.e., EMI BF4 has a wider capacitance peak from 25 to 45 °C and higher capacitance than that of TEA BF4.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirm the intercalation of PAS into the galleries of LDH. The controlled release behavior triggered by temperature for the PAS-LDH composites has been investigated, and the results show that the release rate of all PAS-LDH composites increases as the increase of temperature. However, the MgAl-PAS-LDH composites (Mg2Al-PAS-LDH and Mg3Al-PAS-LDH) exhibit the increased release rate of 0.21 ppm/°C from 15 to 30 °C in 3.5% NaCl solution, more than three times of the ZnAl-PAS-LDH composites (0.06 ppm/°C), owing to the confined microenvironment influenced by metal types in LDH layers. In addition, a possible diffusion-controlled process with surface diffusion, bulk diffusion and heterogeneous flat surface diffusion has been revealed via fitting four kinetic equations. Moreover, to verify the practical application of the PAS-LDH composites, a model coating denoted as Mg2Al-PAS-LDH coating was fabricated. The release result displays that the release rate increases or decreases as temperature altered at 15 and 25 °C alternately, indicating its self-adaptive controlled release behavior with temperature. Moreover, the superior resistance to the settlement of Ulva spores at 15 and 25 °C was observed for the Mg2Al-PAS-LDH coating, as a result of the controllable release of antifoulant. Therefore, this work provides a facile and effective method for the fabrication of antifouling composites with self-adaptive controlled release behavior in response to temperature, which can be used to prolong the lifetime of antifouling coatings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Antifoulant; Antifouling property; Intercalation; Layered double hydroxide; Self-adaptive controlled release","Binary alloys; Coatings; Diffusion; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Integral equations; Intercalation; Magnesium alloys; Surface diffusion; X ray diffraction; Zinc alloys; Antifoulant; Antifouling property; Controlled release; Diffusion-controlled process; Environmental conditions; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Layered double hydroxides; Zn-Al layered double hydroxides; Aluminum alloys",2-s2.0-85026417397

The tubular surfaces of the NTs were completely coated with the HA coating when prepared at 30 V, and no homogeneous CaP coating was observed when prepared at 60 V.

Herein, the composite electrolytes consisting of Li-salt-free polyethylene oxides and 200 nm-sized Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 particles interfacially wetted by [BMIM]TF2N of 1.8 μL cm−2 have been prepared. Such wetted ionic liquid remains the solid state of membrane electrolytes and decreases the interface impedance between the electrodes and the electrolytes. There is no release of the liquid phase from the PEO matrix when the pressure of 5.0 × 104 Pa being applied for 24 h. The interfacially wetted membrane electrolytes show the conductivity of 2.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 20 °C, which is one order of magnitude greater than that of the membranes without the wetted ionic liquids. The conduction mechanism is related to a large number of lithium ions releasing from Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 particles and the improved conductive paths along the ion-liquid-wetted interfaces between the polymer matrix and ceramic grains. When the membranes being used in the solid-state LiFePO4/Li and LiFe0.15Mn0.85PO4/Li cells at 25 °C, the excellent rate capability and superior cycle stability has been shown.

However, supplementing the fuel with a small percentage of excess molecular hydrogen effectively masks the degradation to the catalytic activity of the Ni and carbon fuel cracking reaction reactions. Experiments described in this work explore the chemistry behind the “palliative” effect of hydrogen on SOFCs operating with chlorine-contaminated, carbon-containing fuels using a suite of independent, complementary techniques. Operando Raman spectroscopy is used to monitor carbon accumulation and, by inference, Ni catalytic activity while electrochemical techniques including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and voltammetry are used to monitor overall cell performance. Briefly, hydrogen not only completely hides degradation observed with chlorine-contaminated carbon-containing fuels, but also actively removes adsorbed chlorine from the surface of the Ni, allowing for the methane cracking reaction to continue, albeit at a slower rate. When hydrogen is removed from the fuel stream the cell fails immediately due to chlorine occupation of methane/biogas reaction sites. © 2017","Biogas; Chlorine; Hydrogen; Methane; Raman; SOFC","Biogas; Catalyst activity; Catalytic cracking; Chlorine; Cracks; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Methane; Nickel; Nickel compounds; Carbon accumulation; Complementary techniques; Cracking reactions; Different mechanisms; Effect of hydrogen; Electrochemical techniques; Molecular hydrogen; Raman; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",2-s2.0-85032358370

Efficient utilization of organic P sources in agriculture will help to preserve P resources and thereby has the potential to close nutrient cycles and prevent unwanted P-losses to the environment, one of the major causes for eutrophication of water bodies. Unfortunately, organic P sources usually contain also various detrimental substances, such as potentially toxic elements or organic contaminants like pharmaceuticals as well as pathogenic microorganisms.

The electrochemical tests revealed that CNSCS composites exhibited high specific capacitance (1183.3 Fg−1 at the current density of 2 Ag−1), excellent rate performance (74.9% retention with tenfold current density increase) and outstanding cycle life stability. Moreover, the effect of temperature on electrochemical performance of CNSCS composites was investigated and the results indicated the specific capacitance of CoNi2S4/Co9S8 can keep relatively stable in a wide temperature from 0 °C to 50 °C.

Conversely, it is reported in this work that this multiphysics coupling is associated with an inverse effect (i.e. the dependence of the magnetic properties on mechanical strain), denoted as the pseudo-Villari effect. MR elastomers based on soft and hard silicone rubber matrices and carbonyl iron particles were fabricated and characterized. The pseudo-Villari effect was experimentally quantified: a shear strain of 50 % induces magnetic induction field variations up to 10 mT on anisotropic MR elastomer samples, when placed in a 0.2 T applied field, which might theoretically lead to potential energy conversion density in the mJ cm-3 order of magnitude. In case of anisotropic MR elastomers, the absolute variation of stiffness as a function of applied magnetic field is rather independent of matrix properties. Similarly, the pseudo-Villari effect is found to be independent to the stiffness, thus broadening the adaptability of the materials to sensing and energy harvesting target applications.

Taking discharge as a representative water quantity indicator, as well as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) as water quality indicators for the twin rivers (i.e., the Chaohe and Baihe rivers) which run into the Miyun Reservoir in North China, this study calculated marginal probability distributions of these indicators, and analyzed the joint probability distribution of discharge and TN/TP concentration by applying the Frank copula function. According to an analysis of various scenario combinations of discharge and TN/TP concentration, the quantitative management intervals including the priority control interval, the key attention interval and the daily maintenance interval, were identified. The results were as follows: (a) a fitting degree evaluation indicated that the Pearson-III distribution for the marginal probability distribution of discharge and the lognormal distribution for that of TN/TP concentration were feasible. Additionally, the Frank copula theory was applicable for their joint probability analysis according to the applicability analysis and goodness-of-fit test; (b) regarding to the water quality of the Miyun Reservoir inflows, it is more important to enhance the control of the Chaohe River and the monitoring of TP concentration; and (c) the TN concentration within division values of discharge (i.e., 16.59, 24.14 m3/s) was tend to exceed the class III limitation of the Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water in China, and the concentrations of TN and TP increased as the discharge increased for the two rivers.

However, the mechanism on how sulfate-rich mine drainage affects freshwater ecosystems is largely unknown, and its potential ecological risk has not been assessed so far. During 2009–2016, water and macroinvertebrate samples from 405 sample sites were collected along the mine drainage gradient from circum-neutral to alkaline waters in Hun-Tai River, Northeastern China. Results of linear regressions showed that sulfate-rich mine drainage was significantly positively correlated with the constituents typically derived from rock weathering (Ca2 +, Mg2 + and HCO3 – + CO3 2 −); the diversity of intolerant stream macroinvertebrates exhibited a steep decline along the gradient of sulfate-rich mine drainage. Meanwhile, stressor-response relationships between sulfate-rich mine drainage and macroinvertebrate communities were explored by two complementary statistical approaches in tandem (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis and the field-based method developed by USEPA). Results revealed that once stream sulfate concentrations in mine drainage exceeded 35 mg/L, significant decline in the abundance of intolerant macroinvertebrate taxa occurred. An assessment of ecological risk posed by sulfate-rich mine drainage was conducted based on a tiered approach consisting of simple deterministic method (Hazard Quotient, HQ) to probabilistic method (Joint Probability Curve, JPC).

In this study, six air pollution monitoring campaigns (including major regulated air pollutants) were carried out from 2013 to 2015 at both sides of the bridge, located in the urban areas of Rio and Antirrio respectively. Pollution data were statistically analyzed and air quality was characterized using US and European air quality indices. From the overall campaign, it was found that air pollution levels were below the respective regulatory thresholds, but once at the site of Antirrio (26.4 and 52.2 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and ΡΜ10, respectively) during the 2nd winter period. Daily average PM10 and PM2.5 levels from two monitoring sites were well correlated to gaseous pollutant (CO, NO, NO2, NOx and SO2) levels, meteorological parameters and factor scores from Positive Matrix Factorization during the 3-year period. Moreover, the elemental composition of PM10 and PM2.5 was used for source apportionment. That analysis revealed that major emission sources were sulfates, mineral dust, biomass burning, sea salt, traffic and shipping emissions for PM10 and PM2.5, for both Rio and Antirrio. Seasonal variation indicates that sulfates, mineral dust and traffic emissions increased during the warm season of the year, while biomass burning become the dominant during the cold season. Overall, the contribution of the Charilaos Trikoupis bridge to the vicinity air pollution is very low. This is the result of the relatively low daily traffic volume (~ 10,000 vehicles per day), the respective traffic fleet composition (~ 81% of the traffic fleet are private vehicles) and the speed limit (80 km/h) which does not favor traffic emissions. In addition, the strong and frequent winds further contribute to the rapid dispersion of the emitted pollutants. © 2017","Air quality indices; Air quality monitoring; Cable bridge; PM source apportionment","Air quality; Cable stayed bridges; Cables; Dust; Factorization; Fleet operations; Fog; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Pollution detection; Air pollution monitoring; Air quality indices; Air quality monitoring; Cable bridges; Elemental compositions; Meteorological parameters; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source apportionment; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; sodium chloride; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; bridge; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; source apportionment; traffic emission; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; biomass; chemical composition; controlled study; Greece; mineral dust; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; shipping; traffic; urban area; Greece",2-s2.0-85026843280

Only As(III) and As(V) were detected in saliva samples. In nail and hair samples, DMA, MMA, As(III) and As(V) were observed. Based on total As contents in crops and drinking water, the local residents’ daily intake of total arsenic (TDIAs), the hazard quotient (HQ), and the cancer risk (R) were assessed. Male, older and cases of skin lesion participants generally had higher As contents in saliva, urine, nail and hair samples in relative to others. Salivary, urinary, nail and hair As were not significantly affected by body mass index (BMI) and smoking. Good correlations were observed between TDIAs and salivary, urinary, nail and hair As, showing that saliva, urine, nail and hair samples can be used as biomarkers of As exposure. Individually, levels of arsenicosis were positively correlated with TDIAs. The relationship between TDIAs and prevalence of arsenicosis concluded that, although As levels in crops and drinking water did not exceed national standards, they still pose a potential threat to human health.

Such data can be utilised for supplementing traditional pollution monitoring, improving exposure estimates, and raising community awareness about air pollution. However, data quality remains a major concern that hinders the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor technology. Unreliable data may mislead unsuspecting users and potentially lead to alarming consequences such as reporting acceptable air pollutant levels when they are above the limits deemed safe for human health. This article provides scientific guidance to the end-users for effectively deploying low-cost sensors for monitoring air pollution and people's exposure, while ensuring reasonable data quality. We review the performance characteristics of several low-cost particle and gas monitoring sensors and provide recommendations to end-users for making proper sensor selection by summarizing the capabilities and limitations of such sensors. The challenges, best practices, and future outlook for effectively deploying low-cost sensors, and maintaining data quality are also discussed. For data quality assurance, a two-stage sensor calibration process is recommended, which includes laboratory calibration under controlled conditions by the manufacturer supplemented with routine calibration checks performed by the end-user under final deployment conditions. For large sensor networks where routine calibration checks are impractical, statistical techniques for data quality assurance should be utilised. Further advancements and adoption of sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques for sensor calibration, fault detection, and data quality assurance can indeed help to realise the promised benefits of a low-cost air pollution sensor network. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental sensing; Human health; Outdoor pollution sensing; Pollution exposure; Real-time exposure","Air navigation; Air pollution; Calibration; Costs; Data reduction; Fault detection; Pollution; Quality assurance; Sensor networks; Air pollution monitoring; Controlled conditions; Environmental sensing; Human health; Outdoor pollutions; Performance characteristics; Real time; Statistical techniques; Pollution detection; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; perception; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; public health; sensor; air pollution; biosensor; calibration; concentration (parameters); environmental exposure; environmental factor; intermethod comparison; limit of detection; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; practice guideline; priority journal; reproducibility; Review; sensitivity analysis",2-s2.0-85022204139

However, the ability of trees to cope with the changing climate and the effects of other environmental factors on climate-growth relationships are still poorly understood. There is thus an increasing need to understand the ability of individual trees to cope with changing climate in various environments. To improve the current understanding, a large tree-ring network covering the whole area of the Czech Republic (in 7 × 7 km grids) was utilized to investigate how the climate-growth relationships of Norway spruce are affected by 1) various geographical variables, 2) changing levels of acidic deposition, 3) soil characteristics and 4) age, tree diameter and neighbourhood competition. The period from 1930 to 2013 was divided into four, 21-year long intervals of differing levels of acidic deposition, which peaked in the 1972–1993 period. Our individual-based, spatiotemporal, multivariate analyses revealed that spruce growth was mostly affected by drought and warm summers. Drought plays the most important negative role at lower altitudes, while the positive effect of higher temperature was identified for trees at higher altitudes. Increased levels of acidic deposition, together with geographical variables, were identified as the most important factors affecting climate-growth association. Tree age, tree size and soil characteristics also significantly modulate climate-growth relationships. The importance of all environmental variables on climate-growth relationships was suppressed by acidic deposition during periods when this was at a high level; growth was significantly more enhanced by spring and summer temperatures during these periods. Our results suggest that spruce will undergo significant growth reduction under the predicted climate changes, especially at the lower altitudes which lie outside of its natural range. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Altitude; Climate change; Divergence problem; Individualistic approach; Tree rings","Air pollution; Deposition; Drought; Ecosystems; Forestry; Multivariant analysis; Plants (botany); Soil surveys; Altitude; Divergence problems; Environmental factors; Environmental variables; Increasing temperatures; Individualistic approach; Multi variate analysis; Tree rings; Climate change; nitrogen; sulfur; adaptation; altitude; atmospheric pollution; climate change; climate effect; drought; environmental factor; forest ecosystem; tree; tree ring; acid deposition; altitude acclimatization; Article; climate change; controlled study; correlational study; Czech Republic; drought; environmental factor; environmental temperature; interspecific competition; nonhuman; Norway spruce; plant age; plant growth; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil fertility; soil property; spatiotemporal analysis; spring; summer; Central Europe; Picea; Picea abies",2-s2.0-85026241886

Usually, concrete permeability is studied on plain specimens and the effect of the presence of steel bars on permeability in reinforced concrete has been little studied in the literature. The steel-concrete interface presents a larger porosity than plain concrete, which can be the cause of preferential percolation paths for fluids. Such percolation paths could create a lower resistance to fluid transfer and modify transfer kinetics. For reinforced and prestressed structures with large reinforcement contents, such as found in nuclear power plants, the impact of the reinforcement on gas transfer should be identified to obtain a better assessment of the flow within the structure. The aim of this experimental study is to characterize the effect of the presence of reinforcement on such flows by measuring leakage rates, permeability, and time to reach the steady state. Measurements were performed with a Cembureau constant head permeameter on cylindrical concrete specimens with or without steel bars. Since gas transfer into concrete depends on the rate of saturation of the material, the specimens were tested at different degrees of saturation: 0%, 6%, 30%, 60%, 80%, 90% and 100%. The analysis quantifies the impact of the defects created by the steel bar for each state. The results show that material composed of concrete and reinforcement can be divided into two distinct permeability zones: the plain concrete and the steel-concrete interface with or without cracking. These two zones can be associated in series and/or in parallel according to the configuration.

The results of this study demonstrate that σmix of the tested CLSM specimens increases with increasing copper slag fraction in aggregate and the measured σmix of the CLSM based on HCFA is greater than that with LCFA because both HCFA (or unburned carbon particles) and copper slag are electrically conductive.

Therefore, it is crucial to detect any possible symptoms of a leak as soon as possible. Most of existing leak detection techniques require specialized equipment to be used, while purely software-based methods rely solely on data analysis and are very desirable since they can be deployed on petrol stations without any changes to the existing infrastructure. Moreover, such techniques can be considered as complementary to the hardware leak detection systems, as they provide additional security level. In this paper we present the TUBE algorithm, which detects fuel leaks from underground storage tanks, using only standard measurements that are normally registered on petrol stations, i.e. the amount of stored, sold, and delivered fuel. The TUBE algorithm is an autonomous solution capable of making decisions independently as well as supporting human-made decisions and thus can be considered as an expert leak detection system. The TUBE algorithm introduces a new data mining technique for trend detection and cleaning data over time series, which can be easily adapted to any other problem domain. A trend detection technique, called tubes, created for the TUBE algorithm is a novel data analysis method that allows to envelop uncertainties and oscillations in data and produce stable trends. Trend interpretation technique described in this paper has been designed especially for fuel leak detection purposes using our industrial experience. This paper includes a step-by-step usage example of the TUBE algorithm and its evaluation according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency requirements for leakage detection systems (the EPA SIR standard). Such an evaluation involves calculating the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm. The TUBE algorithm has obtained 98.84% probability of detection and 0.07% probability of false alarm while rejecting 42.22% of analyzed datasets due to their uncertainty. Rejecting datasets from analysis is compliant with the EPA SIR standard; however, rejection rate higher than 20% is not acceptable. Therefore we have evaluated the two-phase filtering stage of the algorithm in order to find the best combination of filters as means of data cleaning. Moreover, we have discussed the results pointing at the overall data quality problem, since it is the main cause of rejecting some datasets from the analysis. Finally, the TUBE algorithm has obtained 93.11% probability of detection and 0.73% probability of false alarm for the best combination of all parameters with 15.56% rejection rate, which is acceptable by the EPA SIR standard. The value of probability of detection is not fully compliant with the EPA SIR standard where 95% probability of detection with probability of false alarm lower than 5% is required. We have found that the requirements for the aforementioned probabilities have been completely fulfilled for datasets representing manifolded tank systems but not for single tank datasets. Such a situation was unexpected since manifolded tank systems are generally claimed to be more complex for analysis as they are in fact systems of multiple single tanks directly connected. In this paper we have also measured the time and memory complexity of the TUBE algorithm as well as discussed the issues connected to the TUBE algorithm deployment on petrol stations using our industrial experience in the topic. © 2017 The Authors","Anomaly detection; Leak detection; Petrol station; Quality of data; Time series; Trend detection","Alarm systems; Data handling; Data mining; Digital storage; Environmental Protection Agency; Errors; Filtration; Fuel storage; Fuels; Gasoline; Information analysis; Leak detection; Offshore pipelines; Probability; Tanks (containers); Time series; Tubes (components); Uncertainty analysis; Anomaly detection; Leakage detection systems; Petrol stations; Probability of false alarm; Quality of data; Trend detection; Underground storage tanks; United States environmental protection agency; Quality control",2-s2.0-85028088353

A plate fin heat exchanger (PFHE) is a kind of multi-stream heat exchanger that can make a system simpler while saving space and performing the complex network functions within a single piece of equipment. However, if the layer stacking pattern that determines the PFHE cross section temperature profile is inadequately composed, the equipment can be damaged by increased thermal stress between the layers. Layer stacking patterns have mainly been determined by inefficient trial and error methods, and only considered design operating conditions. The objective of this study is to obtain a highly efficient thermal layer stacking pattern in a design condition, while also lowering thermal stress in abnormal conditions, using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed GA in this study has a checking module that reduces iteration and saves calculation time. In addition, maximum metal temperature difference is used to evaluate fitness for considering abnormal conditions. According to the proposed algorithm, PFHE metal temperature profile improved about 30% compared to trial and error methods under design condition in a single mixed refrigerant LNG liquefaction process.

The experimental loop is usually arranged inclination or vertical for preventing LBE clogging tube at emergency conditions. Because of the high density and low Prandtl number, LBE natural convection due to buoyancy is significant in the inclined tube. In present work, the influence of buoyancy on LBE convective heat transfer is numerically investigated in a three-dimensional circle tube under different inclined angles and length-to-diameter ratios. The turbulent disturbance resulted from buoyancy reinforces convective heat transfer performances of LBE in the inclined tube. The smaller inclined angle and the larger diameter are helpful to enhance convective heat transfer. The dominant factor effect on convective heat transfer is inclined angles rather than length to diameter ratios. Further numerical investigations of LBE heat exchanger with/without buoyancy are performed. The results indicate that LBE heat exchanger of 5° inclined angle can significantly enhance convective heat transfer with the acceptable pressure drop. This structure is also sufficient to ensure LBE flow back to the storage tank when the pump stops.

A turbine vane with a cooling configuration was used as an example of the simulations; 3 different cases (Isotropic Thermal Conductivity (ITC), constant ATC, and ATC with spatial variation) were examined using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The effects of the thermal conductivity and its variation on the temperature distribution of the CMC turbine vane were also discussed. The results showed that the ATC changed the heat transfer rates in different directions inside the turbine vane, leading to a non-uniform temperature distribution. The ATC's spatial variation due to the vane's curved surface led to additional changes in the temperature distribution, especially the location of the maximum temperature and the high-temperature region. With increasing the anisotropy level, a more significant difference between the temperature fields could be observed, regardless of whether the spatial variation of the ATC was considered. The largest difference between the maximum temperatures was found to be around 107.7 K, when the ratio of the thermal conductivities in different directions was 20. The work indicates that the ATC's spatial variation should be considered in the thermal analysis of a composite hot component with a complex curved surface (such as a nozzle vane or turbine blade).

The synthesized ZnO powders were used in Zn/Ni electrochemical cells to investigate how the size and shape of ZnO can influence the Zn/Ni cell performance.

As a result, the largest-sized ZnO active material, made using the dien chelate, had the best cell performance because dien could affect the formation of the Zn dendrite and suppress its growth. However, the other cells with smaller-sized particles could not suppress dendrite growth. Therefore, the reversibility of the redox reaction, particularly the anodic reaction (Zn(s) → Zn2+ (aq)), was inhibited because the large Zn dendrite growth made Zn ion diffusion more difficult, and resulted in poorer performance.

The reconstructed sinter cakes have various complex pore distributions, leading to remarkable anisotropic thermal conductivities and complicated temperature field. The pores smaller than 300 µm dominate the number frequency in sinter cake, while a small amount of pores larger than 1 mm account for ∼94% of the total pore volume, which determine the thermal behavior greatly.

A numerical simulation method was used to evaluate the thermal characteristics of the novel single cone heat sink, and the reliability analysis was conducted to show that numerical simulation was feasible. The effects of several main parameters of a cone heat sink on average Nusselt number (Nu‾) were analyzed through numerical methods to explore the characteristics of jet flows and heat transfers in a single cone heat sink. These characteristics included the cone angle (A, A = 0–70°), cone bottom diameter to nozzle diameter ratio (d1/d, d1/d = 1–3), jet height to nozzle diameter ratio (H/d, H/d = 3–7), Reynolds number (Re, Re = 16,000–32,000) and heat flux density (q, q = 60–100 W/cm2). Results showed that the cooling effect of fluid impinging on a cone heat sink is superior to that of a conventional flat plate heat sink.

The presence of magnesium and calcium hydroxides on the membrane surface leads to an intensification of water splitting at the depleted membrane surface, resulting in suppression of electroconvection and reduction of the overlimiting current. The presence of calcium carbonate on top of magnesium and calcium hydroxides prevents their contact with water molecules. The current-voltage characteristic of such membrane system was almost identical to the characteristics of the membrane system containing the pristine membrane. To our knowledge, it was the first time that the impact of scaling nature on the electrochemical behavior of membrane system was revealed and the relative mechanisms identified and explained. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Current-voltage characteristic; Electroconvection; Electrodialysis; Ion-exchange membrane; Limiting current; Scaling; Water splitting",,2-s2.0-85027856434

In this study, the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties of the welding joint prior to and following the post-welding heat treatment (such as annealing treatment at 1010 °C for 2 h and 788 °C for 8 h) were investigated. The microstructure stability and hardness were also studied following 500 h, 1000 h and 3000 h at the service temperature (750 °C). An epitaxial growth of the grains near the fusion line was observed, whereas the partition coefficients and solidification temperature range during the thermodynamic state of equilibrium were calculated in the weld metal zone. The welding heat affected zone of the as-welded welding joint was the weakest zone. In contrast, following the post-welding heat treatment, the segregation was significantly eliminated in the weld metal zone. Also, the mechanical properties of the welding heat affected zone were restored to the property levels of the base metal, with the weld strength reduction factor of 4%. Therefore, the effects of post-welding heat treatment on the microstructure and properties of welding joint were also investigated. Following 3000 h thermal exposure at 750 °C, the coarsening rates of the spherical γ′ precipitates of both the as-welded and post-welding heat treatment samples were consistent with the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) model. In addition, the microstructure stability of the welding joint was excellent, without any topologically closed packed phase precipitation.

As a result of Al2O3 dispersion by the two-step process, significant grain refinement, change in the grain morphology, and change in the morphology of the CuAl2 phase were observed. The dispersion of nano-particles was uniform in a substantial fraction of grains. However, in the remaining grains, segregation near the boundary of Al-rich phase and CuAl2 was observed suggesting pushing from both the ends. The reduction in grain size and change in the morphology of CuAl2 were ascribed to the increased heterogenous nucleation rate due to the presence of Al2O3 nano-dispersoids. The distribution was explained on the basis of deagglomeration due to the cavitation and influence of Cu on— (a) the wettability of the Al-Cu with Al2O3, and (b) pushing of nano-particles by the solidification front. The strengthening upon the dispersion was elucidated in terms of a climbing mechanism, which has been proposed earlier in the literature. The increase in the ductility was attributed to the lower extent of the inhomogeneity as a result of two-step ultrasonication in the nanocomposite as compared to the base alloy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cavitation; Deagglomeration; Dispersion; Microstructure; MMNC; Nanocomposite; Ultrasonic casting","Aluminum; Binary alloys; Cavitation; Copper alloys; Dispersion (waves); Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Metallic matrix composites; Microstructure; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Ultrasonic applications; Casting techniques; Ceramic nanoparticles; De agglomerations; Dispersion of nano particles; Grain morphologies; Heterogenous nucleation; MMNC; Solidification fronts; Aluminum alloys",2-s2.0-85030704504

The effect of thermal ageing on a primary-secondary stress dependent creep model has been explored, by conducting a set of uniaxial creep experiments on both un-aged and aged P92 steel. It was observed that thermal ageing enhanced the creep deformation for a narrow range of stresses, and systematically reduced the creep rupture life. These applied for conditions by up to a quarter of the original life. Results from creep crack growth tests for similarly aged material reduced incubation time and accelerated the crack growth rate.

Trapezoidal loading-waveforms with 2 s and 200 s dwell times imposed at the minimum and the maximum strains were adopted for the testing. A constant strain range of 2% was maintained throughout the fully-reversed loading conditions (strain ratio R = −1).

It was found that the stress amplitude remained almost constant until final fracture, suggesting limited cyclic hardening/softening. Also, stress relaxation was clearly observed during the dwell period. Scanning Electron Microscopy fractographic analyses showed evidence of similar failure modes in all the specimens. To understand deformation at grain level, crystal plasticity finite element modelling was carried out based on grain textures measured with EBSD.

For example, it relates to the extraction of iron from iron ore and the charging of iron-based batteries. The sluggish electro-reduction reaction of magnetite affects the energy efficiency of iron extraction or the charge rate of iron-based batteries. However, what factors affecting the reduction rate is not well understood. In this study, electrochemical analysis, XRD, SEM, EDS mapping and XPS techniques are adopted to analyze the reaction, and it is proved that two factors determine the electro-reduction rate of magnetite electrode: O2− diffusion inside the particles determines the electro-reduction rate of a single particle, and the electrical resistivity of electrode determines how many magnetite particles are involved in electro-reduction simultaneously. Contact resistance between particles is the dominant part of the electrical resistance of the magnetite electrode. The function mechanism of sulfide in the reaction is also revealed: a sulfide additive can react with magnetite to form amorphous or crystal FeS at different potentials. These compounds, especially crystal FeS, coat onto the surface of magnetite particles, and bond them together. The coating and bonding can decrease contact resistance significantly, thus enhancing the electro-reduction rate of magnetite to one order of magnitude. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electrical Resistivity; IR Drop; Magnetite; Reaction Rate; Sulfide","Contact resistance; Electric batteries; Electric conductivity; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Energy efficiency; Extraction; Iron; Iron compounds; Iron ores; Magnetite; Ore treatment; Reaction rates; Reduction; Secondary batteries; Sulfur compounds; Electrical resistances; Electro reduction; Electrochemical analysis; Functional mechanisms; IR drop; Iron extraction; Magnetite particles; Sulfide; Ore reduction",2-s2.0-85032360230

At 25 °C, around 40 days were required to perform three acetate batches, which led to current density of 9.4 ± 2 A.m−2, while at 40 °C, 20 days were sufficient to complete three similar batches, leading to 22.9 ± 4.2 A.m−2.

Complex interaction of the incident light with the aggregated particles is expected due to their comparable length scales. In this study, the aggregation behavior of TiO2 nanoparticles during photocatalytic ethanol reforming was investigated by the dynamic light scattering (DLS). DLS results demonstrated that UV light can significantly inhibit the aggregation of TiO2 compared to that under visible light or in the dark. Considering that the ethanol photo-reforming over TiO2 can only occur under UV light, we correlated the significant light-induced particle aggregation with the photocatalytic reactions. Three different aggregation degrees for TiO2 were employed to study the effect of aggregation on its activity for photocatalytic H2 production. The H2 production is found to decrease with the increase of aggregates in the suspension. Our results should be of great value for the understanding of the dynamics in photocatalyst particle suspension during the photocatalytic reaction.

In the production of mini-tablets, tablets smaller than 6 mm, achievement of uniform die fill is much more challenging. Powder flow is often associated with die fill accuracy but this relationship has not been well characterised especially for mini-tablets. In this study, flow properties of different types of granules were characterised. Mini-tablets of 1.8 and 3 mm diameters were prepared from the granules using a rotary press with multiple-tip compression tooling. A methodology was established to evaluate mini-tablet die fill variation within and across compaction cycles using data from compression roller displacement and mini-tablet weight. Both sizes of mini-tablets showed similar extents of inter-cycle weight variation that could be associated with granules’ inter-particulate friction. However, smaller mini-tablets had higher intra-cycle weight variation due to their narrower die orifices. Multivariate and univariate analyses suggested that gravity fill influenced intra-cycle weight variation of 3 mm mini-tablets while suction fill was associated with that of 1.8 mm mini-tablets.

The effect of relative density on the measured thermal properties was investigated by compressing the powders into specimen of different relative densities. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was employed to explore endothermic or exothermic events in the temperature range endured during typical pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, such as tabletting and roll compaction. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to analyse the water/solvent content, either in the form as solvates or as loosely bound molecules on the particle surface. Thermal conductivity analysis (TCA) was conducted to measure thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity. It is shown that, for the MCC powders, almost no changes in morphology or structural changes were observed during heating to temperatures up to 200 °C. An increase in relative density or temperature leads to a high thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity. Among all MCC powders considered, Avicel DG showed the highest increase in thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity, but this heat capacity was not sensitive to the measurement temperature. For lactose and mannitol, some endothermic events occurred during heating. The thermal conductivity increased with the increase in temperature and relative density. A model was also developed to describe the variation of the thermal conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity with the relative density and the temperature.

The specific activity of the platinum foil for oxygen reduction reaction is about 1.55 mAkinetic cmPt −2 in 0.1 M HClO4 at room temperature (20°C), which is in agreement with the measurements reported for polycrystalline Pt. The Ti-based current collector leads to a very small (≈ 5.6%) loss in the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). Hydrodynamic calculations and oxygen reduction measurements confirm that even at the fastest rotation speeds used in this type of measurement (i.e., 1600 rpm), the laminar flow regime (Re ≈ 56) is maintained, allowing one to apply classical RDE analysis. Repeatable and high quality cyclic voltammograms (CVs), oxygen reduction curves, and mass and specific activities for commercial CCMs were obtained in 0.1 M HClO4 at room temperature (20°C). The activities determined from these experiments are in agreement with those of the H2/O2 fuel cell measurements under equivalent operating conditions. Degradation of the CCM's catalyst during a 30,000 potential cycling accelerated degradation test (ADT) is performed using a 0.4 mgPt cm−2 commercial CCM and shows an ECSA loss of ≈ 0.0010 m2 gPt −1 cycle−1 and a mass activity loss of ≈ 1.8 × 10−6 A mgPt −1 cycle−1. Details of the design, implementation, and results of this economical and novel approach for characterization of CCMs are presented and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","catalyst coated membrane; proton exchange membrane fuel cell and polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer; rotating disk electrode catalyst","Catalysts; Chlorine compounds; Electric current collectors; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Laminar flow; Membranes; Oxygen; Platinum; Polyelectrolytes; Reduction; Rotating disks; Accelerated degradation tests; Catalyst coated membranes; Electrochemical surface area; Hydrodynamic calculation; Laminar flow regimes; Oxygen reduction reaction; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Rotating disk electrodes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",2-s2.0-85032735682

Different types of batteries, including alkaline, zinc-carbon (Zn-C), nickel cadmium (Ni-Cd), nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH), lithium ion (Li-ion) and lithium metallic (Li-M) batteries, were mixed according to the proportion of the Canadian sales of batteries. A Box-Behnken design was applied to find the optimum leaching conditions allowing a maximum of valuable metal removals from a mixture of spent batteries in the presence of an inorganic acid and a reducing agent. The results highlighted the positive effect of sodium metabisulfite on the performance of metals removal, especially for Mn. The solid/liquid ratio and the concentration of H2SO4 were the main factors affecting the leaching behavior of valuable metals (Zn, Mn, Cd, Ni) present in spent batteries. Finally, the optimum leaching conditions were found as follows: one leaching step, solid/liquid ratio = 10.9%, [H2SO4] = 1.34 M, sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) = 0.45 g/g of battery powder and retention time = 45 min.

The organic compounds in CWW were extracted by liquid–liquid extraction step by step every day. The extraction phase was concentrated by a rotary evaporator and a nitrogen sweeping device and was analyzed by GC–MS. And the electricity-generation performances of AFBMFC were investigated. The results show that the composition of CWW was complicated, which mainly contains hydrocarbons, phenols, nitrogenous organic compounds, alcohols and aldehydes, esters and acids and so on. After a cycle of anaerobic biochemical treatment, the content of organic compounds in the effluent decreased significantly. After the treatment of AFBMFC, 99.9% phenols, 98.4% alcohol and aldehydes and 95.3% nitrogenous compounds were biodegraded.

Although the supplier selection problem has previously been investigated, an effective solution to consider the dynamics of Customer Needs (CNs) in finding the best supplier has not yet been proposed. Such a method takes into account customer needs as a determinant factor in finding the best supplier and considers possible changes in the priorities of customer needs as time passes. In this study a method integrating the analytic network process (ANP), quality function deployment (QFD), and a Markov chain is used to address the supplier selection problem. This proposed method utilizes a Markov chain to trace the changing-priorities of customer needs and find a pattern for them. The ANP–QFD method then connects this pattern to product requirements (PRs) and PRs to supplier qualifications. This combination develops a customer based supplier selection method. The best supplier is selected based on the changing-priorities of customer needs. Although the customer needs priorities keeps changing, one supplier is selected as the best one. This study introduces an innovative customer based approach to select the best supplier that is independent of initial CNs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","ANP; Markov chain; QFD; Supplier selection","Chains; Decision theory; Markov processes; Quality function deployment; Analytic network process; Determinant factors; Effective solution; Product requirements; Quality function deployments (QFD); Supplier qualification; Supplier selection; Supplier selection process; Sales",2-s2.0-85021738822

However, thermal designs have confined previous single-stage devices to thermal efficiencies below 20%. To mitigate some of these limitations, we consider dividing the isothermal expansion into two stages; one at the evaporator temperature (1150 K) and another at an intermediate temperature (650 K–1050 K). This dual-stage Na-TEC takes advantage of regeneration and reheating, and could be amenable to better thermal management.

This interest concerns the reduction of noise caused by these machines in transportation vehicles for example, to provide better comfort to users. In this paper, the noise radiated by an electrical power transformer is predicted using an end-to-end multiphysics modelling solution. The modelling procedure is based on the chaining of three analysis methods. The first one simulates the electromagnetic problem which generates Maxwell forces on the magnetic core of the transformer from electrical excitation. These forces are considered as an input for the mechanical problem solved by the finite element method (FEM) to calculate the acceleration field on the structure. Finally, these accelerations are considered as in input for the acoustic model to compute the noise radiation using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). Two models of the ferromagnetic core are considered. The first is a bloc model where the different laminates are stuck and the second is a laminated model where a small sliding condition is introduced at interfaces between sheets of metal. Numerical results of the mechanical and acoustic models using a laminated core are compared with experimental data and show good agreements with measurements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electromagnetism; Lamination; Modelling; Noise; Transformer; Vibration","Acceleration; Acoustic noise; Automobile manufacture; Boundary element method; Electric excitation; Electromagnetism; Laminating; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Models; Power transformers; Sailing vessels; Electrical excitation; Electromagnetic problems; Lamination; Multi-physics modelling; Noise; Transformer; Transportation vehicles; Vibration; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85019545886

Addition of potassium salt to increase the conductivity of coal plasma combined with high temperature render the service conditions extremely arduous. Therefore, the electrode coating materials must possess certain properties including high-temperature corrosion resistance, high-temperature oxidation resistance, and adequate electrical conductivity. In this work, those very properties of three different compositions of transition metal diboride solid solutions of HfB2-ZrB2 are studied. Two main approaches of oxidation mitigation methods were employed: adding chemical dopants, such as Hf and La, and performing pre-anodization on the samples to create a protective oxide coating. Thermogravimetric experiments were run at different partial pressures of oxygen to determine the high-temperature oxidation resistance of these boride ceramics. In addition, two different salt coatings (KCl and K2SO4) were applied to the surface of the samples to test their hot corrosion resistance. High-temperature polarization resistance tests were also conducted to measure the electrical resistivity. The addition of lanthanum aided in long term oxidation and corrosion protection, with a parabolic rate constant, Kp = 1.33 × 10−5 kg2/m4 s, a 40% improvement over the sample without the addition of lanthanum under the same conditions.

Based on the technology feasibility, a mechanical pumped cooling loop was proposed for heat rejection system, composed mainly of mechanical pumps, cooling loops and radiator plates. A heat rejection model with the convective and radiative heat transfer was developed. The convective heat transfer coefficient was larger than the radiative heat transfer coefficient by two orders of magnitude and the radiative heat transfer was the primary step controlling the heat rejection process. The radiator size and mass of the heat rejection system were calculated by the model and they were greatly affected by the cooling temperature. Increasing cooling temperature could reduce the required radiator size and mass of the heat rejection system, since higher cooling temperature could increase the heat rejection driving force. Considering the thermal efficiency of the nuclear power system, the reasonable cooling temperature would be in the range of 480 K–520 K, with the lowest specific mass of the lunar surface nuclear power system being 66 kg/kWe achieved in this range. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cooling temperature; Heat rejection; Lunar surface; Mechanical pumped cooling loop; Nuclear reactor power","Cooling; Heat sinks; Heat transfer; Heat transfer coefficients; Moon; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear reactors; Radiative transfer; Radiators; Stirling engines; Cooling loops; Cooling temperature; Heat rejection; Lunar surface; Nuclear reactor power; Heat convection",2-s2.0-85032373309

The introduction of PATs is very important in the water-energy nexus to promote the increase of the energy savings. As consequence, the majority of the water systems does not have access to the electrical grid and, therefore, the need to study the PATs operation off-grid is necessary. In this line, the novelty of this research is the application and optimization of a PAT in water systems when the recovery solution is off-grid type. To operate correctly, the induction machine requires an external source of reactive power, which is typically provided by the electrical grid. To supply the required reactive power, a bank of capacitors is installed at the machine terminals, so-called self-excited induction generator (SEIG). The analytical model, simulation and experimental works were performed, to analyse the SEIG behaviour. The results were applied in a SEIG-PAT system obtaining the global efficiency of the system for different speeds and loads. The global efficiency decreases 47% when off-grid operation, showing the need to optimize the electrical parameters of the generator to operate as off- grid with acceptable efficiency levels. In this framework, a tuning methodology for the SEIG capacitor bank values was developed to be automatically adjusted according to the operating point of the PAT to maximize its efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; PAT isolated to the grid; Self-excited induction generator (SEIG); Water-energy nexus","Asynchronous generators; Electric generators; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Metal drawing; Reactive power; Turbines; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; Waterworks; Efficiency levels; Electrical parameter; Induction machines; PAT isolated to the grid; Pressure reduction valves; Self excited induction generators; Water distribution networks; Water energy; Electric power transmission networks",2-s2.0-85031665654

The factors resulting in reversible and irreversible self-discharge are analyzed by electrochemical pressure-composition isotherms, Tafel and SEM measurements. Electrochemical P-C isotherms show that with the increasing [NdNi5]/[NdMgNi4] subunit ratio, the hydrogen desorption plateau pressure sharply elevates, leading to less stability of the corresponding hydride and more reversible self-discharge of the alloys; whereas, corrosion current density of the three alloy electrodes gradually decreases and SEM shows that the amount of hydroxide accumulating on the alloy surface diminishes, indicating the oxidation/corrosion degree alleviates and less irreversible self-discharge with the higher [NdNi5]/[NdMgNi4] ratio. By calculating the proportion of reversible and irreversible self-discharge in total capacity loss, we find that the reversible self-discharge is nearly more than 90% for the three single-phase alloys, while irreversible self-discharge is less than 10%, which illustrates that reversible self-discharge is the dominate factor in self-discharge of Nd–Mg–Ni-based alloys in this study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electrochemical property; Nd–Mg–Ni-based alloy; Nickel metal hydride battery; Self-discharge characteristic; Superlattice structure","Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical properties; Electrodes; Hydrides; Isotherms; Neodymium; Neodymium compounds; Nickel; Nickel alloys; Nickel compounds; Nickel metal hydride batteries; Corrosion current densities; Electrochemical pressure; Hydrogen desorption; Ni based alloy; Plateau pressures; Self-discharges; Single phase alloy; Super-lattice structures; Electric discharges",2-s2.0-85032189184

Herein, the 3 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (3YSZ) with ultrahigh SSA was synthesized by an one-step alkali chloride-assisted solution combustion process, employing urea as fuel and easily available ZrOCl2·8H2O as zirconium source. The effects of the alkali chloride amount/sort, urea amount and ignition temperature (Tig) on the microstructure of the resultants were systematically investigated. The results show that the 3YSZ derived from KCl-assisted solution combustion consists of monodisperse nanocrystals with 3.2 nm in average size (DTEM) and 378 m2 g−1 in SSA under the condition of stoichiometric urea-to-nitrate ratio (α = 1), 4:1 M ratio of alkali chloride to metal ions of 3YSZ (β = 4) and Tig = 500 °C. The introduction of alkali chlorides into the combustion mixture solution plays a critical part in the formation of well-dispersed 3YSZ nanocrystals with ultrahigh SSA. The amount/sort of alkali chloride, urea amount and ignition temperature also have significant influence on the SSAs of the resultants. In summary, the approach offers a facile, efficient, scalable and cost-effective strategy for fabrication of zirconia-based oxides with ultrahigh SSA. © 2017","3YSZ; Alkali chloride-assisted solution combustion synthesis; Nanopowders; Ultrahigh specific surface area","Chlorine compounds; Combustion synthesis; Cost effectiveness; Metabolism; Metal ions; Metals; Nanocrystals; Nanostructured materials; Specific surface area; Urea; Zirconia; 3YSZ; Cost effective strategies; High specific surface area; Monodisperse nanocrystals; Nano powders; Solution combustion process; Solution combustion synthesis; Yttria stabilized zirconia powders; Yttria stabilized zirconia",2-s2.0-85029481853

The present paper introduces a novel technique for calculation of effective permittivity and permeability based on results of direct finite element method simulations of electromagnetic fields within the model. Equations for calculation of effective electrodynamics parameters were derived from a combination of surface impedance equations and impedance values for an ideal conductor and an ideal magnetic mirror. The contribution of electric and magnetic losses was evaluated and compared for completely conductive particles and dielectric particles with a conductive shell. It was identified that for completely conductive particles and for metallized dielectric particles the imaginary part of effective permeability is orders of magnitude greater than the imaginary part of effective permittivity. In addition, the imaginary part of effective permeability of core-shell metallized dielectric particles can be nearly twice as greater than the one of completely conductive particles.

The ultra-small gold nanoparticles (NPs) were appended to the openings of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) by Au-S bonds as the gatekeepers. Meanwhile, the gold NPs could be heated to high temperature by the near infrared (NIR) light irradiation, which is conducive to photothermal therapy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) spectra confirmed the formation of MSN-SH and MSN-Au. An in vitro NIR-induced photothermal study indicated that MSN-Au possessed concentration-dependent and power-dependent photothermal conversion capacity. Doxorubicin (DOX) was selected as the model drug loaded in the MSN. In vitro drug release showed that DOX released faster in the presence of glutathione (GSH) or NIR laser irradiation than without GSH or NIR irradiation, which suggested that the system had potentials for redox-responsive and NIR-triggered drug release. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) was performed to evaluate the cellular uptake performance of DOX/MSN-Au. The cytotoxicity assay indicated that DOX/MSN-Au had a synergistic therapeutic effect by the combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy.

The oxidation process is described by a power-law model where the oxidation rate decreases rapidly from the initial oxidation rate with increasing time. The oxidation rate of GeSn is higher than that of pure Ge, which can be explained by the higher chemical reaction rate at the GeSn-oxide/GeSn interface. In addition, the Sn atoms at the interface region exchange positions with the underlying Ge atoms during oxidation, leading to a SnO2-rich oxide near the interface. The bandgap of GeSn oxide is extracted to be 5.1 ± 0.2 eV by XPS, and the valence band offset at the GeSn-oxide/GeSn heterojunction is found to be 3.7 ± 0.2 eV.

A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model is established to study the flow and heat transfer inside the full-size PTR equipped with wavy-tape insert. It is found that wavy-tape provokes highly-localized heat transfer enhancement effects, which exactly aim at the highly-concentrated solar heat load. Consequently, both the tube temperature and the heat loss are reduced effectively. A static mechanical analysis is performed to evaluate the thermal stress and deformation of absorber tube, both of which decrease in the presence of wavy-tape. However, the wavy-tape improves the PTR thermal-mechanical performances at the expense of increased pressure loss penalty. The overall effects of wavy-tape insert on PTR are evaluated based on different criterions. For a same flow rate, the total entropy generation rate can be reduced significantly by using wavy-tape insert.

It has been found that, at low current density, the rapid capacity decay of pure aluminium is prevalently due to the incomplete reversibility of the lithiated phase, Li9Al4 during the delithiathion of the anode. Lithium extraction has been found to always be incomplete during anode discharge. Partially reversible Li9Al4 is also present in the 2090-T8 aluminium alloy, together with fully reversible crystals of the Al5CuLi3 phase. In this case, the anode capacity fade after the second galvanostatic cycle is modest. As far as the pure aluminium anode is concerned, thick compound layers, made up of oxides and phosphates on the electrode surface, hinder Li diffusion in the host metal to a great extent, at a high current density, thus abating the anode capacity. However, no surface problems have been encountered for the 2090-T8 alloy, and a high capacity was maintained, after the second galvanostatic cycle, due to the presence of the partially reversible Al4Li9 and Al2Li3 crystals, together with the fully reversible Al6CuLi3 quasicrystal. Therefore, one way of overcoming the low capacity of a pure aluminium anode is to adopt an Al6CuLi3 quasicrystal, or its crystal approximant Al5CuLi3, which may be present in the 2090-T8 alloy because of the previous presence of copper and lithium. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2090-T8 aluminium alloy; Anode; Capacity; Lithium-ion battery; Ternary Al-Cu-Li compounds; X-ray diffraction; XPS analysis",,2-s2.0-85027994133

In this study, A5B19-type hydrogen storage alloys with the elemental composition of La4MgNi18M (M = Ni, Al, Cu, and Co) were prepared by vacuum induction melting followed by annealing. In addition, the effect of the incorporation of M on the phase transformation and electrochemical performance was investigated. The X-ray diffraction profiles revealed the presence of AB5, A2B7 (Ce2Ni7 and Gd2Co7), and A5B19 (Pr5Co19 and Ce5Co19) phases, and no A2B7 (Ce2Ni7 and Gd2Co7) phase, in the La4MgNi18Al alloys. The substitution of Al clearly led to the increased abundance of the A5B19 phase and the disappearance of the A2B7 phase. Cu and Co exhibited similar roles in the phase composition and contributed to the formation of the A2B7 phase. The substitution of Ni by Al, Cu, or Co led to the increase in the maximum discharge capacity Cmax, which is mainly related to the increase in the cell volume and the abundances of the A2B7 and A5B19 phases. With increasing annealing temperature, the Cmax of the La4MgNi18M alloy electrodes first increased and then decreased, with the highest value obtained at an annealing temperature of 1223 K. The change trend in the cycling stability of the La4MgNi18M alloy electrodes was inversely proportional to that of the abundance of the LaNi5 phase. The substitution of Ni by Al, Cu, or Co led to the enhancement in the cycling stability of the alloy electrodes, which was related to the improvement in the corrosion resistance and anti-pulverization ability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","A5B19-type La-Mg-Ni alloys; Electrochemical performance; Element substitution; Hydrogen storage alloy; Phase transformation",,2-s2.0-85027876878

Compared with pure TiO2, the TiO2/rGO hybrids have a reduced particle size and layer-shaped structure. For electrochemical test, the TiO2/rGO assembly exhibits high rate capability (∼270 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), and excellent cycling capacity (∼180 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 2000 cycle). Studying the electrochemical reaction process finds that the charge transfer rate of titanium oxide were significantly increased due to the addition of graphene oxide. A diffusion controlled behavior of Li+ is found to dominate the charge-discharge process in TiO2/rGO hybrids, rather than the capacitive process of the pure TiO2 electrode. This dominated diffusion is believed to inspire both of superior rate and capacity of the TiO2/rGO hybrids in this work. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Diffusion coefficient; Electrochemical performance; Kinetics; Li-ion batteries; TiO2/rGO",,2-s2.0-85028412208

To tackle these issues, we propose a novel device that combines all the components of a solar-battery system in one device.

However, this physical integration means higher temperatures for the components. Therefore, this paper presents a thermal analysis of the physical integration concept to evaluate its feasibility, focusing on the batteries, the most delicate components. The thermal analysis was conducted using a Finite Element Method model and validated with experimental results on a prototype. According to the model, the temperature of the components (battery and converters) reduced drastically by adding an air gap of 5–7 cm between the solar panel and the components. Even under severe conditions, maximum battery temperature never surpassed the highest temperature of operation defined by the manufacturer. Moreover, the maximum battery temperature decreases even further by applying a phase change material as a passive cooling method, reducing it by 5 °C.

The improved electrochemical performance can be defined by the co-effect of Al2O3 coating and Al doping on bare LMO NPs. The former is related to cycle stability that increased due to the prevention of volume expansion and Mn dissolution as a physical buffer layer.

The present work investigates the performance of anode supported solid oxide fuel cells in case of co-feeding of different trace compounds. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is the investigation technique used to analyze the impedance spectra. Typical biogas from OFMSW trace contaminants that follow an initial failure in the cleaning system, such as sulphur, aromatic compounds and siloxanes, have been simultaneously tested. Tests showed that the most deleterious impact for the SOFC was due to the H2S action. This influences mostly the electrochemical losses respect to diffusion losses, even if this last are not null and can be accounted as a secondary effect.

The results indicate that the graphene is in the form of nano-sized sheets which in-situ growed and wrapped around LiFePO4 particles to form a unique core-shell structure. The formation of the core-shell structure is owing to the special chelation and reducing functional groups in the EDTMPA molecules. It is also found that the fabricated LiFePO4@Graphene has a particle size of below 100 nm with high purity. Further on, the fabricated LFP@G exhibits a high reversible capacity of 161.8 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C rate, and an excellent rate capacity of 125.9 mAh g−1 at 10 C, which shows a great potential as a superior cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. The present work also elucidates the mechanism of how the special core-shell structure LiFePO4@Graphene can benefit the Li+ migration during the charge/discharge processes and improve the electronic conductivity of the LFP@G nanocomposites. © 2017","Chelation effect; Core-shell structure; Electrochemical properties; In-situ effect; LiFePO4@Graphene nanocomposite; Organic phosphorus acid",,2-s2.0-85028515776

Specifically, ZIF-67 (ZIF = Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks) microcrystals firstly grow on benzoic acid modified covalent organic framework (BFC), resulting in ZIF-67/COF composite. Subsequently, highly dispersed Co3O4/NPC was obtained via the calcination of ZIF-67/COF. Interestingly, high dispersion of supported Co3O4 is dominated by homogeneous distribution of benzoic acid auchoring on nanoporous COF. More notably, largely triggered by the porosity and confining effect of COF, the resultant Co3O4/NPC features highly active crystal plane and a large specific surface area of 228.0 m2/g. Furthermore, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) measurement results demonstrated that highly dispersed Co3O4/NPC features good catalytic activity (330 mV overpotential at 10 mA.cm−2, 79 mV.dec−1 Tafel slope and mass activity of 130 A.g−1 at overpotential of 400 mV) and durable stability, superior to currently available counterparts. Moreover, Li-ion battery (LIB) tests also showed high reversible capacity (785 mA.h.g−1 at 500 mA.g−1) as well as excellent cycling stability and rate performance. Furthermore, Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrated that these superior OER properties can be attributed to the geometrical and electronic effects of Co3O4/NPC on activation and adsorption/desorption of reaction species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Co3O4; COF; Electrocatalytical properties; MOF; Oxygen evolution reaction",,2-s2.0-85027998901

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the conductivity of LICGC membranes immersed in deionized water remains stable over a one month period, while there is a significant increase in resistance when exposed to the acidic solutions. When exposed to pH 4 and 2 solutions for just 24 h, the resistances of the LICGC membrane increase by a factor of 8.5 and 23.5, respectively. EIS coupled with morphological characterization by scanning electron microscopy, shows that this resistance growth is due to the development of a surface layer on the LICGC membrane. However, this substantial increase in resistance can be mitigated by adding LiCl to the HCl solutions. For a pH 4 solution supported with 6.75 M LiCl, the impedance spectrum and surface morphology are qualitatively comparable to pristine, dry LICGC material, suggesting that surface layer formation was suppressed.

The structure, morphology, valence state and electrochemical performance of F-doped LiFePO4/C materials are investigated systematically.

The morphology analysis indicates that the particle size of F-doped LiFePO4/C samples are slightly increased compared with LiFePO4/C sample, F doping promotes the growth of the primary particles. An interesting red shift in FTIR analysis shows that F doping induces the rearrangement of the electron cloud in the PO4 3−, thus impacts the intrinsic conductivity and enhances the electrochemical performance. Raman analysis reveals that the LiFePO4/C and F-doped LiFePO4/C composites almost have the same amount of sp2-coordinated carbon in the residual carbon, thus F doping is more critical to the electrochemical performance compared with the carbon coating. XPS analysis shows that F is successfully incorporated into the product, and F doping does not change the valance of elements.

The chlorine dioxide gas converts the relatively insoluble nitric oxide (NO) to the more soluble nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This makes a downstream wet scrubbing process feasible for simultaneous removal of sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). An experimental evaluation of the proposed process using chlorine dioxide gas has been performed on a laboratory scale. The experimental setup, designed and built by Akzo Nobel, consists of a reactor for oxidation, a flue gas condenser and a wet scrubber. The results show that ClO2 gas oxidises NO with high efficiencies under a wide range of process conditions, also in the presence of sulphur dioxide (SO2). The more ClO2 gas is added, the higher the degree of NO oxidation and the total nitrogen oxides (NOx) removal efficiency becomes. The results also show that the presence of water strongly increases the removal of SO2 which is believed to be an effect of liquid phase nitrogen-sulphur interactions. The absorption solution, sodium carbonate and sodium sulphite, is efficient in removing NOx (especially NO2) from the oxidised flue gas. The total NOx reduction at 0.6 ClO2:NO mole ratio and subsequent wet scrubbing is between 79% and 94%, depending on the process conditions used. The total SO2 reduction in the scrubber is between 97% and 100% independent of ClO2 gas addition. Furthermore, the total NOx balance shows that the major part of the NOx is converted to nitrate in the condensate liquor and as nitrite in the absorption solution.

Usually, lakes created after the end of lignite mine activity have extremely acidic or very acidic water, with pH < 3.0, caused by the oxidation of pyrite and marcasite and other sulfide compounds. After the closure of mines, the lakes undergo natural neutralization. However, this process is long-term and depends on many different factors, such as the amount of carbonates, the geological structure of bedrock, hydrology and hydrobiology, climate and the method of lignite exploitation. In some types of anthropogenic lakes (i.e., clay pits), water pH is almost neutral or alkaline due to the adsorption properties of clay minerals. Along the Polish-German border in the Łuk Mużakowa Geopark, over 100 post-mining lakes were formed as a result of lignite and clay exploitation. The Mining pH training set of modern diatom samples and water chemistry was created from 69 lakes to quantify the relationship between the diatom assemblages living in these water bodies and the lakes' chemical composition. Then, this database was applied to the reconstruction of diatom-inferred pH in the sediments of a post-mining lake TR-33. The results of reconstruction was compared to similar analysis based on the Combined pH training set containing more variety of diatom taxa from a higher number of lakes. Although the second dataset was larger and gave a smaller root mean square error, the Mining pH training set has a longer gradient of pH including lakes with extremely acidic water and gives more reliable results. The reconstruction of DI-pH in TR-33 which had very acidic water in the past and currently neutralized from acidification was more precise and reliable using the database sensu stricto, which consists of only the post-mining lakes. © 2016","Artificial lakes; Diatoms; Mining pH training set; Natural neutralization; Reconstruction of diatom-inferred pH","Lakes; Lignite; Lignite mines; Mean square error; Mineral resources; pH; Sulfide minerals; Adsorption properties; Artificial lake; Chemical compositions; Diatoms; Geological structures; Natural neutralization; Root mean square errors; Training sets; Alkalinity; acidification; adsorption; diatom; exploitation; lake water; mining; neutralization; oxidation; pH; Achnanthidium minutissimum; Achnathes hungarica; acidity; adsorption; alkalinity; Amphipleura pellucida; analytical error; Article; Asterionella formosa; Aulacoseira; Brachysira; chemical composition; clay; Cocconeis; Cyclostephanos; Cyclotella; diatom; Discostella; Eunotia; Fragilaria; general device; lake ecosystem; Mining and the Combined pH training set; Nitzschia; nonhuman; pH; Pinnularia; Poland; priority journal; Pseudostaurosira brevistriata; Puncticulata radiosa; quantitative analysis; reliability; species diversity; Staurosira construens; Staurosirella pinnata; Stephanodiscus hantzschii; surface mining; Tabellaria; water analysis; Poland [Central Europe]; Bacillariophyta",2-s2.0-85021135670

From the specific heat data, we determined the phonon components, that is, the Debye and Einstein modes, for Th- and U-based isostructural aluminides. To approximate the Sommerfeld coefficients, we had to include the T3lnT term characteristic of spin-fluctuations originating from the Fe-sublattice. The roughly estimated spin-fluctuation temperature is about 11 K. ThFe2Al10 is a weakly temperature-dependent Pauli-paramagnet. However, at lower temperatures the ferromagnetic correlations are observed, which signals that the system drives to quantum criticality. The distinct minimum in electrical resistivity observed at about 20 K suggests a realization of a nonmagnetic two-channel Kondo-effect in ThFe2Al10, as discussed for ThAsSe [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 236603 (2005)], for example. The [ρ(T) – ρmin] versus T curves of ThFe2Al10, determined along the a- and c-axes, were used to subtract the phonon contributions from the corresponding ρ(T)a,c of UFe2Al10. The resulting magnetic part of the average ρm(T)av curve was then analysed in terms of the influence of the crystal field effect on the transport properties. However, to obtain agreement with the experiment, we had to take into account another effect, namely the Kondo-like one. This kind of probe has been applied for the first time in the case of uranium compounds.

Mag. B 95, 2343 (2015)]. Furthermore, fully relativistic band structure calculations performed for ThFe2Al10 revealed its metallic-like character with a similarly large contribution of the Fe 3d electrons at the Fermi level as predicted previously for its 5f-electron analogue UFe2Al10.

Recently, their removal methodologies are advanced after exploring nanomaterials. Therefore, degradation of selected toxic PAHs (3–5 rings) using potassium zinc hexacyanoferrate (KZnHCF) nanocubes was studied. Highly crystalline and sharp KZnHCF nanocubes (∼100 nm) were obtained by green route using sapindus mukorossi. In both water and soil, anthracene and phenanthrene were degraded to maximum extent (80–93%), whereas, the degradation of fluorene, chrysene and benzo (a) pyrene were ∼70–80%.Because of small size (lower molecular weight), large number of anthracene and phenanthrene molecules were adsorbed on catalyst as compared to other PAHs. Higher degradation of PAHs in water than in the soil is attributed to the easy absorption of PAHs on catalyst in water and slow diffusion of PAHs on organic content of soil. PAHs were degraded at the concentration of 50 mg/L, 25 mg catalyst dose, neutral pH and solar irradiation. Higher proficiency of the catalyst was revealed by degradation of PAHs into small and non-toxic by-products such as malealdehyde, 4-oxobut-2-enoic acid and o-xylene.

More than 80% NO reduction and 90% Hg0 oxidation were concurrently achieved on the CuO/TiO2 catalyst at 250 °C under a simulated NH3 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) atmosphere. NO was likely oxidized on the CuO/TiO2 catalyst to form active nitrogenous species, particularly with the aid of oxygen. The active nitrogenous species then significantly promoted Hg0 oxidation. NH3 itself did not affect Hg0 conversion on the CuO/TiO2 catalyst. The co-occurrences of NO and NH3 led to a reduction in oxidized mercury (HgO in this work), which partially offset the Hg0 oxidation and therefore resulted in a relatively lower Hg0 conversion efficiency. However, compared to flue gas without NO and NH3, the combined presence of NO and NH3 still enhanced Hg0 oxidation over the CuO/TiO2 catalyst, primarily because of the overwhelming benefit from NO.

The attractive electrochemical performance of the silicon nanorods is attributed to its 1D nanostructure, porosity and outward nanometer-sized SiOx layer.

An experimental test rig was built up, and a numerical model was developed to obtain the characteristics of the thermal stratification in the water pit thermal storage. Fluid properties are assumed to be constant, except for the density changes with temperature which is treated using the Boussinesq approximation. The simulations of temperature profiles are reasonably proved by experiments with the maximum relative errors of ±9.77%. The results show that water temperature decreases close to the walls due to the heat losses, which leads to a downward flow along the inclined sidewalls. A slight upward flow occurs at the center of the water pit thermal storage, which lifts the warmer water to a higher level. As a result, the buoyancy-driven flow gradually builds up the thermal stratification in the water pit thermal storage. The modelling results also show that the values of the average Nusselt numbers on the inner surface of the inclined sidewalls and the bottom of the tank are much higher than that of the top thermal insulation layer. The thermal energy storage efficiency decreases rapidly in the first five minutes from 100% to 83.19% due to the intense heat transfer, and then tends to level off at the end of 40 min. The maximum velocity of the natural convection appears close to the upper part of the inclined sidewalls, and it decreases with the cooling process evolved. The present work has a valuable attempt to fill the gap in the existing studies and is useful for guiding the water pit thermal storage design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Boussinesq approximation; Buoyancy-driven flow; Efficiency; Natural convection; Thermal stratification; Water pit thermal storage","Buoyancy; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Groundwater; Heat losses; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Natural convection; Thermal stratification; Walls (structural partitions); Boussinesq approximations; Buoyancy driven flows; Comparative studies; Maximum relative errors; Temperature profiles; Thermal insulation layer; Thermal storage; Transient natural convection; Thermal insulation",2-s2.0-85029454215

Rebar in reinforced concrete is mainly corroded due to penetration of chloride ions which are one of the most dominant degradation factor for reinforced concrete. An effective method to monitor the extent of corrosion is to determine the positions where the chloride ions are present beyond the chloride threshold level (CTL). The sensors consist of ultrathin-film iron (Fe) layers deposited on the PET substrate, Au lines as electrode connection lines, and anion exchange membrane encasing the sensor. As the chloride ions exist near Fe layer of sensors, as if rebar has been corroded in reinforced concrete, the macro cells which occur relatively low anode and high cathode with somehow distance between them are made up and pitting corrosion accelerates. The pitting corrosion on the Fe layer of sensor induces the variation of electrical properties, which indicates the corrosion level using variations of resistance (R) and electrical response (R/R0). To protect the sensor from mechanical and chemical stimuli in a concrete, sensors are encapsulated with an anion exchange membrane that functions not only as a protector, but also as a selector of anions including chloride ions among degradation factors. Therefore, by embedding sensors at every 10 mm depth from the surface of reinforced concrete, we can monitor the corrosion tendency causing penetration of chloride ions with respect to depth. Through the variation of electrical properties in sensors, the velocity of corrosion (ΔR·R0 -1·t-1) is suggested as a new parameter, which shows the tendency for corrosion under the surrounding conditions. To confirm the relationship between corrosion velocity as determined by the sensor and the concentration of diffused chloride ions, the chloride concentration in mortar is measured.

The experiments of clean water aeration showed that the oxygen transfer coefficient of jet aeration increased with the liquid flow rate. The results of jet aeration oxidation of magnesium sulfite revealed that the oxidation process could be divided into two stages according to the concentration of magnesium sulfite, i.e., the saturated stage controlled by the oxygen transfer and the unsaturated reaction stage controlled by the oxygen transfer and the sulfite concentration. In the saturated reaction stage, the oxidation rate was found increasing linearly with the increase of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient. The oxidation reaction occurred in the fast reaction regime. In the unsaturated reaction stage, the oxidation reaction rate was 0.62 order in sulfite ion and zero-order in oxygen, whereas the reaction rate constant was found increasing linearly with the oxygen transfer coefficient.

The coupling effect was investigated by combining non-catalytic/catalytic pyrolysis and gasification in a pressurized IFB. Having TB pyrolysis obviously raised CH4 yield (also its content in producer gas) and tar yield. The respective contributions to CH4 formation from the TB pyrolysis and FB gasification were mainly relevant to operating pressure and Ca(OH)2 catalyst. Raising pressure facilitated CH4 formation. When lignite was treated without catalyst, the contribution from TB pyrolysis was greater than that from FB gasification as hydropyrolysis was intensified by pressure in H2-rich gas atmosphere from the FB gasifier. Adding catalyst into lignite reversed their contributions. The FB catalytic gasification formed more CH4 because Ca(OH)2 functioned well as a catalyst for CH4 formation in pressurized gasification. With elevated pressure or/and the addition of Ca(OH)2, pyrolysis tar yield decreased in different degrees but its quality was improved. With the combination effect of pressure and Ca(OH)2, producer gas from the tested IFB reactor was highly rich in CH4 to reach 10.8 vol%, with as well a high H2/CO ratio of 2.3 that is suitable for making SNG.

The good NH3-SCR performance of the V0.5WCe/Ti catalyst was due to the enhancement in acidity that arose from the introduced vanadium oxide, the better redox capability and greater amount of surface adsorbed oxygen species (O2 −, O− and O2−) by Ce-modification, which generated a large amount of NO2, conducting the “fast SCR reaction”. Hg0 oxidation was strongly affected by surface adsorbed oxygen and C[dbnd]O functional groups in the absence of HCl in CO2-enriched flow conditions, while the reaction was mostly between Hg0 (ad)/HgO(ad) and gaseous Cl⁎ or Cl2 in the presence of both HCl and O2. In addition, a high concentration of CO2 inhibited NO conversion, because of the rate of diffusion, but promoted Hg0 removal. Furthermore, while a high concentration of HCl prohibited NO conversion due to the formation of V–Cl and Ce–Cl on the catalyst surface, Hg0 adsorption and catalytic oxidation were inhibited when SO2 and H2O coexisted in the flue gas. © 2017","Ce-modification; Elemental mercury; Low-V2O5-based catalyst; NH3-SCR; NO; Oxy-combustion flue gas","Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Chlorine compounds; Combustion; Flue gases; Flues; Fuels; Nobelium; Vanadium compounds; Adsorbed oxygen; Catalyst surfaces; Ce modifications; Elemental mercury; Oxy combustions; Oxyfuel combustion; Simultaneous removal; Vanadium oxides; Mercury compounds",2-s2.0-85032196171

On one hand, a commercial mesoporous alumina support was used as reference material. On the other hand, a meso-macroporous alumina was prepared in the laboratory. The macropores were expected to act as transport pores and facilitate diffusion through the catalytic phase volume. Despite showing different porosities, both catalysts presented similar cobalt dispersions and maintained the textural properties observed in the slurried samples once they were deposited onto the metallic monoliths. Being made of a high-thermal-conductivity substrate, the structured catalysts behaved like isothermal reactors with no significant radial thermal gradient being observed inside them during the reactions. Under isothermal conditions, the catalytic differences in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis tests carried out at the same conversion values were ascribed to only diffusional effects imparted by the influence of the macropores. Methane selectivity increased and C5+ selectivity decreased linearly with catalyst loading. Moreover, for the highest catalyst loading used, methane selectivity was higher and C5+ selectivity was lower for the catalyst with transport pores. However, when the results of catalysis studies were analyzed as a function of the average catalyst layer thickness; thus under equivalent diffusion lengths, the catalyst containing transport pores showed lower methane selectivity and higher C5+ selectivity than the reference catalyst over the entire range of layer thicknesses studied. Therefore, the effect of macropores was observed to reduce the diffusion limitations, although at high catalyst loadings the layer thickness determined the selectivity results more than the macroporosity of the layer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Catalyst layer thickness; Fischer-Tropsch; Macroporosity; Structured catalyst",,2-s2.0-85027496714

However, its structure and colloidal properties continue to be the subject of debate, largely owing to its molecular complexity and association with other humic substances and mineral matter. As a class, HA is considered to comprise supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous species, and herein we consider a simple route for the separation of some HA sub-fractions. Experiments: A commercial HA sample from Sigma-Aldrich has been fractionated into two soluble (S1, S2) and two insoluble (I1, I2) fractions by successive dissolution in deionized water at near-neutral pH. These sub-fractions have been characterized by solution and solid-state approaches. Findings: Using this simple approach, the HA has been shown to contain non-covalently bonded species with different polarity and water solubility. The soluble and insoluble fractions have very different chemical structures, as revealed particularly by their solid-state properties (13C NMR and IR spectroscopy, and TGA); in particular, S1 and S2 are characterized by higher carbonyl and aromatic contents, compared with I1 and I2.

With a global PV installed capacity of 303 GW, a nominal 10 °C decrease in their average temperature could theoretically lead to 15 GW increase in electricity production worldwide. Currently, there is a gap in the research knowledge concerning the effectiveness of the available passive thermal regulation techniques for BICPV, both individually and working in tandem. This paper presents a novel combined passive cooling solution for BICPV incorporating micro-fins, Phase Change Material (PCM) and Nanomaterial Enhanced PCM (n-PCM). This work was undertaken with the aim to assess the unreported to date benefits of introducing these solutions into BICPV systems and to quantify their individual as well as combined effectiveness. The thermal performance of an un-finned metallic plate was first compared to a micro-finned plate under naturally convective conditions and then compared with applied PCM and n-PCM. A designed and fabricated, scaled-down thermal system was attached to the electrical heaters to mimic the temperature profile of the BICPV. The results showed that the average temperature in the centre of the system was reduced by 10.7 °C using micro-fins with PCM and 12.5 °C using micro-fins with n-PCM as compared to using the micro-fins only. Similarly, the effect of using PCM and n-PCM with the un-finned surface demonstrated a temperature reduction of 9.6 °C and 11.2 °C respectively as compared to the case of natural convection. Further, the innovative 3-D printed PCM containment, with no joined or screwed parts, showed significant improvements in leakage control. The important thermophysical properties of the PCM and the n-PCM were analysed and compared using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter. This research can contribute to bridging the existing gaps in research and development of thermal regulation of BICPV and it is envisaged that the realised incremental improvement can be a potential solution to (a) their performance improvement and (b) longer life, thereby contributing to the environmental benefits. © 2017 The Authors","Building-integrated concentrating photovoltaic (BICPV); Micro-fins; Nanomaterial enhanced PCM (NEPCM, n-PCM); Passive cooling; Phase Change Materials (PCM); Thermal management","Differential scanning calorimetry; Environmental regulations; Fins (heat exchange); Nanostructured materials; Temperature control; Thermal variables control; Thermodynamic properties; Concentrating photovoltaic; Differential scanning calorimeters; Electricity production; Incremental improvements; Micro fins; Passive cooling; Photovoltaic technology; Research and development; Phase change materials",2-s2.0-85029592771

The focus of this feasibility study, performed on the pilot plant scale, was on technological options for three key process stages in the manufacture of dried mango peel (DMP) as a possible bulk commodity: fruit blanching, peel drying, and DMP packaging. Depending on cultivars, hot-water blanching of fruit (65–85 °C) before peeling proved inappropriate for peel color retention, but could even induce enzymatic browning until peel drying, and thus losses of bioactive compounds due to oxidative polymerization and insolubilization. Hence, this process step should be limited to brief washing of the fruit at maximally 65 °C to reduce microbial load. Intermittent microwave-convective drying (IMWC) of MPW0 in a continuous belt dryer at high peel throughput was feasible at ambient air temperatures. Finalizing initial IMWC of MPW0 by convective drying (CD, 80 °C) in the falling-rate period avoided local charring. Alternatively, MPW0 had to be washed before IMWC to remove adherent pulp, but at the expense of soluble solids and β-carotene losses. Unlike the carotenoids, alk(en)ylresorcinols were hardly affected by IMWC. By washing MPW0, quality defects compared to CD-dried peel in terms of antioxidant capacity, water-holding capacity, and yield and quality of pectin were compensated. Adequate preprocessing plus IMWC was thus deemed to be a promising option, especially for biorefinery concepts including biogas production and congeneration. The minimal moisture barrier properties needed for flexible intermediate bulk containers were estimated from an 11-month shelf-life test of IMWC-dried peel in two climate zones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidant activity; Bioactive fiber; Fruit processing waste; Mangifera indica L.; Pectin; Value addition","Agents; Antioxidants; Blanching; Fruits; Heat convection; Microwave heating; Pilot plants; Plants (botany); Washing; Anti-oxidant activities; Bioactive fibers; Fruit processing; Mangifera indica L; Pectin; Value addition; Drying; antioxidant; bioactivity; cultivar; enzyme activity; feasibility study; food processing; fruit; industrial waste; microwave radiation; oxidation; polymerization; ripening; seasonality; solid waste; Mangifera indica",2-s2.0-85030706917

Application of purified immobilized endoxylanases for CS hydrolysis is a pioneering effort in bioethanol production. Both immobilized endoxylanase were successfully reused up to 4 hydrolysis cycles with a fresh supplement of Cellic® C-Tec2 each time.

The BiOCl-(0 1 0) and BiOCl-(0 0 1) single-crystalline sheets are separately synthesized via hydrothermal and hydrolysis routes. In contrast to BiOCl-(0 1 0), BiOCl-(0 0 1) demonstrates highly promoted photo-redox performance for H2 generation and degradation of pollutants. The facet-dependent charge movement behaviors were surveyed by surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPV), transient photocurrent, linear sweep voltammetry, continuous wavelength photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS). All the photoelectrochemical and photoelectric measurement results reflect that BiOCl-(0 0 1) exhibits superior charge separation and migration efficiencies in the whole charge movement process than the BiOCl-(0 1 0). Besides, a higher charge carrier density (3.1-fold enhancement) was also observed for BiOCl-(0 0 1) compared to BiOCl-(0 1 0).

While previous studies have employed land use regression methods to develop a greater understanding of the sources and dynamics of microbial NPS pollution, little work has explicitly considered the effects of local, state, and federal stormwater management policies on water quality across multiple watersheds or at larger spatial scales. How do land use and stormwater management efforts collectively influence fecal coliform (FC) levels at a regional or multiple-watershed scale? We construct a unique spatial regression model of stream FC pollution (n = 327 monitoring stations) throughout the state of North Carolina (USA), incorporating both land cover and urban development variables. We then use a subset of our data (nbmp = 80 monitoring stations) to incorporate local stormwater control measures and stormwater management policies. Results demonstrate that the inclusion of policy and management variables improves the explanatory capacity for FC levels (R2 = 0.4412 versus R2 = 0.5323). Locally, this model can be used to better target stream restoration and water quality mitigation actions and investments, as well as help to predict FC levels at unmonitored locations throughout North Carolina's stream network. More generally, the novel structure of this model can also help examine the large-scale effects of stormwater regulations on surface water pathogen levels, helping researchers and planners better predict water quality in the absence of extensive monitoring station data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial contamination; Best management practices; Fecal coliform pollution; Green stormwater infrastructure; Spatial analysis; Urban stormwater management","Economics; Engineering geology; Investments; Land use; Pollution; Regression analysis; River pollution; Rivers; Storm sewers; Storms; Surface waters; Urban growth; Water quality; Bacterial contamination; Best management practices; Fecal Coliform; Spatial analysis; Stormwaters; Urban stormwater management; Water pollution; storm water; surface water; best management practice; coliform bacterium; land use; spatial analysis; stormwater; streamwater; waste management; water pollution; Article; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; fecal coliform; lagoon; land use; North Carolina; priority journal; stream (river); urban area; waste water management; water analysis; water contamination; water pollution; water quality; watershed; North Carolina; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms)",2-s2.0-85016167894

In this study, the significant parameters (i.e., initial pH, premagnetization time and intensity of magnetic field) were optimized firstly. Under the optimal conditions, the premagnetization Fe0/(Fe/Cu) system could obtain a high rate (kobs = 0.732 min−1) and better selectivity ([TN removal]/[NO3 −-N removal] ratio = 54.3%) for nitrate reduction, which were much superior to the 7 control experiments (i.e., Fe0/(Fe/Cu) system, premagnetization Fe0 particles and Cu0 particles micro-electrolysis (premagnetization Fe0/Cu0) system, Fe0/Cu0 system, premagnetization Fe0 system, Fe0 system, premagnetization Fe/Cu system and Fe/Cu system). Meanwhile, it was confirmed that the prepared Fe0/(Fe/Cu) could keep the high reactivity even after vacuum drying and longtime storage. Furthermore, the operational life of premagnetization Fe0/(Fe/Cu) system is better than that of Fe0/(Fe/Cu) system (for more than 12.6 L wastewater treatment). The used Fe0/(Fe/Cu) could recover high reactivity after acid washing as well. Moreover, the characteristics of the medium materials before and after employment were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Besides, the reasonable mechanism of premagnetization improving the rate and selectivity for nitrate reduction of Fe0/(Fe/Cu) system was also proposed. The possible reasons why premagnetization process could strengthen both rate and selectivity for nitrate reduction and why premagnetization could strengthen the Fe0/(Fe/Cu) system better were also given. Finally, it was proved that the new developed system not only could effectively treat different pollutants but also is suitable for different quality wastewater treatment.

Although promising, pinecone has received inadequate attention as a biofuel feedstock for thermochemical conversion. Water above its critical temperature (TC ≥ 374 °C) and critical pressure (PC ≥ 22.1 MPa), termed as supercritical water, has high kinetic energy and densities similar to that of gases and liquids, respectively. When employed in gasification, supercritical water has an ability to completely dissolve organics and gases. Therefore, this study identifies the candidacy of pinecone as a precursor for conversion to hydrogen through hydrothermal gasification. Pinecone was gasified in subcritical water (300 and 350 °C; 21 MPa), near-critical water (370 °C; 22 MPa) and supercritical water (450 and 550 °C; 23 MPa) to investigate the impacts of temperature (300–550 °C), feed concentration (10–25 wt%) and residence time (15–60 min). The impacts of alkali catalysts (e.g., Na2CO3, NaOH and KOH) at a loading of 30 wt% were examined to maximize hydrogen yields. The hydrochar generated from gasification in subcritical water, near-critical water and supercritical water were physico-chemically characterized through proximate and ultimate analysis (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur-oxygen), thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the non-catalytic gasification of pinecone, highest hydrogen (1.42 mmol/g) and total gas yields (6.6 mmol/g) with lower heating value (488 kJ/Nm3) of the gas products were obtained in supercritical water at 550 °C with 10 wt% feed concentration for 60 min. Moreover, at 30 wt% catalyst loading, highest hydrogen yield was obtained from KOH (3.26 mmol/g) followed by NaOH (2.71 mmol/g) and Na2CO3 (1.96 mmol/g). Hydrochars generated in supercritical water at 550 °C had a greater content of aromatic carbon and were thermally stable. The findings reveal, for the first time, the potential of pinecone for hydrogen production through subcritical, near-critical and supercritical water gasification, as well as the prospective of its hydrochar for environmental and material applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Gasification; Hydrochar; Hydrogen; Pinecone; Subcritical water; Supercritical water","Calorific value; Catalysts; Gasification; Hydrogen; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Potash; Scanning electron microscopy; Sodium compounds; Spectrum analysis; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Fourier transform infra reds; Hydrochar; Hydrothermal gasification; Pinecone; Sub-critical water; Supercritical water; Supercritical water gasification; Thermochemical Conversion; Hydrogen production",2-s2.0-85031752160

Samples were taken in the foot, middle, and top of the slope, at two depths, and in two environments (under canopy and bare soil). Sediments were collected from sediment fences after erosive rainfall events. Most of the screened compounds were found in both, burned and control hillslopes, though significant differences were found between both. In burned soil, low concentrations of PBDEs (maximum ΣPBDEs: 7.3 ng g− 1), PFRs (664.4 ng g− 1) and PFASs (56.4 ng g− 1) were detected in relation to PAHs (Σ16 PAHs = 1255.3 ng g− 1). No significant influence of the hillslope position was observed for any of the contaminants but differences based on depth and vegetation presence tended to be significant, particularly for the PAHs.

We take advantage of the underlying free fermion description of the XX model to accurately test the strengths and limitations of this algorithm for large system sizes. We discuss the theoretical constraints on the performance of the algorithm from the entanglement properties of the eigenstates, and its actual performance at different values of disorder. A small but significant improvement to the algorithm is also presented, which helps significantly with convergence. We find that, at high entanglement, DMRG-X shows a bias towards eigenstates with low entanglement, but can be improved with increased bond dimension.

In this work, high-angle wire feeding method is proposed to obtain uniform deposit in gas tungsten arc welding-based additive manufacturing. The results illustrate that low wire feeding angle (30°–50°) causes the deposition to break at the back feeding, meanwhile too high wire feeding angle (70°) leads to many littered droplets on one side of the deposition at the condition of side feeding. A uniform deposition can be obtained at the optimal wire feeding angle of 60° in any wire feeding direction, and the reasons have been discussed based on the temperature distribution characteristics of the arc and molten pool.

Voltammograms exhibit a single cathodic current peak related to the electroreduction of tin ions on the glassy carbon substrate. The current of this peak increases linearly with the square root of the scan rate in the absence of thiourea, as expected for an electrochemical reaction under diffusion control. However, with the addition of thiourea, the peak current exhibits a semi-logarithmic dependence. Electrodeposition current transients show always a single peak that increases its height and appears at shorter times as the electrode potential is made more negative. The non-dimensional analysis of the current transients suggests the occurrence of an instantaneous nucleation and 3D growth under diffusion control in thiourea-free solutions. When thiourea is added, the transient current peak shifts to longer times and the non-dimensional analysis agrees with the presence of a progressive nucleation process. Seemingly, thiourea adsorbs on the electrode surface blocking active sites. This is consistent with the changes observed in the morphology of tin deposits, which change from well-distributed small crystallographic particles in the absence of thiourea, to complex and larger ones that exhibit branches at 900, in the presence of thiourea. Nyquist plots exhibit only two time constants at open circuit conditions, while in the potential range of tin electrodeposition two capacitive contributions appear at high an medium frequencies, followed by an inductance, assigned to a surface relaxation process, and a Warburg contribution, associated with the transport of ions to the interface, at low frequencies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","electrodeposition; Glassy carbon; growth mechanism; nucleation; thiourea; Tin","Electrodeposition; Electrolytic reduction; Glass; Glass membrane electrodes; Glassy carbon; Nucleation; Power quality; Thioureas; Tin; Tin deposits; Transients; Electrochemical reactions; Electrodeposition currents; Glassy carbon electrodes; Growth mechanisms; Instantaneous nucleations; Logarithmic dependence; Nondimensional analysis; Open circuit conditions; Electrodes",2-s2.0-85031812917

The N, P self-doped biocarbon (NPBC) was obtained simply by pyrolyzing spirulina at 950 °C. This single-step process eliminates additional chemicals including nitrogen source, phosphorus source, and pore-forming agents, thus allowing NPBC to become a true sense of potentially low-cost and sustainable oxygen electrocatalysts.

Due to large volume changes of the graphite particles during electrochemical anion intercalation, an appropriate electrode binder is required to sustain the mechanical integrity of the composite electrode and a stable and highly reversible charge/discharge cycling. Therefore, the expansion and contraction behavior of graphite positive electrodes containing different binders, including Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), poly(vinylidene)difluoride (PVdF) and a CMC/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) mixture, during anion intercalation/de-intercalation was investigated by in situ electrochemical dilatometry (ECD). These measurements give insights into reversible and irreversible relative height changes at different cycling conditions and, thus, into the long-term cycling stability of the composite electrodes. Long-term cycling measurements reveal that the maximum and minimum electrode thicknesses of PVdF-based electrodes remain constant during anion intercalation/de-intercalation, while the CMC-containing electrodes exhibit a thickness increase in the first cycles and subsequent decrease after reaching a maximum electrode thickness. This instability can most likely be correlated with the mechanical instability of the electrode due to the high stiffness of the CMC binder compared to PVdF and an active material contact loss during cycling. If CMC is applied as binder mixture in combination with SBR, which shows a high flexibility, the thickness decay can be decreased.

It is demonstrated that a great enhancement on the capacitive properties can be achieved by introducing a small amount of IPA which would be of benefit to promote the formation of PANI nanofibers with larger ratio of height to diameter. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Capacitive properties; Co–solvent effect; Interfacial polymerization; Isopropanol; Polyaniline nanofibers","Chains; Field emission microscopes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Molecules; Polyaniline; Polymerization; Scanning electron microscopy; Solvents; Capacitive properties; Interfacial polymerization; Iso-propanols; Polyaniline nanofibers; Solvent effects; Nanofibers",2-s2.0-85031501629

Temperature dependence of magnetization exhibits a paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition at Curie temperature TC = 265 K. Close to this transition, the magnetic entropy change reaches a maximum of about 2.19 J/kgK and the relative cooling power (RCP) value is of 241 J/kg, when a magnetic field of 5 T is applied. Additionally, Banerjee's criteria, Landau theory and the universal behavior of phase transitions were also studied to assess magnetic phase ordering in this material, such investigations indicate that the phase transition from the PM to FM states is of second order.

Substituting these noble metals by more abundant transition metals is vital for commercial application of these technologies. In this regard, we have developed a facile method for synthesis of Ni3Fe alloy with bicontinuous structure. The highly porous foam-like structure of the composite electrode offers numerous transportation channels for transfer of electrolyte and dissipation of the gaseous products. Moreover, the formation of a carbon layer during the synthesis of the composite improves the stability of the catalyst by preventing the agglomeration and dissolution of nanoparticles. Consequently, Ni3Fe nanoparticles with bicontinuous structure displayed enhanced catalytic activity for OER and required low overpotential only 248 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Excellent activity and long-term durability of theses Ni3Fe nanoparticles make them an ideal substitute for the noble metal catalyst.

It is demonstrated that the complex stress and temperature dependence of minimum creep rate of this steel grade can be rationalised in a simple manner on the basis of the new power law creep equation that incorporates the tensile strength σTS. The activation energy of creep determined on this basis does not depend on stress and the stress exponent depends only on the stress ratio σ/σTS region but not on temperature. This allows the new power law equation to be used in combination with Monkman-Grant relationship to predict long-term (60 years) creep strengths and lifetimes at different application temperatures using creep parameters determined from creep tests lasting less than 6000 h. The reliability of these predictions is discussed and the causes for possible over-predictions are considered. It is also shown that the previously observed stress dependence of activation energy of creep is simply the consequence of the conventional method by which this parameter is determined and hence has no physical significance. The change in stress exponent in respective stress ratio σ/σTS regions is not due to the change in creep mechanism but may be attributed to microstructure changes under creep load in respective σ/σTS ranges. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Creep; Creep life prediction; Creep rupture; Mechanical properties; Steel",,2-s2.0-85027896259

SPS technology provides a compact material but with high porosity, consequently creating a high internal surface area within the volume of sample. The combination of the MA and SPS techniques produces a promising material in terms of fast hydriding kinetics and a high content of absorbed hydrogen. All samples were electrochemically hydrided in a 6 mol/L KOH solution at 80 °C for 480 min.

This is detrimental for natural fibre based fabrics, like cotton, due to the significant hydrolysis-induced losses in mechanical resistance. Herein, we propose a simple alkaline pre-treatment (mercerization) of cotton fabrics to minimize PEDOT:PSS hydrolysis-induced mechanical fabric degradation. Following this, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were dispersed in PEDOT:PSS solutions to produce conductive, breathable and light-weight mercerized cotton fabrics by spray coating. Due to mercerization, conducting fabrics treated with the PEDOT:PSS dispersions containing 20 wt% GNPs exhibited improved Young's modulus and maximum elongation values compared to unmercerized fabrics.

In result, all the solution-processed ITO films achieved high transparency of more than 96% in the visible range (500–730 nm) with respect to the glass substrate. As well, sheet resistance (Rs) decreased with increasing temperature and the lowest Rs (309.4 Ω/□) was achieved by annealing at 600 °C under Ar atmosphere. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that the highest concentration of oxygen vacancies occurred under Ar atmosphere resulting in the highest carrier mobility and lowest Rs.

The results show that K2FeO4-impregnation can improve pore structure of WS char and produce new active sites, which significantly enhance Hg0 removal. Increasing Hg0 inlet concentration significantly decreases Hg0 removal efficiency. O2 in flue gas promotes Hg0 oxidation by replenishing the oxygen groups on the surface of modified chars. The presence of NO obviously promotes Hg0 removal since it can oxidize Hg0 to Hg(NO3)2.

Appropriate rare earth could effectively spheroidise and refine ceramic particles, and made the distribution uniform. Excessive rare earth could cause the burning loss of ceramic particles, inhibit the formation of second precipitated phases, and the reunion of particles occurred again.

An impact risk valuation model is then developed, based on the certainty equivalent of an exponential dis-utility function. We show that the evaluation of the impact risk value can be achieved using a closed-form expression and demonstrate an application in a food waste recycling alternatives comparison. We further extend the methodology to construct an impact safety index model that evaluates uncertain impacts using an impact tolerance level.

The study also revealed that the role of diffusion to the total anodic current was insignificant and chloride ions were transported at the electrode surface only by conduction. The hypochlorite production in case of platinum was about 3.66 times than that of graphite and GC with the current efficiency of 75% in contrast to 46% found in graphite and GC.

Here we present a new method to transduce and digitize temperature at very low power levels. Specifically, two pA current references are generated via small tunneling-current metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) that are independent and proportional to temperature, respectively, which are then used to charge digitally-controllable banks of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors that, via a discrete-time feedback loop that equalizes charging time, digitize temperature directly.

The high efficiency is because plasmonic contact electrodes concentrate a large portion of the incident optical pump beam in close proximity to the contact electrodes. By reducing the average transport path length of the photo-generated carriers from the contact electrodes, a larger number of the photocarriers drift to the terahertz radiating elements of the photoconductive source within a sub-picosecond time scale. Therefore, higher terahertz radiation power levels are achieved compared to a similar photoconductive source without plasmonic contact electrodes. Au is a preferred metal for plasmonic contact electrodes because of the strong plasmonic enhancement factors it offers at near-infrared optical wavelengths. However, it requires an adhesion layer to stick well to most III–V semiconductor substrates used in photoconductive terahertz sources. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the Au adhesion layer on the performance of plasmonic photoconductive sources fabricated on a GaAs substrate. Our analysis suggests that Cr is the most promising adhesion layer for plasmonic contact electrodes. We show that the use of a Cr adhesion layer instead of Ti, which is used in previously demonstrated plasmonic photoconductive sources, offers up to an 80% enhancement in the generated terahertz powers.

This means that the choice of nanoparticles to obtain improved anodes performance and properties is not trivial and a trade-off between relevant properties plays a key role. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anode; Cell test; Characterization; Nanoparticle; Performance","Biomechanics; Carbonation; Cerium compounds; Characterization; Economic and social effects; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrodes; Fuel cells; Gas fuel purification; Metal nanoparticles; Metallic compounds; Metals; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC); Molten materials; Nanoparticles; Reinforcement; Titanium dioxide; Titanium oxides; Zirconia; Alloying metals; Cell test; Electrode material; Metal oxide nanoparticles; Operating environment; Oxide nanoparticles; Performance; Reinforced particles; Anodes",2-s2.0-85032280403

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) are two reactions that play key roles in electrochemical energy storage and conversion with the sustainable H2 as a medium. To date, the most efficient catalysts for production and conversion of hydrogen are based on noble metals. Therefore, the development of non-noble metal catalysts with high efficiency and low cost is of significant importance for the practical application of H2 in different electrochemical energy technologies. In this review, we recapitulate the recent progress of developing non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for HER and HOR and provide insights into the origins of catalytic performance enhancement. Fundamental understanding of the synthesis-structure-activity correlations, focusing on the HER/HOR mechanisms in acidic/alkaline media on studied non-noble metal catalysts are also discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electrocatalysis; Hydrogen evolution; Hydrogen oxidation; Nanomaterials; Non-precious metal","Catalysis; Catalysts; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Energy conversion; Energy resources; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen storage; Metals; Nanostructured materials; Electrochemical energy storage; Electrochemical energy technologies; Hydrogen evolution; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Hydrogen oxidation; Hydrogen oxidation reaction; Non-precious metals; Structure activity correlations; Precious metals",2-s2.0-85032199623

MgO modification of the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst enhanced the formation of NiAl2O4. There was only one reduction peak from 700 to 950 °C, which is usually ascribed to the reduction of NiAl2O4. The Ni-containing species which are easily reduced at low temperature were removed. When the MgO modified Ni/Al2O3 was reduced at 750 °C in the performance evaluation, a small amount of Ni was produced from NiAl2O4 to give small and active Ni sites, resulting in better catalytic reforming performance than for the unmodified Ni/Al2O3. The H2 yield of 88% and CO selectivity of 86% was obtained at 800 °C when MgO modified Ni/Al2O3 was adopted as a reforming catalyst, which was combined with 0.5 wt% Pt/Al2O3 to form a dual bed catalysts. The other metal (Ca, Sr, Ba) oxide modification of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, however, did not enhance the formation of NiAl2O4 as well as MgO, and there were still certain amounts of low temperature reducible NiO species, resulting in a worse catalytic performance than the unmodified Ni/Al2O3. The variation of the amount of MgO modification had no obvious effect on the formation of NiAl2O4. However, the peak reduction temperature of 7.5 wt% MgO modified Ni/Al2O3 in H2-TPR patterns was a little lower than that of 5.0 or 10.0 wt% MgO modified Ni/Al2O3, resulting in a little better catalytic performance by giving more active Ni sites reduced from NiAl2O4 at 750 °C. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Alkaline earth metal; DME; Hydrogen production; Modification; Partial oxidation and reforming","Alkaline earth metals; Catalyst selectivity; Catalysts; Ethers; Fuels; Hydrogen production; Magnesia; Metals; Nickel; Oxidation; Temperature; Alkaline earth metal oxides; Catalytic performance; Dimethyl ethers; Low temperatures; Modification; Ni/Al2O3 catalyst; Partial oxidations; Reforming Catalyst; Catalytic reforming",2-s2.0-85030331704

The obtained equilibrium lattice parameters and elastic properties at zero pressure for MgH2 and Mg7TMH16 hydrides, are in good agreement with other experimental and theoretical values. The calculations of the bulk modulus and the ductility factors (B/G) show that mixing (MgH2) with small amount of transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Y, Zr and Nb) can enhance the resistance to volume change and transform it from a brittle to a ductile material (brittle → ductile). The elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, anisotropy factor and hardness have been studied under pressure. These mechanical quantities are found to increase with increasing pressure. While the B/G and Poisson's ratios (v) undergo an inverse behaviour. In addition to that, the studied hydrides are found stable with a ductile behaviour under a pressure between 0 and 20 GPa. Furthermore, the effect of pressure on Debye temperature and sound velocity, was also investigated and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ab initio calculations; Elastic properties; High pressure; Magnesium-transition metal hydrides","Calculations; Debye temperature; Density functional theory; Ductility; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Hydrides; Niobium; Scandium; Stability; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Zirconium; Ab initio calculations; Elastic properties; First-principles calculation; First-principles investigations; Generalized gradient approximations; High pressure; Structural stabilities; Transition metal hydrides; Pressure effects",2-s2.0-85026901144

The photoelectrical performance of HTS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS coupled to CuS or to Cu2ZnSn(S1 − xSex)4 with x = 0, 0.5, or 1.0 counter electrodes (CEs) were compared to those coupled to Pt CE. The HTS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS coupled to the CuS CE showed the highest power conversion efficiency η (of 3.46%). The efficiencies η of 1.88, 2.64, and 2.06% were obtained for CZTS (x = 0), CZTS0.5Se0.5 (x = 0.5), and CZTSe (x = 1), respectively. These are significantly higher than those using a standard Pt CE (η = 0.37%).

The influence of sintering process parameters on microstructure, density, porosity, wear rate and microhardness of the fabricated samples has been analyzed. The input variable process parameters, such as, laser power density (range: 4.13–5.57 W/cm2 (× 104)), scanning speed (range: 3500–4500 mm/min) and the constant parameters, such as, laser beam diameter (0.4 mm), hatching distance (0.2 mm) and layer thickness (0.4 mm) have been considered in the process. It has been observed from Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) analysis that TiN and SS316 powder mixture can be sintered in which chromium acts as a binder. Fine gaps are not found at the interface between TiN and SS316 when the mixture is sintered in nitrogen atmosphere. With an increase in the percentage of TiN, the density and wear rate decreases. However, when the reinforcement is taken beyond 18% by weight, the wear rate starts increasing. The microhardness also increases with an increase in the percentage of TiN. The microstructure, elemental compositions and phase characterization of the developed sintered MMCs have been examined by FESEM, EDX (Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and XRD (X-ray diffractometer) analysis, respectively. The results have demonstrated the suitability of the TiN reinforced SS316 MMCs for industrial applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","DMLS; Interface zone; Laser power density; Microstructure; MMCs; Sintering; TiN","3D printers; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Field emission microscopes; Laser heating; Microhardness; Microstructure; Mixtures; Nitrogen; Particle reinforced composites; Reinforcement; Scanning electron microscopy; Sintering; Tin; Titanium compounds; Titanium nitride; X ray spectroscopy; Direct metal laser sintering; DMLS; Elemental compositions; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Laser power density; MMCs; Phase characterization; Metallic matrix composites",2-s2.0-85021072591
