We develop a data science toolbox for manufacturing prediction tasks to bridge the gap between machine learning research and concrete practical needs. We provide guidelines and best practices for modeling, feature engineering and interpretation. To this end, we leverage tools from business information systems as well as machine learning. We illustrate the usage of this toolbox by means of a real-world manufacturing defect prediction case study. Thereby, we seek to enhance the understanding of predictive modeling. In particular, we want to emphasize that simply dumping data into “smart” algorithms is not the silver bullet.

Such enterprises, through their operational models and possessed resources, are capable of effective operation in a rapidly-changing environment and have the capacity for taking advantage of potential opportunities. A resource which is of particular significance to an enterprise that strives after achieving agility is human capital. The probability of capturing and making use of an opportunity grows along with the dynamic growth of human capital maintained by an organization. Proper staff ensures a high and constantly updated level of knowledge in an organization, enables a quick reconfiguration of resources and adeptly supports relations creating virtual partner networks. The aim of the publication is to present mechanisms that shape business agility through the use and creation of human capital potential in the context of reacting to opportunities that appear in the business environment. It is expressed through the development of agility dimensions such as: brightness, flexibility, intelligence and shrewdness. Thanks to the increased level of agility, an enterprise attains the desired level of: knowledge, core competences, virtuality and capacity for resource reconfiguration. The mechanism which is featured in the article was developed on the basis of an analysis of source literature and on the basis of empirical research related to the identification of human capital characteristics in an enterprise, which are conducive for the development of agility. Considerations made in the article contribute to structuring and describing the influence exerted by human capital on the development of business agility and to specifying, in an utilitarian way, the characteristics of human capital which have an impact on increasing the level of business agility. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Agile enterprise; Human capital; Knowledge-Based enterprise; Opportunities","Competitive intelligence; Ergonomics; Manufacture; Agile enterprise; Business environments; Changing environment; Human capitals; Knowledge based enterprise; Opportunities; Quick reconfiguration; Resource reconfigurations; Knowledge based systems",2-s2.0-85029003389

Privatization and liberalization of previously nationally owned systems are examples of the transformations that have been applied. Microgrids and smart grids emerge and new business models able to cope with new opportunities start being developed. New types of players appear, allowing aggregating a diversity of entities, e.g. generation, storage, electric vehicles, and consumers, Virtual Power Players (VPPs) are a new type of player that allows aggregating a diversity of players to facilitate their participation in the electricity markets. A major task of VPPs is the remuneration of generation and services (maintenance, market operation costs and energy reserves), as well as charging energy consumption. The paper proposes a normalization method that supports a clustering methodology for the remuneration and tariffs definition. This model uses a clustering algorithm, applied on normalized load values, the value of the micro production, generated in the bus associated to the same load, was subtracted from the value of the consumption of that load. This calculation is performed in a real smart grid on buses with associated micro production. This allows the creation of sub-groups of data according to their correlations.

Hence, constructing an effective pre-warning model for performance forecasting is an urgent requirement. Most previous studies only analyzed monetary-based ratios, but merely considering such ratios does not depict the full perspective of a corporation's business conditions. This study thus extends monetary-based ratios to non-monetary-based ratios and aggregates them through the analytic network process (ANP) with a risk-adjusted strategy to establish performance ranks of corporations. Analyzing a corporation's business relationships can help it to react to changes in the market and improve profit margins, as it draws upon such relationship networks for the transfer of scarce resources and knowledge. We believe that no current study adopts such a method to construct a forecasting model. To fill this gap in the literature, this study implements the social network (SN) technique to examine a corporation's competitive edge from seemingly noisy big media data, which are subsequently fed into an artificial intelligence (AI)-based technique to construct the model. The introduced model, examined through real-life cases under numerous conditions, offers a promising alternative for performance forecasting. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Decision making; News mining; Performance measure; Risk management; Social network","Forecasting; Profitability; Risk assessment; Risk management; Social networking (online); Analytic network process; Business conditions; Business relationships; Corporate performance; Forecasting modeling; Performance forecasting; Performance measure; Relationship networks; Decision making",2-s2.0-85030978851

We propose a multi-layered decision support framework that combines empirical data with simulation, optimization, and econometric methods to address this problem. Our framework allows sellers to: (i) compare revenue performances of limited information sequencing strategies, (ii) quantify benchmark revenue levels that can be achieved via the optimal sequence based on detailed buyer information, (iii) determine the costs of limited information and strategic buyers to the seller, and (iv) identify the moderators of sequencing strategy performance. We illustrate our framework through two applications in a business-to-business used-car auction setting. Contrary to previous studies reporting practitioners’ tendency to sequence items from the lowest value to the highest, our results suggest that the best-performing limited information sequencing strategy depends on buyers’ bidding behavior. We also find that the revenue difference between the optimal sequence and a limited information sequencing strategy can be substantial. Our results show that a significant portion of this revenue difference is associated with the seller's limited information on buyers’ budgets and product valuations. Our applications also provide various sensitivity analyses and develop new propositions on the moderators of the relationship between the seller's revenue and sequencing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support systems; Multi-item sequential auctions; Optimization; Simulation","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Budget control; Decision support systems; Moderators; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Bidding behavior; Business to business; Decision support framework; Limited information; Optimal sequence; Sequential auctions; Simulation; Strategic buyers; Sales",2-s2.0-85021698083

Yet fewer than half of UK companies are fully aware of GDPR—and a number of those who were preparing for it stopped doing so when the Brexit vote was announced. A last-minute rush to become compliant is therefore expected, and numerous companies are starting to offer advice, checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR. In such an environment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to assist by providing best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring activities; and carrying out assessments. The paper considers four areas of GDPR compliance where rule based technologies and/or machine learning techniques may be relevant: Following compliance checklists and codes of conduct; Supporting risk assessments; Complying with the new regulations regarding technologies that perform automatic profiling; Complying with the new regulations concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security. It concludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas.

Therefore, determining the optimal groundwater abstraction using classical approaches such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) requires a large number of groundwater simulations and exorbitant computational efforts. The problem becomes even more complex and time consuming for regional coastal aquifers whose domains must be discretized using high-resolution meshes. In fact, even fast evolutionary multi-objective optimization techniques generally require a large number of simulations to determine the Pareto-front among the objectives. This study explores the performance of a Decision Tree (DT) approach for the generation of the Pareto optimal solutions of groundwater extraction. This paper applies the DTs for the optimal management of the Al-Khoud coastal aquifer in Oman. The learning process of the developed DT-based model uses the output of a numerical simulation model to assess the aquifer response based on different abstraction policies. The trained DT network then utilizes the NSGA-II to determine the Pareto-optimal solutions. The simulation show that the general flux pattern in the study area is toward the sea and the hydraulic head following a similar pattern in both best and worst recharging scenarios downstream of the studied recharging dam. Statistical tests showed a good correlation between the DT-based and simulation-based results and demonstrate the capability of the DT approach to obtain high-quality solutions by incorporating a large number of recharge scenarios. Moreover, the required runtime of the DT-based approach is extremely low (5 min) compared to that of the simulation-based method (several days). This means that including additional Monte-Carlo simulations can be readily done in few minutes using the obtained DTs, instead of the long computational time needed by the simulation-based approach. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aquifer management; Groundwater simulation; M5P model tree; Multi-objective optimization; Seawater intrusion; Uncertainty","Aquifers; Decision trees; Groundwater; Groundwater geochemistry; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Intelligent systems; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Pareto principle; Recharging (underground waters); Salt water intrusion; Stochastic systems; Aquifer management; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Groundwater simulations; Model trees; Pareto optimal solutions; Simulation based approaches; Simulation-based method; Uncertainty; Monte Carlo methods; artificial intelligence; coastal aquifer; computer simulation; groundwater abstraction; Monte Carlo analysis; optimization; recharge; saline intrusion; uncertainty analysis; water management",2-s2.0-85027362233

Methods: We conducted five typical executive function tests (Stroop test, verbal fluency [VF] test, Hayling Sentence Completion Test [HSCT], N-back test, and Sustained Attention to Response Task [SART]) on 42 acromegalic patients and 42 strictly matched healthy controls. Comparative analyses were conducted for five major executive function domains. The Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) was used to assess patients’ subjective feelings about their executive function. All patients underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination and a blood test to determine their pituitary hormone levels before the tests were performed. Results: The patients exhibited worse results on the Stroop test, VF test, HSCT and N-back test compared to the healthy control group. Moreover, part B of the HSCT and the N-back test performance were negatively correlated with IGF-1 concentrations, and the duration of the disease was significantly associated with the Stroop color task results. Conclusions: Acromegalic patients were severely impaired in semantic inhibition, executive processing, working memory and executive inhibition, and they have realized a portion of these deficits.

This study contributes to the literature by analyzing a trading strategy which benefits from this leverage by using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and cost-of-carry relationship. We apply the technical trading rules developed from spot market prices, on futures market prices using a CAPM based hedge ratio. Historical daily prices of twenty stocks from each of the ten markets (five developed markets and five emerging markets) are used for the analysis. Popular technical indicators, along with artificial intelligence techniques like Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, are used to generate buy and sell signals for each stock and for portfolios of stocks. The performance of the trading strategies is then calculated and compared. The results show that, although equal amounts invested in both spot and futures markets, the profit from the strategies applied on futures is considerably higher than that from the spot market in both developed and emerging markets. Moreover, the overall performance of the artificial intelligence strategies is far better than the traditional ones. © 2016, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.","Artificial intelligence; CAPM; Emerging markets; Futures; Genetic programming; Neural networks; Technical indicators",,2-s2.0-85027974016

For this purpose, data of daily mean streamflow of the Behesht-Abad (perennial) and Joneghan (non-perennial) rivers as well as precipitation information of 17 meteorological stations for the period 1999–2008 were used. Coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used for evaluating the applicability of developed models. This study showed that although the GEP model was the most accurate in predicting peak flows, but in overall among the four mentioned models in both perennial and non-perennial rivers, WANN had the best performance. Among input patterns, flow based and coupled precipitation-flow based patterns with negligible difference to each other were determined to be the best patterns.

WQIs allow users to query domain-specific databases for obtaining information of interest from diverse domains such as car rentals, hotels, airfare, etc. As the number of WQIs on the web is increasing drastically, some research efforts are focused on building a single (unified) WQI that allows users to query and integrate information available in different web databases related to a specific domain. A very important task in this WQIs’ integration process is the extraction, modeling and understanding of WQIs’ semantic content. However, this task is challenging because of the great heterogeneity in the design of WQIs. This paper presents a novel tree-based approach for the modeling and understanding of WQIs. A tree schema called the Visual Reduced Tree (VR-Tree) is built from the tree produced by a web browser’s render engine, applying a set of well- defined functions and guided by a set of heuristic rules to identify the WQI’s main components and their relationships. The proposed strategy was evaluated by running a collection of experiments over the Tel-8 and ICQ datasets from the UIUC repository. The results show that the automatic modeling of WQIs is possible with a high degree of precision if compared against previous approaches, simplifying the modeling task by only considering visual and spatial properties of WQI components using the VR-Tree schema proposed in this work. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Heuristic rules; Modeling; Render tree; Schema tree; Web Query Interfaces","Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Models; Automatic modeling; Degree of precision; Heuristic rules; Integration process; Query interfaces; Render tree; Schema tree; Tree-based approach; Semantics",2-s2.0-85014021554

Specifically, we draw on the conservation of resources model to suggest that international students who have been a member of more minority groups in their home country have unique experiences working with dissimilar others that offer advantages when acculturating to new cultures and novel situations. Then, change in host country acculturation is explored as a mechanism to explain how minority status in the home country relates to intentions to leave the host country and psychological well-being 6 months after entry. Two moderators (cultural intelligence, perceived diversity climate of the host institution) of these relationships are also examined. Results revealed that the relationship between minority status in the home country and change in host country acculturation was positive and stronger for those with higher cultural intelligence.

The design of energy efficient WSN is still a greater research challenge. Clustering techniques have been widely used to reduce the energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime. This paper introduces an algorithm named Fuzzy logic based Unequal clustering, and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based Routing, Hybrid protocol for WSN to eliminate hot spot problem and extend the network lifetime. This protocol comprises of Cluster Head (CH) selection, inter-cluster routing and cluster maintenance. Fuzzy logic selects CHs efficiently and divides the network into unequal clusters based on residual energy, distance to Base Station (BS), distance to its neighbors, node degree and node centrality. It uses ACO based routing technique for efficient and reliable inter-cluster routing from CHs to BS. Moreover, this protocol transmits data in a hybrid manner, i.e. both proactive and reactive manner. A threshold concept is employed to transmit/intimate sudden changes in the environment in addition to periodic data transmission. For proper load balancing, a new routing strategy is also employed where threshold based data transmission takes place in shortest path and the periodic data transmission takes place in unused paths. Cross-layer cluster maintenance phase is also used for uniform load distribution.

In this regard, VDW offers several advantages such as real-time analytic reports, reduced maintenance, low cost solution and flexible data integration, but performance is still one of its critical shortcomings.

It has many applications, such as sequential analysis, classification, and prediction. How to generate candidates and how to control the combinatorically explosive number of intermediate subsequences are the most difficult problems. Intelligent systems such as recommender systems, expert systems, and business intelligence systems use only a few patterns, namely those that satisfy a number of defined conditions. Challenges include the mining of top-k patterns, top-rank-k patterns, closed patterns, and maximal patterns. In many cases, end users need to find itemsets that occur with a sequential pattern. Therefore, this paper proposes approaches for mining top-k co-occurrence items usually found with a sequential pattern. The Naive Approach Mining (NAM) algorithm discovers top-k co-occurrence items by directly scanning the sequence database to determine the frequency of items. The Vertical Approach Mining (VAM) algorithm is based on vertical database scanning. The Vertical with Index Approach Mining (VIAM) algorithm is based on a vertical database with index scanning. VAM and VIAM use pruning strategies to reduce the search space, thus improving performance. VAM and VIAM are especially effective in mining the co-occurrence items of a long input pattern. The three algorithms were evaluated using real-world databases. The experimental results show that these algorithms perform well, especially VAM and VIAM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Co-occurrence sequential mining; Sequential pattern mining; Top-k mining","Database systems; Expert systems; Human computer interaction; Intelligent systems; Scanning; Business intelligence systems; Co-occurrence; Frequent sequential patterns; Improving performance; Real-world database; Sequential analysis; Sequential patterns; Sequential-pattern mining; Data mining",2-s2.0-85019574472

Ten years on we argue the case for the ‘flip’ is stronger than ever yet our progress toward it disappointing. The criticism of business schools is ever persistent and the argument for their irrelevancy seems to be strengthening. Our paper seeks to argue that much of business school practice and pedagogy is still rooted in content rather than context, where priority is given to academic knowledge in favour of practice intelligence. The ‘flip’ as we define it shifts the emphasis to the latter and helps restore business schools to the status of being relevant to business.

Among them, point of interest (POI) recommendation based on user behaviour has enticed a decent attention. Along with quality of recommendations, the utilization of user feedback has grown to be a key part in the POI recommendations. While implementing similarity-based methods in conventional recommender systems, it faces various issues such as trustworthiness, sparsity and cold-start. The commonness and popularity of social network facilitate people to interact with different users and generate massive data such as user relationships, ratings and interactions. Thus, integration of trust relationship of user in location based social network along with their feedback for POI recommendation is the motivation of this work. In this article, we present a POI recommendation method based on trust enhancement in social networks known as social pertinent trust walker (SPTW). Initially, the level of trust between users in social networks is calculated through matrix factorization technique. Then, SPTW with high probability location category algorithm helps to generate POIs as list of recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate proposed algorithm for accuracy.

For this, pulsed infrared photoacoustics is used to investigate SF 6–Ar mixtures in a multiphoton regime, assisted by artificial neural networks. Feedforward multilayer perceptron networks are applied in order to recognize both the spatial characteristics of the laser beam and the values of laser fluence Φ from the given photoacoustic signal and prevent changes. Neural networks are trained in an offline batch training regime to simultaneously estimate four parameters from theoretical or experimental photoacoustic signals: the laser beam spatial profile R(r), vibrational-to-translational relaxation time τV - T, distance from the laser beam to the absorption molecules in the photoacoustic cell r* and laser fluence Φ. The results presented in this paper show that neural networks can estimate an unknown laser beam spatial profile and the parameters of photoacoustic signals in real time and with high precision.

Crowdsourcing and automated retinal image analysis (ARIA) are two areas where new technology has been applied to reduce costs in screening for DR. This paper reviews the current literature surrounding these new technologies. Recent Findings: Crowdsourcing has high sensitivity for normal vs abnormal images; however, when multiple categories for severity of DR are added, specificity is reduced. ARIAs have higher sensitivity and specificity, and some commercial ARIA programs are already in use. Deep learning enhanced ARIAs appear to offer even more improvement in ARIA grading accuracy.

While performing LSPIT in the field is generally quite simple and quick, determining the integrity of the test piles by analyzing and interpreting the test signals (reflectograms) is still a manual process performed by experienced experts only. For foundation construction sites where the number of piles to be tested is large, it may take days before the expert can complete interpreting all of the piles and delivering the integrity assessment report. Techniques that can automate test signal interpretation, thus shortening the LSPIT’s turnaround time, are of great business value and are in great need. Motivated by this need, in this paper, we develop a computer-aided reflectogram interpretation (CARI) methodology that can interpret a large number of LSPIT signals quickly and consistently. The methodology, built on advanced signal processing and machine learning technologies, can be used to assist the experts in performing both qualitative and quantitative interpretation of LSPIT signals. Specifically, the methodology can ease experts’ interpretation burden by screening all test piles quickly and identifying a small number of suspected piles for experts to perform manual, in-depth interpretation. We demonstrate the methodology’s effectiveness using the LSPIT signals collected from a number of real-world pile construction sites. The proposed methodology can potentially enhance LSPIT and make it even more efficient and effective in quality control of deep foundation construction. © 2017 by the authors.

In order to support such large-scale scientific workflows, high-capacity parallel systems such as supercomputers are widely used. To increase the utilization of these systems, most schedulers use backfilling policy based on user’s estimated runtime. However, it is found to be extremely inaccurate because users overestimate their jobs. Therefore, in this paper, an efficient machine learning approach is present to predict the runtime of parallel application. The proposed method is divided into three phases. First is to analyze important feature of the history log data by factor analysis. Second is to carry out clustering for the parallel program based on the important features.

However, it remains unknown whether variations in putamen structure reflect individual differences in the ability to recognize facial expressions. Thus, the present study assessed the putamen volumes and shapes of 50 healthy Japanese adults using structural MRI scans and evaluated the ability of participants to recognize facial expressions associated with six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The volume of the bilateral putamen was negatively associated with the recognition of fearful faces, and the local shapes of both the anterior and posterior subregions of the bilateral putamen, which are thought to support cognitive/affective and motor processing, respectively, exhibited similar negative relationships with the recognition of fearful expressions. These results suggest that individual differences in putamen structure can predict the ability to recognize fearful facial expressions in others.

We employ the principles of ANP methodology to examine and discover the inter-relationships among the OCBs. This process results in a descriptive model that encapsulates the findings from both qualitative and analytics methods. Necessity, altruism, departmental, compliance, and independence are the underlying dimensions of OCBs found to be the most influential/important. The key novelty of this study resides in designing and developing a prescriptive analytics (i.e. ANP) methodology to evaluate the OCBs, which is rare in the area of organizational behavior (a managerial field of study that have been dominated by traditional statistical methods), and thus serves as a useful contribution/augmentation to the business/managerial research methods, and also extends the reach/coverage of analytics-based decision support systems research and practice into a new direction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Analytic network process (ANP); Consumer products; Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB); Qualitative research; Sales representatives","Artificial intelligence; Consumer behavior; Consumer products; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Analytic network process; Conceptual frameworks; In-depth interviews; Organizational behavior; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Qualitative research; Qualitative research methods; Sales representatives; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85028805887

They are thus faced with the challenge of finding solutions for monitoring service performance and estimating customer Quality of Experience (QoE) degradations based solely on passive monitoring solutions deployed within their network. We address this challenge by considering the concrete case of YouTube, whereby we present a methodology for the classification of end users’ QoE when watching YouTube videos, based only on statistical properties of encrypted network traffic. We have developed a system called YouQ which includes tools for monitoring and analysis of application-level quality indicators and corresponding traffic traces. Collected data is then used for the development of machine learning models for QoE classification based on computed traffic features per video session. To test the YouQ system and methodology, we collected a dataset corresponding to 1060 different YouTube videos streamed across 39 different bandwidth scenarios, and tested various classification models. Classification accuracy was found to be up to 84% when using three QoE classes (“low”, “medium” or “high”) and up to 91% when using binary classification (classes “low” and “high”). To improve the models in the future, we discuss why and when prediction errors occur. Moreover, we have analysed YouTube’s adaptation algorithm, thus providing valuable insight into the logic behind the quality level selection strategy, which may also be of interest in improving future QoE estimation algorithms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","HTTP adaptive streaming; Machine learning; Network measurements; Passive monitoring; Quality of Experience; Video streaming; YouTube","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Cryptography; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Video streaming; Adaptive streaming; Network measurement; Passive monitoring; Quality of experience (QoE); YouTube; Quality of service",2-s2.0-85018750008

Several attempts to secure 802.11 standard ends up with the inadequate security mechanisms that are vulnerable to various attacks and intrusions. Thus, integration of external defense mechanism like intrusion detection system (IDS) is inevitable. An anomaly-based IDS employs machine learning algorithms to detect attacks. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensure the performance of the classifier in terms of speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability. This paper proposes a normalized gain based IDS for MAC Intrusions (NMI) to improve the IDS performance significantly. The proposed NMI includes two primary components OFSNP and DCMI. The first component is optimal feature selection using NG and PSO (OFSNP) and the second component is Detecting and Categorizing MAC 802.11 Intrusions (DCMI) using SVM classifier. The OFSNP ranks the features using an independent measure as normalized gain (NG) and selects the optimal set of features using semi-supervised clustering (SSC). The SSC is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that uses labeled and unlabeled features simultaneously to find a group of optimal features. Using the optimal set of features, the proposed DCMI utilizes a rapid and straightforward support vector machine (SVM) learning that classifies the attacks under the appropriate classes. Thus, the proposed NMI achieves a better trade-off between detection accuracy and learning time. The experimental results show that the NMI accurately detects and classifies the 802.11 specific intrusions and also, it reduces the false positives and computation complexity by decreasing the number of features. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Intrusion detection system; MAC 802.11; Normalized gain (NG); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machine (SVM) classifier; WLAN","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Computer crime; Economic and social effects; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mercury (metal); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Wi-Fi; Wireless telecommunication systems; Anomaly-based intrusion detection; Computation complexity; Intrusion Detection Systems; MAC 802.11; Normalized gains; Optimal feature selections; Semi-supervised Clustering; WLAN; Feature extraction",2-s2.0-84969850606

The classification using the different machine learning technique leads for over fitting and under fitting. To select the optimized feature is a difficult task. The high dimension feature vector requires a high computational cost. The hand craft feature selection machine learning techniques performed poor. We have used the incremental feature selection strategy for feature selection. In this paper we first selected the feature and identify the principle feature then we classify gait data using different machine learning technique (KNN, ANN, SVM, DNN and classifier fusion) and shown the performance comparison. Experimental result on real time datasets propose method is better than previous method as far as humanoid locomotion classification is concerned and the generalization accuracy provided by new feature selection method i.e. incremental feature selection (IFS) with analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Zhang et al., 20). During the feature extraction, 17 features were selected from the existing literatures (Wang et al. in IEEE Trans Circ Syst Video Technol 14(2):149–158, 15). Using all the features could lead to over fitting, information redundancy and dimension disaster. Thus, a system with optimal features was selected using ANOVA combined with IFA. These selected features were then fed as an input to the ANN, SVM, KNN and DNN model. These individual classifiers were combined to produce classifier fusion model. The 5-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Based on the empirical results it may be concluded that classifier fusion provides satisfactory results (92.23 %) compared to other individual classifiers. One-way analysis of variance test, Friedman’s test and Kruskal-Wallis test has also been conducted to validate the statistical significance of the results.

Hajj and Umrah Department has various services accommodating hajj applicants end-to-end including registrations and cancellations of each applicants. Currently the applicants that cancel their applications is unpredictable and only have very short notice period so that the applicants that is in waiting list only have very limited time to prepare themself. Considering this, system that can predict the number of cancelled applicants is very important and highly needed to solve the problem.

Hence, computational intelligence optimization algorithms have been proposed and used to find well-enough solutions at a reasonable computation time when the classical algorithms are not applicable or do not provide good solutions to these problems due to the unmanageable search space. Many existing algorithms are nature-inspired, which work by simulating or modeling different natural processes. Due to the philosophy of continually searching the best and absence of the most efficient method for all types of problems, novel algorithms or new variants of current algorithms are being proposed and seem to be proposed in future to see if they can cope with challenging optimization problems. Studies on sports in recent years have shown that processes, concepts, rules, and events in various sports can be considered and modelled as novel efficient search and optimization methods with effective exploration capabilities in many cases, which are able to outperform existing classical and computational intelligence based optimization methods within different types of search spaces (Kashan in Appl Soft Comput 16:171–200, 2014; Bouchekara in Oper Res 1–57, 2017; Razmjooy in J Control Autom Electr Syst 1–22, 2016; Osaba et al. in Appl Intell 41(1):145–166, 2014a, Sci World J, 2014b). These novel and interesting sports based algorithms have shown to be more effective and robust than alternative approaches in a large number of applications. In this work, all of the computational intelligence algorithms based on sports and their applications have been for the first time searched and collected. Specific modelling of real sport games for computational intelligence algorithms and their novelties in terms of comparison with alternative existing algorithms for optimization have been reviewed with specific characteristics, computational implementation details and main applications capabilities, in the frame of hard optimization problems. Information is given about these search and optimization algorithms such as League Championship Algorithm, Soccer League Optimization, Soccer Game Optimization, Soccer League Competition Algorithm, Golden Ball Algorithm, World Cup Optimization, Football Optimization Algorithm, Football Game Inspired Algorithm, and Most Valuable Player Algorithm.

Such requests are usually checked manually by the developers, which is time consuming and tedious. Consequently, an approach that can automatically predict whether a new enhancement report will be approved is beneficial for both the developers and enhancement suggesters. With the approach, according to their available time, the developers can rank the reports and thus limit the number of reports to evaluate from large collection of low quality enhancement requests that are unlikely to be approved. The approach can help developers respond to the useful requests more quickly. To this end, we propose a multinomial naive Bayes based approach to automatically predict whether a new enhancement report is likely to be approved or rejected. We acquire the enhancement reports of open-source software applications from Bugzilla for evaluation. Each report is preprocessed and modeled as a vector. Using these vectors with their corresponding approval status, we train a Bayes based classifier. The trained classifier predicts approval or rejection of the new enhancement reports. We apply different machine learning and neural network algorithms, and it turns out that the multinomial naive Bayes classifier yields the highest accuracy with the given dataset.

Sentiment analysis is one example of application for which parsing has recently proven useful. In recent years, there have been significant advances in the accuracy of parsing algorithms. In this article, we perform an empirical, task-oriented evaluation to determine how parsing accuracy influences the performance of a state-of-the-art rule-based sentiment analysis system that determines the polarity of sentences from their parse trees. In particular, we evaluate the system using four well-known dependency parsers, including both current models with state-of-the-art accuracy and more innacurate models which, however, require less computational resources. The experiments show that all of the parsers produce similarly good results in the sentiment analysis task, without their accuracy having any relevant influence on the results. Since parsing is currently a task with a relatively high computational cost that varies strongly between algorithms, this suggests that sentiment analysis researchers and users should prioritize speed over accuracy when choosing a parser; and parsing researchers should investigate models that improve speed further, even at some cost to accuracy. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Syntactic parsing","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Context free grammars; Cost benefit analysis; Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Computational costs; Computational resources; Empirical evaluations; Internal structure; Natural language text; Natural languages; Sentiment analysis; Syntactic parsing; Syntactics",2-s2.0-85031905148

Finally, RBSIF and ICD are fused to develop the RBSIF-ICD that will be very robust against several attacks such as rotation, flipping, strong compression, ... etc. For the evaluation purpose, the TRECVID 2009 database is used to test the robustness of the proposed system.

Each stego-image is preserved by a participant. In the recovery stage, at least k out of n stego-images are required to obtain the secret image, while k − 1 cannot reveal the secret in the sense of perfect secrecy. Hence, SIS guarantees long-term security. However, as the longer the stego-images remain stored, the higher is the probability of being vulnerable against steganalysis. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes the use of proactive secret sharing in an SIS scheme (P-SIS). P-SIS allows the stego-images to be renewed frequently while these are stored, without changing both cover and secret images. However, direct implementation of a proactive SIS requires more embedding rate (ER), causing high steganalysis accuracy detection and loss of quality in the stego-images. Our proposal addresses this issue and presents the combination of a (k, L, n)-threshold ramp secret sharing scheme and least significant bit matching (LSBM) steganography to reduce the steganalysis accuracy detection. The results of the evaluation show effectiveness of the proposal in terms of good quality of the stego-images, accurate recovery of the secret, and reduce the ER. Note that, despite the extensive research of SIS presented until now, only a few previous work is found on steganalysis in SIS. Not only constructing P-SIS scheme, but we also experimented the tolerance of the proposed P-SIS scheme against stganalysis in this paper. As a result, it is shown that the proposed scheme can withstand steganalysis based on machine learning (i.e., based on subtractive pixel adjacency matrix, SPAM). © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Machine learning; Proactive secret sharing scheme; Ramp secret sharing scheme; Secret image sharing scheme; Steganalysis; Support vector machine","Artificial intelligence; Electric resistance; Learning systems; Steganography; Support vector machines; Adjacency matrices; Least significant bit matching; Perfect secrecy; Proactive secret sharing; Proactive Secret Sharing Schemes; Secret image sharing; Secret sharing schemes; Steganalysis; Image processing",2-s2.0-85031494966

To prevent churn, we track user activity, identify the game features that are potentially interesting to the user and then use that data to tailor personalized push notifications with a purpose to attract users back into the game.

The assumption behind the proposed approaches is that events are susceptible to substantively deviate from the distribution of normal observations and therefore should be lying in regions of low density. Thus, it is believed that an event detection model can be trained more efficiently by focusing on samples that appear to be inconsistent with the majority of the dataset. The first approach is an uni-modal method which consists in using rank aggregation to select informative samples which have previously been ranked using different unsupervised outlier detection techniques in combination with an uncertainty sampling technique. The information used for the sample selection stems from an unique modality (e.g. video channel). Since most active learning approaches focus on one target channel to perform the selection of informative samples and thus do not take advantage of potentially useful and complementary information among correlated modalities, we propose an extension of the previous uni-modal approach to multi-modality. From a target pool of instances belonging to a specific modality, the uni-modal approach is used to select and manually label a set of informative instances. Additionally, a second set of automatically labelled instances of the target pool is generated, based on a transfer of information stemming from an auxiliary modality which is temporally dependent to the target one. Both sets of labelled instances (automatically and manually labelled instances) are used for the semi-supervised training of a classification model to be used in the next active learning iteration. Both methods have been assessed on a set of participants selected from the UUlmMAC dataset and have proven to be effective in substantially reducing the cost of manual annotation required for the training of a facial event detection model. The assessment is done based on two different methods: Support Vector Data Description and expected similarity estimation. Furthermore, given an appropriate sampling approach, the multi-modal approach outperforms its uni-modal counterpart in most of the cases. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Active learning; Expected similarity estimation; Support Vector Data Description; Unsupervised outlier detection","Artificial intelligence; Data description; Data handling; Image retrieval; Statistics; Active Learning; Classification models; Outlier Detection; Semi-supervised trainings; Similarity estimation; Support vector data description; Transfer of information; Uncertainty samplings; Iterative methods",2-s2.0-85031424472

The usefulness of the proposed framework is twofold: (i) for multi-agent scenarios, it provides a computational approach to handling large-scale distributed decision-making problems and learning decentralized control policies.

As an analysis of how clinicians examine children to diagnose developmental disabilities, it involves the sociology of testing and standardization, with our particular focus on Autism Spectrum Disorders. Whereas previous research has concentrated primarily on the outcomes of testing, such as diagnostic trends, little has been written about the tests by which these trends are produced. Our analysis shows how psychometric tests operate to shape the interactive environments (those established by the test instrument, scoring metrics, etc.). Additionally, the interactional environment (the practices by which protocols are implemented as clinician and child do the test) exerts an influence on performance. In short, the interactive and interactional environment may affect the measurement of ability and difference in children. We propose that the emphasis of clinical tests on measuring second-order, abstract competence—or the ability to produce general answers to theoretical questions—may obscure various kinds of first-order, concrete competence and “autistic intelligence” a child displays. As forms of first-order, concrete competence, we examine orientation in situ to testing history, narrative combinations of test items, and using filler words for test item answers. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Autism Spectrum disorder; Conversation analysis; Ethnomethodology; Medical sociology; Science and technology; Testing",,2-s2.0-85030873754

These systems require that the robots interrupt, albeit shortly, their activity, which influences the swarm behaviour.

Among popular botnet countermeasures, an intrusion detection system is the prominent mechanism. In the past, packet-based intrusion detection systems were popular. However, flow-based intrusion detection systems have been preferred in recent years due to their ability to adapt to modern high-speed networks. A collection of flows from an enterprise network usually contains both botnet traffic and normal traffic. To classify this traffic, supervised machine learning algorithms, i.e., classifications, have been applied and achieved a high accuracy. In an effort to improve the ability of intrusion detection systems against botnets, some studies have suggested partitioning flows into clusters before applying the classifications and this step could significantly reduce the complexity of a flow set. However, the instability of individual clustering algorithms is still a constraint for botnet detection.To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel method that combines individual partitions to become a strong learner through the use of a link-based algorithm.

However, most literature about these attacks does not indicate how such knowledge is obtained by the attacker. So, to fill this hiatus, an Active System Identification attack is proposed in this paper, where the attacker injects data on the NCS to learn about its model. The attack is implemented based on two bio-inspired metaheuristics: Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm (BSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To improve the accuracy of the estimated models, a statistical refinement is proposed for the outcomes of the two optimization algorithms. Additionally, a set of data injection attacks are shown in order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed attack in supporting the design of other sophisticated attacks. The results indicate a better performance of the BSA-based attacks, especially when the captured signals contain white Gaussian noise. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the degree of accuracy that this System Identification attack may achieve, highlighting the potential impacts and encouraging the research of possible countermeasures. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Backtracking search algorithm; Cyber-physical systems; Networked control systems; Particle swarm optimization; Security; System identification","Computer crime; Control systems; Control theory; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Gaussian noise (electronic); Identification (control systems); Network security; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Religious buildings; Backtracking search; Backtracking search algorithms; Degree of accuracy; Estimated model; Optimization algorithms; Potential impacts; Security; White Gaussian Noise; Networked control systems",2-s2.0-85030700543

To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today’s increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems.

Differences in the results of such categorization arise from the feature set chosen to base the association of a given document with a given category. This process is challenging mainly because there can be large number of discriminating words which render many of the current algorithms unable to complete this. For most of these tasks there exist both relevant as well as irrelevant features. The objective here is to bring about a text classification on the basis of the features selected and also pre-processing to bring down the dimensionality and increase the accuracy of classification of the feature vector. Here the most commonly used methods are meta-heuristic algorithms in order to facilitate selection. Artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) takes the underlying intelligence of the behaviour of fish swarming to combat the problems of optimization as well as the combinatorial problems. This method has been greatly successful in diverse applications but does suffer from certain limitations like not having multiplicity. Therefore, a modification has been proposed to AFSA which is MAFSA that has a crossover in its operation in order to bring about an improvement in the text classification selection.

This requires the use of policies and rules to guide or enforce the execution of strategies or tactics within an enterprise as well as in collaborations between enterprises. With the help of policies and rules, an enterprise is able to capture an actor's intent in its business support system, and act according to this intent on behalf of the actor. Since the value networks an enterprise is part of will change over time the business intents' life cycle states might change. Achieving the changes in an effective and efficient way requires knowledge about the affected intents and the correlation between intents. The aim of the study is to identify how a business support system can support continuous changes to business intents. The first step is to find a theoretical model which serves as a foundation for intent-driven systems. We conducted a case study using a focus group approach with employees from Ericsson. This case study was influenced by the spiral case study process. The study resulted in a model supporting continuous definition and execution of an enterprise. The model is divided into three layers; Define, Execute, and a common governance view layer. This makes it possible to support continuous definition and execution of business intents and to identify the actors needed to support the business intents' life cycles. This model is supported by a meta-model for capturing information into viewpoints. The research question is addressed by suggesting a solution supporting continuous definition and execution of an enterprise as a model of value architecture components and business functions.

We describe some of the limitations of the many evaluation schemes and competitions in these three categories, and follow the progression of some of these tests. We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more integrated approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics. We analyse some evaluation tests from AI that are better positioned for an ability-oriented evaluation and discuss how their problems and limitations can possibly be addressed with some of the tools and ideas that appear within the paper.

Business process data are sequential in nature and can be very diverse. Thus, there is a need for an efficient sequential forecasting methodology that can cope with this diversity. This paper proposes two approaches, a sequential k nearest neighbour and an extension of Markov models both with an added component based on sequence alignment. The proposed approaches exploit temporal categorical features of the data to predict the process next steps using higher order Markov models and the process outcomes using sequence alignment technique. The diversity aspect of the data is also added by considering subsets of similar process sequences based on k nearest neighbours.

One recent swarm intelligence algorithm that has begun to receive more attention is Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO). It is an enhanced version of PSO with global optimization capability, sufficient simplicity and high flexibility. In this paper, we propose the application of the APSO technique to efficiently solve the problem of Query Expansion (QE) in Web Information Retrieval (IR). Unlike prior studies, we introduce a new modelling of QE that aims to find the suitable expanded query from among a set of expanded query candidates. Nevertheless, due to the large number of potential expanded query candidates, it is extremely complex to produce the best one through conventional hard computing methods. Therefore, we propose to consider the problem of QE as a combinatorial optimization problem and address it with APSO. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed APSO for QE using MEDLINE, the world Web’s largest medical library. We first conduct a preliminary experiment to tune the APSO parameters. Then, we compare the results to a recent swarm intelligence algorithm called Firefly Algorithm (FA). We also compare the results with three recently published methods for QE that involved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Bat Algorithm (BA). The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed APSO for QE is very competitive and yields substantial improvement over the other methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and computational complexity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Accelerated particle swarm optimization; Information retrieval; MEDLINE; Query expansion; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Web intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Information retrieval; Optimization; Particle accelerators; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Problem solving; Soft computing; Accelerated particles; Medline; Query expansion; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Web intelligence; Swarm intelligence",2-s2.0-85018814431

We move from the intuitions that (1) a set of textual reviews expressing different sentiments may feature the same score (and vice-versa), and (2) detecting and analyzing the mismatches between the review content and the actual score may benefit both service providers and consumers, by highlighting specific factors of satisfaction (and dissatisfaction) in texts. To prove the intuitions, we adopt sentiment analysis techniques and we concentrate on hotel reviews, to find polarity mismatches therein. In particular, we first train a text classifier with a set of annotated hotel reviews, taken from the Booking website. Then, we analyze a large dataset, with around 160k hotel reviews collected from TripAdvisor, with the aim of detecting a polarity mismatch, indicating if the textual content of the review is in line, or not, with the associated score. Using well-established artificial intelligence techniques and analyzing in depth the reviews featuring a mismatch between the text polarity and the score, we find that—on a scale of five stars—those reviews ranked with middle scores include a mixture of positive and negative aspects. The approach proposed here, beside acting as a polarity detector, provides an effective selection of reviews—on an initial very large dataset—that may allow both consumers and providers to focus directly on the review subset featuring a text/score disagreement,which conveniently convey to the user a summary of positive and negative features of the review target. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Natural language processing; Online reviews; Polarity detection; Social science methods or tools","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Hotels; Natural language processing systems; Artificial intelligence techniques; Artificial intelligence tools; Cognitive Computing; Online reviews; Science methods; Sentiment analysis; Service provider; Text classifiers; Feature extraction",2-s2.0-85026501769

It is concerned more and more in recent years and arises in a variety of application fields such as the layout design of spacecraft modules, plant equipment, platforms of marine drilling well, shipping, vehicle and robots. The algorithms based on swarm intelligence are considered powerful tools for solving this kind of problems. While usually swarm intelligence algorithms also have several disadvantages, including premature and slow convergence. Aiming at solving engineering complex layout problems satisfactorily, a new improved swarm-based intelligent optimization algorithm is presented on the basis of parallel genetic algorithms. In proposed approach, chaos initialization and multi-subpopulation evolution strategy based on improved adaptive crossover and mutation are adopted. The proposed interpolating rank-based selection with pressure is adaptive with evolution process. That is to say, it can avoid early premature as well as benefit speeding up convergence of later period effectively. And more importantly, proposed PSO update operators based on different versions PSO are introduced into presented algorithm.

The implementation of optimal recharge methods requires knowledge of physical, chemical, and biological phenomena involving water and wastewater filtration in the subsoil, together with engineering aspects related to plant design and maintenance operations. This study uses a novel Decision Support System (DSS), which includes soil aquifer treatment (SAT) evaluation, to design an artificial recharge plant. The DSS helps users make strategic decisions on selecting the most appropriate recharge methods and water treatment technologies at specific sites. This will enable the recovery of safe water using managed aquifer recharge (MAR) practices, and result in reduced recharge costs. The DSS was built using an artificial intelligence technique and knowledge-based technology, related to both quantitative and qualitative aspects of water supply for artificial recharge. The DSS software was implemented using rules based on the cumulative experience of wastewater treatment plant engineers and groundwater modeling.

Often, this expertise is irreconcilably split between an organisation's engineers and subject matter domain experts. Previous approaches to this problem have relied on technically adept users with tool-specific training. Such an approach has a number of challenges: Expertise — There are few data-analytic subject domain experts with in-depth technical knowledge of compute architectures; Performance — Analysts do not generally make full use of the performance and scalability capabilities of the underlying architectures; Heterogeneity — calculating the most performant and scalable mix of real-time (on-line) and batch (off-line) analytics in a problem domain is difficult; Tools — Supporting frameworks will often direct several tasks, including, composition, planning, code generation, validation, performance tuning and analysis, but do not typically provide end-to-end solutions embedding all of these activities.

With current trends towards big Data Warehouses (DWs), it is attractive to run existing business intelligence/data warehousing applications on higher volumes of data in wide-column NoSQL databases for low latency by mapping multidimensional models to wide-column NoSQL models or using additional SQL add-ons. For examples, applications like retail management can run over integrated data sets stored in big DWs or in the cloud to capture current item-selling trends. Many of these systems also employ Snapshot Isolation (SI) as a concurrency control mechanism to achieve high throughput for read-heavy workloads. SI works well in a DW environment, as analytical queries can now work on (consistent) snapshots and are not impacted by concurrent update jobs performed by online incremental Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) flows that refresh fact/dimension tables. However, the snapshot made available in the DW is often stale, since at the moment when an analytical query is issued, the source updates (e.g. in a remote retail store) may not have been extracted and processed by the ETL process in time due to high input data volume or slow processing speed. This staleness may cause incorrect results for time-critical decision support queries. To address this problem, snapshots which are supposed to be accessed by analytical queries need to be first maintained by corresponding ETL flows to reflect source updates based on given freshness needs. Snapshot maintenance in this work means maintaining the distributed data partitions that are required by a query. Since most NoSQL databases are not ACID compliant and do not provide full-fledged distributed transaction support, snapshot may be inconsistently derived when its data partitions are updated by different ETL maintenance jobs. This paper describes an extended version of HBelt system [1] which tightly integrates the wide-column NoSQL database HBase with a clustered & pipelined ETL engine. Our objective is to efficiently refresh HBase tables with remote source updates while a consistent snapshot is guaranteed across distributed partitions for each scan request in analytical queries. A consistency model is defined and implemented to address so-called distributed snapshot maintenance. To achieve this, ETL jobs and analytical queries are scheduled in a distributed processing environment. In addition, a partitioned, incremental ETL pipeline is introduced to increase the performance of ETL (update) jobs. We validate the efficiency gain in terms of data pipelining and data partitioning using the TPC-DS benchmark, which simulates a modern decision support system for a retail product supplier. Experimental results show that high query throughput can be achieved in HBelt when distributed, refreshed snapshots are demanded. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed snapshot maintenance; Incremental ETL pipeline","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Concurrency control; Costs; Data handling; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Maintenance; Pipelines; Query processing; Retail stores; Sales; Analytical queries; Decision support query; Distributed processing; Distributed snapshots; Distributed transaction; Extract transform loads; Multi-dimensional model; Snapshot isolation; Distributed database systems",2-s2.0-85019028512

However, most performance-based measures of cognitive rigidity associated with depression offer poor ecological validity, produce mixed findings, and afford little in the way of therapeutic application. In order to establish a more useful and relevant performance-based measure of cognitive rigidity in depression, we developed a novel task that probes a rigidity process using stimuli highly relevant to the level of construal, the thematic content, and the rhetorical mode of depressotypic thinking. The task consists of a set of narrative vignettes that contain an expectancy-violation that is incompatible with an initially-established interpretation. As hypothesized, depressive symptoms were associated with reduced ability to update interpretations. This finding was independent of the valence of the expectancy-violation (i.e., was not merely a negativity bias), and was significant after controlling for basic set-shifting ability, intelligence measures, working memory, and other potential confounds. The novel Contingent Inference Task is a promising approach that may probe a more ecologically and etiologically relevant form of cognitive rigidity in depression than other related performance-based rigidity tasks.

Detecting the location entities mentioned in these messages is useful in text mining applications. Therefore, techniques for extracting the location entities from the Twitter textual content are needed. In this work, we approach this task in a similar manner to the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, but we focus only on locations, while NER systems detect names of persons, organizations, locations, and sometimes more (e.g., dates, times). But, unlike NER systems, we address a deeper task: classifying the detected locations into names of cities, provinces/states, and countries in order to map them into physical locations. We approach the task in a novel way, consisting in two stages. In the first stage, we train Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models that are able to detect the locations mentioned in the messages. We train three classifiers: one for cities, one for provinces/states, and one for countries, with various sets of features. Since a dataset annotated with this kind of information was not available, we collected and annotated our own dataset to use for training and testing. In the second stage, we resolve the remaining ambiguities, namely, cases when there exists more than one place with the same name. We proposed a set of heuristics able to choose the correct physical location in these cases. Our two-stage model will allow a social media monitoring system to visualize the places mentioned in Twitter messages on a map of the world or to compute statistics about locations.

Reliable and predictive animal models are essential to increase our understanding of the neurobiological basis of the disorder and for the development of novel antipsychotics with improved therapeutic efficacy and tolerable side effects. A favorite working hypothesis is the so-called two-hit theory. Developmental animal models of schizophrenia are a valuable heuristic tool which focuses on this aspect. Manipulations of the environment, drug administration, or discrete surgical intervention during the sensitive prenatal or postnatal period induce a reorganization of neuronal circuits resulting in irreversible changes in central nervous system (CNS) function, which typically appear after puberty. These models are considered superior, since they can include different schizophrenia-relevant brain and behavioral pathologies and incorporate the developmental component of the disorder.

In this approach, an integrated decision support system was applied to assess thermal insulation practices used commonly in residential buildings in the Mediterranean area. The system assesses the buildings’ elements over their life cycle, with thermal comfort being evaluated by means of the PMV/PPD index. Twenty-three thermal insulation configurations were considered, with different locations (internal, middle, external), materials (expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, stone wool), and thicknesses.

Recently, approaches for model-free tracking have received increased interest since manually annotating sufficient examples of all objects in the world is prohibitively expensive. By definition, a model-free tracker has only one labeled instance in the form of an identified object in the first frame. In the subsequent frames, it has to learn variations of the tracked object with only unlabeled data available. There exists a dilemma for model-free trackers, i.e., whether the tracker would shift the focus to clutters (i.e., adaptivity) or result in very short tracks (i.e., stability) largely depends on how sensitive the appearance model is. In contrast to recent survey efforts with data-driven approaches focusing on the performance on benchmarks, this article aims to provide an in-depth survey on solutions to the dilemma between adaptivity and stability in model-free tracking focusing on the ability of achieving situation awareness, i.e., learning the object appearance adaptively in a non-stationary environment. The survey results show that, regardless of visual representations and statistical models involved, the way of exploiting unlabeled data in the changing environment and the extent of how rapidly the appearance model need be updated accordingly with selected example(s) of estimated labels are the key to many, if not all, evaluation measures for tracking. Such conceptual consensuses, despite the diversity of approaches in this field, for the first time capture the essence of model-free tracking and facilitate the design of visual tracking systems. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Computer vision; Machine learning; Model-free tracking; Semi-supervised online learning; Video surveillance","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Computer vision; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Security systems; Tracking (position); Changing environment; Data-driven approach; Model free; Non-stationary environment; Online learning; Video surveillance; Visual representations; Visual tracking systems; Surveys",2-s2.0-84992124400

However, the projection-and-test mechanism used by these algorithms to discover recent weighted frequent itemsets (RWFIs) in a recursive way may have poor performance when the database is dense or contains long transactions. To address this issue, an efficient tree-based RWFI-Mine algorithm is proposed in this paper for mining RWFIs, which considers both weight and the recency of patterns. A novel Set-enumeration tree called the recent weighted frequent (RWF)-tree and a sorted downward closure property of RWFIs for the RWF-tree are proposed. Moreover, two data structures, named element (E)-table and recent weighted frequent (RWF)-table, are designed to store the information needed for discovering RWFIs. RFWI-Mine discovers RWFIs in a recursive way without candidate generation, thus reducing the computational costs and memory requirements for mining RWFIs. A second improved algorithm named RWFI-EMine algorithm is further proposed to avoid building E-tables and RWF-tables for unpromising itemsets and their child nodes by adopting the Estimated Weight of 2-itemset Pruning (EW2P) strategy. Extensive experiments are conducted on several real-world and synthetic datasets to evaluate the performance of the two proposed algorithms, and the ratio between the number of generated RWFIs and WFIs. Results show that the proposed algorithms outperform not only the traditional PWA algorithm for WFIM, but also the state-of-the-art RWFIM-P and RWFIM-PE algorithms for RWFIM, in terms of runtime, memory usage and scalability. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","EW2P strategy; Recency constraint; Set-enumeration RWF-tree; Temporal database; Weighted frequent itemsets","Artificial intelligence; EW2P strategy; Item sets; Recency constraint; Set-enumeration RWF-tree; Temporal Database; Trees (mathematics)",2-s2.0-85018817124

The aim of the study was to assess the agreement in the postoperative setting between the SL method and electromagnetic 3D positioning (EM). CVP was measured with patients in positions dictated by nursing routines. The staff members measured CVP using SL to position the transducer at the perceived phlebostatic level. This position was compared to coordinates based on an electromagnetic field with external sensors at anatomical landmarks and an internal sensor in the CV catheter for 3D determination of the phlebostatic axis. An electronic survey took bearing on the accepted error in measurement among colleagues at the department. There was a clinically relevant difference between the CVP measured by the staff members and the CVP based on the 3D EM positioning. The limits of agreement extended in excess of ±8 mmHg and half of the measurements had deviations outside an accepted error range of ±2.5 mmHg.

HEVC requires only 50 % bitrate of H.264/AVC at the same perceptual quality by adopting new coding tools and more flexible block structures. HEVC specifies 35 different intra prediction directions that can be associated to different block sizes. Each possible combination needs to be tested within the Rate Distortion (RD) process to enable selecting the optimal intra mode and block splitting depth. This leads to a significant processing weight and therefore any improvement that might be achieved will bring significative increase in the computational efficiency of the algorithm.

This fast algorithm is composed of two algorithms. The first algorithm is a modes pruning algorithm depending on decision trees. We first calculate variances of the above side, the left side and all the reference samples of all the PUs (Prediction Units), which are used to divide the PUs into three groups of different candidate intra prediction modes. The first group only includes Planar mode and DC mode, the optimal mode will be selected from the two modes. The second and third groups include 19 and 35 intra modes, respectively. Then the decision trees are trained using the information obtained previously by the software WEKA. The classification process has an accuracy of 85.29 %. The second algorithm is a three-step search algorithm which is defined to be suitable for prediction units classified into class two and class three after the execution of decision trees. The detailed implementations of three-step search algorithms for prediction units belong to those two classes are subtly different. Experimental results verify that, compared with the reference software HM15.0, on average, the proposed algorithm reduces the encoding time by 37.87 % with a slightly decreasing of BD-PSNR (0.058 dB) and increasing of BD-Rate (1.19 %). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Decision trees; High efficiency video coding (HEVC); Intra mode decision; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Decision trees; Efficiency; Electric distortion; Encoding (symbols); Forecasting; Forestry; Image coding; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Signal distortion; Trees (mathematics); Video signal processing; Classification process; Encoding efficiency; High-efficiency video coding; Intra mode decision; Intra prediction modes; New three-step searches; Pruning algorithms; Video coding schemes; Computational efficiency",2-s2.0-84994411648

There is a scarcity of validated scales of mindfulness in children or adolescent populations, especially in Italy. The aim is to investigate the psychometric characteristics of the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) on an Italian sample of 941 children and adolescents (from 9 to 18 years). In addition, we tested the convergence of the CAMM with measures of emotional intelligence (EQ-i), of quality of life (YQLI), and of somatizing symptoms (CSI). Statistical analyses showed that the original version of the CAMM with 10 items does not fit in with the data obtained on the Italian children and adolescents samples, especially for the bad psychometric properties of two items. When these items were removed, the new version of the CAMM with eight items provided more reliable measures. The confirmatory factor analysis consolidated the uni-dimensional structure of the CAMM. In addition, the new version of the CAMM showed a strong measurement invariance between males and females, significant positive correlations with emotional intelligence and quality of life, and significant negative correlations with somatizing symptoms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","CAMM; Children and adolescents; Confirmatory factor analysis; Measurement invariance; Mindfulness",,2-s2.0-85029745605

In CI, objects/attributes are considered as neurons connected to each other via synapse. The relation represents the synapse in CI. In order to represent new information the brain generates new synapse or relation between the existing neurons. Therefore, the establishment of cognitive relations is essential to represent new information. In order to represent new information, we propose an algorithm which creates cognitive relation between the pair of objects and attributes by using the relational attribute and object method. Further, the cognitive relations between the pair of objects or attributes within the context could be checked with newly defined conditions, i.e. the necessary and sufficient condition. These conditions will evaluate whether the relational object and attribute is adequate to have relations between the pair of objects and attributes. The new information is obtained without increasing the number of neurons in brain. It is achieved by creating cognitive relations between the pair of objects and attributes. The obtained results are beneficial to simulate the intelligence behaviour of brain such as learning and memorizing. Integrating the idea of CI into cognitive relations is a promising and challenging research direction.

A classification model is used for predicting the sentiment polarity of segmentation. The joint framework is trained directly using the sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without the use of any syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level.

Identifying sentiments in an automated, algorithmic manner will be a useful capability for business and research in their search to understand what consumers think about their products or services and to understand human sociology. Here we propose two new Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for the task of automated text sentiment analysis. The GAs learn whether words occurring in a text corpus are either sentiment or amplifier words, and their corresponding magnitude. Sentiment words, such as’horrible’, add linearly to the final sentiment. Amplifier words in contrast, which are typically adjectives/adverbs like’very’, multiply the sentiment of the following word. This increases, decreases or negates the sentiment of the following word. The sentiment of the full text is then the sum of these terms. This approach grows both a sentiment and amplifier dictionary which can be reused for other purposes and fed into other machine learning algorithms.

WA-ANN and WA-SVR relative of ANN and SVR were evaluated with coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Results showed that WA-ANN and WA-SVR have better performance than ANN and SVR models. WA-SVR yielded better results than WA-ANN model for 1, 2 and 3-month lead times. The study indicates that WA-SVR could be applied for groundwater forecasting under ecological water conveyance conditions. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial neural network; Discrete wavelet transform; Extreme arid regions; Groundwater level fluctuations; Support vector regression","Arid regions; Discrete wavelet transforms; Forecasting; Groundwater; Mean square error; Neural networks; Water resources; Wavelet transforms; Coefficient of correlation; Ecological water conveyances; Groundwater forecasting; Groundwater level fluctuation; Root mean squared errors; Support vector regression (SVR); Water resources management; Wavelet support vector regressions; Groundwater resources",2-s2.0-85029737599

Among these, ethical and social considerations are critical. This article reviews the spectrum of IATs for dementia and investigates the prevalence of ethical considerations in the design of current IATs. Our screening shows that a significant portion of current IATs is designed in the absence of explicit ethical considerations.

The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition technology called “Beyond AI”. Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent learning model called “Brain Intelligence (BI)” that generates new ideas about events without having experienced them by using artificial life with an imagine function.

Learning algorithms are evolving; they are often created from parsing through large datasets of online information while having truth labels bestowed on them by crowd-sourced masses. These specialized AI algorithms have been liberated from the minds of researchers and startups, and released onto the public. Yet intelligent though they may be, these algorithms maintain some of the same biases that permeate society. They find patterns within datasets that reflect implicit biases and, in so doing, emphasize and reinforce these biases as global truth. This paper describes specific examples of how bias has infused itself into current AI and robotic systems, and how it may affect the future design of such systems.

One of the fast evolving application in MANET is mobile-learning (m learning). Security in MANET’s is a challenge due to its open medium. The routing assumes that all the nodes in the network are trustworthy which leaves the network vulnerable to attacks. Trust management schemes are popularly used for secure routing, verification, interruption location, and access control. In this work, clustering and trust is used for mitigating maliciousness and formation of clusters is optimized using heuristic method. Swarm intelligence (SI) is an efficient option for optimizing routing in a complex network situation, where traditional routing strategies come up short.

However, the traditional analysis of the concept, which requires that a deceiver intentionally cause her victim to have a false belief, rules out the possibility of much deception in the animal kingdom. Cognitively unsophisticated species, such as fireflies and butterflies, have simply evolved to mislead potential predators and/or prey. To capture such cases of “functional deception,” several researchers (e.g., Sober, From a biological point of view, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1994; Hauser in: Whiten, Byrne (eds) Machiavellian intelligence II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp 112–143, 1997; Searcy and Nowicki, The evolution of animal communication, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2005; Skyrms, Signals, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2010) have endorsed the broader view that deception only requires that a deceiver benefit from sending a misleading signal. Moreover, in order to facilitate game-theoretic study of deception in the context of Lewisian sender-receiver games, Brian Skyrms has proposed an influential formal analysis of this view. Such formal analyses have the potential to enhance our philosophical understanding of deception in humans as well as animals. However, as we argue in this paper, Skyrms’s analysis, as well as two recently proposed alternative analyses (viz., Godfrey-Smith in Review of signals: evolution, learning, and information by Brian Skyrms, Mind, 120: 1288–1297, 2001; McWhirter in Brit J Philos Sci 67: 757–780, 2016), are seriously flawed and can lead us to draw unwarranted conclusions about deception. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Deceptive signals; Functional deception; Measures of inaccuracy; Misinformation; Sender–Receiver games; Signaling theory",,2-s2.0-85029591056

In modern software development, developers frequently use different applications including IDEs, Web Browsers, documentation software (such as Office Word, Excel, and PDF applications), and other tools to complete their tasks. This creates significant challenges in collecting and analyzing developers’ behavior data. Researchers usually instrument the software tools to log developers’ behavior for further studies. This is feasible for studies on development activities using specific software tools. However, instrumenting all software tools commonly used in real work settings is difficult and requires significant human effort. Furthermore, the collected behavior data consist of low-level and fine-grained event sequences, which must be abstracted into high-level development activities for further analysis. This abstraction is often performed manually or based on simple heuristics. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the above two challenges in collecting and analyzing developers’ behavior data. First, we use our ActivitySpace framework to improve the generalizability of the data collection. ActivitySpace uses operating-system level instrumentation to track developer interactions with a wide range of applications in real work settings. Secondly, we use a machine learning approach to reduce the human effort to abstract low-level behavior data. Specifically, considering the sequential nature of the interaction data, we propose a Condition Random Field (CRF) based approach to segment and label the developers’ low-level actions into a set of basic, yet meaningful development activities. To validate the generalizability of the proposed data collection approach, we deploy the ActivitySpace framework in an industry partner’s company and collect the real working data from ten professional developers’ one-week work in three actual software projects. The experiment with the collected data confirms that with initial human-labeled training data, the CRF model can be trained to infer development activities from low-level actions with reasonable accuracy within and across developers and software projects. This suggests that the machine learning approach is promising in reducing the human efforts required for behavior data analysis. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Condition Random Field; Developers’ interaction data; Software development","Abstracting; Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Computer software; Data acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Random processes; Software engineering; Web browsers; Development activity; Labeled training data; Machine learning approaches; Random fields; Reasonable accuracy; Simple heuristics; Software project; Techniques and tools; Software design",2-s2.0-85029475777

It consists of finding groups of items bought together that yield a high profit. Several algorithms have been proposed to mine high utility itemsets using various approaches and more or less complex data structures. Among existing algorithms, one-phase algorithms employing the utility-list structure have shown to be the most efficient. In recent years, the simplicity of the utility-list structure has led to the development of numerous utility-list based algorithms for various tasks related to utility mining. However, a major limitation of utility-list based algorithms is that creating and maintaining utility-lists are time consuming and can consume a huge amount of memory. The reasons are that numerous utility lists are built and that the utility-list intersection/join operation to construct a utility-list is costly. This paper addresses this issue by proposing an improved utility-list structure called utility-list buffer to reduce the memory consumption and speed up the join operation. This structure is integrated into a novel algorithm named ULB-Miner (Utility-List Buffer for high utility itemset Miner), which introduces several new ideas to more efficiently discover high utility itemsets. ULB-Miner uses the designed utility-list buffer structure to efficiently store and retrieve utility-lists, and reuse memory during the mining process. Moreover, the paper also introduces a linear time method for constructing utility-list segments in a utility-list buffer. An extensive experimental study on various datasets shows that the proposed algorithm relying on the novel utility-list buffer structure is highly efficient in terms of both execution time and memory consumption. The ULB-Miner algorithm is up to 10 times faster than the FHM and HUI-Miner algorithms and consumes up to 6 times less memory. Moreover, it performs well on both dense and sparse datasets. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Itemset mining; Pattern mining; Utility list; Utility list buffer; Utility mining","Artificial intelligence; Itemset mining; Pattern mining; Utility list; Utility list buffer; Utility mining; Miners",2-s2.0-85029539168

A joint analysis is conducted on three types of heterogeneous mobility data (i.e., taxi trajectories, metro passenger RFID card data, and telco data), which can complement each other and provide a full picture of people's activities in a region. In addition, advanced analytical algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to capture latent activity patterns, as well as metric learning to calibrate and supervise the underlying analysis) and novel visualization designs are integrated into our system to provide a comprehensive solution to region segmentation in urban areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system via case studies with real-world datasets and qualitative interviews with domain experts. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Matrix algebra; Taxicabs; Urban planning; Visualization; Analytical algorithms; Modern civilization; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Novel visualizations; Qualitative interviews; Rapid transformations; Real-world datasets; Visual analytics systems; Factorization",2-s2.0-85032035833

First, the initial pool of base ELMs is generated by using bootstrap sampling, which is then pre-pruned by calculating the pair-wise diversity measure of each base ELM. Second, partial-based ELMs among the initial pool after pre-pruning with higher precision and with greater diversity are selected by using an Improved Discrete Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (IDAFSA). Finally, the selected base ELMs are integrated through majority voting. The Experimental results on 16 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository demonstrate that IDAFSEN can achieve better classification accuracy than other previously reported methods.

Big data technology, which provides new solutions to data-related problems, draws an increasing attention, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. Swarm intelligence is an important tool for solving complex problems in both scientific research and engineering practice. Representing a major development trend in artificial intelligence and information science, swarm intelligence has displayed great application potentials in big data analysis and data mining. Firefly algorithm (FA), an optimization technique based on swarm intelligence, has been successfully applied to a diversity of complex engineering optimization problems. In a standard FA, particles migrate blindly towards those better ones, without considering the status of the object of learning. However, this type of particle regeneration may result in a solution being trapped into local optima, with fast convergence speed but low convergence precision. We propose an FA with Gaussian disturbance and local search. The swarm is updated using random attraction model. The current position of the particle is compared with particle’s historical optimal position. If the current position is inferior to the historical optimal position, the particle is updated by Gaussian disturbance and local search strategy. The optimal particle will be selected for the next round of learning. This method not only enhances population diversity, but also increases optimizing precision. Simulations were performed on 12 benchmark functions under the same parameters. The results indicate that the optimizing performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the other 5 recently provided FA methods. Local search strategy, as compared with random attraction model and Gaussian disturbance, can dramatically improve the optimizing performance. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Firefly algorithm; Gaussian disturbance; Local search; Random model","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Bioluminescence; Data mining; Gaussian distribution; Local search (optimization); Problem solving; Swarm intelligence; Cloud computing technologies; Fast convergence speed; Firefly algorithms; Gaussian disturbances; Local search; Optimization techniques; Optimizing performance; Random Model; Optimization",2-s2.0-85028856805

This enables scientists to strategically select their experimental environment. Since it is hard to offer cloud resources in accordance with application characteristics, efficient resource provisioning methods are needed. This paper proposes an adaptive resource provisioning method using an application-aware machine learning technique that is based on the job history in heterogeneous infrastructures. The proposed resource provisioning method is built on two main concepts. First, it provides application-aware resource provisioning through the profiling of scientific application in a heterogeneous computing infrastructure. A resource provisioning model uses the resource usage profiles of scientific applications and job history data in heterogeneous computing infrastructures. In addition to the multilayer perceptron machine learning method, an error back-propagation approach is applied to analyze job history to re-learn the error of the output value. Second, it offers an adaptive resource scaling that is invoked by the availability of resource changes. An adaptive resource management method results in an enhancement of the overall balance between the performance and utilization of a system. For the experiments with the two CPU-intensive applications according to the method, a heterogeneous infrastructure comprising clusters and cloud environments is used. Experimental results indicate that the use of the proposed method can gratify user requests (cost and execution time) regarding its application and enhance resource usage effectiveness. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Adaptive provisioning; Application-aware; Auto-scaling; Heterogeneous infrastructure; Multilayer perceptron","Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Adaptive provisioning; Adaptive Resource Management; Auto-scaling; Experimental environment; Heterogeneous infrastructure; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Scientific applications; Learning systems",2-s2.0-85028865774

Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to how having a child with cancer affects the marital relationship from the perspective of the father. We examined the impact of the child’s cancer on the father’s relationship with his spouse in Korea. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 fathers (mean age = 41.35 years; SD = 4.49) of children who were diagnosed with cancer before the age of 19 and were within 5 years of the diagnosis. The mean age of the child with cancer was 9.1 years (SD = 3.68), and the mean age at diagnosis was 6.4 years (SD = 4.08). The analysis of the interviews revealed the following four themes (and eight subthemes): conflicts between spouses (lack of father’s participation in caregiving, financial and work-related stress), mental suffering (heartbroken, torn between caregiving and work), change in communication (child-focused communication, avoiding communication), and change in the marital relationship (neglected relationship, new trust built in the relationship). A father’s increased conflict in the marital relationship after his child’s diagnosis of cancer was intensified by his limited involvement in child care and parenting responsibilities. An understanding of the change in the father’s relationship with his spouse can inform the development of a psychosocial intervention that may strengthen a father’s emotional intelligence and resilience, which could improve the marital relationship. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Child with cancer; Fathers; Qualitative research; South Korea; Spousal relationship","adult; case report; child; child care; child parent relation; diagnosis; emotional intelligence; father; female; human; interview; job stress; male; mental stress; preschool child; qualitative research; responsibility; South Korea; spouse; trust",2-s2.0-85028758160

This new framework requires taking into account some relevant aspects. (i) In the historical endeavor of building up AI and the Internet, minds and machines have interacted over the years and in many ways through the interrelation between scientific creativity and technological innovation. (ii) Philosophically, minds and machines can have epistemological, methodological and ontological differences, which are based on the distinct configuration of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Their comparison with rationality and its various forms is particularly relevant. (iii) Scientifically, AI and the Internet belong to the sciences of the artificial, because they work on designs that search for specific aims, following selected processes in order to achieve expected results. (iv) Technologically, AI and the Internet require the support of information and communication technologies (ICT). These have an instrumental role regarding the existence of AI and the Internet. Also ICT shape their diverse forms of configuration over the years. Within this framework, this paper offers a new context of analysis that goes beyond Simon’s and follows four main steps: (i) the interaction between scientific creativity and technological innovation as the philosophico-methodological setting for Artificial Intelligence and the Internet; (ii) artificial intelligence and human intelligence as epistemological basis for machines and minds, where the differences between artificial intelligence and human intelligence are made explicit (under the consideration of “computational intelligence”) and the analysis of minds and machines is made from the perspective of rationality (“symbolic rationality” and “adaptive rationality”); (iii) intention and its difference with design of machine learning are considered to distinguish human intelligence from artificial intelligence; and (iv) the internal and external aspects of artificial designs in contemporary society are considered through the perspective of rationality, which leads to the transition from intelligence to rationality in the Internet as well as to the historicity of information (how aims, processes, and results can be based on conceptual revolutions). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Contemporary; Design; Information; Intelligence; Machines; Minds; Rationality; Role; Sciences; Society","Design; Engineering education; Machining; Contemporary; Information; Intelligence; Minds; Rationality; Role; Sciences; Society; Artificial intelligence",2-s2.0-85021286626

Emotional intelligence as measured by the extent to which self-other agreement existed in the 360-degree survey ratings was explored as a key predictor of leadership quality in the potential leaders. Study Design: A non-experimental correlational survey design was implemented to assess the variation in leadership quality scores across the sample of potential leaders. A total of 63 of 86 (76%) of those invited to participate did so. All potential leaders received feedback from PMA Leadership, PMA Colleagues, and PMA Staff and were asked to complete self-ratings regarding their behavior. Results: Analyses of variance revealed a consistent pattern of results as Under-Estimators and Accurate Estimators-Favorable were rated significantly higher than Over-Estimators in several leadership behaviors. Conclusions: Emotional intelligence as conceptualized in this study was positively related to overall performance ratings of potential leaders. The ever-increasing roles and potential responsibilities for PMAs suggest that these organizations should consider multisource performance reviews as these potential future PMA executives rise through their organizations to assume leadership positions with profound potential impact on healthcare. The current findings support the notion that potential leaders who demonstrated a humble pattern or an accurate pattern of self-rating scored significantly higher in their leadership, teamwork, and interpersonal/communication skills than those with an aggrandizing self-rating. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","360-degree survey; Emotional intelligence; Leadership; Leadership development; Physician feedback; Physician-leaders; Professional medical association; PULSE 360; PULSE survey; Self-other agreement","adult; Article; community hospital; controlled study; correlational study; emotional intelligence; feedback system; female; health care personnel; health survey; human; interpersonal communication; leadership; male; medical society; middle aged; physician; priority journal; university hospital",2-s2.0-85007480700

However, despite little research focusing on Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in OCD, it has long been speculated that the disorder is associated with elevated intellectual capacity. The present meta-analytic study was, therefore, conducted to quantitatively summarize the literature on IQ in OCD systematically. We identified 98 studies containing IQ data among individuals with OCD and non-psychiatric comparison groups, and computed 108 effect sizes for Verbal IQ (VIQ, n = 55), Performance IQ (PIQ, n = 13), and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ, n = 40). Across studies, small effect sizes were found for FSIQ and VIQ, and a moderate effect size for PIQ, exemplifying reduced IQ in OCD. However, mean IQ scores across OCD samples were in the normative range. Moderator analyses revealed no significant moderating effect across clinical and demographic indices. We conclude that, although lower than controls, OCD is associated with normative FSIQ and VIQ, and relatively lowered PIQ. These results are discussed in light of neuropsychological research in OCD, and particularly the putative impact of reduced processing speed in this population.

Basically, it relies on an enhanced Multi-Region Modified Wind Driven Optimization (MR-MWDO) model and exhibits four main features. First, a multi-region approach is used to classify regions of the search space into promising and non-promising areas with accordance to low and high pressure regions in the natural model. Second, it uses an effective collision avoidance strategy to prevent collision between sub-populations. Third, it allows cost effective change detection. Fourth, it maintains two types of populations in order to achieve better balanced search. The proposed WD2O has been successfully applied to Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB) problem. An extensive experimental study has shown that WD2O outperforms significantly the first prototype MR-MWDO. Furthermore, it has shown very competitive results compared to state of the art methods and has achieved the best performance for high dimensional problems while keeping an appreciable time complexity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Change detection; Dynamic optimization problems; Moving peaks benchmark; Multi-population; Swarm intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Swarm intelligence; Change detection; Dynamic environments; Dynamic optimization problem (DOP); High pressure regions; High-dimensional problems; Moving peaks benchmarks; Multi population; State-of-the-art methods; Problem solving",2-s2.0-85017173685

Hence, there is a great requirement to have algorithms that could accurately classify Web pages. Automatic Web page classification is significantly different from traditional text classification because of the presence of additional information, provided by the HTML structure. Recently, several techniques have been arisen from combinations of artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. However, it is not a simple matter to find an optimal classification technique for Web pages. This paper introduces a novel strategy for vertical Web page classification, which is called Classification using Multi-layered Domain Ontology (CMDO). It employs several Web mining techniques, and depends mainly on proposed multi-layered domain ontology. In order to promote the classification accuracy, CMDO implies a distiller to reject pages related to other domains. CMDO also employs a novel classification technique, which is called Graph Based Classification (GBC). The proposed GBC has pioneering features that other techniques do not have, such as outlier rejection and pruning. Experimental results have shown that CMDO outperforms recent techniques as it introduces better precision, recall, and classification accuracy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Association rules; Classification; KNN; Naïve Bayes; Ontology; SVM","Artificial intelligence; Association rules; Graphic methods; Ontology; Semantic Web; Semantics; Text processing; Websites; Classification accuracy; Classification technique; Graph-based classifications; Optimal classification; Outlier rejection; Statistical approach; Text classification; Web page classification; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-84992365841

The link information-internet is analyzed from the perspective of the sciences of the artificial, to highlight aspects of this field that Herbert Simon did not consider. The analysis follows three steps: (1) the study of the development of Artificial Intelligence as the support of internet for communication processes. This analysis is made to clarify the new communicative designs. (2) The role creativity in the new communication designs is studied. In this regard, there is an interplay between the scientific creativity of human beings making designs and technological innovation of information and communication technologies. (3) The consideration of the transverse and longitudinal novelty that exist in the types of digital communication. They are based on AI built up as a science of the artificial. These types of novelty depend on the interaction between scientific creativity and technological innovation. A central aim of this paper on communication sciences from the perspective of sciences of design is to overcome Simon´s theoretical schemes. His view is mainly focused on structural complexity (holistic complexity and near decomposability). But communicative designs of the internet phenomena require the dynamic complexity. In addition, communication on the internet is based on an internal-external duality, which goes beyond Simon’s approach on the artificial. Thus, the analysis takes into account the new types of communication (such as social networks) and their different levels (micro, meso, and macro). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Artificial intelligence; Artificial sciences; Communication sciences; Information; Internet; Science of design","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Digital communication systems; Philosophical aspects; Artificial sciences; Digital communications; Information; Information and Communication Technologies; Philosophical approaches; Science of design; Structural complexity; Technological innovation; Internet",2-s2.0-85006459508

In such case, there may be authentic results among the pools of nominal candidates, and an alternative approach is to consider nominal candidates but are replicable across different samples. Here, we found that mRNA expression of the choline dehydrogenase gene (CHDH) was uniformly upregulated in the brains of bipolar disorder (BPD) patients compared with healthy controls across different studies. Follow-up genetic analyses of CHDH variants in multiple independent clinical datasets (including 11,564 cases and 17,686 controls) identified a risk SNP rs9836592 showing consistent associations with BPD (Pmeta = 5.72 × 10−4), and the risk allele indicated an increased CHDH expression in multiple neuronal tissues (lowest P = 6.70 × 10−16). These converging results may identify a nominal but true BPD susceptibility gene CHDH. Further exploratory analysis revealed suggestive associations of rs9836592 with childhood intelligence (P = 0.044) and educational attainment (P = 0.0039), a “proxy phenotype” of general cognitive abilities. Intriguingly, the CHDH gene is located at chromosome 3p21.1, a risk region implicated in previous BPD genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but CHDH is lying outside of the core GWAS linkage disequilibrium (LD) region, and our studied SNP rs9836592 is ∼1.2 Mb 3′ downstream of the previous GWAS loci (e.g., rs2251219) with no LD between them; thus, the association observed here is unlikely a reflection of previous GWAS signals. In summary, our results imply that CHDH may play a previously unknown role in the etiology of BPD and also highlight the informative value of integrating gene expression and genetic code in advancing our understanding of its biological basis. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bipolar disorder; CHDH; Cognitive ability; Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL); Gene expression; Genetic evidence","choline dehydrogenase; academic achievement; anterior cingulate; Article; bipolar disorder; CHDH gene; chromosome 3p; chromosome 3p21; controlled study; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; down regulation; gene expression regulation; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene location; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variation; genotyping technique; human; human tissue; intelligence quotient; major clinical study; neuropathology; quantitative trait locus; RNA sequence; single nucleotide polymorphism; upregulation",2-s2.0-84983491009

This adversarial nature makes security applications different from the classical machine learning problems; for instance, an adversary (attacker) might change the distribution of test data and violate the data stationarity, a common assumption in machine learning techniques. Since machine learning methods are not inherently adversary-aware, a classifier designer should investigate the robustness of a learning system under attack. In this respect, recent studies have modeled the identified attacks against machine learning-based detection systems. Based on this, a classifier designer can evaluate the performance of a learning system leveraging the modeled attacks. Prior research explored a gradient-based approach in order to devise an attack against a classifier with differentiable discriminant function like SVM. However, there are several powerful classifiers with non-differentiable decision boundary such as Random Forest, which are commonly used in different security domain and applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach to model an attack against classifiers with non-differentiable decision boundary. In the experimentation, we first present an example that visually shows the effect of a successful attack on the MNIST handwritten digits classification task. Then we conduct experiments for two well-known applications in the security domain: spam filtering and malware detection in PDF files. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack successfully evades Random Forest classifier and effectively degrades the classifier’s performance. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Discriminant function; Evasion attack; Machine learning; Security application; Surrogate classifier","Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Computer crime; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Function evaluation; Malware; Classification tasks; Discriminant functions; Evasion attack; Machine learning methods; Machine learning problem; Machine learning techniques; Random forest classifier; Security application; Learning systems",2-s2.0-85017466763

Intelligent transportation systems based on vehicular ad-doc network (VANET) communications will improve many services, expressively, related to transport, security, reliability, management and including the assistance in the reduction of traffic congestion. In this context, we propose an intelligent system based, firstly, on a new clustering technique to control and maintain the stability of routes during inter-vehicular communications, and secondly, a bio-inspired systematically conducting mobility measurement of agent, intervening in cases of traffic congestion, in order to find new routes to those offered by the global positioning system. Obviously, by providing an appropriate route selection process, such routing concept could be helpful in exchanging control messages to inform the nearest medics willing to give first aid and routing of another alert to the nearest ambulance.

Education scores were available for mothers and fathers; the majority of the parents had less than a high school education. GA scores were heteroscadistic with respect to mid-parent education, with reduced variability at higher levels of education. Both MZ and DZ twin correlations for GA were linearly and negatively related to mid-parent education, DZ twins substantially more so. When the model was extended to an ACE model consisting of standardized positive ACE variance components, the modification appeared to disappear. Further analysis revealed that this occurred because the steep decline of DZ twin correlations with increasing mid-parent education resulted in a violation of the classical twin model for much of the parameter space. Other phenomena that might result in large declines in DZ twin correlations are considered, along with implications for other studies of socioeconomic interactions with the heritability of GA in European samples. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gene by environment interaction; Intelligence; Military conscripts; Parental education","Article; cognition; dizygotic twins; education; educational status; heritability; histogram; human; male; monozygotic twins; Norwegian (people); parental education; socioeconomics",2-s2.0-85025823826

Furthermore, a learning model is employed to avoid an overwhelming number of interactions.

Undoubtedly, its prediction is one of the most challenging tasks in time series forecasting. Moreover existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches fail to provide encouraging results. Meanwhile advances in machine learning have presented favourable results for speech recognition, image classification and language processing. Methods applied in digital signal processing can be applied to stock data as both are time series. Similarly, learning outcome of this paper can be applied to speech time series data. Deep learning for stock prediction has been introduced in this paper and its performance is evaluated on Google stock price multimedia data (chart) from NASDAQ. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that deep learning can improve stock market forecasting accuracy.

It is found that the proposed method is performing better than the existing method RBFNN with an improved accuracy of 4.8% for Hit Rate with a window size of 20. Also the results of the proposed model are compared with the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and it is found that the accuracy for Hit Rate is improved by 15.6%.

This paper presents a biologically inspired scheme of collaborative mobile sensing. The proposal has been designed in such a way that the coverage, the energy efficiency and a high network availability are maintained. Social foraging behaviors of the Escherichia coli bacteria modeled in the bacterial foraging optimization have been used to achieve these goals, especially the chemotaxis and the swarming features that allow bacteria to move. After a description, a formalization of the problem of mobile sensing is presented. Then, models that allow mobile sinks to move in a self-organized and self-adaptive way is proposed.

In terms of network topology, this attribute even though generally thought as time-invariant it actually is time-dependent, as the paths in a water distribution network change over time based on the hydraulics in the network (water demand and water pressure/flow alter the way water flows in the piping network).

Signatures are analyzed at small fragments in which we seek to extract the patterns that an individual employs frequently as he writes. We exploit different features of writing like orientation, centroid and contour by computing a set of features from writing samples at different levels of observations. Orientation like intersecting point, edge point and gradient change of signature achieve great success in feature description. These features are extracted from the standard signature database and extracted features are trained and tested by machine learning (ML) approach.

When the network is large and policies are complicated, manual cross-check may be insufficient to detect anomalies. In this paper, an automated model based on machine learning and high performance computing methods is proposed for the detection of anomalies in firewall rule repository. To achieve this, firewall logs are analysed and the extracted features are fed to a set of machine learning classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, kNN, Decision Table and HyperPipes. F-measure, which combines precision and recall, is used for performance evaluation. In the experiments, kNN has shown the best performance. Then, a model based on the F-measure distribution was envisaged. 93 firewall rules were analysed via this model. The model anticipated that 6 firewall rules cause anomaly. These problematic rules were checked against the security reports prepared by experts and each of them are verified to be an anomaly. This paper shows that anomalies in firewall rules can be detected by analysing large scale log files automatically with machine learning methods, which enables avoiding security breaches, saving dramatic amount of expert effort and timely intervention. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Computer security; Firewall logs; Firewall rule; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Data mining; Decision tables; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Security of data; Security systems; Automated modeling; Firewall logs; Firewall rules; High performance computing; Large-scale network; Machine learning classification; Machine learning methods; Precision and recall; Network security",2-s2.0-85019615776

Under conditional operating rules, the operational parameters of reservoir target storage levels and their priority rankings were conditioned on the hydrologic state of the system in a priority-based water allocation scheme. The role of conditional operating rules and policies were evaluated by comparing water shortages associated with objective function values under unconditional and conditional operating rules.

With the high-speed development of the internet and information systems, some performance issues are certain to arise when the traditional CRFs deals with such massive data. This paper proposes SCRFs, which is a parallel optimization of CRFs based on the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) in the Spark computing framework. SCRFs optimizes the traditional CRFs from these stages: First, with all features are generated in parallel, the intermediate data which will be used frequently are all cached into the memory to speed up the iteration efficiency. By removing the low-frequency features of the model, SCRFs can also prevent the overfitting of the model to improve the prediction effect. Second, some specific features are dynamically added in parallel to correct the model in the training process. And for implementing the efficient prediction, a max-sum algorithm is proposed to infer the most likely state sequence by extending the belief propagation algorithm. Finally, we implement SCRFs base on the version of Spark 1.6.0, and evaluate its performance using two widely used benchmarks: Named Entity Recognition and Chinese Word Segmentation.

Considerable experimental and computational work suggests that the SFE itself is highly dependent—in a complex manner—on chemical composition and temperature. Over the past decades, there have been a large number of efforts focused on determining the composition dependence of SFE in austenitic steel alloys by means of experimental, theoretical or computational methods. Unfortunately, experimental methods suffer from the indirect nature of the methodologies used to estimate the value of SFE, while computational and/or theoretical approaches are either limited by the physics that they can incorporate into the predictions or have more practical limitations associated, for example, to the size of the systems that can be modeled or the assumptions that must be made. In this paper, we review the major experimental and computational approaches to determine SFE in austenitic steel alloys, and we discuss their limitations. We then demonstrate a data-driven machine learning technique to mine the literature of experimental SFE data in steels, while algorithms at the fore-front of machine learning have been used to visualize the SFE data and then construct a three-class classifier. The classifier is used then to predict likely secondary deformation mechanisms of untested compositions, while the classifier itself is presented as a valuable tool for the further development of austenitic steel alloys in which the specific secondary plastic deformation mechanisms are a feature to design for. The data as well as the entire analysis workflow are made available to the wider community through a public github repository. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Artificial intelligence; Austenite; Austenitic steel; Computational methods; Forecasting; Learning systems; Supercritical fluid extraction; Chemical compositions; Composition dependence; Computational approach; Deformation mechanism; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Plastic deformation mechanisms; Stacking fault energies; Alloy steel",2-s2.0-85020724030

Early detection of those classes of a software which are prone to change is critical for software developers and project managers as it can aid in efficient resource allocation of limited resources. Moreover, change prone classes should be efficiently restructured and designed to prevent introduction of defects. Recently, use of search based techniques and their hybridized counter-parts have been advocated in the field of software engineering predictive modeling as these techniques help in identification of optimal solutions for a specific problem by testing the goodness of a number of possible solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for change prediction using search-based techniques and hybridized techniques. Further, we address the following issues: (i) low repeatability of empirical studies, (ii) less use of statistical tests for comparing the effectiveness of models, and (iii) non-assessment of trade-off between runtime and predictive performance of various techniques. This paper presents an empirical validation of search-based techniques and their hybridized versions, which yields unbiased, accurate and repeatable results. The study analyzes and compares the predictive performance of five search-based, five hybridized techniques and four widely used machine learning techniques and a statistical technique for predicting change prone classes in six application packages of a popular operating system for mobile—Android.

A popular variation of the problem of HUI mining is to discover high average-utility itemsets (HAUIs), where an alternative measure called the average-utility is used to evaluate the utility of itemsets by considering their lengths. Albeit, HAUI mining has been studied extensively, current algorithms often consume a large amount of memory and have long execution times, due to the large search space and the usage of loose upper bounds to estimate the average-utilities of itemsets. In this paper, we present a more efficient algorithm for HAUI mining, which includes three pruning strategies to provide a tighter upper bound on the average-utilities of itemsets, and thus reduce the search space more effectively to decrease the runtime. The first pruning strategy utilizes relationships between item pairs to reduce the search space for itemsets containing three or more items. The second pruning strategy provides a tighter upper bound on the average-utilities of itemsets to prune unpromising candidates early. The third strategy reduces the time for constructing the average-utility-list structures for itemsets, which is used to calculate their upper bounds. Substantial experiments conducted on both real-life and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm with three pruning strategies can efficiently and effectively reduce the search space for mining HAUIs, when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, in terms of runtime, number of candidates, memory usage, performance of the pruning strategies and scalability. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Data mining; High average-utility itemsets; Pruning strategies; Tighter upper bound","Artificial intelligence; Average utilities; High utility itemsets; Item sets; Pruning strategy; State-of-the-art algorithms; Synthetic datasets; Transactional database; Upper Bound; Data mining",2-s2.0-85014957800

Measuring levels of performance over time is difficult, and obtaining accurate measures in real time is problematic; thus, reactive measures to address loss of performance are also problematic. The ability to predict service performance can be viewed as an important added-value, one that can help users or third-part applications select the proper online service provider. With this aim in view, we have designed a measurement system and deployed it in eleven provinces and cities in China to monitor two popular websites, Youku and Tudou. The analysis indicates that the performance trend of these two service providers followed daily changing patterns, such as rush hour traffic and lower service workloads at midnight; this is consistent with user behaviors. It was also confirmed that the future performance was related to the historical records. Based on these findings, we have decided to investigate the use of modified time series models to forecast the performance of such video services. Meanwhile, some machine learning models are implemented and compared as baseline models, such as Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree. In addition, a hybrid model, which is generated by combining different machine learning models, is also studied as the baseline. An investigation shows that time series models are much more suitable to this prediction problem than baseline models in most situations. To alleviate the data sparseness problem in training the predictor, a new predictor that combines different information sources is proposed, thus improving prediction precision. Furthermore, the predictor is quite stable, and we have discovered that the average performance estimation is more accurate if the model is updated within 2–3 days, which is useful in some applications, e.g., video source analysis and recommendation systems. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Performance analysis; Performance prediction; Time-series models; Video service provider","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Decision trees; Forecasting; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Neural networks; Time series; Time series analysis; Data sparseness problem; Machine learning models; Performance analysis; Performance estimation; Performance prediction; Third party application (Apps); Time series models; Video service providers; Internet service providers",2-s2.0-85014593085

Clipping noise in the OFDM system is introduced either by transmitter non-linearity or due to the low power sensitivity of the receiver. However the clipping noise in the DCO-OFDM is also dependent upon the DC bias applied to make the bipolar OFDM signal unipolar. The addition of this extra DC bias increases the average signal power of the DCO-OFDM signal. The non-linearity of the DFB laser increases with the optical modulation index, which gives rise to intermodulation and harmonic distortions at the receiver. The OFDM signal when transmitted through the Single Mode Fiber (SMF) suffers from group—velocity dispersion (GVD) which limits its performance in the Passive Optical Networks (PON). In this paper, an assessment of the DC bias to reduce the clipping noise in the two systems under consideration is performed. A practical laser model is considered and analysis is performed to estimate the average laser drive power to maintain its non-linearities within a tolerable region for both the OFDM systems. A simulation is performed to transmit 5 and 8 Gb/s (ACO and DCO) OFDM signal over 120 km SMF where the effect of GVD is taken into consideration. An optimum OFDM drive signal power is calculated to maintain the laser transmitter in its linear region such that the effect of second order harmonic distortions (HD2) and third order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) is low. The SNR requirement of DCO-OFDM being higher than the ACO-OFDM leads to more clipping noise, HD2 and IMD3. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ACO-OFDM and DCO-OFDM; Intensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD); Intermodulation and distortion; Laser nonlinearities; Optical millimeter wave generation; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","Artificial intelligence; Dispersion (waves); Distributed feedback lasers; Frequency division multiplexing; Harmonic distortion; Intermodulation; Millimeter waves; Multiplexing; Optical fiber communication; Optical transmitters; Passive optical networks; Signal to noise ratio; Single mode fibers; Transmitters; Analytical investigations; Average signal power; Intensity modulated direct detections; Laser transmitters; Optical millimeter-wave generation; Optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Third order intermodulation distortion; Velocity dispersion; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",2-s2.0-85018853317

The proposed system provides forecasted truck arrival rates to the nodes and predicted truck gate waiting times at the nodes to the truck companies based on historical data, economic and environmental impact factors.

This is necessary as it is important to maintain glucose levels at appropriate values to avoid not only short-term, but also long-term complications of the illness. Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning techniques in particular have already lead to promising results in modeling and predicting glucose concentrations. In this work, several machine learning techniques are used for the modeling and prediction of glucose concentrations using as inputs the values measured by a continuous monitoring glucose system as well as also previous and estimated future carbohydrate intakes and insulin injections. In particular, we use the following four techniques: genetic programming, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and grammatical evolution. We propose two new enhanced modeling algorithms for glucose prediction, namely (i) a variant of grammatical evolution which uses an optimized grammar, and (ii) a variant of tree-based genetic programming which uses a three-compartment model for carbohydrate and insulin dynamics. The predictors were trained and tested using data of ten patients from a public hospital in Spain. We analyze our experimental results using the Clarke error grid metric and see that 90% of the forecasts are correct (i.e., Clarke error categories A and B), but still even the best methods produce 5 to 10% of serious errors (category D) and approximately 0.5% of very serious errors (category E).

We identify an ‘innovation paradox’ in that the very point in the business cycle, when legislators are tempted to view austerity as a cure for economic downturns and to reduce innovation spend, is when an increase is most needed to create new industries and jobs and innovate out of recession or depression. It is both desirable and possible that policymakers resist the urge to capitulate to the innovation paradox. During periods that exhibit subdued inflation, elevated spare productive capacity, and low government borrowing rates, governments should increase their borrowings and use the proceeds to boost investment targeted towards innovation. We show how the State of California successfully utilized debt financing, traditionally reserved for physical infrastructure projects, to stimulate the development of intellectual infrastructure. Finally, we recommend a halt to European austerity policies and a ‘triple helix’ broadening of narrow ‘smart specialization’ policies that chase a private venture capital chimera. Europe should seize the present macroeconomic opportunity of low interest rates, borrow for innovation and be paid back manifold by ‘picking winners’, similarly to what the USA has been doing through DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) with GPS, as a response to Sputnik, the Internet and artificial intelligence, or the driverless car, formerly known as the ‘autonomous land vehicle’ in its military guise.

This paper undertakes a survey of the usage of the word buddhi (“intellect”) in general Sanskrit literature from its earliest late Vedic occurrences up to the middle of the first millennium CE. Signifying fundamentally “awareness (of something),” the word “buddhi” is shown to refer often to a being’s persisting capacity or faculty of awareness (“attentiveness, mind, intelligence,” etc.) and also, often, to the content of a being’s awareness (“idea, notion, thought, disposition, resolution,” etc.). There are also instances where it is hard to determine which of these two kinds of reference are intended in our written sources, and there are other instances where both senses seem present simultaneously. Various examples attest to the use of the word to refer to an affective and volitional capacity in a being—and to affective and volitional content—as well as to a cognitive faculty and cognitive content. One feature that occurs frequently in the word’s use is that this faculty and, or, its content, regularly describe alterations of a subject’s knowledge of the surrounding situation, the transformation of surrounding complexity or multiplicity into a simpler and more manageable mental construct—an understanding, an interpretation, a decision, a plan, etc. As the word buddhi is related to the primary Sanskrit word-family used to describe the concrete experience of awakening—moving from no (or little, or muddled) awareness to clear awareness—it is not surprising that its more abstract usage would often incorporate a similar dynamic, a transition from less clear to more clear knowledge, a rendering of early knowledge to better and more useful knowledge, in short, a faculty of “intellect” that produces refined decisions, resolutions, and determinations. It is suggested that this element of its semantic profile contributed to the word’s eventually becoming the preferred word for the most important of the mental functions of beings in one of the most widespread philosophical psychologies of ancient India, that which ultimately became formally enshrined in the philosophical system “Sāṃkhya.”. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","adhyātma; Awakening; Awareness; buddhi; Intellect; manas; Mind; Sāṃkhya; Understanding; Volition",,2-s2.0-85020267861

The investigations were carried out in the classroom during a stress condition (final exams) and non-stress condition (without any exam). In the whole sample, the condition with exam was associated with higher cortisol and lower testosterone concentrations in saliva compared to the condition without exam. The activity of salivary alpha-amylase increased at the end of the exam. Anxious children showed higher concentrations of aldosterone and lower activity of alpha-amylase compared to children with low trait anxiety. Cortisol levels were higher in anxious children in the first morning samples before starting the lessons. Children with high and low trait anxiety did not differ in extraversion, neuroticism, as well as non-verbal intelligence and school success. Thus, the anxious children at school showed a more rapid decrease of anticipatory stress-induced cortisol concentrations, higher aldosterone levels, and lower alpha-amylase activities compared to non-anxious children.

Despite the fact that the scientific understanding of biological self-consciousness is still in preliminary stage, we make our efforts to integrate and adopt known biological findings of self-consciousness to build a brain-inspired model for robot self-consciousness. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired robot bodily self model based on extensions to primate mirror neuron system and apply it to humanoid robot for self recognition. In this model, the robot firstly learns the correlations between self-generated actions and visual feedbacks in motion by learning with spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP), and then learns the appearance of body part with the expectation that the visual feedback is consistent with its motion. Based on this model, the robot uses multisensory integration to learn its own body in real world and in mirror. Then it can distinguish itself from others. In a mirror test setting with three robots with the same appearance, with the proposed brain-inspired robot bodily self model, each of them can recognize itself in the mirror after these robots make random movements at the same time.

Technology infiltrates in ordinary things, hitching intelligence and materializing smart systems. Each of these individual entities monitors a specific set of parameters and deduces a constrained local view of the surrounding environment. Many distributed devices exchange information in order to infer the real system state and achieve a consistent global view. However, conflicts may arise due to the integration of deficit pieces of local knowledge. Robust and efficient conflict resolution is essential, especial in cases of emergency where the system must contribute with timely and accurate data to the overall crisis management operation. In this paper, we present AmbISPDM – a formal framework for the management of embedded systems with a coherent conflict resolution mechanism. The process is implemented as a software agent’s reasoning behaviour and applied in the multi-agent domain.

Among the machine learning algorithms, one-class naïve Bayes (ONENB) has been shown to be effective when it is applied to anomaly tests; however, there have been few studies on applying the ONENB algorithm to keystroke dynamics-based authentication. We applied the ONENB algorithm to calculate the likelihood of attributes in keystroke dynamics data. Additionally, we propose the speed inspection in typing skills (SITS) algorithm designed from the observation that every person has a different typing speed on specific keys. These specific characteristics, also known as the keystroke’s index order, can be used as essential patterns for authentication systems to distinguish between a genuine user and imposter. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the SITS algorithm and examine the quality of each attribute type (e.g., dwell time and flight time), we investigated the influence of attribute types on the keystroke’s index order. From the experimental results of the proposed algorithms and their combination, we observed that the shortest/longest time attributes and separation of the attributes are useful for enhancing the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Duration feature ranking; Keystroke dynamics; One-class naïve Bayes; User authentication","Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Dynamics; Learning systems; Authentication systems; Essential patterns; Feature ranking; Keystroke dynamics; Specific keys; Typing behaviors; Typing speed; User authentication; Learning algorithms",2-s2.0-85028327760

It can work with a large amount of categorical data. It represents its structure as a sparser graph, while maintaining a high likelihood, by producing an adjacent weight matrix, where relationships are expressed by conditional independences. By maximizing the likelihood indicates that the model fits better to the data under the assumption that the observed data are the most likely data. The whole approach was implemented in a business intelligence problem of evaluating the attractiveness of Belgian companies. Through the analysis of results and conducted scenarios, the usefulness of the proposed MGM method for designing FCM capable to make decisions, is demonstrated. Comparisons with the previous known methodology for automatic construction of FCMs based on distance-based algorithm, showed that the proposed approach provides more understandable/useful relationships among nodes, through a less complex structure for making decisions. © 2017 IEEE.","Fuzzy cognitive map; Graph-based methods; Mixed graphical model; Ordinal data","Cognitive systems; Covariance matrix; Design; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Graphic methods; Large scale systems; Matrix algebra; Speech recognition; Automatic construction; Conditional independences; Distance based algorithm; Fuzzy cognitive map; Graph-based methods; GraphicaL model; Ordinal data; Structure estimation; Structural design",2-s2.0-85030157503

However, a gap can be observed between the communities detected by many data analytics algorithms on OSN, and effective groups existing in real life: The detected communities often lack of meaning and internal semantic cohesion. Most of existing literature on OSN either focuses on the community detection problem in graphs without considering the topic of the messages exchanged, or concentrates exclusively on the messages without taking into account the social links. In this article, we support the hypothesis that communities extracted on OSN should be topically coherent. We therefore propose a model to represent the interaction between users on Twitter, the reference on micro-blogging OSN, and metrics to evaluate the topical cohesion of the detected communities. As an evaluation, we measure the topical cohesion of the groups of users detected by a baseline community detection algorithm, using two measures inspired from the classification domain, and one measure inspired from the NLP domain.

Organizations have launched many initiatives to accomplish adequate and timely decision support as an important factor to achieve and sustain competitive advantage. Given today’s turbulent environments it is increasingly challenging to bridge the gap between establishing a long-term strategy and quickly adopting to the dynamics in market competition. BI must address this field of tension as it was originally used to retrospectively reflect an organization’s performance and build upon stability and efficiency. This study aims to understand and achieve an agile BI from a dynamic capability perspective. Therefore, we investigate how dynamic BI capabilities, i.e., adoption of assets, market understanding, and intimacy as well as business operations, impact the agility of BI. Starting from a literature review of dynamic capabilities in information systems and BI, we propose hypotheses to connect dynamic BI capabilities with the agility to provide information. The derived hypotheses were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling on data collected in a questionnaire-based survey. The results show that the lens of dynamic capabilities provides useful means to foster BI agility. The study identifies that technological advancements like in-memory technology seem to be a technology enabler for BI agility. However, an adequate adoption and integration of BI assets as well as the focus on market orientation and business operations are crucial to reach BI agility. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany","Agility; Business intelligence; Dynamic capabilities",,2-s2.0-85027834008

We explore this by discussing the impact of the human-in-the-loop, the potential for using abstraction and distributed computing to further privacy goals, and an approach for determining when video footage should be hidden from human users. We propose that in an ideal surveillance scenario, a privacy-affirming framework causes collected camera footage to be processed by computers directly, and never shown to humans.

To achieve this effectively requires less widely studied capabilities such as spatio-temporal reasoning about people identities and locations within a space partially observed by multiple cameras over an extended time period. To bridge this gap between research and required capabilities, we propose a new dataset LIMA that encompasses the challenges of monitoring a typical home / office environment. LIMA contains 4.5 hours of RGB-D video from three cameras monitoring a four room house. To reflect the challenges of a realistic practical application, the dataset includes clothes changes and visitors to ensure the global reasoning is a realistic open-set problem. In addition to raw data, we provide identity annotation for benchmarking, and tracking results from a contemporary RGB-D tracker - thus allowing focus on the higher level monitoring problems. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cameras; Computer vision; Higher order statistics; Pattern recognition; Target tracking; Video cameras; Cameras monitoring; Health monitoring; Long term monitoring; Multi-camera tracking; Multiple cameras; Re identifications; Spatio-temporal reasoning; Video surveillance systems; Security systems",2-s2.0-85030234826

These stakeholders include mobile users, mobile service operators and cloud service providers. Assorted challenges are also there for the implementation of mobile cloud computing but security and privacy are the dominant concerns. In order to achieve security and privacy of the said system several attempts are taken up. As the underlying system is complex and more prone against security threats, therefore strong authentication and privacy preserving schemes are desired. Three factor biometrics based authentication schemes are considered more secure for such huge and complex systems. Moreover, computational intelligence is getting popular nowadays for designing more vigorous and reliable biometrics based authentication schemes. Very recently, Tsai and Lo proposed an identity based authentication scheme for distributed mobile cloud computing environments. They claimed to achieve single sign on authentication for multiple service providers. Furthermore, they emphasized the usefulness and security of their scheme. However, the analysis in this paper shows that Tsai and Lo’s scheme is insecure against server forgery attack. It is proved that any adversaries having knowledge of just public parameters can forge as a valid service provider. Then an improved scheme is proposed to mitigate the security weakness.

The operation of CSOs (most often in heavy rainfall conditions) prevents houses and businesses from flooding. However, sometimes, CSOs do not operate as they should, potentially bringing environmental pollution risks. Therefore, CSOs should be appropriately managed by water utilities, highlighting the need for adapted decision support systems. This paper proposes an automated CSO predictive model construction methodology using field monitoring data, as a substitute for the commonly established hydrological-hydraulic modeling approach for time-series prediction of CSO statuses. It is a systematic methodology factoring in all monitored field variables to construct time-series dependencies for CSO statuses. The model construction process is largely automated with little human intervention, and the pertinent variables together with their associated time lags for every CSO are holistically and automatically generated. A fast least absolute shrinkage and selection operator solution generating scheme is proposed to expedite the model construction process, where matrix inversions are effectively eliminated. The whole algorithm works in a stepwise manner, invoking either an incremental or decremental movement for including or excluding one model regressor into, or from, the predictive model at every step. The computational complexity is thereby analyzed with the pseudo code provided. Actual experimental results from both single-step ahead (i.e., 15 min) and multistep ahead predictions are finally produced and analyzed on a U.K. pilot area with various types of monitoring data made available, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The aim of this study was to predict the magnitude of the neurocognitive and hearing deficits associated with proton and photon RT for children with brain tumors. The existing RT plans for 50 children treated with photon intensity modulated RT were compared with generated intensity modulated proton RT plans. The proton and photon RT dose distribution was used to estimate the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) via a Monte Carlo model and the probability of hearing loss per ear, based on previously published dose-risk relationships. Compared to photon plans, the mean brain dose was found to be reduced in all proton plans, translating into a gain of (Formula presented.) IQ points for the whole cohort at 5 years post-RT for dose regimens of 54 Gy, or (Formula presented.) IQ points for dose regimens of 59.4 Gy, where the errors shown represent statistical and systematic uncertainties. The probability of hearing loss ≥20 dB per ear was less for proton versus photon RT: overall (9 ± 4) versus (17 ± 6)%, respectively, based on dose regimens of 54 Gy, and (13 ± 5) versus (23 ± 9)% for dose regimens of 59.4 Gy.

The optimization of the aggregated cost of a network of cost functions arises in a variety of problems including Weighted Constraint Programs (WCSPs), Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP), as well as optimization in stochastic variants such as the tasks of finding the most probable explanation (MPE) in belief networks. Inference-based algorithms are powerful techniques for solving discrete optimization problems, which can be used independently or in combination with other techniques. However, their applicability is often limited by their compute intensive nature and their space requirements. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a novel inference-based technique, which exploits modern massively parallel architectures, such as those found in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to speed up the resolution of exact and approximated inference-based algorithms for discrete optimization. The paper studies the proposed algorithm in both centralized and distributed optimization contexts. The paper demonstrates that the use of GPUs provides significant advantages in terms of runtime and scalability, achieving up to two orders of magnitude in speedups and showing a considerable reduction in execution time (up to 345 times faster) with respect to a sequential version. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","(A)DPOP; (Mini-)bucket elimination; DCOP; GPU; MPE; WCSP","Constrained optimization; Cost functions; Graphics processing unit; Inference engines; Parallel architectures; Problem solving; Program processors; Stochastic systems; (A)DPOP; Bucket eliminations; DCOP; Discrete optimization problems; Distributed constraint optimizations; Exact and approximate inferences; Graphical processing unit (GPUs); WCSP; Optimization",2-s2.0-85027849497

Thus, we evaluated mediation by fluid reasoning in a longitudinal sample of 163 youth (45% female) with (n = 52) or without (n = 111) ID who were followed prospectively from age 5 to age 13. At age 9, youth completed the Arithmetic subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, a measure of fluid reasoning. At ages 9 and 13, mothers and teachers separately rated youth ADHD symptoms and mothers completed a diagnostic interview. Mediation was tested via path analysis with bootstrapped confidence intervals, and moderated mediation estimated whether indirect effects differed between ID and TD youth or based on youth IQ. Controlling for demographic factors and age 9 ADHD symptoms, age 9 Arithmetic mediated birth weight and multi-method/informant age 13 ADHD symptoms, such that birth weight positively predicted Arithmetic, which negatively predicted ADHD symptoms. Neither ID status nor IQ moderated the observed indirect effect through Arithmetic, suggesting that it was similar for ID and TD youth as well as across the range of youth IQs. These findings support previous evidence that fluid reasoning, as measured by Arithmetic, may causally mediate birth weight and ADHD symptoms, and suggest that this pathway operates similarly with respect to the development of ADHD symptoms in youth with ID. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","ADHD; Birth weight; Fluid reasoning; Intellectual disability; Mediation",,2-s2.0-85027692832

Generally, the first step to discover anomalies is a data representation method which reduces dimensionality as well as preserves key information. Anomaly detection based on real-value representation methods is meaningful for its convenience in numeric operation. A typical real-value representation method is the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) that is simple and intuitive by capturing mean values of segments in a sequence. However, if segments are same or similar in their average values but different in their oscillation amplitudes, the PAA method is ineffective to describe a sequence composed of such segments. To address this issue, we propose a representation method called the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation in the Amplitude Domain (AD-PAA). For discovering anomalies, a sequence is partitioned into subsequences by a sliding window firstly. Then in the AD-PAA method, a subsequence is divided into equal size subsections according to the amplitude domain. With mean values of subsections computed, the amplitude oscillation of a subsequence is embodied effectively. When the AD-PAA method is applied to approximate subsequences, the AD-PAA representation of a sequence is constructed. Anomalies are determined by anomaly scores that are based on similarities among representation results. Experimental results on various data confirm that the proposed method is more accurate than the PAA based method and other comparison methods. The ability to differentiate anomalies of the proposed algorithm is also superior. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Anomaly detection; Anomaly score; Data representation; Sequences","Artificial intelligence; Amplitude oscillation; Anomaly detection; Anomaly score; Data representations; Oscillation amplitude; Piecewise aggregate approximation; Representation method; Sequences; Aggregates",2-s2.0-85028561719

This procedure is highly inefficient, time consuming, and may result in disproportionately high correction costs to meet existing service level agreements. However, enterprise applications nowadays excessively make use of standard software that is shipped by large software vendors to a wide range of customers. Therefore, an application similar to the one whose capacity is being planned may already be in production state and constantly produce log data as part of application performance monitoring facilities. In this paper, we demonstrate how potential capacity planning service providers can leverage the dissemination effects of standard software by applying machine learning techniques on measurement data from various running enterprise applications. Utilizing prediction models that were trained on a large scale of monitoring data enables cost-efficient measurement-based prediction techniques to be used in early design phases. Therefore, we integrate knowledge discovery activities into well-known capacity planning steps, which we adapt to the special characteristics of enterprise applications.

This research applies artificial intelligence to explore several questions. What viewing features span media and devices? What are the viewer attitude models inherent in those features? What are the functions and rules driving the model? Can these be converted into knowledge, and can new hypotheses be obtained from this knowledge? For this, the technologies of natural language processing, neural network, and automated reasoning are applied. From data sequences including property amounts representing viewing attitudes, we visualize time-series feature patterns and extract a state space model driving these features and logical rules between the variables.

Due to increase in mobility and automation of activities within enterprises, huge amounts of data are rapidly generated than they could be instantaneously utilized in heterogeneous, intra or inter-organisational business processes. Many of the developing countries’ small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are faced with challenges of accessing intelligent information for decision making at different operational sites. SMEs in developing countries are paying a huge business opportunity cost by not utilizing mobile business intelligence (MBI) systems. This is as a result of a general lack of MBI framework to inform the deployment of MBI solutions in developing countries’ SMEs. This study proposes a framework for the deployment of MBI in developing countries’ SMEs.

At the same time, online travel review (OTR) websites have grown significantly, allowing users to post their travel experiences, opinions, comments, and ratings in a structured way. Moreover, Internet search engines play a crucial role in locating and presenting OTRs before and throughout a trip. This evolution of social media and information and communication technologies has upset the classic sources of information of the projected tourist destination image (TDI), allowing electronic word-of-mouth to occupy a prominent position. Hence, the aim of this paper is to propose a method based on big data technologies for analysing and measuring the perceived (and transmitted) TDI from OTRs as presented in search engines, emphasising the cognitive, spatial, temporal, evaluative, and affective TDI dimensions. To test this approach, a massive analysis of metadata processed by search engines was performed on 387,414 TripAdvisor OTRs on 'Things to Do' in Ile de France, an outstanding smart tourist destination.

However, the performance of SVM can be adversely affected by poorly selected parameter values. Current approaches to SVM parameter selection mainly rely on extensive cross validation or anecdotal information, which can be inefficient and ineffective. In this research, we propose an efficient algorithm called Percentile-SVM (P-SVM) for selecting the parameter pair, (γ, C), of SVM with Gaussian kernels on metric data. P-SVM searches only a handful of percentiles of the squared Euclidean distances of data points to select the best pair of parameter values. To validate the algorithm, we applied P-SVM to categorizing business intelligence factors extracted from 6,859 sentences of 231 online news articles about four major companies in the information technology sector. The results show that P-SVM achieved a significant improvement in precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC over the LibSVM package (with default parameter values) used in WEKA, a widely used data mining software.

It is imperative to understand not only the consequences, but also the drivers of effective and efficient collaboration. In this study, we attempt to show how varying levels of collaboration impact service level and how cloud computing fosters these levels of collaboration. We introduce a framework detailing how cloud computing impacts three levels of collaboration: (1) information centralisation, (2) vendor managed inventory and continuous replenishment programmes and (3) business intelligence (BI) collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment. In addition, we use multi-agent-based simulation to analyse how each level of collaboration (enhanced through cloud computing) impacts service level as measured by fill rate. Obtained results show that cloud computing can enhance all three levels of collaboration. Further, our results demonstrate that BI collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment have significantly greater service level benefits in comparison to other collaboration levels. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cloud computing; collaboration; fill rate; service level; simulation","Cloud computing; Supply chains; collaboration; Collaborative planning , forecasting and replenishments; Fill rate; Levels of collaborations; Multi agent based simulations; Service levels; simulation; Vendor managed Inventory; Multi agent systems",2-s2.0-84992366087

Some pre-alarm signals that indicate a potential financial crisis exist when a firm faces a default risk. Early studies on corporate bankruptcy prediction include parametric and nonparametric approaches, such as artificial intelligence (AI), for detecting pre-alarm signals. Among nonparametric techniques, the methods involving support vector machine (SVM) have shown potential in predicting corporate bankruptcy. We propose a hybrid method that combines data depths and nonlinear SVM for the prediction of corporate bankruptcy. We employed data depth functions to condense multivariate financial data with nonlinear and non-normal characteristics into one-dimensional space. The SVM method was introduced to classify the data points on a depth versus depth plot (DD-plot). Based on data set that records failed and non-failed manufacturing firms in Korea over 10 years, the empirical results demonstrated that the proposed method offers a higher level of accuracy in corporate bankruptcy prediction than existing methods. The proposed method is expected to provide a guidance in corporate investing for investors or other interested parties. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Artificial neural network; Bankruptcy prediction; Classification model; Data depth; DD-plot; Support vector machine","Classification (of information); Finance; Forecasting; Neural networks; Risk assessment; Bankruptcy prediction; Classification models; Data depth; DD-plot; Manufacturing firms; Non-parametric techniques; Normal characteristics; Parametric and non-parametric approaches; Support vector machines",2-s2.0-85026845323

The development of multimedia computing and artificial intelligence technologies support intelligent sport video analysis to add live video broadcast, score detection, highlight video generation, and online sharing functions to the intelligent arena applications. In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning based video analysis scheme for intelligent basketball arena applications. First of all, with multiple cameras or mobile devices capturing the activities in arena, the proposed scheme can automatically select the camera to give high-quality broadcast in real-time. Furthermore, with basketball energy image based deep conventional neural network, we can detect the scoring clips as the highlight video reels to support the wonderful actions replay and online sharing functions. Finally, evaluations on a built real-world basketball match dataset demonstrate that the proposed system can obtain 94.59% accuracy with only less than 45ms processing time (i.e., 10ms broadcast camera selection, and 35ms for scoring detection) for each frame. As the outstanding performance, the proposed deep learning based basketball video analysis scheme is implemented into a commercial intelligent basketball arena application named “Standz Basketball”.

To explore functions of different categories of microorganisms is a fundamental work in biological studies, which can assist biologists and related scientists to get to know more properties, habits and characteristics of these tiny but obbligato living beings. However, taxonomy of microorganisms (microorganism classification) is traditionally investigated through morphological, chemical or physical analysis, which is time and money consuming. In order to overcome this, since the 1970s innovative content-based microscopic image analysis (CBMIA) approaches are introduced to microbiological fields. CBMIA methods classify microorganisms into different categories using multiple artificial intelligence approaches, such as machine vision, pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, because CBMIA approaches are semi- or full-automatic computer-based methods, they are very efficient and labour cost saving, supporting a technical feasibility for microorganism classification in our current big data age. In this article, we review the development history of microorganism classification using CBMIA approaches with two crossed pipelines. In the first pipeline, all related works are grouped by their corresponding microorganism application domains. By this pipeline, it is easy for microbiologists to have an insight into each special application domain and find their interested applied CBMIA techniques. In the second pipeline, the related works in each application domain are reviewed by time periods. Using this pipeline, computer scientists can see the dynamic of technological development clearly and keep up with the future development trend in this interdisciplinary field. In addition, the frequently-used CBMIA methods are further analysed to find technological common points and potential reasons. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Classifier design; Content-based microscopic image analysis; Feature extraction; Microorganism classification","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Chemical analysis; Classification (of information); Compensation (personnel); Feature extraction; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Microorganisms; Pattern recognition; Pipelines; Wages; Classifier design; Computer scientists; Computer-based methods; Development history; Interdisciplinary fields; Microscopic image analysis; Special applications; Technological development; Image analysis",2-s2.0-85026788167

A key feature of DEL is that possibilities in an agent’s belief can be represented by a Kripke model. This study addresses two difficulties in applying DEL to a legal case. First, since there are several methods for constructing a Kripke model, our question is how we can construct the model from a legal case. Second, since this study employs several dynamic operators, our question is how we can decide which operators are to be applied for belief/reliability change of a judge. In order to solve these difficulties, we have implemented a computer system which provides two functions. First, the system can generate a Kripke model from a legal case. Second, the system provides an inconsistency solving algorithm which can automatically perform several operations in order to reduce the effort needed to decide which operators are to be applied.

Industry 4.0 and the corresponding industrial Internet of Things are about to generate new waves of process-related data, next to the abundance of event data already present in enterprise systems. However, organizations often fail to convert such data into strategic and tactical intelligence. This is due to the lack of dedicated technologies that are tailored to effectively manage the information on processes encoded in process models and process execution records. Process-related information is a core organizational asset which requires dedicated analytics to unlock its full potential. This paper proposes a framework for devising process querying methods, i.e., techniques for the (automated) management of repositories of designed and executed processes, as well as models that describe relationships between processes. The framework is composed of generic components that can be configured to create a range of process querying methods. The motivation for the framework stems from use cases in the field of Business Process Management. The design of the framework is informed by and validated via a systematic literature review. The framework structures the state of the art and points to gaps in existing research.

The objective is to find an online strategy such that at least one of the agents finds a route from the initial location O to a given destination D with minimum total cost. We focus on the case where communication among the agents is limited in the sense that some travelers can both send and receive information while the others can only receive information. We formalize the definition of agents’ intelligence by specifying three levels. We introduce two online strategies which utilize higher levels of agents’ intelligence to provide updated lower bounds to this problem.

As one of the most typical decision-making problems, medical diagnosis is used to analyze the relationship between symptoms and diseases according to uncertain and inconsistent information. It is essential to investigate the structure of a set of records on different levels such that similar patients can be treated concurrently within a group. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm in a neutrosophic recommender system for medical diagnosis. First, we define new algebraic structures for the system such as lattices, De Morgan algebra, Kleen algebra, MV algebra, BCK algebra, Stone algebra, and Brouwerian algebra. Based on these algebraic structures, we construct a neutrosophic recommender similarity matrix and a neutrosophic recommender equivalence matrix. A consecutive series of compositions between the neutrosophic recommender similarity matrices is performed to obtain the neutrosophic recommender equivalence matrix. From this matrix, a λ-cutting matrix is defined to conduct clustering among the neutrosophic recommender systems. Regarding the values of clustering validity indices, the Davies-Bouldin (DB) of the proposed method is approximately 20% better than those of the methods of Sahin (Neutrosophic Sets and Systems. 2014;2:18–24), Ye (J Intell Syst. 2014;23(4):379–89), and Ye (Soft Computing 2016;1–7). Analogously, the IFV and simplified silhouette with criterion (SSWC) of the proposal are better than those of the relevant methods with the improvement percentages being 30 and 70%, respectively. The results show that the proposed method is better than the related algorithms in terms of clustering quality whilst its computational time is slightly slower. The contributions of this research is significant in both algorithmic aspects of computational intelligence and and practical applications. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algebraic neutrosophic measures; Medical diagnosis; Neutrosophic recommender system; Neutrosophic set; Non-linear forecasting model","Algebra; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Diagnosis; Matrix algebra; Medical problems; Patient treatment; Recommender systems; Soft computing; Algebraic neutrosophic measures; Algebraic structures; Clustering validity index; Decision making process; Decision-making problem; Forecasting modeling; Inconsistent information; Neutrosophic sets; Clustering algorithms",2-s2.0-85017277802

This is causing strong concern regarding a potential collapse of the music industry comparable to other print media industries such as newspaper and book publishing. However, recent changes in the music industry initiated by a resurgence of the live music industry are giving rise to some expectations for the survival and growth of the music industry. The parallel paths of increasing popularity of streaming services and a resurgence of live music suggest that these two dynamics are working together in a co-evolutionary way toward the sustainability of the music industry. This paper attempts to elucidate the co-evolutionary dynamism between the increasing popularity of streaming music and the resurgence of live music. An empirical analysis of monthly trends over the period of the last three decades in the US music industry by its sectors revealed that (i) the co-evolution between streaming and live music industries has functioned well over the last few years, (ii) the live music industry has incorporated a self-propagating function by assimilating innovations previously initiated by digital music, (iii) given the above co-evolution, the recent resurging trend in the music industry can be sustained, (iv) the advancement of digital innovations such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, fintech, virtual reality, big data, and social media by enabling such coevolution have transformed the live music industry into a “live-concert-streaming music industry” (LCSMI) that further enabling the participative creativity of its stakeholders. For these collaborative and cultural industries to function in harmony, trust between its participating stakeholders is very crucial.

For complex business tasks, the usability of mobile applications is still perceived as inferior. Nevertheless, mobile computing could support work activities in different ways. This research seeks to explore whether mobile applications, especially sophisticated real-time groupware such as Group Decision Support Systems can match or even outperform their desktop-based counterparts regarding task performance and user satisfaction. To provide a more comprehensive comparison, two widely used web metric frameworks, HEART and PULSE (the former focusing on human behavior and the latter focusing on technology), have been used to evaluate and compare a web-based mobile group decision support app with its desktop counterpart on a chair-led multi-step decision-making process in lab settings and real-world contexts. Moreover, data from web tracking tools and system logs of these two apps have been analyzed to deepen the level of analysis. Therefore, an innovative methodology for usability research combining lab experiments with long-term web observations is proposed. The results have shown that users interacting with the mobile version of the system had a steeper learning curve than users interacting with the desktop one. After a short practice period, participants using the mobile version of the groupware could perform as efficiently as participants using its desktop counterpart. Not only both the mobile and the desktop version of the app were used effectively for the group decision tasks chosen for this study, but also the two versions of the application were rated similarly in terms of user satisfaction. Furthermore, the mobile version had a faster adoption, better engagement, and better retention than its desktop counterpart. Despite an additional groupware middleware layer and a sophisticated user interface rendering layer, both groupware versions have yielded a user-to-user response time sufficient for real-time group interactions. These results convey important implications: as society is quickly moving towards mobile computing, web-based mobile technologies can now support multi-step group decision-making tasks. © 2017","Desktop groupware; Group decision support system; Mobile groupware; Usability testing; Web metrics; Web tracking","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Computer software; Decision making; Groupware; Human computer interaction; Middleware; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Real time systems; User interfaces; Websites; Comparative evaluations; Comprehensive comparisons; Decision making process; Group decision supports; Innovative methodologies; Usability of mobile applications; Usability testing; Web metrics; Decision support systems",2-s2.0-85014702014

DTI data were acquired on a 3 Tesla scanner in 30 abstinent alcoholics (AL; 9 men) and 25 nonalcoholic controls (NC; 8 men). The MdLF was determined using DTI-based tractography. Volume of the tract, fractional anisotropy (FA), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity, were compared between AL and NC, with sex and hemispheric laterality as independent variables. The association of DTI measures with neuropsychological performance was evaluated. Men showed bilateral reduction of MdLF volume and abnormal diffusion measurements of the left MdLF. Analyses also indicated that the left MdLF diffusion measurements in AL men were negatively associated with Verbal IQ and verbal fluency test scores.

In our approach, we tackle the problem of instable endpoints by utilizing relaxed constraints on their positions, both during matching and as well in the following bundle adjustment stage. Furthermore, we gain efficiency in estimating trifocal image relations by decoupling rotation and translation. To this end, a novel linear solver for relative translation estimation given rotations from five line correspondences in three views is introduced. Extensive experiments on long image sequences show that our line-based structure from motion pipeline advantageously complements point-based methods, giving more meaningful 3D representation for indoor scenarios. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Line segment matching; Line segments; Structure from motion; Visual odometry","Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; 3d representations; End-point constraint; Line correspondence; Line segment; nocv1; Point-based methods; Position and orientations; Structure from motion; Visual odometry; Pipelines",2-s2.0-84997427195

This paper proposes an energy efficient approach for a cluster based wireless sensor network architecture by employing the game theory and ant colony optimization technique. Initially, the proposed work forms various clusters within the network and thereafter, the coalitions are formed using the proposed algorithm based on the game theory. The proposed algorithm considers the extent of spatially correlated sensed data that are generated by neighbouring nodes in order to form a coalition within a cluster. The proposed coalition scheme reduces the number of transmissions across the network. It is compared with the competing clustering protocols. The simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves the increased network lifetime under the specified quality of service specification (QSS). The results of the proposed work are compared with that obtained through the existing low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and the deterministic stable election protocols (D-SEP). The overall improvement gain achieved by the proposed work is 31% and 10% at specified QSS, when compared with the LEACH and the D-SEP protocols respectively.

In recent years, many scholars proposed some localization algorithms based on machine learning, especially support vector machine (SVM). Localization algorithms based on SVM have good performance without pairwise distance measurements and special assisting devices. But if detection area is too wide and the scale of wireless sensor network is too large, the each sensor node needs to be classified many times to locate by SVMs, and the location time is too long. It is not suitable for the places of high real-time requirements. To solve this problem, a localization algorithm based on fast-SVM for large scale WSNs is proposed in this paper. The proposed fast-SVM constructs the minimum spanning by introducing the similarity measure and divided the support vectors into groups according to the maximum similarity in feature space. Each group support vectors is replaced by linear combination of “determinant factor” and “adjusting factor” which are decided by similarity. Because the support vectors are simplified by the fast-SVM, the speed of classification is evidently improved. Through the simulations, the performance of localization based on fast-SVM is evaluated. The results prove that the localization time is reduce about 48 % than existing localization algorithm based on SVM, and loss of the localization precision is very small. Moreover, fast-SVM localization algorithm also addresses the border problem and coverage hole problem effectively. Finally, the limitation of the proposed localization algorithm is discussed and future work is present. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Fast localization; Similarity analysis; SVM; Wireless sensor networks","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Problem solving; Sensor nodes; Support vector machines; Vector spaces; Vectors; Determinant factors; Fast localization; Large-scale wireless sensor networks; Linear combinations; Localization algorithm; Real time requirement; Similarity analysis; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-84984918430

Thus, the overall network lifetime is reduced due to the fact some nodes deplete their energy reserves much faster compared to the rest. Recently, adopting sink mobility has been considered as a good strategy to overcome the hot spot problem. Mobile sink(s) physically move within the network and communicate with selected nodes, such as cluster heads (CHs), to perform direct data collection through short-range communications that requires no routing. Finding an optimal mobility trajectory for the mobile sink is critical in order to achieve energy efficiency. Taking hints from nature, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm has been seen as a good solution to finding an optimal traversal path. Whereas the traditional ACO algorithm will guide ants to take a small step to the next node using current information, over time they will deviate from the target. Likewise, a mobile sink may communicate with selected node for a relatively long time making the traditional ACO algorithm delays not suitable for high real-time WSNs applications. In this paper, we propose an improved ACO algorithm approach for WSNs that use mobile sinks by considering CH distances. In this research, the network is divided into several clusters and each cluster has one CH. While the distance between CHs is considered under the traditional ACO algorithm, the mobile sink node finds an optimal mobility trajectory to communicate with CHs under our improved ACO algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve wireless sensor network performance compared to other routing algorithms. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Ant colony optimization; Clustering; Energy efficiency; Mobile sink; Wireless sensor networks","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Network routing; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Clustering; Improved ant colony optimization; Mobile sinks; Optimal mobility trajectory; Overall networks; Short-range communication; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-85026510379

The mismatch between the product’s actual conversion period and the application’s target conversion period has been the subtle culprit compromising many existing recommendation algorithms. The challenging question: what products should be recommended for a given time period to maximize conversion—is what has motivated us in this paper to propose a rank-based time-aware conversion prediction model (rTCP), which considers both recommendation relevance and conversion time. We adopt lifetime models in survival analysis to model the conversion time and personalize the temporal prediction by incorporating context information such as user preference. A novel mixture lifetime model is proposed to further accommodate the complexity of conversion intervals.

Yet, Morgan initially had significant doubts about whether a genuine science of comparative psychology was even possible, only later becoming more optimistic about our ability to make reliable inferences about the mental capacities of non-human animals. There has been a fair amount of disagreement amongst scholars of Morgan’s work about the nature, timing, and causes of this shift in Morgan’s thinking. We argue that Morgan underwent two quite different shifts of attitude towards the proper practice of comparative psychology. The first was a qualified acceptance of the Romanesian approach to comparative psychology that he had initially criticized. The second was a shift away from Romanes’ reliance on systematizing anecdotal evidence of animal intelligence towards an experimental approach, focused on studying the development of behaviour. We emphasize the role of Morgan’s evolving epistemological views in bringing about the first shift – in particular, his philosophy of science. We emphasize the role of an intriguing but overlooked figure in the history of comparative psychology in explaining the second shift, T. Mann Jones, whose correspondence with Morgan provided an important catalyst for Morgan’s experimental turn, particularly the special focus on development. We also shed light on the intended function of Morgan’s Canon, the methodological principle for which Morgan is now mostly known. The Canon can only be properly understood by seeing it in the context of Morgan’s own unique experimental vision for comparative psychology. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Animal behaviour; Comparative psychology; Lloyd Morgan; Morgan’s Canon",,2-s2.0-84979503080

We conducted 15 interviews and 2 focus groups between July 2015 and February 2016, with commissioners (including public health managers, data analysts and council members). Two overlapping themes were identified explaining the obstacles and enablers of using such a tool in commissioning: a) evidence cultures, and b) system interdependency. The former highlighted the diverse evidence cultures present in the LA with politicians influenced by the ‘soft’ social care agendas affecting their local population and treating local opinion as evidence, whilst public health managers prioritised the scientific view of evidence informed by research. System interdependency further complicated the decision making process by recognizing interlinking with departments and other disease groups. To achieve legitimacy within the commissioning arena health economic modelling needs to function effectively in a highly politicised environment where decisions are made not only on the basis of research evidence, but on grounds of ‘soft’ data, personal opinion and intelligence. In this context decisions become politicised, with multiple opinions seeking a voice. The way that such decisions are negotiated and which ones establish authority is of importance. We analyse the data using Larson's (1990) discursive field concept to show how the tool becomes an object of research push and pull likely to be used instrumentally by stakeholders to advance specific agendas, not a means of informing complex decisions. In conclusion, LA decision making is underpinned by a transactional business ethic which is a further potential ‘pull’ mechanism for the incorporation of health economic modelling in local commissioning. © 2017","Commissioning; Discursive field; Evidence informed practice; Health economic model; Implementation; Local government; Qualitative study; UK","decision analysis; economic analysis; ethics; implementation process; local government; modeling; public health; research; Article; correlational study; cultural diversity; decision making; diabetes mellitus; government employee; health care planning; health economics; human; information processing; politics; public figure; public health; qualitative research; social care; England; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85020496606

The data being transmitted may contain sensitive information, and undesired disclosure of information can lead to launching of various attacks, thus breaching the data privacy. Earlier works achieve data privacy by using approaches such as data transformation and data perturbation. However, these approaches introduce higher overheads and delays. We propose a computational intelligence based data privacy preserving scheme, where rough set theory is used to anonymize the data during data transfer. Data packets are enclosed within capsules that can be opened only by the designated node, thus preventing the undesired leakage of the data. Also, route between a sender and a receiver is changed dynamically by selecting more than one trusted 1-hop neighbor nodes in each routing step. The proposed data privacy preserving scheme is tested by considering different case studies in a MANET deployed for stock market.

Various researchers have used different techniques to resolve this problem. These techniques can be classified into the unsupervised and supervised approaches. Amongst the unsupervised approaches, Spectral Subtraction and Wiener Filter are commonly exploited. However, such approaches do not yield significant enhancement in the speech quality as well as intelligibility. As compared to unsupervised, supervised approaches such as Hidden Markov Model produces enhanced speech signals with better quality. However, supervised approaches need prior knowledge about the type of noise which is considered their major drawback. Moreover, for each noise type, separate models need to be trained. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach for the enhancement of speech is presented to overcome the limitations of both supervised and unsupervised approaches. The filter weights adjustment on the basis of Delta Learning Rule makes it a supervised approach. To address the issue of construction of new model for each noise type, the filter adjusts its weights automatically through minimum mean square error. It is unsupervised as there is no need of estimation of noise power spectral density. Various experiments are performed to test the performance of proposed filter with respect to different parameters. Moreover, the performance of the proposed filter is compared with state-of-the-art approaches using objective and subjective measures.

However, finding this optimal allocation among a set of possible allocations can represent a difficult task in large systems that contain a large number of components, which subsequently increases the search space. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that uses the nature-inspired meta-heuristic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the ASIL allocation problem and makes use of strategies that reduce the solution space. The problem was formulated as a construction graph, which the ants use to construct possible ASIL allocations. The search space reduction is accelerated considerably by both the effective performance of the ACO and the convergence of the algorithm on the optimal solution. This approach has been evaluated by applying it to a hybrid braking system and a steer-by-wire system. The results show a significant improvement over genetic-based, penguins search-based and tabu search-based approaches. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Ant colony optimization; Automotive safety integrity levels; Constrained optimization; ISO 26262; Reduction of solution space","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Constrained optimization; Hazards; Product design; Safety engineering; Tabu search; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Automotive functional safeties; Automotive safety integrity levels; Design and Development; ISO 26262; Search space reduction; Solution space; Tabu search based approaches; Optimization",2-s2.0-85025456300

Threat actors have quickly learned of the value and potential impact of targeting CPS, and numerous tailored multi-stage cyber-physical attack campaigns, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), have been perpetrated in the last years. They aim at stealthily compromising systems' operations and cause severe impact on daily business operations such as shutdowns, equipment damage, reputation damage, financial loss, intellectual property theft, and health and safety risks. Protecting CIs against such threats has become as crucial as complicated. Novel distributed detection and reaction methodologies are necessary to effectively uncover these attacks, and timely mitigate their effects. Correlating large amounts of data, collected from a multitude of relevant sources, is fundamental for Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to establish cyber situational awareness, and allow to promptly adopt suitable countermeasures in case of attacks. In our previous work we introduced three methods for security information correlation. In this paper we define metrics and benchmarks to evaluate these correlation methods, we assess their accuracy, and we compare their performance.

We report on 3 case studies of business process management and reengineering projects, relying on advanced information technology, focused on the supply chains of two major urban hospitals, involving $2 million in minimum stocks for drug inventory. Case study 1 deals with an in-depth analysis of SCM practices around a key medical asset in pharmaceutical supply, i.e. infusion pumps.

We extend the existing literatures by considering all the basic requirements for a promotional Decision Support System (DSS): reliance on operational (store-level) data only, the ability to predict sales as a function of prices and the inclusion of other promotional variables affecting the category. The new model delivers an optimizing promotional schedule at Stock-Keeping-Unit (SKU) level which maximizes multi-period category level profit under the constraints of business rules typically applied in practice. We first develop a high dimensional distributed lag demand model which integrates both cross-SKU competitive promotion information and cross-period promotional influences. We estimate the model by proposing a two stage sign constrained regularization approach to ensure realistic promotional parameters. Based on the demand model, we then build a nonlinear integer programming model to maximize the retailer's category profits over a planning horizon under constraints that model important business rules. The output of the model provides optimized prices, display and feature advertising planning together with sales and profit forecasts. Empirical tests over a number of stores and categories using supermarket data suggest that our model generates accurate sales forecasts and increases category profits by approximately 17% and that including cross-item and cross-period effects is also valuable. © 2016","Demand forecasting; Fast-moving consumer goods retailing; OR in marketing; Promotion optimization","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Integer programming; Marketing; Optimization; Profitability; Retail stores; Competitive dynamics; Decision support system (dss); Demand forecasting; Fast moving consumer goods; Non-linear integer programming; Optimization modeling; Profit maximization; Regularization approach; Sales",2-s2.0-85008500680

The purpose of the chapter is two-fold: 1) to study the impact of informational competencies in both education and entrepreneurship, and 2) to emphasize the importance of acquiring integral values by learners to be applied into educational processes based on emotional intelligence. As a result, students will be defined as prospective entrepreneurs endowed with the ability to recognize, internalize and understand emotions to be adjusted into relations and business behavior to impulse their goals. And in this sense, online education has an important role to play, especially in postgraduate studies, as in the case of MOOCs that are also analyzed. © 2018 by IGI Global.

The queries necessary for business decision making against a large data warehouse are usually analytical, complex and exploratory in nature. The facility to answer these queries economically is a critical performance concern in the data warehouse environment. One of the techniques employed in data warehouse to improve query performance is to identify and store the relevant data as summaries or aggregates, referred to as materialized view. The problem of choosing such data and storing them as views has been shown to be an NP-hard problem. This problem has been solved using exchange function based particle swarm optimization (EFPSO) in this paper. Accordingly EFPSO based view selection algorithm (EFPSOVSA) is proposed. Experimentally, it is observed that EFPSOVSA selects comparatively better quality views than the greedy algorithm for view selection. © 2017 IEEE.","Analytical Queries; Data Warehouse; Decision Making; Particle Swarm Optimizaton Algorithm; Swarm Intelligence; View Selection","Artificial intelligence; Computational complexity; Decision making; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Query processing; Swarm intelligence; Analytical queries; Business decisions; Greedy algorithms; Materialized view; Materialized view selection; Particle swarm; Query performance; View selection; Data warehouses",2-s2.0-85027502627

Service oriented architecture provides feature like reusability, composability, distributed deployment. Service of SOA is governed by SOA governance board in which they provide approval to create the services and also provide space to expose the particular services. Sometime many services are kept in a repository which creates service identification issue. Service identification is one of the most critical aspects in service oriented architecture. The services must be defined or identified keeping reuse and usage in different business contexts in mind. Rigorous review of Identified service should be done prior to development of the services. Identification of the authenticated service is challenging to development teams due to several reasons such as lack of business process documentation, lack of expert analyst, and lack of business executive involvement, lack of reuse of services, lack of right decision to choose the appropriate service. In some of the cases we have replica of same service exist, which creates difficulties in service identification. Existing design approaches of SOA doesn't take full advantage whereas proposed model is compatible more advantageous and increase the performance of the services. This paper proposes a model which will help in clustering the service repository based on service functionality. Service identification will be easy if we follow distributed repository based on functionality for our services. Generally in case of web services where service response time should be minimal, searching in whole repository delays response time. The proposed model will reduce the response time of the services and will also helpful in identifying the correct services within the specified time. © 2017 IEEE.","Case Study; Microservices; Model; Repository; Response Time; Service Identification; Service-oriented Architecture; Services","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Information services; Models; Response time (computer systems); Reusability; Web services; Distributed deployment; Distributed repositories; Microservices; Repository; Service functionalities; Service identification; Service response time; Services; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",2-s2.0-85027534154

In addition to fulfilling those requirements, NewSQL systems aimed to preserve the useful properties of relational databases as well, such as ACID transactions, SQL and a relational schema. The various systems bear significant differences in terms of architecture, data representation, query capabilities and optimization techniques, and because of that, they offer diverse means of data analysis.

Therefore, cloud computing vendors and providers need to implement strong information security protection mechanisms on their cloud infrastructures. One approach that has been taken for successful threat detection that will lead to the successful attack prevention in cloud computing infrastructures is the application of machine learning algorithms. To understand how machine learning algorithms can be applied for cloud computing threat detection, we propose the cloud computing threat classification model based on the feasibility of machine learning algorithms to detect them. In this paper, we addressed three different criteria types, where we considered three types of classification: a) type of learning algorithm, b) input features and c) cloud computing level.

This pay-for-use approach enables small enterprises and startups to run HPC-related businesses with a significant saving in capital investment and a short time to market. When deploying an application in the cloud, the users may a) fail to understand the interactions of the application with the software layers implementing the cloud system, b) be unaware of some hardware details of the cloud system, and c) fail to understand how sharing part of the cloud system with other users might degrade application performance. These misunderstandings may lead the users to select suboptimal cloud configurations in terms of cost or performance. To aid the users in selecting the optimal cloud configuration for their applications, we suggest that the cloud provider generate a prediction model for the provided system. We propose applying machine-learning techniques to generate this prediction model. First, the cloud provider profiles a set of training applications by means of a hardware-independent profiler and then executes these applications on a set of training cloud configurations to collect actual performance values. The prediction model is trained to learn the dependencies of actual performance data on the application profile and cloud configuration parameters. The advantage of using a hardware-independent profiler is that the cloud users and the cloud provider can analyze applications on different machines and interface with the same prediction model. We validate the proposed methodology for a cloud system implemented with OpenStack. We apply the prediction model to the NAS parallel benchmarks. The resulting relative error is below 15% and the Pareto optimal cloud configurations finally found when maximizing application speed and minimizing execution cost on the prediction model are also at most 15% away from the actual optimal solutions. © 2017 IEEE.","Cloud; Design of experiments; High performance computing; Machine learning; Performance prediction; Random forest","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; C (programming language); Clouds; Cluster computing; Decision trees; Design of experiments; Forecasting; Grid computing; Hardware; Investments; Learning systems; Pareto principle; Application performance; Configuration parameters; High performance computing; High-performance computing applications; Machine learning techniques; NAS parallel benchmarks; Performance prediction; Random forests; Distributed computer systems",2-s2.0-85027444992

Our strategy is to try and fuse training and education learning outcomes, so that students emerge with a technical competence in analytic methods, underpinned by a deeper understanding of the foundations and internal logic shaping those methods. The Iraq Matrix exercise seeks to unpack and examine the nuts and bolts of source evaluation, and to test alternative hypotheses with particular attention to the relationship between the quality of various sources and, the weight of judgements they can or cannot sustain. The ultimate goal is to encourage what is currently fashionably referred to as ‘reflexive practice’, whereby the practitioner reflects critically and self-critically upon how their task works and how they do it, then uses those insights to improve their workplace performance. But not all of our teaching is directed towards practitioners. For those whose aims are scholarly and academic, the aim is to give observers a more visceral understanding of the challenges of the intelligence task they intended to study.

The former objective is characterized as the combined effect of chord error and scallop height, known as surface machining error, whilst the latter may be reflected by the number of cutting tool locations constituting the tool path. These objectives are entirely depended on the values to be selected for computing tool paths under a given cutting strategy and preset tolerance. In order to determine optimal tool path parameters that will simultaneously satisfy the trade-off incurred between these objectives, a novel; generic and unbiased environment integrated with a virus-evolutionary heuristic for intelligent tool path optimization is presented. The proposed environment has been developed using the open architecture of a cutting edge CAM system whilst it deploys a set of interactive functions to straightforwardly assess criteria without the formal knowledge of any objective function; but directly from computer-aided manufacturing attributes; fully responsible to formulate efficient tool paths. A utility based on weighted summation for multi-objective optimization has been introduced to capture the direct output of globally optimized tool paths avoiding this way problem oversimplification and statistical errors that mathematical relations involve. Results have been rigorously validated both computationally and experimentally with the aid of a benchmark sculptured part that has been previously tested by several noticeable research contributions. Based on the quality of research outputs it is shown that the proposed framework for optimizing sculptured surface CNC tool paths may gain a prominent role for further extending the capabilities of current industrial strategies and be the flagship of allied; not-yet industrially interfaced approaches for deploying similar software integration tools to transfer significant results to production. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Intelligent algorithms; Sculptured surface machining; Tool path optimization; Viral intelligence","Computer aided manufacturing; Computer architecture; Cutting tools; Errors; Industrial research; Machine tools; Machining; Multiobjective optimization; Industrial strategies; Integrated frameworks; Intelligent Algorithms; Interactive functions; Mathematical relation; Sculptured surface machining; Tool path optimization; Viral intelligence; Optimization",2-s2.0-85021938907

Decision making is therefore selection of that particular choice over any of several alternatives. Because of the process complexity, a continuous research and improvement of the methods and techniques modern decision making involves is required. One of many modern business challenges is to discover any possible improvement in the decision-making process managers shall use in making the right decision. Any decision made by managers directly impacts the realized profit, business, and company’s position on the market. The fact is that mankind faces the decision-making problem in each phase of its social development, which has resulted in increased need for learning more about it. In this work, both the significance and application of association rules will be analyzed on an example of car sales business. The research was conducted on a sample of 1728 transactions in order to recognize and establish the association rules and then determine their impact on the sales and profit. For the purpose of this research, a large car sales database was used as a source of information, which is also described in this work. Once these association rules were established, they were then used to create a better and more complete market supply.

ELM is a modern neural network with high accuracy and fast learning speed. We apply ELM to classify domain names based on features extracted from multiple resources. Our experiment reveals the introduced detection method is able to perform high detection rate and accuracy (of more than 95%).

One hundred and sixty 4–6 year-old kindergarten students participated in the study for 145 days, which included pre- and post-intervention tests in language, mathematics, and non-verbal intelligence. The three interventions consisted of (a) a mindful movement—integrating movement in academic learning, (b) a movement for its own sake—allowing children free movement without providing academic instruction, and (c) a control condition—children engaging in their regular academic environment activities. The findings revealed that the mindful movement intervention resuted in the highest improvement in the academic achievement tests.

By ‘artificial offspring’ I mean beings that we construct, with a mix of human and non-human-like qualities. Robotic artificial intelligences are paradigmatic examples of the form. There are two reasons for thinking that the creation of such beings could make our lives more meaningful and valuable. The first is that the existence of a collective afterlife—i.e. a set of human-like lives that continue after we die—is likely to be an important source and sustainer of meaning in our present lives (Scheffler in Death and the afterlife, OUP, Oxford, 2013). The second is that the creation of artificial offspring provides a plausible and potentially better pathway to a collective afterlife than the traditional biological pathway (i.e. there are reasons to favour this pathway and there are no good defeaters to trying it out).

It also includes an important factor from the business intelligence literature called analysis quality. To test the model, data were collected through a questionnaire survey from 331 business users working in a variety of industries in Jordan. Data were analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. The results demonstrated that the three quality factors-information quality, system quality and analysis quality -are key antecedents of perceived usefulness and ease of use, which in turn were found to be strong predictors of users' intention to use SSBI tools. The findings of this study provide several implications for research and practice, and thus should help in the design and deployment of more user-accepted SSBI tools. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.

Specifically, we propose the concept of the adjective ""big"" as a mathematical operator, furthermore, the concept of so-called ""big"" logically and naturally fits the concept of being ""linguistics variable"" as per fuzzy logic research community for decades. The consequence of adopting such a mathematical modeling can be profoundly considered as an abstraction of the technologies, systems, tools for data management and processing that transforms data into big data. In addition, the concept of infinity of the big data is based on the theory of calculus and the set theory.

Power management is therefore one of the most important issues to consider in the implementation of WSNs. As a result, decentralized detection, in which the fusion center makes the final decision to use data partially processed by local nodes, is more attractive than centralized detection in unstructured WSNs. This paper proposes a more efficient and effective method for solving the power allocation problem as a constrained optimization problem: to schedule power allocation in a distributed WSN using correlated observations and amplify-and-forward local processing at sensor nodes so that the WSN detects a constant signal while maintaining a sufficient fusion error probability threshold. To accomplish this goal, this paper proposes using Deb’s method, which does not require a penalty parameter when handling the constraints of the optimization problem. Additionally, representative optimization algorithms based on swarm intelligence are used, i.e., particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACO R), and artificial bee colony. Through a simulation, their performance is compared for several different WSNs to determine the best algorithm for solving the power allocation problem. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony optimization; Artificial bee colony; Correlated data fusion; Decentralized wireless sensor networks; Optimal power allocation; Particle swarm optimization","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Bandwidth; Constrained optimization; Correlation detectors; Data fusion; Energy efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor data fusion; Sensor nodes; Swarm intelligence; Ant colony optimization for continuous domains; Artificial bee colonies; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Correlated data; Decentralized detection; Error probability threshold; Optimal power allocation; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-85011610075

We find that the frequency of appearance of specific brain topographies, spatially associated with visual (microstate B) and executive control (microstate C) networks, respectively, is inversely related to Gf scores. Moreover, changes in Gf scores with cognitive training are inversely correlated with changes in microstate properties, indicating that the changes in brain network dynamics are behaviorally relevant. Finally, we find that cognitive training that increases Gf scores results in a posterior shift in the topography of microstate C.

The assessment of the maximum sustained wind speed along the track of the tropical cyclones is very important for estimating the strength of the cyclones. The swarm intelligence in the form of ant colony optimization (ACO) technique is introduced in this study to compute the pheromone deposition along the track of tropical cyclones followed by neural nets to forecast the maximum sustained wind speed of the cyclones occurring over the Bay of Bengal of North Indian Ocean. The ACO is a nonlinear problem-based meta-heuristic optimization method for finding approximate solutions to discrete optimization problems and simulates the decision-making processes of ant colony similar to other adaptive learning techniques. The method has shown its application potential in various fields including the prediction of monsoon rainfall. In this study, the amount of pheromone deposition during the successive stages of the cyclones has been estimated. A range of minimum central pressure (MCP), central pressure drop (PD), maximum sustained wind speed (MSWS) and intensity (T-No) associated with the cyclones of Bay of Bengal are utilized to form the input matrix of the neural nets. The neural nets are trained to forecast the maximum sustained wind speed along the track of the tropical cyclones over Bay of Bengal. The result reveals that the errors in forecasting the MSWS along the track of tropical cyclones with 6, 12, 18 and 24 h lead time are 2.6, 2.9, 3.1 and 4.8, respectively.

Moreover, it enhances the utilization of infrastructure. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially artificial neural network (ANN), intelligent monitor systems are being raised and developed in our daily life. However, a simple task with a single ANN costs a lot of time and computation resources. Hence, we propose using a cloud-based system to share computation resources for ANN to reduce redundant computation. In this paper, we present an intelligent monitor system, which is based on cloud technology, to provide intelligent monitor services. The system is designed with hybrid convolutional neural networks.

The participants included 100 German VET (vocational education and training) students nearing the end of a 3-year apprenticeship program as an industrial clerk (n = 63) which usually leads to a position in office work, lower or middle management, or a similar apprenticeship program to become IT-systems management assistants (n = 37). The participants worked on three computer-based problem scenarios dealing with operative controlling, a relevant domain to both training occupations, and completed further assessments to measure the variables listed above. Theoretical considerations, prior research and domain analyses suggested that industrial clerks would have greater domain-specific problem-solving competence (H1a) and domain-specific knowledge (H1b) than IT-systems management assistants and that domain-specific knowledge would be the strongest predictor of problem-solving competence (H2: “knowledge-is-power” hypothesis); all hypotheses were confirmed. Hypothesis 3, the “Elshout-Raaheim hypothesis,” predicts that fluid intelligence and problem-solving competence are most strongly correlated in the context of intermediate levels of task-related content knowledge, however the highest correlation was found in the group with low domain-specific knowledge. The findings suggest that intelligence plays a minor role in later stages of competence development whereas typical problem situations in later stages particularly require prior knowledge.

This paper presents a new method to estimate the size of a crowd. The new algorithm depends on sequential frame differences to estimate the crowd size in a scene. However, relying only on these simple differences adds more constraints for extracting sufficient crowd descriptors. A curvelet transform is employed to achieve that goal. Every two sequential frames are transformed into multi-resolution and multi-direction formats, and then the frame differences are detected at every subband in the curvelet domain. Statistical features out of each subband are then calculated, and the collected features from all subbands are considered as a descriptor vector for the crowd in the scene. Finally, a neural network is manipulated to map the descriptor vectors into predicted counts. The experimental results show that the proposed curvelet statistical features are more robust and provide crowd counting with higher accuracy than previous approaches. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Crowd counting; Curvelet transform; Frame difference; Statistical features","Artificial intelligence; Automatic counting; Change detection; Crowd counting; Curvelet transforms; Descriptors; Digital image; Frame differences; Statistical features; Image segmentation",2-s2.0-84984784814

The present study aimed to shed more light on the reasons for why male students show low academic effort despite the finding that this undermines their academic achievement. We explored whether students experience psychological benefits from showing low effort or “effortless” achievement in school and whether these benefits are greater for male than for female students. In two experimental vignette studies with independent samples of German ninth graders (N = 210) and teachers (N = 176), we systematically varied student targets’ gender, effort, and achievement and tested for effects on targets’ ascribed intelligence, popularity, likeability, masculinity, femininity, and gender-typicality. The “effortless” achiever was rated as more popular than students showing high effort. Teachers perceived the effortless achiever as the most intelligent target. Academic effort further increased students’ ratings of a low-achieving target’s likeability and students’ and teachers’ ratings of all targets’ femininity as well as decreased students’ ratings of all targets’ masculinity. Students and teachers perceived targets showing low (vs. high) effort as more similar to a typical boy, whereas teachers perceived targets showing high (vs. low) effort as more similar to a typical girl. Results indicate a need to understand the psychological benefits of low academic engagement, especially for male students, and to address the feminine stereotyping of (academic) effort. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Academic achievement; Effort; Gender roles; Gender stereotypes; Human sex differences; Masculinity; Popularity","academic achievement; child; experimental model; female; femininity; girl; high school; human; intelligence; major clinical study; male; masculinity; sex difference; sex role; stereotyping; stereotypy; student; teacher; vignette",2-s2.0-84989162307

Even with ever enlarging networks and data scale? Event detection and evaluation in social networks provide an effective solution, which has become the critical basis for many real applications, such as crisis management and decision making. The existing event detection methods mainly focus on text analysis that is limited in social media content and graphic feature statistic that needs calculate vast variables. Can we find an efficient way for generalized social networks with limited topology information? In this paper, a novel hybrid quantum swarm intelligence indexing method (HQSII) from the perspective of link prediction is proposed for the first time, which includes an optimal weight algorithm (OWA) and a fluctuation detection algorithm (FDA). The innovations behind HQSII lie in three aspects: (1) The mixed index that can universally describe the social network evolutions is proposed firstly, which explores the cooperation of different independent similarity indexes. OWA is further proposed to determine the optimal mixed index that achieves higher link prediction accuracy and better network evolution description than other independent and mixed similarity indexes. (2) To better avoid the interferences of routine network evolution fluctuations, the otherness of micro node evolutions is considered into link prediction. FDA is further proposed to quantify the abnormal fluctuations caused by events. (3) Based on OWA and FDA, HQSII is proposed for all the generalized social networks, which detects events by discovering abnormal fluctuations and evaluates events by analyzing fluctuation trends. Extensive experiments on theoretical and real-world social networks show that HQSII can accurately detect events and quantitatively evaluate event impacts in social networks with single and multiple events. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Event detection and evaluation; Link prediction; Network evolution; Social network","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Forecasting; Social networking (online); Complex social networks; Detection algorithm; Effective solution; Event detection; Link prediction; Network evolution; Social network evolution; Topology information; Complex networks",2-s2.0-84988418351

We achieve this framework by developing an efficient two-stage extreme learning machine (ELM). The first stage is to construct classification models on textual contents of Web pages using ELM. In particular, we take Optical Character Recognition (OCR) as an assistant tool to extract textual contents from image format Web pages in this stage. In the second stage, a classification model on hybrid features is developed by using a linear combination model-based ensemble ELMs (LC-ELMs), with the weights calculated by the generalized inverse.

However, most of the traditional loan evaluation models assume a balanced misclassification cost, which is far from business reality and leaves opportunities for investigating the cost-sensitive modelling approaches. Moreover, few existing studies consider the special characteristics of P2P lending. In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive boosted tree loan evaluation model by incorporating cost-sensitive learning and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to enhance the capability of discriminating potential default borrowers. Therefore, a portfolio allocation model that converts the portfolio optimization problem into an integer linear programming is proposed as a decision support system for unprofessional lenders. Unlike existing studies, which mainly evaluate the model through accuracy-based metrics, this study measures the expected profitability based on the annualized rate of return (ARR) and proposes a new metric (ARR curve) reflecting the ARR over different rejection rates. Two real-world P2P lending datasets are examined, and explanatory data analysis shows that explanatory variables differ in predicting the probability of default and profitability. Experimental results reveal that the area under the ARR curve is not a considerable metric in evaluating models from a profit perspective. Conventional cost-insensitive models may even lead to negative returns, whereas the proposed loan evaluation and portfolio allocation model are the best performing methods over the two datasets in terms of profitability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cost-sensitive learning; Extreme gradient boosting; Loan evaluation; P2P lending; Portfolio allocation","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Earnings; Education; Finance; Financial data processing; Forestry; Integer programming; Optimization; Profitability; Risk assessment; Cost-sensitive learning; Gradient boosting; Loan evaluation; P2p lending; Portfolio allocation; Costs",2-s2.0-85021432111

Importantly, although pitch and duration MMN both correlated with RS of AEPs within the MMN time range (p’s < 0.01), SZ diagnosis predicted MMN over and above RS (p < 0.05) and shared little variance with RS in prediction of MMN amplitude (tolerance > 0.93).

In this approach which is named as dynamic design, pipe diameters in the first year and their rehabilitation/replacement in the next years of the expected life of the network are determined considering the nodal demands growth and increase in pipes’ roughness.

Then pipe breaks and their repair costs are considered in dynamic design process; (3) a new reliability index is used as one of the objective functions. Two networks are used to investigate the impact of static and dynamic designs on the reliability and total cost of design and rehabilitation of WDNs during their life cycle.

The concept of Community Attraction is proposed as the selection criteria. It is related to three factors, that is, the distance of moving, the human relationships and the location restriction. Thus, our new mobility model is called Distance, Relationship, Location (DRL). Specifically, the former two factors are indicated through interaction matrices, which take the Social Relationship Attributes and the information of location as input. And we propose Location Attraction for the first time to denote the location restriction of a place. By the way, the value of Location Attraction is time varying.

Data mining supported by machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to find patterns and to build classifiers for the data. In order to make it possible, data should be represented in an appropriate format, e.g. attribute-value table, which can be built by feature extraction approaches, such as the cross-correlation (CC) method, which uses one signal as reference and correlates it with other signals. However, the reference is commonly selected randomly and, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to evaluate whether this choice can affect the ML method performance. Thereby, this work aims to verify whether the choice of an epileptic EEG segment as reference can affect the performance of classifiers built from data.

With increasing amounts of 3-dimensional experimental data and high fidelity simulation data from Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), data-driven turbulence modeling has become a promising approach to increase the predictive capability of RANS simulations. However, the prediction performance of data-driven models inevitably depends on the choices of training flows. This work aims to identify a quantitative measure for a priori estimation of prediction confidence in data-driven turbulence modeling. This measure represents the distance in feature space between the training flows and the flow to be predicted. Specifically, the Mahalanobis distance and the kernel density estimation (KDE) technique are used as metrics to quantify the distance between flow data sets in feature space. To examine the relationship between these two extrapolation metrics and the machine learning model prediction performance, the flow over periodic hills at Re = 10595 is used as test set and seven flows with different configurations are individually used as training sets. The results show that the prediction error of the Reynolds stress anisotropy is positively correlated with Mahalanobis distance and KDE distance, demonstrating that both extrapolation metrics can be used to estimate the prediction confidence a priori. A quantitative comparison using correlation coefficients shows that the Mahalanobis distance is less accurate in estimating the prediction confidence than KDE distance. The extrapolation metrics introduced in this work and the corresponding analysis provide an approach to aid in the choice of data source and to assess the prediction performance for data-driven turbulence modeling. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Extrapolation; Kernel density estimation; Machine learning; Mahalanobis distance; Random forest regression; Turbulence modeling","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Extrapolation; Large eddy simulation; Learning systems; Navier Stokes equations; Reynolds equation; Reynolds number; Statistics; Turbulence; Turbulence models; Correlation coefficient; High-fidelity simulations; Kernel Density Estimation; Machine learning models; Mahalanobis distances; Predictive capabilities; Quantitative comparison; Random forests; Forecasting",2-s2.0-85016027245

In fact, most researchers overlooked an appropriate design of the IoT analytics network while focusing much on the sensing and delivery networks of the IoT system. Since much of the IoT analytics network has often been taken as granted, the survey, in this paper, we aim to review the state-of-the-art of the analytics network methodologies, which are suitable for real-time IoT analytics. In this vein, we first describe the basics of the real-time IoT analytics, use cases, and software platforms, and then explain the shortcomings of the network methodologies to support them. To address those shortcomings, we then discuss the relevant network methodologies which may support the real-time IoT analytics. Also, we present a number of prospective research problems and future research directions focusing on the network methodologies for the real-time IoT analytics. © 2017 IEEE.","data center network; edge analytics network; hyper-convergence; real-time analytics; The Internet-of-Things (IoT)","Real time systems; Surveys; Appropriate designs; Data center networks; Future research directions; hyper-convergence; Internet of thing (IOT); Network methodologies; Real-time analytics; Software platforms; Internet of things",2-s2.0-85029487083

Data Science is a known term that tends to be synonymous with the term Big-Data; however, Data Science is the application of solutions found through mathematical and computational research while Big-Data Science describes problems concerning the analysis of data with respect to volume, variation, and velocity (3V). Even though there is not much developed in theory from a scientific perspective for Data Science, there is still great opportunity for tremendous growth. Data Science is proving to be of paramount importance to the IT industry due to the increased need for understanding the insurmountable amount of data being produced and in need of analysis. In short, data is everywhere with various formats. Scientists are currently using statistical and AI analysis techniques like machine learning methods to understand massive sets of data, and naturally, they attempt to find relationships among datasets. In the past 10 years, the development of software systems within the cloud computing paradigm using tools like Hadoop and Apache Spark have aided in making tremendous advances to Data Science as a discipline [Z. Sun, L. Sun and K. Strang, Big data analytics services for enhancing business intelligence, Journal of Computer Information Systems (2016), doi: 10.1080/08874417.2016.1220239]. These advances enabled both scientists and IT professionals to use cloud computing infrastructure to process petabytes of data on daily basis. This is especially true for large private companies such as Walmart, Nvidia, and Google. This paper seeks to address pragmatic ways of looking at how Data Science - with respect to Big-Data Science - is practiced in the modern world. We also examine how mathematics and computer science help shape Big-Data Science's terrain.

It is a well-known problem in the field of database and artificial intelligence. In digital libraries such as DBLP, ArnetMiner, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, AllMusic, IMDB, etc., some of the attributes may evolve over time, i.e., they change their values at different instants of time. For example, affiliation and email-id of an author in bibliographic databases which maintain publication details of various authors like DBLP, ArnetMiner, etc. may change their values. A taxpayer can change his or her address over time. Sometimes people change their surnames due to marriage. When a database contains records of these natures and the number of records grows beyond a limit, then it becomes really challenging to identify which records belong to which entity due to the lack of a proper key. In the current paper, the problem of automatic partitioning of records is posed as an optimization problem. Thereafter, a genetic algorithm based automatic technique is proposed to solve the entity matching problem. The proposed approach is able to automatically determine the number of partitions available in a bibliographic dataset. A comparative analysis with the two existing systems – DBLP and ArnetMiner, over sixteen bibliographic datasets proves the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bibliographic database; Cluster validity index; Distance measure; Entity matching; Genetic algorithm; Record similarity","Bibliographies; Clustering algorithms; Database systems; Digital libraries; Genetic algorithms; Information services; Optimization; Taxation; Vocabulary control; Bibliographic database; Cluster validity indices; Distance measure; Entity matching; Record similarity; Bibliographic retrieval systems",2-s2.0-85014122442

The study was conducted Mexico, which is sociologically, culturally and ecologically complex, similar to other “megadiverse” countries. We conducted ensemble niche modeling of endangered top predators to define a set of large vertebrate species. Environmental attributes were used to perform three distance-based and two artificial intelligence-based algorithms. Socio-cultural attributes were included to depict agricultural communities with strong social government schemes and clear evidence of well-managed natural resources. Other socio-economic attributes such as land acquisition cost, human agglomeration and anthropogenic land use were included in the analysis. Scenarios were computed and displayed cartographically with the aid of a geographic information system. Results showed that the largest concentration of biodiversity converges on regions with large land cover persistence and high local governance, defined as potential willingness to engage in conservation actions. The cartographic areas identified overlapped with current Mexican protected areas in only 2.7% of the country. Thus, conservation law enforcement in most of the country seems to be ineffective. Here we show that, in a number of territories, agrarian communities that have coexisted for millennia with umbrella species can be regarded as allies in biodiversity conservation.

This understanding makes it possible to acquire relevant knowledge in order to automatically solve the problem of reverse fault propagation. Two main types of methods can be used to understand fault propagation in order to guess or approximate as much as possible the root causes of observed alarms. Expert systems formulate laws or rules that best describe the phenomenon. Artificial intelligence methods consider that a phenomenon is understood if it can be reproduced by modeling. We propose in this paper, a generic probabilistic modeling method which facilitates fault propagation modeling on large-scale telecommunication networks. A Bayesian network (BN) model of fault propagation on gigabit-capable passive optical network-fiber to the home (GPON-FTTH) access network is designed according to the generic model. GPON-FTTH network skills are used to build structure and approximatively determine parameters of the BN model so-called expert BN model of the GPON-FTTH network. This BN model is confronted with reality by carrying out self-diagnosis of real malfunctions encountered on a commercial GPON-FTTH network. Obtained self-diagnosis results are very satisfying and we show how and why these results of the probabilistic model are more consistent with the behaviour of the GPON-FTTH network, and more reasonable on a representative sample of diagnosis cases, than a rule-based expert system. With the main goal to improve diagnostic performances of the BN model, we study and apply expectation maximization algorithm in order to automatically fine-tune parameters of the BN model from real data generated by a commercial GPON-FTTH network. We show that the new BN model with optimized parameters reasonably improves self-diagnosis previously carried out by the expert Bayesian network model of the GPON-FTTH access network. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bayesian network; Expectation maximization; Fault management; Fault propagation; Model-based approach; Network management; Optical network; Parameters estimation; Statistical inference","Bayesian networks; Expert systems; Fiber optic networks; Image segmentation; Maximum principle; Network management; Parameter estimation; Telecommunication networks; Expectation - maximizations; Fault management; Fault propagation; Model based approach; Parameters estimation; Statistical inference; Passive optical networks",2-s2.0-85007486209

Moreover, stain protection is essential in applications such as medical clothing and industrial workwear where it is important to prevent spills from penetrating a garment and reaching the wearer if those spills have the potential to cause harm. More recently, stain protection has become a highly desirable feature for everyday wear because it minimises the need to launder and dry clean garments-thereby saving time for the user as well as conserving energy and water and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The most common method of imparting stain protection properties to a garment is to treat the fabric from which it is made with a hydrophobic material. This type of treatment is often combined with wrinkle resistance and anti-odour treatments so that clothes look fresh and stay in a wearable condition for longer. Increasingly, consumers are taking anti-staining features in clothing for granted but they are demanding that the incorporation of such features does not cause harm to human health or the environment. The chemicals of choice for imparting stain protection properties to textiles are fluorocarbons because of their unparalleled ability to repel water and oil. But the manufacture of these compounds can result in the generation of chemicals which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment-and some of these chemicals have been, or are being, phased out. Companies specialising in the supply of stain resistant textiles have therefore been vying with each other to develop environmentally sound technologies which can provide reliable stain protection, durable stain protection and a level of performance comparable with that of fluorocarbons. Also, a growing number of businesses have launched clothing collections which shield against spills and odours without the use of potentially harmful chemicals. Many developers are looking to nature-and the water repelling and self-cleaning properties of lotus leaves in particular-to help them to bridge the gap between good stain protection and the demands of environmental sustainability. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85026456010

However, deriving all MHS is NP-hard. In this paper, the principle of “Divide and Conquer” is used to decompose a large family of conflict sets into many smaller sub-families. To efficiently merge the sub-MHS to give sub-families of conflict sets, the relations between the sub-MHS and sub-families of conflict sets are exploited. Based on this, a new method called Subset-Rec-MHS is proposed. In theory, our method based on sub-MHS recombination generally has lower complexity than that based on whole MHS families, as it avoids a large number of set unions and comparisons (to minimize the family of hitting sets). Compared with the direct merge of whole MHS families, the proposed approach reduces the computation time by a factor of approximately (Formula presented.).

Method: The functionality of the proposed system is based on a sequence of texture analysis of laser speckle images (using laser sources of 650 and 808 nm, VIS/IR) followed by the optimization of texture parameters using Bayesian Networks (BN). Results: In the first part of this work, a Bayesian inference method was used to detect microscale tablet defects that are generated “progressively” during production whereas in the second part a Bayesian classifier method was used to discriminate between tablets made from different granule sizes. In part two, it was shown that (i) the comparatively higher energy (5 mW) IR laser light generates different speckle effects than the lower energy visible (Red 3 mW) by interacting with deeper subsurface of the tablets and (ii) by using multi-classifier systems (MCS) to fuse the Bayesian classifiers from both types of speckle images it was possible to achieve a higher discrimination power (88% classification accuracy) for distinguishing between tablets made from different granule sizes than one can achieve from a single image type. Conclusion: It is suggested that this unified method has the potential to provide for a comprehensive analysis of both tablet quality attributes, on the one hand, and failure modes, on the other, that might be used in the development of a low-cost tablet inspection system. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Laser speckle imagery; Tablet inspection",,2-s2.0-85025152049

The workshop was devised to achieve three primary goals: 1) Encourage consideration of a career in electrical and computer engineering 2) Build excitement about the Internet-of-Things and provide students with a future technical focus and 3) Introduce students to the fundamental building blocks that make up the Internet-of-Things. During this activity, students complete a project in which they first construct a circuit to read data from a temperature sensor using a microcontroller platform. The students then write software to transmit that data over a short-range wireless network and then eventually to an Internet-connected device. Finally, that information is used to actuate a DC motor, thereby emulating the same loop carried out by many Internet-of-Things devices, creating data that originates from a sensor, goes to the cloud and then comes back to perform action. We report on two offerings of this workshop and present results in various forms. In addition to student surveys, an observation protocol was used to collect information on the level of activity and student engagement. Finally, samples of student work were directly assessed in terms of their quality and completeness. The results show that the activity is engaging and is successful in meeting its three stated goals. We also provide lessons learned, suggestions for educators who wish to deploy similar activities and propose ideas to improve future offerings. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85030553263

Dengue outbreak is caused by improper maintenance of water storages, lack of urbanization, deforestation, lack of vaccination and awareness. Moreover, a number of dengue cases are varying based on climate season. There is a need to develop the prediction model for modeling the dengue outbreak based climate change. To model the dengue outbreak, Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is applied in this paper that uses the seasonal average of various climate parameters such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, wind, relative humidity and solar. The number of dengue cases and climate data for each block of Tamil Nadu, India are collected from Integrated Disease Surveillance Project and Global Weather Data for SWAT Inc respectively. Local Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation is used in this paper for geographical visualization of hotspot regions. The outbreak of dengue and its hot spot regions are geographically visualized with the help of ArcGIS 10.1 software. The day wise big climate data is collected and stored in the Hadoop cluster computing environment. MapReduce framework is used to reduce the day wise climate data into seasonal climate averages such as winter, summer, and monsoon. The seasonal climate data and number of dengue incidence (health data) are integrated based on the geo-location (latitude and longitude). GPR is used to develop the prediction model for dengue based on the integrated data (climate and health data). The proposed Gaussian process based prediction model is compared with various machine learning approaches such as multiple regression, support vector machine and random forests.

It is a participatory approach centred on design know-how, which promotes innovative forms of engagement and articulation. The proposed methodology balances experience in designing and applying foresight approaches and futures literacy knowledge labs together with a multidisciplinary understanding of institutional context. The methodology fosters decision making processes that embrace complexity and treat uncertainty as a resource, thus improving an organisations’ capacity to use the future to expand its understanding of the present. It has been applied at the Center for Strategic Studies and Management (CGEE), an organisation where institutionalised foresight and technology assessment takes place in Brazil, especially in support of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policy design and implementation, as well as evaluation. However, its clients also include different ministries within government and industries alike. The article outlines the ways in which the organisation involved all its collaborators in jointly rethinking its future, building upon collective intelligence, narrative building, sense making, framing and reframing. The design principles called for these experiments to follow a collective learning curve that enable a renewed focus on systemic and transformative innovation. The crafting of new strategic questions was inspired by jointly expanding the understanding of the imaginary futures of the interrelated systems in which the organisation might play a role. As a consequence, new and disruptive possible roles for the institution were identified. These insights then informed the assessment and choices for the redesign of the business strategy. This paper presents the methodology for combining design thinking and futures literacy, the application of this methodology to CGEE, and the major findings of the overall exercise. Readers will find out about the impact of this exercise on the organisation’s approach to both its own strategic positioning and to the design and implementation of foresight and strategic studies.

The case started when Jong, the junior vice president in the modeling and analyst department of ABC Bank of Thailand, and his team were drafting a proposal presentation on the new credit card approval processes. Jong believed that it was time to overhaul credit card application processes by employing more sophisticated analytical techniques to analyze customer and credit card data. ABC-Premier Card, the bank’s most popular card offering, would be a serendipitous test case in which to further develop the idea about improvements in approving credit card applications. Currently, there were 5 ABC-Premier card applications pending for decision in the house file. Tightening the credit approval process was one of the important strategies for the bank to potentially avoid an increase of risky customers. However, overly strict declinations of credit card applications might alienate potential customers and causing the bank to forego profitable lending opportunities. Taking the ABC-Premier card applications as a testing scenario, Jong and his team had to come up with a new method to evaluate each credit card applicant. They could approve all of them instantly, approve some of them, or even decline all of them. Consequently, Jong hoped that this proposed credit card approval method would improve the bank’s policy decision to optimally balance both risky and profitable customers in the long run. © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust","business analytics; business intelligence; CLV; credit card",,2-s2.0-85020756143

Bridging the gap between stock volatility and behavioral economics, we collected longitudinal data from multiple sources and at multiple times: First, private investors (N = 229) in Shanghai—the financial capital of China—completed their love of money attitude measure (Rich-affect, Motivator-behavior, and Importance-cognition) and demographic variables in a survey. Second, we recorded daily Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (“the Index”) for 30 consecutive trading days during the financial crisis in 2008—public records. Third, we text-messaged investors, collecting their daily Index Happiness, Stock Percentage (stocks/liquid assets), and Stock Happiness—private information. Here, investors illustrate: high Rich investors fret about low Index happiness, yet high Rich and high Importance investors boast high stock happiness, supporting the endowment effect and investor hubristic smirk.

Effective inventory management is a capability necessary to lead in the global marketplace. In the current retailing market, a huge amount of data regarding stocked items in inventory is generated and collected every day. Due to the increasing volume of transaction data and their correlated relations, it is often a non-trivial task to efficiently manage stocked goods, yet it is imperative to explore the underlying dependencies of the inventory items and give insights into implementing intelligent management systems. However, existing inventory management systems rely on statistical analysis of the historical inventory data, and have a limited capability of intelligent management.

Typical ways to address this problem are based on swarm intelligence and very especially using the so-called response threshold method. In the aforementioned method a robot has a certain probability of executing a task which depends on a task threshold response and a task stimulus. Nevertheless, response threshold method cannot be extended in a natural way to allocate more than two tasks when the theoretical basis is provided by probability theory. Motivated by this fact, this paper leaves the probabilistic approach to the problem and provides a first theoretical framework towards a possibilistic approach. Thus, task allocation problem is addressed using fuzzy Markov chains instead of probabilistic processes. This paper demonstrates that fuzzy Markov chains associated to a task allocation problem can converge to a stationary stage in a finite number of steps. In contrast, the probabilistic processes only can converge asymptotically, i.e. the number of steps is not bounded in general. Moreover, fuzzy Markov chains predicts in a better way the future behavior of the system in the presence of vagueness when measuring distances. The simulations performed confirm the theoretical results and show how the number of steps needed to get a stable state with fuzzy Markov chains is reduced more than 10 times and the system’s behavior prediction can be improved more than a 60% compared to probabilistic approaches. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Multi-robot; Possibility theory; Swarm intelligence; Task allocation","Artificial intelligence; Chains; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Markov processes; Multipurpose robots; Probability; Robot applications; Robots; Multi-robot task allocation; Multirobots; Possibilistic approach; Possibility theory; Probabilistic approaches; Probabilistic process; Task allocation; Theoretical framework; Swarm intelligence",2-s2.0-85020446805

Enhanced algorithms are being designed and applied on large datasets to help discover hidden insights and correlations amongst data elements not obvious to human. These insights help businesses take better decisions and optimize key indicators of interest. The growing popularity of machine learning also stems from the fact that learning algorithms are agnostic to the domain of application. Classification algorithms, for example, that could be applied to categorize faults in windmill blades can also be used for categorizing TV viewers in a survey. The actual value of machine learning however depends on the ability to adapt and apply these algorithms to solve specific real world problems. In this paper we discuss two such applications for interpreting medical data for automated analysis. Our first case study demonstrates the use of Bayesian Inference, a paradigm of machine learning, for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease based on cognitive test results and demographic data. In the second case study we focus on automated classification of cell images to determine the advancement and severity of breast cancer using artificial neural networks.

Organisations are optimizing service performance, better handling capacity across overall organisations, and effectively making decisions utilising operational analytics. Realizing the full value of business data is a key challenge for today's operational analytics. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a technique for tracking, analyzing, and processing data as an event happens and is useful for Big Data because it is intended to manage data in motion. Data in motion is processed and communicated based on business rules and processes. For decisions to be better-informed, data used for decision making has to be timely, complete, accurate, trusted, valid, reliable, and relevant. CEP utilizes data generated from moment-to-moment from different emerging sources such as sensor, sentiment, geo-locational, etc. There is a need to bridge the gap between traditional business intelligence with new Big Data technologies such as CEP. Bridging of this gap will enable organisations to become agile and data-driven so that business outcomes can be maximized by delivering better-informed decisions about a customer and delivering a better service to them. In this paper we discuss the architecture developed for CEP using open source technologies and show how CEP is applied to the use case of an Electronic Coupon Distribution Service (ECDS), using location information, past shopping/travel history, gender, likes/dislikes, etc. We further explore how different types of data such as static information (gender, age, etc.), previous history (where the person travelled to, what they bought, etc.), as well as real-time information about a customer (current location, current shopping habits, etc.) would all be utilised in CEP. © 2016 IEEE.","Big Data; Business Intelligence; Complex Event Processing; Conventional Coupon Distribution Service; Electronic Coupon Distribution Service","Competitive intelligence; Data handling; Decision making; Information analysis; Location; Management science; Societies and institutions; Complex event processing; Complex event processing (CEP); Distribution services; Location information; Open-source technology; Operational analytics; Real-time information; Service performance; Big data",2-s2.0-85022019637

It is for this reason that the data related to errors, in particular, have been dwelled upon. Data mining and ANN techniques used in practice are in widespread use. However, examples of their application in providing logistic service are few in number. For this purpose, the classification techniques of data mining were applied to estimate 3PL damage parameters as the class attribute. Find laws, decision tree and decision forest modules (engines) of Polyanalyst are used to discover the similarities and information recovery about the 3PL damage parameters. Moreover, in this study, to compare the prediction results artificial neural networks are used. In order to catch robust and adaptive neural network approach, four types of neural predictors are operated in this research. These neural network predictors are; Back Propagation Neural Network (BBNN), General Regression Neural Network, Radial Basis Neural Network and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Neural Network (ANFIS). The results of four structures have proven that an ANFIS type can be employed to estimate the damage parameters of a 3PL company. This study shows how the 3PL can evaluate and dataof damages to improve their service quality and cost effectiveness to the customers. he analysis of the data related operational errors in 3PL’s is one of the most important contributions of this study in that such analyses can guide this and other similar companies in managing and reducing the number of their future errors.

Even though Hadoop, MapReduce and MapReduce Access Patterns (MRAP) involved in increasing the productivity and fault tolerance, improving the performance is complicated task for handling the vast amount of data. So, we propose a new methodology Distinct MapReduce with Access Patterns (DMRAP) in association with Hadoop MapReduce and business intelligence tools that supports in taking quick decisions and are capable of handling and processing Big data. The methodology used here is unique and more tangible, scalable, reduces cost and time for wide variety of data analytics, real time operations in order to predict and forecast the future business needs. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

To analyze the two types of data, a collaborative filtering approach together with portfolio analyses and association mining techniques were adopted. Theoretically, this is one of the earliest attempts to combine patent data and trademark data to investigate corporate strategies. In practice, the research results are expected to be used as a decision criterion to diagnose the economic value that companies can obtain by entering the market, as well as the technological value to be passed onto their customers.

These algorithms have been designed for logs in which the events that belong to the same case are related to each other - and to that case - by means of a unique case identifier. However, in service-oriented systems, these case identifiers are rarely stored beyond request-response pairs, which makes it hard to relate events that belong to the same case. This is known as the correlation challenge. This paper addresses the correlation challenge by introducing a technique, called the correlation miner, that facilitates discovery of business process models when events are not associated with a case identifier. It extends previous work on the correlation miner, by not only enabling the discovery of the process model, but also detecting which events belong to the same case. Experiments performed on both synthetic and real-world event logs show the applicability of the correlation miner. The resulting technique enables us to observe a service-oriented system and determine - with high accuracy - which request-response pairs sent by different communicating parties are related to each other. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","business process intelligence (BPI); business process management (BPM); event correlation; process discovery; Process mining",,2-s2.0-85021149533

However, there is no significant relationship between emotional intelligence and emotion-focused coping, which positively predicts depressed mood. These results indicate that emotionally intelligent people make greater use of problem-focused strategies, and they benefit from them in achieving a positive mood and, therefore, better psychological adjustment, whereas emotional strategies foster depressed mood.

Such anticipation can be the result of the correct application of information-based knowledge extraction in the form of business analytics. In particular, the use of intelligent data analysis, or data mining, for the analysis of market surveyed information can be of great assistance to churn management.

This unique methodology converts textual and qualitative data into a common quantitative format which is then used to develop a mapped Integrated Customer Satisfaction Index (ICSI). ICSI is a framework for measuring customer satisfaction. Previous measures of customer satisfaction ratio failed to incorporate the cost implications of resolving customer complaints/issues and the fuzzy impact of those complaints/issues on the system. In addition to including these important and unique factors in the present study, we have also introduced a dynamic Critical to Quality (CTQ) concept, a novel method that provides a real-time system to monitor the CTQ list through an updated CTQ library.

In this essay, I will argue that this picture of skilled, automatic, motor processes is overly simplistic. Specifically, I will argue that an adequate account of the learned motor routines that constitute embodied skills cannot be given in a purely bottom-up, brute-causal fashion. Rather, motor control is intelligent all the way down. To establish this, I will first review two recent accounts of skill, Stanley and Krakauer (Front Hum Neurosci, 2013. doi:10.3389/fnhum.2013.0050) and Papineau (R Inst Philos Suppl 73:175–196, 2013), which characterize the automatic motor control responsible for the fine-grained movements constitutive of motor skill as brute, low-level phenomena. I will then isolate five key features that should apply to skilled motor control, if these accounts are correct. Together, the accounts posit that motor control is: (1) ballistic, (2) invariant, (3) independent of general action trajectories, (4) Insensitive to semantic content, and (5) independent of personal-level intentions. In the final section of this paper, I will appeal to optimal control theory for empirical evidence to challenge the commitment to skilled action as qualified by the above features. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Know how; Motor control; Optimal control theory; Skill",,2-s2.0-84986317258

Within the vast world of bioinformatics, we will focus on proteomics, more specifically, on the discovery of small repeated common patterns on sets of protein sequences that may represent some biological functionality.

Highly connected cortical “hub” regions are also thought to facilitate interactions between these networks, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and anterior insula (AI). However, less is presently known about the relationship between these network functions and individual differences in social-cognitive abilities. In the present study, 23 healthy adults (12 female) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a visually based social judgment task (requiring the evaluation of social dominance in faces). Participants also completed both self-report and performance-based measures of emotional intelligence (EI), as well as measures of personality and facial perception ability. During scanning, social judgment, relative to a control condition involving simple perceptual judgment of facial features in the same stimuli, activated hub regions associated with each of the networks mentioned above (observed clusters included: bilateral DLPFC, DMPFC/ACC, AI, and ventral visual cortex). Interestingly, self-reported and performance-based measures of social-cognitive ability showed opposing associations with these patterns of activation. Specifically, lower self-reported EI and lower openness in personality both independently predicted greater activation within hub regions of the SN, DMN, and ECN (i.e., the DLPFC, DMPFC/ACC, and AI clusters); in contrast, in the same analyses greater scores on performance-based EI measures and on facial perception tasks independently predicted greater activation within hub regions of the SN and ECN (the DLPFC and AI clusters), and also in the ventral visual cortex. These findings suggest that lower confidence in one’s own social-cognitive abilities may promote the allocation of greater cognitive resources to, and improve the performance of, social-cognitive functions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Emotional Intelligence; Individual Differences; Large-Scale Neural Networks; Social Cognition; Social Visual Perception","adult; anterior cingulate; anterior insula; Article; brain function; brain region; cerebellum; default mode network; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; emotional intelligence; executive control network; executive function; facial recognition; facies; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; intelligence quotient; male; mesencephalon; nerve cell network; normal human; personality; posterior parietal cortex; priority journal; salience network; self report; social cognition; task performance; thalamus; ventral visual cortex; visual cortex",2-s2.0-84961773679

Simulating interruptible algorithms by means of schedules of executions of contract algorithms in parallel processors is a well-studied problem with significant applications in AI. In the standard model, the interruptions are hard deadlines in which a solution must be reported immediately at the time the interruption occurs. In this paper, we study the more general setting of scheduling contract algorithms in the presence of soft deadlines. In particular, we address the setting in which if an interruption occurs at time t, then the system is given an additional window of time w(t) ≤ c· t, for constant c, within which the simulation must be completed.

Beyond the life sciences and bio-inspired engineering, collective decision making is important in a number of other disciplines, most prominently economics and the social sciences. A paradigmatic model system for collective decision making is the foraging behaviour of mass recruiting ant colonies. While this system has been investigated extensively, our knowledge about its function in dynamic environments is still incomplete at best. We show that the mathematical model of mass foraging is really just a specific instance of a very general class of rational group decision making processes. We analyse this general class using an information-theoretic framework, which allows us to abstract from the specific details of a fixed model system. We specifically investigate how noisy communication can enable groups to share information about changes in an environment more efficiently. In the present paper, we show that an optimal noise level exists and that this optimal level depends on the rate of change in the environment. We explain this on the basis of stochastic resonance theory and show why stochastic attractor switching is a suitable base mechanism for adaptive group decision making in dynamic environments. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colonies; Collective decision making; Information theory; Self-organised behaviour; Stochastic resonance","Bioinformatics; Circuit resonance; Decision theory; Dynamics; Information theory; Magnetic resonance; Resonance; Stochastic systems; Swarm intelligence; Ant colonies; Bio-inspired engineerings; Biological mechanisms; Collective decision making; Group decision making process; Information transfers; Self-organised; Stochastic resonances; Decision making",2-s2.0-85017456937

In the past decades quite a few FALA algorithms are maturely developed but exposing critical defects, when they are applied to optimize continuous functions. In order to overcome their shortcomings and explore a higher-performance LA, we propose a novel CALA algorithm to solve the function optimization problems via one kind of LA prototypes, i.e, the continuous action-set reinforcement learning automata, which is abbreviated as CARLA. The key mechanism of the proposed algorithm lies in a combination of equidistant discretization and linear interpolation. Specifically, four categories of application models are constructed. Two of them are created to obtain continuous actions when the priori information is finite ones, thus avoiding the drawbacks of FALA. The realization of this functionality recourses to the so-called cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a new concept of area surrounded by curves (AsbC) respectively. The other two models are modified versions to balance the trade-off between accuracy and speed. Moreover, these models are expanded to their generalized versions so that multidimensional function optimization problems can be handled as well. A massive amount of experiments including four benchmarks and three scenarios are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed application models. The proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the arts of LA as well as optimization algorithms, with a high accuracy rate, a fast convergence speed, and a competitive time consumption, especially in noised environments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial intelligence; CALA; Function optimization; Learning automata; Reinforcement learning","Artificial intelligence; Automata theory; Benchmarking; Distribution functions; Economic and social effects; Functions; Optimization; CALA; Cumulative distribution function; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Function Optimization; Function optimization problems; Learning Automata; Multidimensional function; Optimization algorithms; Reinforcement learning",2-s2.0-85001817373

In actual applications, the data traffic on an available routing path could fluctuate from time to time, so there is a compelling need for a robust routing strategy to make the links robust enough when the link outage happens. In the paper, we jointly integrate the maximization of network lifetime and the designing of robust routing strategy into consideration, by which both two subproblems are modeled in a framework of cross-layer nonlinear optimization. By using the popular anti-risk methods popularly used in financial mathematics, our proposed cross-layer optimization problem can be transformed to a convex expression, while its uncertain probabilistic constraints are further changed to a specific solvable expression. Inspired by the particle swarm intelligence in recent development of evolutionary computation, a penalty function based method is introduced and applied in the optimal solution searching process. The effectiveness of our robust routing design is validated by the extensive simulation results, and the quantitative interactions among different neighboring links are also analysed in a typical network topology. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Anti-risk strategy; Cross-layer optimization; Network lifetimes; Robust routing; Wireless sensor networks","Constrained optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Network layers; Network routing; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Routing algorithms; Swarm intelligence; Constrained particle swarm optimization; Critical performance indices; Cross layer optimization; Network lifetime; Non-linear optimization; Probabilistic constraints; Risk strategies; Robust routing; Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-85012273676

Therefore, the work presented in this paper is to demonstrate an improved auto-alignment single-channel FSO transmission system at X-axis detection area. The receiver base station was fed with pulsed signal laser from a tunable laser source with a central wavelength of 1550 nm. The detection mechanism responds from an analog input signal received that corresponds to the X-axis direction of transmitter vibration. The detection performance of the system was observed by using two approaches: auto-searching of artificial intelligence (AI) detection with stop command and without stop command. The obtained results indicate that the bit sequence of the pulsed signal has low loss by implementing the auto-searching of AI detection with stop command features and hence improves the efficiency of the overall FSO transmission system. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial Intelligence; Auto-alignment; Detection; Free space optical (FSO); Line-of-sight (LOS)","Alignment; Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Error detection; Pulsed lasers; Signal receivers; Analog input signals; Auto alignment; Detection performance; Free-space optical; Line of Sight; Low-frequency vibration; Transmission systems; Tunable laser sources; Signal detection",2-s2.0-84979210364

A training sample consists of a set, known as a bag, of unlabelled instances. The bag as a whole is labeled positive if at least one instance in the bag is positive, or negative otherwise. Given such training samples, the goal is to learn a description of the common instance(s) among the positive bags, i.e., the underlying concept that is responsible for the positive label. In this work, we introduce a learning scheme based on the notion of partial entropy for MI concept learning. Partial entropy accentuates the intra-class information by focusing on the information reflected from the positive class in proportion to the total entropy, maximization of which is to equalize the likelihoods of intra-class outcomes among the positive class, essentially reflecting the intended concept. When coupled with a distance-based probabilistic model for MI learning, it is equivalent to seeking out a concept estimate that equalizes the intra-class distances while the distance to negative bags is restrained. It produces patterns that are similar to at least one instance from each of the positive bags while dissimilar from all instances in negative bags. The generated patterns from the optimization process correspond to prototypical concepts. Maximum partial entropy is conceptually simple and experimental results on different MI datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in learning an explicit representation of the concept and its competitive performance when applied to classification tasks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Concept learning; Data mining; Instance-based learning; Knowledge extraction; Machine learning; Multiple instance learning; Partial entropy; Weakly supervised learning","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Entropy; Equivalence classes; Learning systems; Sampling; Concept learning; Instance based learning; Knowledge extraction; Multiple instance learning; Partial entropies; Weakly supervised learning; Data mining",2-s2.0-85003968502

In-order to achieve an accurate segmentation, a machine learning based algorithm such as regression neural network enhanced with the augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm (RNN-ALGA). Since the segmentation was processed for multispectral image, the optimization strategy was included in-order to process all the 2D slices with reduced time span. The segmentation was done in-order to process the differentiation of colons, partial volume effect and bowels. By using this algorithm (RNN-ALGA) it is possible to achieve 97 % accuracy with some minor error. The comparison results shows that this algorithms best suitable abdominal slices of CT image is due to its enhanced nonlinearity nature. This methodology was developed especially for the hospital applications. RNN-ALGA works virtually in the common cloud server with an effective wireless distributive system accessed by many clients placed at the remote regions (medical centers, hospitals etc.). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ALGA; ANN; Bowels; Cloud serve; Colon; RNN; WDS","Algae; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Constrained optimization; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gallium alloys; Genetic algorithms; Hospitals; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Optimization; Wavelength dispersive spectroscopy; Augmented Lagrangians; Bowels; Colon; Multispectral images; Optimization strategy; Partial volume effect; Regression neural networks; Segmentation methods; Computerized tomography",2-s2.0-84974808343

The modified ant colony optimization algorithm is used to conduct a multipath search in which the angle factor between nodes is considered. Based on the remaining energy of nodes along multiple paths, a path decision model is established to determine the optimal network routing. In the process of communication, a repair ant is sent along random paths to identify nodes whose energy level is below a certain threshold. The transmission path is then strengthened according to the remaining energy of the nodes. We conduct a series of simulations under two different scenarios, and compare the performance of the proposed method with that of existing routing algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can consume less energy and retain more live nodes, helping to balance the energy consumption of the network. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony optimization; Energy awareness; Multipath; Wireless sensor network","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Energy utilization; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Decision modeling; Energy awareness; Multipath; Multipath routing algorithms; Reduce energy consumption; Remaining energies; Transmission paths; Optimization",2-s2.0-84988917236

Semantic detection is a sub-category of sentiment analysis which deals with the identification of sentiment orientation in any text. Many sentiment applications rely on lexicons to supply features to a model. Various machine learning algorithms and sentiment lexicons have been proposed in research in order to improve sentiment categorization. Supervised machine learning algorithms and domain specific sentiment lexicons generally perform better as compared to the unsupervised or semi-supervised domain independent lexicon based approaches. The core hindrance in the application of supervised algorithms or domain specific sentiment lexicons is the unavailability of sentiment labeled training datasets for every domain. On the other hand, the performance of algorithms based on general purpose sentiment lexicons needs improvement. This research is focused on building a general purpose sentiment lexicon in a semi-supervised manner. The proposed lexicon defines word semantics based on Expected Likelihood Estimate Smoothed Odds Ratio that are then incorporated with supervised machine learning based model selection approach.

One notable example is obtaining informative customer feedback (e.g., customer-product ratings via costly incentives) to improve the effectiveness of recommender systems. In this paper, we develop a novel active learning approach, which aims to intelligently select informative training instances to be labeled so as to maximally improve the prediction accuracy of a real-valued prediction model. We focus on large, heterogeneous, and dyadic data, and on localized modeling techniques, which have been shown to model such data particularly well, as compared to a single, ""global"" model. Importantly, dyadic data with covariates is pervasive in contemporary big data applications such as large-scale recommender systems and search advertising. A key benefit from incorporating dyadic information is their simple, meaningful representation of heterogeneous data, in contrast to alternative local modeling techniques that typically produce complex and incomprehensible predictive patterns. We develop a computationally efficient active learning policy specifically tailored to exploit multiple local prediction models to identify informative acquisitions. Existing active learning policies are often computationally prohibitive for the setting we explore, and our policy makes the application of active learning computationally feasible for this setting. We present comprehensive empirical evaluations that demonstrate the benefits of our approach and explore its performance in real world, challenging domains. © 2017 INFORMS.","Active learning; Big data; Information acquisition; Local regression models; Predictive models","Artificial intelligence; Education; Forecasting; Recommender systems; Regression analysis; Search engines; Time series analysis; Active Learning; Big data applications; Computationally efficient; Empirical evaluations; Information acquisitions; Local regression models; Localized regression; Predictive models; Big data",2-s2.0-85025467696

The first algorithm, called Correlated Sparse Signal Recovery addresses the problem of structured sparse signal recovery when statistical rather than exact properties describing the structure of the signal are appropriate, as in the elimination of eye movement artifacts; such tasks cannot be done efficiently using structured models that assume a common sparsity profile of fixed groups of components. Our algorithm learns structured sparse coefficients in a Bayesian paradigm. Using it, we have successfully identified and subtracted eye movement (structured) artifacts in real EEG recordings resulting in minimal data loss. Our method outperforms Independent Component Analysis and standard sparse recovery algorithms by preserving both spectral and complexity properties of the denoised EEG. Our second method uses a new active selection algorithm that we call Output-based Active Selection (OAS). When applied to the task of detection of EEG epochs containing other non-structured artifacts from an ensemble of detectors, OAS boosts accuracy of the ensemble from 91 to 97.5% with only 10% active labels.

However, there is always an upfront cost to train such algorithms to detect relevant architectural information for each quality attribute in the code. In practice, training supervised or semi-supervised algorithms requires the expert to collect several files of architectural tactics that implement a quality requirement and train a learning method. Establishing such a training set can take weeks to months to complete. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this approach is largely dependent upon the knowledge of the expert. In this paper, we present three baseline approaches for the creation of training data. These approaches are (i) Manual Expert-Based, (ii) Automated Web-Mining, which generates training sets by automatically mining tactic’s APIs from technical programming websites, and lastly (iii) Automated Big-Data Analysis, which mines ultra-large scale code repositories to generate training sets.

However, the underlying neural substrate and biological mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate changes in cognition and brain grey matter (GM) morphology in TC patients undergoing treatment, and to explore associations with immune markers, endocrine markers, and genotype. Sixty-five patients with stage I-III TC underwent assessment after surgery but prior to further treatment and again 6 months after. Twenty-two patients received chemotherapy (+CT), while 43 did not (−CT). Assessments included neuropsychological testing, whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging, and blood samples. Twenty-five healthy controls (HCs) underwent neuropsychological testing with a matching time interval. A regression-based approach was used to determine cognitive changes and longitudinal voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to investigate changes in GM density in the TC groups. Compared with the HCs, both TC groups showed higher rates of cognitive decline (p < 0.05). A trend towards greater decline was observed in + CT (63.6 %) compared with -CT patients (39.5 %) (p = 0.07). VBM revealed widespread GM reductions in both TC groups, but a group-by-time interaction analysis revealed prefrontal reductions specific to the + CT group (p = 0.02), which were associated with poorer cognitive performance. Poorer cognitive performance was also associated with an increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha in + CT patients. Furthermore, an interaction effect was found between the APOE ε4 genotype and chemotherapy on cognitive performance with ε4 carriers performing significantly worse.

Using DWI high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (‘HARDI’), whole brain tractography was conducted on 21 ADHD-combined type boys (m 13.3 ± 1.9 yrs) and 21 typically developing boys (m 14.8 ± 2.1 yrs). This study presents a comprehensive structural network investigation in ADHD covering a range of commonly used methodologies, including both streamline and probabilistic tractography, tensor and constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) models, as well as different edge weighting methods at a range of densities and t-thresholds. Using graph metrics, ADHD was associated with local neighbourhoods that were more modular and interconnected than controls, where there was a decrease in the global, long-range connections, indicating reduced communication between local, specialised networks in ADHD. ADHD presented with a sub-network of stronger connectivity encompassing bilateral frontostriatal connections as well as left occipital, temporal, and parietal regions, of which the white matter microstructure was associated with ADHD symptom severity. Probabilistic tractography using CSD and the Hagmann weighting method produced that highest stability and most robust network differences across t-thresholds.

Unusually, in this study, we applied a successful time-series processing neural network architecture, the echo state network (ESN), to a static pattern recognition task. The networks were presented with clamped input data patterns, but in this work, they were allowed to run until their output units delivered a stable set of output activations, in a similar fashion to previous work that focused on the behaviour of ESN reservoir units. Our aim was to see if the short-term memory developed by the reservoir and the clamped inputs could deliver improved overall classification accuracy. The study utilized a challenging, high dimensional, real-world plant species spectroradiometry classification dataset with the objective of accurately detecting one of the world’s top 100 invasive plant species. Surprisingly, the ESNs performed equally well with both unsettled and settled reservoirs. Delivering a classification accuracy of 96.60%, the clamped ESNs outperformed three widely used machine learning techniques, namely support vector machines, extreme learning machines and multilayer perceptrons. Contrary to past work, where inputs were clamped until reservoir stabilization, it was found that it was possible to obtain similar classification accuracy (96.49%) by clamping the input patterns for just two repeats. The chief contribution of this work is that a recurrent architecture can get good classification accuracy, even while the reservoir is still in an unstable state. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Echo state networks; Hyperspectral sensors; Input clamping; Remote sensing; Static pattern recognition","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Cybernetics; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Multilayers; Network architecture; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Echo state networks; Extreme learning machine; Hyperspectral sensors; Input clamping; Machine learning techniques; Short term memory; Time series processing; Pattern recognition",2-s2.0-85018356833

The PHR integrates data from hospital medical records, mobile biosensors, data entered by patients, and recommendations and abstractions output by the DSS. CIGs are customized to consider the patients’ psycho-social context and their preferences; shared decision making is supported via decision trees instantiated with patient utilities. The central DSS “projects” personalized CIG-knowledge to a mobile DSS operating on the patients’ smart phones that applies that knowledge locally. In this paper we explain the knowledge elicitation and specification methodologies that we have developed for making CIGs patient-centered and enabling their personalization.

However, there is concern that many environmental and agricultural decision support systems remain underutilized and ineffective. Recent efforts to improve decision support systems use have focused on enhancing stakeholder participation in their development, but a mismatch between stakeholders’ expectations and the reality of decision support systems outputs continues to limit uptake. Additional challenges remain in problem-framing and evaluation. We propose using an outcomes-based approach called theory of change in conjunction with decision support systems development to support both wider problem-framing and outcomes-based monitoring and evaluation. The theory of change helps framing by placing the decision support systems within a wider context. It highlights how decision support systems use can “contribute” to long-term outcomes, and helps align decision support systems outputs with these larger goals. We illustrate the benefits of linking decision support systems development and application with a theory of change approach using an example of pest rabbit management in Australia. We develop a theory of change that outlines the activities required to achieve the outcomes desired from an effective rabbit management program, and two decision support systems that contribute to specific aspects of decision making in this wider problem context. Using a theory of change in this way should increase acceptance of the role of decision support systems by end-users, clarify their limitations and, importantly, increase effectiveness of rabbit management. The use of a theory of change should benefit those seeking to improve decision support systems design, use and, evaluation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Environmental management; Logic models; Policy support; Rabbit management; Theory of change (ToC)","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision theory; Environmental management; Systems analysis; Agricultural decision support; Logic models; Long-term outcome; Management programs; Monitoring and evaluations; Policy support; Stakeholder participation; Theory of change (ToC); Decision support systems; agricultural management; decision making; decision support system; environmental management; environmental policy; Internet; lagomorph; land management; local participation; logit analysis; methodology; pest control; stakeholder; Australia; decision support system; environmental management; human; logic; monitoring; nonhuman; rabbit; theoretical model; agriculture; decision making; Internet; organization and management; procedures; program evaluation; software; trends; Australia; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Agriculture; Australia; Decision Making; Decision Support Techniques; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Internet; Models, Theoretical; Program Evaluation; Software",2-s2.0-85014711352

Factors space is more suitable for describing cognition process of intelligence science than the qualitative cartesian space. Based on factor logic, the justice system of the function structure analysis was built. It is proved that the system function logic structure is a minimal disjunctive normal form from the system function analysis. The relationship is discussed between the classification reasoning method of inward analysis of system structure in space fault tree (SFT) and the function structure analysis. The process of inward analysis of system function structure in SFT is realized by the function structure analysis theory. The original classification reasoning method is enhanced to the level of logic mathematics. The system function structures of both incomplete information and complete information are analyzed with the method respectively, and the minimal disjunctive normal forms obtained from the analyses are T= x1x4+ x3x5+ x1x2 and T= x1x4+ x3x5+ x1x2x3.

IS research investigating user behavior in IP2PLS has revealed the saliency of social identity and personal transparency (as expressed through information sharing) in such systems. Prior research has largely focused on a small number of IP2PLS providers, thus this study examines a very large but under-researched platform.

The study reveals the importance of social (vs financial) data, and further reveals relationships that frequently contradict prior findings from other IP2PLS.

Yet, teachers’ sense of personal (rather than formal) responsibility and willingness to assume responsibility for their teaching and students remains an understudied area. The main purpose of this study was to investigate contextual and person-specific predictors of teachers’ sense of personal responsibility, as well as the potential implications of teachers’ personal responsibility for their instructional approaches and wellbeing. A path analysis indicated that high school teachers (n = 287) who felt responsible for their teaching and students reported higher levels of work engagement and job satisfaction than less responsible teachers, and were more likely to endorse mastery-oriented instructional practices that emphasized student effort, task mastery, and individual growth. Teachers’ perceptions of their school’s social climate (teachers’ evaluations of their relationships with students), their sense of teaching self-efficacy, and incremental beliefs of intelligence emerged as positive predictors of teacher responsibility. Teacher responsibility partially mediated the positive effects of these predictors on teachers’ wellbeing and mastery-oriented instructional practices. The results suggest that both contextual (e.g., school climate) and person-specific (e.g., self-efficacy) factors can contribute to teachers’ sense of personal responsibility, and that responsibility, in turn, can have positive implications for teachers’ wellbeing and instructional practices.

However, cloud-based models also pose challenges such as reliability, availability, capability, ability, adaptability of resources, and services across spatial boundaries. Multi-scale design can presumably stimulate greater intelligence in cloud-based models. Using the concepts of the fuzzy holon and the fuzzy attractor, this paper proposes the fuzzy holonic approach to address multi-scale design for configurations. A fuzzy design holon is defined through two basic holons: fuzzy function holon and fuzzy solution holon. A fuzzy attractor is defined as a fuzzy function holon or fuzzy function solution toward which a design tends to evolve. The proposed fuzzy holon model is driven by two conflicting drives: (a) completeness of fuzzy function holons and fuzzy solution holons, and (b) discrimination of fuzzy function holons and fuzzy solution holons. Through simulations, four possible states of behavior of fuzzy holon design are found: (a) the impossibility state characterized by the impossibility of fuzzy holon creation; (b) the creation and destruction state sometimes characterized by the creation of fuzzy holons and sometimes the destruction of fuzzy holons, (c) the development state characterized by a natural creation and development of fuzzy holons and (d) the failure state characterized by the interruption of the development of the fuzzy design holon and the destruction of already created fuzzy design holon. The model explains that design is not an orderly and well behaved phenomenon. It shows that fuzzy holon design is a discontinuous phenomenon. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud-based design and manufacturing; Cloud-based design for configuration; Fuzzy holon design; Intelligent design; Multi scale design","Design; Distributed computer systems; Fuzzy set theory; Cloud-based; Design for configurations; Fuzzy design; Fuzzy function; Intelligent designs; Multi-scale design; Networked design; Service Oriented; Availability",2-s2.0-84934774948

In general, when an individual engages with an object, say Facebook, Instagram, a Mobile game, or anything else, we know that there is some interest that the person has in the object. However, we do not have a procedure that can tell us by “how much” of a factor is the person interested. Simply put, can we find a “number” for someone’s interest? In this article, we propose the design of a framework that can handle this issue. We formulate the interest estimation problem as a state estimation problem and deduce interest indirectly from the activity. Activity, stimulated by interest, is measured via a subjective-objective weighted approach. Further, we present a novel continuous-time model for interest by drawing inspiration from Physics and Economics simultaneously. We model interest along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in Physics and improve the performance by borrowing ideas from Stochastic Volatility Models in Economics. Subsequently, we employ particle filter to solve the interest estimation problem. To validate the feasibility of the proposed theory in practice, we investigate the model by conducting numerical simulations on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate good performance of the framework, and thus match the theoretical expectations from the method. Lastly, we implement the framework in practice and deploy it as a RESTful service, thereby providing a uniform interface for accessing the procedure via any remote or local application. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Artificial intelligence; Interest; Interest estimation; Machine learning; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Statistical application; Stochastic volatility models","Artificial intelligence; Continuous time systems; Economic analysis; Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Automated approach; Continuous time modeling; Estimation problem; Interest; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process; Real-world datasets; Stochastic Volatility Model; Uniform interface; Stochastic models",2-s2.0-85020120724

ABC arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs due to ease of implementation however, its search equation contributes to its insufficiency due to poor exploitation phase and storage of certain control parameters. Thus, we propose an improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved search equation to enhance its exploitation capabilities and in order to increase the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Student’s-t distribution, which require only one control parameter to compute and store, hence increase efficiency of proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact Student’s-t distribution, make it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs.

Therefore, the wireless network should be protected using encryption, firewalls, detection schemes to identify the attackers and decreasing their impact on the network. So, it’s an essential task to design the intelligent intrusion detection system. This research work deals with designing the multilevel trust based intelligence intrusion detection system with cryptography schemes for detecting the attackers. In order to identify the attackers, we propose a novel trust management with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithm. At first, a trust manager is maintained, its functions is to classify the trust into three different sets of trust level based upon the elliptic curve cryptography and Schnorr’s signature in the MANET. Each trust level has identified a single attacker. Thus, the proposed method has detected three types of attackers such as black hole attack, flooding attack and selective packet dropping attack. Furthermore, it have provided countermeasure for these attackers in the MANET as well as improved performances. Hence, it obtains higher throughput, minimum delay, minimum packet loss and efficient end to end delivery in MANET.

Recently, mobile crowdsensing, as a new paradigm, makes it possible that a large number of instances can be often quickly labeled at low cost. Existing works only focus on the single labeling for supervised learning problems of traditional machine learning, where one instance associates with only label. However, in many real world applications, an instance may have more than one label. To the end, in this paper, we explore an incremental multi-labeling issue by incentivizing crowd users to label instances under the budget constraint, where each instance is composed of multiple labels. Considering both uncertainty and diversity of the number of each instance’s labels, this paper proposes two mechanisms for incremental multi-labeling crowdsensing by introducing both uncertainty and diversity. Through extensive simulations, we validate their theoretical properties and evaluate the performance. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Budget constraints; Incentive mechanisms; Machine learning; Multi-labeling crowdsensing; Truthfulness","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Budget constraint; Extensive simulations; Human comprehensions; Incentive mechanism; Machine learning techniques; Multi-labeling crowdsensing; Supervised learning problems; Truthfulness; Budget control",2-s2.0-85019756835

Based on a critical analysis of these accounts, we will present our own account according to which mental disorders are dispositional properties that are token-identical to physical properties.

We argue that our account is not only able to account for multiple realizability without running into the causal exclusion problem, but that it also allows for the integration of very different factors into the description and explanation of mental disorders, such as neurological and neurochemical factors on the one side and social and cultural factors on the other.

To bring these paradigms to life, self-sustainable wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes capable of seamless and maintenance free operation at remote locations are desired. Recently, radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) circuits capable of harvesting RF power transmitted by base stations, TV towers and other ambient RF sources have been developed. Low power requirements and architectural compatibility between WSN nodes and RFEH circuits make RFEH a promising and feasible solution for WSN nodes. In this paper, a novel multi-stage decision-making policy (DMP) for RFEH enabled WSN nodes has been proposed. It offers an intelligence, via online learning algorithm, for characterization and selection of frequency bands based on their RF potential especially in the dynamic spectrum environment. Furthermore, proposed DMP supports multi-antenna multi-band harvesting capabilities of the RFEH circuits. The final contribution includes tunable RFEH duration that leads to significant improvement in the harvested energy and fewer number of frequency band switchings (FBS). Derived theoretical performance bounds and simulation results validate the superiority of proposed DMP in terms of the harvested RF energy and throughput of the WSN nodes. Furthermore, the fewer number of FBS makes the proposed DMP suitable for resource-constrained WSN nodes. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Decision making policy; Multi-armed bandit; RF energy harvesting; Wireless sensor nodes","Decision making; Energy harvesting; Frequency bands; Low power electronics; Smart city; Wireless sensor networks; Architectural compatibility; Distributed decision making; Frequency-band selection; Multi armed bandit; Online learning algorithms; Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting; RF energy harvesting; Wireless sensor node; Sensor nodes",2-s2.0-85019889674

Distributing high-quality videos among users who employ numerous channels in multi-channel P2P live streaming systems, however, still suffers from many challenges arisen from the network size and dynamicity, channel resource imbalance, and bandwidth limitations. Other challenges also exist, including instability of peers, the peers’ low participation, large startup and playback delays, low quality of received video, and resource insufficiency in unpopular channels. In this paper, ReDePoly, with some levels of distributed intelligence, is proposed to reduce the bootstrapping delay and to increase the service quality. The key idea is to substitute agents with bootstrapping peers in the channels to model user behaviors and to share the aggregated knowledge among the agents to disseminate the learned models. Accordingly, the agents dynamically predict the behavior of participating peers to pre-assign them to the predicted channels and to parallelize the threads related to viewing behavior and channel switching. In case of congested channels, the new agents are distilled to mitigate the agent responsibilities.

A temporal compression mechanism based on theta phase coding has been shown to be essential for the encoding of episodic memory occurring on a behavioral timescale (>a few seconds) and capable of operating sequential and spatial memory. However, episodic memory models should be developed to handle more semantic-rich contents. Here, memory from the reading of a passage of literature was evaluated using a network model based on theta phase coding. Two types of input were simultaneously applied: word inputs, defined by the eye movement sequence obtained during the reading, with each fixated word encoded by a vector computed from a statistical language model with a large text corpus; and sequence inputs, defined by random activations and representing a gradually changing input pattern, independent of the eye movement. The results successfully demonstrated a memory generated by the word sequence from the 6-min reading session, and the memory network for the sequence input was shown to be essential for the retrieval. This result was characterized by a words-in-sequence structure in the network formed by theta phase coding, of which, the unidirectional connections among sequence units dominantly evoked the sequential activation, which further conveyed word unit activations through the unidirectional connections from the sequence to the word units. This suggests a general role for theta phase coding in the formation of episodic memory. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Computational neuroscience; Episodic memory; Hippopcampus; Neural oscillation; Statistical language modeling","Chemical activation; Codes (symbols); Computational linguistics; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Network coding; Semantics; Computational neuroscience; Episodic memory; Hippopcampus; Neural oscillations; Statistical language modeling; Eye movements",2-s2.0-85019597401

These methods heavily rely on matrix computations, and it is hence critical to make these computations scalable and efficient. These matrix computations are often complex and involve multiple steps that need to be optimized and sequenced properly for efficient execution. This paper presents new efficient and scalable matrix processing and optimization techniques for in-memory distributed clusters. The proposed techniques estimate the sparsity of intermediate matrix-computation results and optimize communication costs. An evaluation plan generator for complex matrix computations is introduced as well as a distributed plan optimizer that exploits dynamic cost-based analysis and rule-based heuristics to optimize the cost of matrix computations in an in-memory distributed environment. The result of a matrix operation will often serve as an input to another matrix operation, thus defining the matrix data dependencies within a matrix program. The matrix query plan generator produces query execution plans that minimize memory usage and communication overhead by partitioning the matrix based on the data dependencies in the execution plan. We implemented the proposed matrix processing and optimization techniques in Spark, a distributed in-memory computing platform. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that our proposed techniques achieve up to an order-of-magnitude performance improvement over state-ofthe-Art distributed matrix computation systems on a wide range of applications. © 2017 IEEE.","Distributed computing; Matrix computation; Query optimization","Computational efficiency; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Distributed computer systems; Optimization; Communication overheads; Distributed environments; Large-scale machine learning; Matrix computation; Optimization techniques; Query execution plan; Query optimization; Rule-based heuristics; Matrix algebra",2-s2.0-85021186559

For example, certain types of web contents hold hidden information that traditional search engines are unable to retrieve. Searching for the mathematical construct of 1/x using Google will not result in the retrieval of the documents that contain the mathematically equivalent expressions (i.e. x−1). Because conventional search engines fall short of providing math-search capabilities. One of these capabilities is the ability of these search engines to detect the mathematical equivalence between users’ quires and math contents. In addition, users sometimes need to use slang terms, either to retrieve slang-based visual data (e.g. social media content) or because they do not know how to write using classical form. To solve such a problem, this paper proposed an AI-based system for analysing multilingual slang web contents so as to allow a user to retrieve web slang contents that are relevant to the user’s query. The proposed system presents an approach for visual data analytics, and it also enables users to analyse hundreds of potential search results/web pages by starting an informed friendly dialogue and presenting innovative answers. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval; Search query; Text analysing; Visual data analytics; Web content","Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval; Intelligent systems; Technology transfer; Websites; Equivalent expression; Hidden information; Mathematical constructs; Mathematical equivalences; Search queries; Text analysing; Visual data; Web content; Search engines",2-s2.0-85019268306

We apply an unsupervised neural-network based NLP idea, Distributed Representation via Word Embedding, to extract latent information from a relational table. The word embedding model is based on meaningful textual view of a relational database and captures inter-/intra-attribute relationships between database tokens. For each database token, the model includes a vector that encodes these contextual semantic relationships. These vectors enable processing a new class of SQL-based business intelligence queries called cognitive intelligence (CI) queries that use the generated vectors to analyze contextual semantic relationships between database tokens. The cognitive capabilities enable complex queries such as semantic matching, reasoning queries such as analogies, predictive queries using entities not present in a database, and using knowledge from external sources. © 2017 ACM.",,"Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Education; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Cognitive capability; Cognitive intelligence; Contextual semantics; Distributed representation; Latent information; Relational Database; Semantic matching; Unsupervised neural networks; Query languages",2-s2.0-85021633433

The area of “opinion mining”, particularly sentiment analysis, aims to find, extract, and systematically analyze people’s opinions, attitudes and emotions towards certain topics. Performance of a supply chain is closely associated with the level of trust, collaboration, and information sharing among its members. In this paper, using textual “sentiment analysis”, we explore the relationship between elements of social media content generated by supply chain members and performance of supply chain. In particular, we identify specific elements of member generated supply chain related content on social media such as: information sharing, collaboration, trust, and commitment to determine their association with supply chain performance. We find information sharing and collaboration to be positively associated with supply chain performance, and these findings are consistent with previous reports in supply chain literature. In addition, ours is one of the first attempts to use sentiment analysis to analyze social media content in a supply chain context. The findings indicate that supply chain members value the sharing of relevant information and collaborative contents on social media as such efforts improve individual and overall supply chain performance. The results of this study should prove useful to other studies that utilize social media in a supply chain context, and to improve supply chain management strategies. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","And supply chain management; Intelligent decision making; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Social network analysis","Behavioral research; Consumer behavior; Data mining; Decision making; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Social networking (online); Information sharing; Intelligent decision making; Market researches; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Supply chain intelligence; Supply chain management strategy; Supply chain performance; Supply chain management",2-s2.0-85019226856

In RL agents freely interact with environment and learn through trial and error with reward and punishment provided by the environment where agents exist. The method is inspired by behaviorist psychology, and similar to how living beings learn by trial and error. An important aspect of RL is that agents aim to maximize end cumulative reward not immediate reward. This is a very important feature as it allows RL to be applied to complex problems where immediate results are very different to final end outcomes. For example, individual moves in a business deal could incur loss, but an overall strategy over time could result in net gain. Such complex problems are well suited to RL. Most RL studies deal with single agent acting in an environment; here we deal with a more efficient paradigm where multiple agents act and cooperate in the environment to maximize the final outcome. A multiagent reinforcement leaning (MARL) can be very effective in finding solutions to complex problems. © 2017 IEEE.","Agent; Collective behavior; Learning; Multiagent; Punishment; Reinforcement; Reward; Self-organizing","Agents; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Fertilizers; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement; Collective behavior; Learning; Multiagent; Punishment; Reward; Self-organizing; Reinforcement learning",2-s2.0-85019657303

Therefore, it is very critical to efficiently schedule the offloaded tasks especially when the available computation, storage, communication resources and energy supply are limited. In this paper, we investigate the MCC-assisted execution of multi-tasks scheduling problem in hybrid MCC architecture. Firstly, this problem is formulated as an optimization problem. Secondly, a Cooperative Multi-tasks Scheduling based on Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (CMSACO) is put forward to tackle this problem, which considers task profit, task deadline, task dependence, node heterogeneity and load balancing.

In this work, we leverage the collective knowledge embedded in the social relationships of users on the network to predict user preferences and future behavior. We extract social dimensions in the form of overlapping communities that capture the behavioral heterogeneity in directed and signed social networks. We present an extension of signed modularity, namely Structural Balance Modularity (SBM). We first propose a metric Structural Balance Index (SBI) that determines users’ degrees of affiliation towards various communities by harnessing the concept of the generalized theory of structural balance. We then incorporate SBI into the signed modularity to define SBM. It takes into account the density as well as the sign (positive or negative) of the links between users on the network. A genetic algorithm is developed that optimizes the SBM, thereby maximizing positive intra-community connections and negative inter-community connections. The discovered latent overlapping communities represent affiliations of users with similar preferences and mutual trust relationships captured by the signs of connections exerting differential effects on users’ behaviors. Thereafter, we ascertain which communities are relevant for a targeted behavior by using discriminative learning. The computational experiments are performed on Epinions real-world dataset, and the results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of our proposed approach. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Collective behavior prediction; Collective intelligence; Community detection; Genetic algorithm; Signed social networks; Structural balance","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge management; Business applications; Collective behavior; Collective intelligences; Community detection; Computational experiment; Discriminative learning; Overlapping communities; Structural balance; Social networking (online)",2-s2.0-85018742904

Two factors which determine the impact of non-existence of safety practices in any organization are economic repercussions and large humanitarian. This is particularly prevalent among the manufacturing firm which holds a track record of maximum illness and injury rate for the past couple of years. This outlays the importance of safety in any organization. The contemporary trend of manufacturing firms is that, the safety practices that exist in the organization or in the shop floor is aligned with the very nature of its business or the way its operations run. This gives us a limited understanding on safety implementation in those firms. This paper primarily focuses upon identifying the most important drivers that are rudimentary for improvement of safety practices. This paper makes use of interpretive structural modeling whose output elucidates two important components namely, driving power and dependence power. Driving power is the level of prominence that each driver has got in importance in the safety practice improvement. Dependence power is the level of interdependency between them. © 2016 IEEE.","Interpretive structural modeling; safety drivers; safety in manufacturing; safety practice level","Artificial intelligence; Control measures; Interpretive structural modeling; Level of safeties; Manufacturing firms; Safety measures; Safety policies; Safety practices; Visual management; Manufacture",2-s2.0-85019971361

Due to the complexity of IoT systems, the understanding and development of attractive new system functions is a great challenge compared with traditional, stand-alone product systems. Methods that focus on the integration of market and business analysis with product design and development emerged from Japan in the late 1960s under the title of Quality Function Deployment (QFD). These have undergone considerable development over the last 30 years to ensure they are appropriate for the development of both complex hardware, software and service systems and the current best practices are described in the recently published ISO 16355 for QFD. Recent significant progress in development of cognitive artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as IBM's Watson system, provides opportunities to gather and analyse significant volumes of market and technological information to support the core objectives of QFD i.e. aligning new product system design to customer and stakeholder priorities. This involves targeting information sources, refining analysis algorithms to ensure market priorities with associated underlying trends are identified reliably.

These data contain the most important facts about the institutions and its customers. A good and efficient data analytics system can find patterns in this huge data source that can be used in actionable knowledge creation. Actionable knowledge is the knowledge that can be put to decision making and take some positive action towards better performance of organizations. This actionable knowledge is termed Business Intelligence by data scientists. Business Intelligence and Analytics is the process of applying data mining techniques to organizational or corporate data to discover patterns. Business Intelligence and Business Analytics are emerging as important and essential fields both for data scientists and organizations. Risk analysis, fraud detection, customer retention, customer satisfaction analysis and actuarial analysis are some of the areas of application of business intelligence and analytics. Credit risk analysis is an important part of a successful financial institution particularly in the banking sector. The current study takes this risk analysis in financial institutions and reviews the state of the art in using data analytics or data mining techniques for financial risk analysis. The analysis of risk from financial data depends on several factors that are both objective and subjective. Hence it is a multi-criteria decision problem. The study also proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) for analyzing financial data for risk analysis and prediction. The proposed MOGA is different from other evolutionary systems in that a memory component to hold the rules is added to the system while other systems in the literature are memory less. The algorithm is applied to bench mark data sets for predicting the decision on credit card and credit applications.

BI is currently the largest area of IT investment in organizations and has been rated as the top technology priority by CIOs worldwide for many years. The most important use patterns in decision support are concerned with the type of decision to be supported and the type of manager that makes the decision. The seminal Gorry and Scott Morton MIS/DSS framework remains the most popular framework to describe these use patterns. It is widely believed that DSS theory like this framework can be transferred to BI. This paper investigates BI systems use patterns using the Gorry and Scott Morton framework and contemporary decision-making theory from behavioral economics. The paper presents secondary case study research that analyzes eight BI systems and 86 decisions supported by these systems. Based on the results of the case studies a framework to describe BI use patterns is developed. The framework provides both a theoretical and empirically based foundation for the development of high quality BI theory.

The service-dominant (S-D) logic framework offers significant insights into this challenge; however, these effects have not been tested quantitatively. This study addresses that gap, examining the influence of various seller resources on buyer satisfaction. An empirical analysis of buying organizations that purchased and implemented business intelligence systems finds that “augmented” operant resources that the buyers ascribe to the software’s sellers—resources that go above and beyond expectations—are the most significant predictors of both successful technology assimilation and overall customer relationship quality. In particular, an augmented operant resource reflecting a seller’s ability to see value creation opportunities from the buyer’s perspective (value mindset) has up to three times the effect on relationship satisfaction as “core” operant resources such as product-specific expertise or basic interpersonal service skills.

Yet, little is known about the effect of ethnocentrism on diversified working relationships and effective means of reducing ethnocentrism such that it does not impede the successful management of an emerging diverse workforce. Can one be ethnocentric and yet culturally intelligent at the same time? This study examined the relationship between these two constructs in general and the role of cultural intelligence (CQ) as a predictor of ethnocentrism, specifically. The data used to examine the CQ–ethnocentrism relationship was part of an ongoing study examining the efficacy of an experiential training program involving diversified mentoring relationships. In these relationships, primarily white, affluent, university students studying business were assigned to mentor refugees from diverse backgrounds being resettled in the U.S. Using a quasi-experimental design, we found that while ethnocentrism increased for the treatment group, it did not rise as much as it did in the control group, indicating a buffering effect for the diversified mentoring training intervention.

However, there is still limited and partly conflicting experimental evidence for the possible effect of social exclusion on children’s cognitive performance. In the present study, we tested the possibility that some children are more vulnerable than others to the negative effects of social exclusion on cognitive performance. We selected 4 potential candidates that could moderate the effects of social exclusion: relational self-esteem, peer ratings of popularity, rejection sensitivity and nonverbal intelligence. Individual differences in these 4 potential moderating factors were first assessed in a sample of 318 children (45.6 % females; mean age = 9.92 years). Then, in a subsequent experimental session, the participants were either socially included or excluded using a typical manipulation (i.e., the Cyberball paradigm). Following the manipulation, the children’s cognitive performance was assessed using a logical reasoning test. The results showed that the children with lower scores for relational self-esteem (the bottom 37.46 % of the sample), lower popularity (43.49 %) or weaker nonverbal intelligence (37.80 %) performed worse on the logical reasoning test following social exclusion. Moreover, children with combined low self-esteem, popularity and nonverbal intelligence were the most affected by social exclusion. This study identified factors that make some children more vulnerable to the negative effects of social exclusion. Overall, the present work underscores the value of considering basic cognitive and relational individual differences when developing interventions aimed at preventing the negative effects of social exclusion among children. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cognitive consequences; Logical reasoning; Popularity; Risk factors; Self-esteem; Social exclusion","child; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; intelligence; major clinical study; male; risk factor; self esteem; social exclusion; intelligence; peer group; physiology; self concept; social desirability; social distance; Child; Female; Humans; Intelligence; Male; Peer Group; Self Concept; Social Desirability; Social Distance",2-s2.0-84979574392

However, research in moral psychology indicates that moral emotions have a significant role in ethical decision-making (Haidt, Handbook of affective sciences, 2003). Thus, the ability to experience, perceive and regulate emotions should influence consumers’ ethical decision-making. These abilities, which are components of emotional intelligence (Davies et al., J Person Soc Psychol, 1998), are examined as antecedents to consumers’ ethical beliefs in this study. Five hundred Australian consumers participated in this study by completing an online questionnaire that included measures of emotional intelligence, consumers’ ethical beliefs and personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism, Forsyth, J Person Soc Psychol, 1980). Results demonstrate that the ability to appraise and express emotions in oneself is directly negatively related to beliefs regarding actively benefiting from illegal actions as a consumer, passively benefiting at the expense of the seller and actively benefiting from questionable but legal actions as a consumer. The ability to appraise and express emotions in oneself is directly positively related to beliefs regarding ‘doing-good’ (pro-social) actions. The ability to appraise and recognise emotions in others is also directly positively related to beliefs regarding ‘doing-good’ actions as well as pro-environmental buying actions. The effects of the different components of emotional intelligence on consumers’ ethical beliefs are (in most cases) mediated by personal moral philosophies. This study demonstrates the relationship between emotional intelligence and consumer ethics and highlights the interplay of affect and cognition in consumers’ ethical decision-making. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Consumer ethics; Emotional intelligence; Idealism; Relativism",,2-s2.0-84933557947

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios. © 2017 The Authors","Agriculture; Business modelling; Data; Data infrastructure; Governance; Information and communication technology","agricultural land; agricultural modeling; artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; data acquisition; data set; decision making; food production; food supply; governance approach; literature review; power relations; stakeholder; supply chain management",2-s2.0-85011824717

This study investigates whether childhood factors reflecting biological risk and cognitive reserve have additive predictive value for the persistence of ADHD that is unique beyond childhood indicators of disorder severity. One-hundred thirty children with ADHD (mean age = 8.9 years, 75 % male) were followed into adolescence (mean age = 14.0 years). Childhood ADHD and co-morbidities were assessed via interviews with parents and teachers; parental psychopathology was assessed via parent interview; exposure to neurobiological and psychosocial adversity were indexed by parent questionnaire; and cognitive reserve was evaluated through children’s performance on measures of IQ and executive functioning. Univariate analyses identified childhood inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, co-morbid oppositional defiant disorder, overall impairment, and paternal anxiety and depression as more prevalent amongst adolescents with persistent compared with remitted ADHD. Only child-level predictors remained significant in a final multivariate model. These results suggest that children who are most likely to experience persistent ADHD have a more severe clinical presentation in childhood, reflected by increased levels of inattention, oppositional behavior, and impairment. They also are more likely to have fathers with internalizing concerns, but these concerns do not uniquely predict ADHD persistence beyond child-level factors.

Recently, mobile sink, trajectory based forwarding and energy supply based node selection have been suggested in literature for optimizing residual energy of nodes. In the most of these approaches, energy consumption has been minimized focusing on the optimization of one particular parameter. The consideration of impact of more than one parameters on energy consumption is lacking in literature. In this context, this paper proposes Huffman coding and Ant Colony Optimization based Lifetime Maximization (HA-LM) technique for randomly distributed WSNs. In particular, ACO based multiple paths exploration and Huffman based optimal path selection consider the impact of two network parameters on energy consumption. The parameters include path length in terms of hop count and residual energy in terms of load of nodes of the path and the least energy node. The construction of multiple paths from source to the sink is mathematically derived based on the concept of two types of ants; namely, Advancing Ant (A-ANT) and Regressive Ant (R-ANT) in ACO. The optimal path is identified from the available multiple paths using Huffman coding. Analytical and simulation results of HA-LM are comparatively evaluated with the state-of-the-art techniques considering four performance metrics; namely, average residual energy, energy consumption, number of alive sensors and standard deviation of energy. The comparative performance evaluation attests the superiority of the proposed technique to the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ACO; Energy consumption; Green computing; Huffman coding; Lifetime maximization; Optimization; WSNs","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Energy utilization; Optimization; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication networks; Average residual energy; Green computing; Huffman coding; Lifetime maximization; State-of-the-art techniques; Trajectory based forwarding; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); WSNs; Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-84990878584

The use of adequate doses of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), formulated as Argovit™, is an alternative to reduce the contamination indices and promote development in plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial and hormetic effects of Argovit on in vitro regeneration of vanilla (Vanilla planifolia) using a TIS. In vitro regenerated shoots were grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium with Argovit at five different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/l) using a temporary immersion bioreactor system (RITA®). At 30 days of culture, contamination percentage was evaluated and shoot regeneration and length were used to determine the hormetic response. Analysis of macro and micronutrient contents was performed. In addition, the effect of Argovit on total phenolic content (TPC), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, antioxidant capacity (ORAC) and lipid peroxidation (LP-MDA) was determined. Results showed that bacterial contamination was reduced at 50, 100 and 200 mg/l of Argovit. Growth stimulation was observed at 25 and 50 mg/l of Argovit, while significant inhibition was detected at 100 and 200 mg/l of Argovit. Mineral nutrient analysis revealed changes in macro and micronutrient concentrations exerted by Argovit. Moreover, the presence of Argovit induced the production of ROS and increased total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation with a dose-dependent effect. Results suggested that the production of ROS and mineral nutrition are key mechanisms of AgNPs-induced hormesis for vanilla. Therefore, the addition of 50 mg/l of Argovit in the culture media had an antimicrobial and hormetic effect. Use of Argovit could be an efficient strategy for commercial micropropagation of vanilla and other species. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Hormesis; Micropropagation; Nanobiotechnology; RITA®","Antioxidants; Artificial intelligence; Bioreactors; Contamination; Lipids; Metal nanoparticles; Microorganisms; Nanobiotechnology; Nanoparticles; Nutrients; Oxidation; Plants (botany); Trace elements; Hormesis; Macro-and micronutrients; Microbial contamination; Micropropagation; Reactive oxygen species; Silver nanoparticles (AgNps); Temporary immersion bioreactors; Temporary immersion systems; Silver",2-s2.0-85010782639

Nowadays, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is widely applied in computer vision field, including image classification, caption, recognition and retrieval, etc. We introduce an extension to query expansion: an automatic method to select good candidate samples for interactive annotation which is used in query expansion using both BoW method and CNN feature. In this work, we address the query expansion framework using active learning, where the main focus is on the sample selection step in the process of query expansion. More specifically, we propose an active sample selection algorithm based on binary relevance classification, based on the assumption that most confusing samples of the classifiers have high probability to contain helpful true positives for query expansion, which significantly improves the retrieval performance. It takes full use of the multimodal information of the shortlist obtained from the basic retrieval to train a binary relevance classifier, which is used to pick up the most confusing samples for human annotation, with top list as unlabeled data and bottom list as fake negatives. And it can achieve a faster and better retrieval than naive top sample selection method. We also fuse BoW vector and CNN prediction in the retrieval system for a better performance. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, experiments are conducted on Standard Oxford (5K and 105K) and Paris (6K) datasets, and experimental results and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Active learning; Convolutional neural network; Image retrieval; Query expansion","Artificial intelligence; Bins; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Convolution; Information retrieval; Neural networks; Active Learning; Convolutional neural network; Human annotations; Multi-modal information; Query expansion; Retrieval performance; State-of-the-art methods; State-of-the-art performance; Image retrieval",2-s2.0-85007413430

The novelty of the proposed technique is that it adopts a semi-supervised learning approach by requesting a user to provide keywords to describe the target product feature. In addition, a set of unannotated consumer reviews are retrieved from various social media websites. On the basis of the user-provided keywords and the set of unannotated consumer reviews, the class association rule mining algorithm is applied to learn a set of opinion sentence identification rules for the target product feature.

Therefore, this research aimed to: 1) explain motivation and social entrepreneur attributes and 2) assess the social entrepreneur competencies of activists with regard to children and youths in Nan province, Thailand. Thirty-two social activists who actively worked on children and youth issues in Nan province were purposely selected from 35 social organizations active with children and youths. Data were collected using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. An in-depth interview using semi-structured questioning was conducted to explain social activists’ motivation. Social entrepreneur attributes and social entrepreneur competencies were assessed using a self-assessment questionnaire. The findings showed that participant's motivation was derived from: 1) beliefs in human dignity and rights, 2) experiences with a role model, 3) own experiences, and 4) gratitude to the nation. Regarding emotional intelligence and social skills, 59.4 percent of participants perceived having a high performance level in understanding emotional conditions when interacting with others and 84.4 percent perceived their ability to adapt and coordinate with others at a high level. On virtues and ethical issues, 96.9 percent viewed these two as significant and necessary for social entrepreneurs. Regarding social entrepreneur competencies, the average score for overall competency was at the master level (X¯=2.76, SD = 0.54). The competency with the highest average score was learning (X¯=3.01, SD = 0.62) followed by teamwork (X ¯=3.00, SD = 0.61). The competency with the lowest average score was fund raising at the apply level (X¯=2.34, SD = 0.73).

For this purpose, several software-based solutions have been proposed. However, it has been observed that software solutions are vulnerable to several kinds of attacks. Moreover, they cannot protect and monitor all parts of the system. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed to monitor a target system from an isolated hardware and store system’s sensitive information in its tamper-proof memory locations. To realize such a solution, Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has proposed the specifications of a co-processor called Trusted Platform Module which is widely available in commodity hardware. Integrity Measurement Architecture is one of the well-known static techniques that brings TCG’s attestation from kernel to the application level. However, this method cannot measure runtime behavior of applications, which is necessary to detect runtime attacks such as buffer overflow and return-oriented programming.

The system may be used in the automatic assessment of research performance in public or private institutions. It can be easily modified to support complex sets of rules depending on each user's needs in personnel evaluation. The main research field of this papers concerns distributed artificial intelligence. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business process re-engineering; Distributed computing","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Distributed computer systems; Human resource management; Information management; Reengineering; Automatic assessment; Automatic identification; Business process re-engineering; Distributed approaches; Distributed Artificial Intelligence; Personnel evaluation; Stakeholder identifications; Stakeholders identifications; Mobile agents",2-s2.0-85004006966

The design of these objects gives rise to new opportunities but requires taking into account a number of dimensions that contribute to smartness. In our view, supported by considerable literature on this subject, smart behavior is the result of proper combinations of several dimensions of intelligence. In the paper we analyze these dimensions, singling out different alternatives leading to different capabilities of smart objects. The contribution of the paper is to provide a framework to guide a designer in making decisions about smartness in the physical object being designed, starting from its requisites. At the same time the framework provides an effective guide to classify and compare smart physical objects according to the type and level of smartness they exhibit. We apply the approach to a set of smart physical objects showing its suitability and usefulness. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Design guidelines; Dimensions of intelligence; Human-object interaction; Internet of things; Levels of smartness; Smart Objects","Information systems; Internet of things; Digital counterparts; Dimensions of intelligence; Human-object interaction; Levels of smartness; Multi dimensional; Physical objects; Seamless integration; Smart objects; Computer networks",2-s2.0-85017469245

We examined the effects of common genetic variation in GRM5 with cognitive function, hippocampal volume, and hippocampal mGluR5 protein levels in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy controls. Two independent GRM5 variants rs60954128 [C>T] and rs3824927 [G>T] were genotyped in a schizophrenia case/control cohort (n=249/261). High-resolution anatomical brain scans were available for a subset of the cohort (n=103 schizophrenia /78 control). All participants completed a standard set of neuropsychological tests. In a separate postmortem cohort (n=19 schizophrenia/20 controls), hippocampal mGluR5 protein levels were examined among individuals of different GRM5 genotypes. Schizophrenia minor allele carriers of rs60954128 had reduced right hippocampal volume relative to healthy controls of the same genotype (−12.3%); this effect was exaggerated in males with schizophrenia (−15.6%). For rs3824927, compared to major allele homozygotes, minor allele carriers with schizophrenia had lower Intelligence Quotients (IQ). Examination in hippocampal postmortem tissue showed no difference in mGluR5 protein expression according to genotype for either rs60954128 or rs3824927. While these genetic variants in GRM5 were associated with cognitive impairments and right hippocampal volume reduction in schizophrenia, they did not affect protein expression. Further study of these mechanisms may help to delineate new targets for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, and may be relevant to other disorders. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Case-control; GRM5; IQ; Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5; mGluR5; Schizophrenia",,2-s2.0-85017430695

Studies conducted since the 1930’s consistently indicate significant sub-average intelligence among African populations. The purpose of this study is to examine whether commonly used intelligence tests such as the Ravens Progressive Matrices are valid indices of cognitive functioning among children in Mali, Africa. Participants in the current study were 206 children from Mali attending French-language schools. The Woodcock-Johnson II math assessment was used to measure participants’ academic achievement. The Vineland II- Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) was used to indicate their adaptive functioning level. In this study, tests of IQ were compared against adaptive functioning and academic achievement, to examine whether IQ scores measured among African populations are artificially low or are an accurate measure of performance. IQ scores as measured by the Ravens were discrepant with standardized scores on math achievement and adaptive functioning. Results indicate that use of the Ravens may substantially underestimate the intelligence of children in Mali. This can be particularly problematic when comparisons are made across cultures using the same test and norms. .

Mass customisation (MC), which inherits the ‘economy of scale’ from mass production (MP), aims to meet specific customer demands with near MP efficiency. Such an overarching concept has multiple impacts on operations management. This requires highly qualified and multi-skilled engineers who are well prepared for managing MC. Therefore, this concept should be properly addressed by engineering education curricula which needs to keep up with the emerging business trends. This paper introduces a novel course about MC and variety in operations management which recalls several Experiential Learning (EL) practices consistently with the principle of an active learning. The paper aims to analyse to which extent EL can improve the efficiency of the teaching methods and the retention rate in the context of operations management. The proposed course is given to engineering students whose’ perceptions are collected using semi-structured questionnaires and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively.

The center of this hypersphere is approximated using a sparse solution, by selecting an appropriate set of relevant samples. For this purpose, we investigate well-known shrinkage methods, namely Least Angle Regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, and Elastic Net. We revisit these methods and adapt their algorithms for estimating the sparse center in the RKHS.

We employ the lens of cognitive scripts and posit that people share a cognitive script for what constitutes a helpful review in a given domain. Conceptually, a script includes the salient elements that readers look for before determining whether a review is helpful. To operationalize the construct of cognitive script, we seek the help of human annotators and ask them to highlight phrases that they believe are important for determining review helpfulness. The words in the annotated phrases are collected and become part of the script lexicon for a given domain. The lexicon entries represent the shared conception of essential elements, which are key to the evaluation of review helpfulness. We employ the words in the script lexicon as features in a text regression model to predict review helpfulness. Furthermore, we develop and empirically validate a new approach for combining script analysis and dimension reduction.

We summarise the prototype process, and discuss the many difficulties that currently stand in the way of high quality research by this route. Despite the difficulties, the combination of low cost text mining with qualitative research is a promising methodological avenue, and we specify some future paths for this area of study. © 2017.

As a result, most companies have increasingly been choosing the application of performance measurement systems. This significantly results in poor performance measurement regarding future business lagging measure. To solve this problem, this research presents a hybrid predictive performance measurement system (PPMS) using the neuro-fuzzy approach based on particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO). It is constructed from many leading aspects of convenience store performance measures and projects the competitive level of future business lagging measure. To do so, monthly store performance measures were first congregated from the case study value chains. Second, data cleaning and preparations by headquarter accounting verification were carried out before the proposed model construction. Third, these results were used as the learning dataset to derive a predictive performance measurement system based on ANFIS-PSO. The fuzzy value of each leading input was optimized by parallel processing PSO, before feeding to the neuro-fuzzy system. Finally, the model provides a future performance for the next month’s sales and expense to managers who focused on managing a store using desirability function (Di). It boosted the sales growth in 2012 by ten percentages using single PPMS. Additionally, the composite PPMS was also boosted by the same growth rate for the store in the blind test (July 2013–February 2014). From the experimental results, it can be concluded that ANFIS-PSO delivers high-accuracy modeling, delivering much smaller error and computational time compared to artificial neural network model and supports vector regression but its component searching time differs significantly because of the complexity of each model. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Neuro-fuzzy; Predictive performance measurement system; Retailing value chain; Swarm intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Chains; Deep neural networks; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sales; Supply chain management; Swarm intelligence; Artificial neural network modeling; Desirability function; Neuro-Fuzzy; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Parallel processing; Performance measurement system; Predictive performance; Value chains; Fuzzy inference",2-s2.0-85016079917

However, research has shown that companies perform better when they apply data-driven decision-making. This creates an incentive to introduce intelligent, data-based decision models, which are comprehensive and support the interactive evaluation of decision options necessary for the business environment. Recently, a new general explanation methodology has been proposed, which supports the explanation of state-of-the-art black-box prediction models. Uniform explanations are generated on the level of model/individual instance and support what-if analysis. We present a novel use of this methodology inside an intelligent system in a real-world case of business-to-business (B2B) sales forecasting, a complex task frequently done judgmentally. Users can validate their assumptions with the presented explanations and test their hypotheses using the presented what-if parallel graph representation. The results demonstrate effectiveness and usability of the methodology. A significant advantage of the presented method is the possibility to evaluate seller's actions and to outline general recommendations in sales strategy. This flexibility of the approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different applications. Our well-documented real-world case shows how to solve a decision support problem, namely that the best performing black-box models are inaccessible to human interaction and analysis. This could extend the use of the intelligent systems to areas where they were so far neglected due to their insistence on comprehensible models. A separation of the machine learning model selection from model explanation is another significant benefit for expert and intelligent systems. Explanations unconnected to a particular prediction model positively influence acceptance of new and complex models in the business environment through their easy assessment and switching. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","B2B Sales forecasting; Black-box models; Intelligent system; Machine learning; Prediction explanation","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Learning systems; Sales; Black-box model; Business environments; Business to business; Data driven decision; Decision support problem; Graph representation; Machine learning models; Sales forecasting; Intelligent systems",2-s2.0-85006817279

Still, it is imperative to redefine the different aspects of emotional intelligence in the context of the prevailing aggressive global atmosphere. The achievement and failure of a company chiefly depends upon the productive and effective handling of resources available within the organization. Resources are categorized into two like: human and non-human. Successful and productive uses of non -human resources are possible only through highly motivated and committed human beings. Motivation and commitment among the work force are shaped and injected through the dynamic leadership of managers. One of the vital aspects of effective leadership is to develop the ability to perceive emotions within one self and others. Leadership also involves expressing emotions effectively. The whole process of perceiving and expressing emotions effectively pose a greater challenge before today's managers to motivate and mobilize their subordinates. In order to bridge the expected gap existing in the present emotional intelligence aspects, a paradigm shift came into view by means of instilling contemporary management thoughts through the nuances of age-old insights. The article examined the book Arthashastra authored by Kautilya, the chief exponent in the field of economics and management. Arthashastra etymologically explains ""the science of wealth"" and is one of the ancient Indian works that emphasizes upon the effective management of wealth through leadership. Arthashastra illustrates the contribution of Kautilya in ancient India regarding the role of an emotionally intelligent king towards the effective administration of the state. The paper explored the lessons in emotional intelligence from Arthashastra and interpreted its relevance in the present day business context.

This often takes place with the purchase of expensive products/services and in the business-to-business context. Effective negotiation pricing can help enhance a company's profitability, balance supply and demand, and improve the customer satisfaction. However, determining the “right” price is a rather complex decision-making problem that puzzles pricing managers, as it needs to consider information from many constituents of the purchase channel. To further advance this line of research, this study proposes a systematic and learning approach that consists of three different types of fuzzy systems (FSs) to provide intelligent decision support for negotiation pricing. More specifically, the three FSs include: 1) a standard FS, which is a typical multiple inputs and single output FS that forms a mathematical mapping from the input space to the output space; 2) an SFS-SISOM, which is a linear fuzzy inference model with a single input and a single output module; and 3) a hierarchical FS, which consists of several FSs in a hierarchical manner to perform fuzzy inference. To address the existing problem of a standard FS suffering from the high-dimensional problem with a large number of influential factors, a generalized type of FS (named hierarchical FS), including its mathematical models and suitability for tackling the negotiation pricing problem, is introduced. In particular, a proof-of-concept prototype system that integrates these three FSs is also developed and presented. From a system design perspective, this artifact provides immense potential and flexibility for end users to choose the most suitable model for the given problem. The utility and effectiveness of this proposed system is illustrated and examined by three experimental datasets that vary from dimensionality and data coverage. Moreover, the performances of three different approaches are compared and discussed with respect to some important properties of decision support systems (DSSs). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support systems; Hierarchical fuzzy systems; Negotiation pricing","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Fuzzy systems; Hierarchical systems; Purchasing; Sales; Web browsers; Automatic negotiation; Business to business; Decision support system (DSSs); Fuzzy inference model; Hierarchical fuzzy systems; High-dimensional problems; Intelligent decision support; Intelligent decision support systems; Fuzzy inference",2-s2.0-85013223041

Their attractive characteristics include low deployment cost, a low-cost option to extend network coverage and ease of maintenance due to their self-healing properties. Multiple routes exist between the sender and receiver nodes because of the mesh layout that ensures network connectivity even when node or link failures occur. Recent advances among others include routing metrics, optimum routing, security, scheduling, cross-layer designs and physical layer techniques. However, there are still challenges in wireless mesh networks as discussed in this paper that need to be addressed. Cross-layer design allows information from adjacent and non-adjacent layers to be used at a particular layer for performance improvement.

Previous studies have focused on the differences in behaviors, such as cognitive function and personality traits, between the only-child and the non-only-child. However, there are few studies that have focused on the topic of whether different family environments influence children’s brain structural development and whether behavior differentially has its neural basis between only-child and non-only-child status. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the differences in cognition (e.g., intelligence and creativity) and personality and the anatomical structural differences of gray matter volume (GMV) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) between only-children and non-only-children. The behavioral results revealed that only-children exhibited higher flexibility scores (a dimension of creativity) and lower agreeableness scores (a dimension of personality traits) than non-only-children. Most importantly, the GMV results revealed that there were significant differences in the GMV between only-children and non-only-children that occurred mainly in the brain regions of the supramarginal gyrus, which was positively correlated with flexibility scores; the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which was positively correlated with agreeableness scores; and the parahippocampal gyrus. These findings may suggest that family environment (i.e., only-child vs. non-only-child), may play important roles in the development of the behavior and brain structure of individuals. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Agreeableness; Creativity; Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); Only-child; Supramarginal gyrus","anatomical concepts; Article; brain region; child; child behavior; cognition; creativity; family income; first-degree relative; gray matter; human; intelligence; medial prefrontal cortex; non only child; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; only child; personality; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; self control; supramarginal gyrus; voxel based morphometry",2-s2.0-84960103405

In this case, they have often shown their practical interest. So, the literature (coming from Mathematics, OR or AI) has concentrated its efforts on the minimization of a single parameter, namely the tree-width. Nevertheless, experimental studies have shown that this parameter is not always the most relevant to consider when solving CSPs. So, in this paper, we highlight two fundamental problems related to the use of tree-decomposition and for which we offer two particularly appropriate solutions. First, we experimentally show that the decomposition algorithms of the state of the art produce clusters (a tree-decomposition is a rooted tree of clusters) having several connected components. We highlight the fact that such clusters create a real disadvantage which affects significantly the efficiency of solving methods. To avoid this problem, we consider here a new graph decomposition called Bag-Connected Tree-Decomposition, which considers only tree-decompositions such that each cluster is connected. We analyze such decompositions from an algorithmic point of view, especially in order to propose a first polynomial time algorithm to compute them. Moreover, even if we consider a very well suited decomposition, it is well known that sometimes, a bad choice for the root cluster may significantly degrade the performance of the solving. We highlight an explanation of this degradation and we propose a solution based on restart techniques. Then, we present a new version of the BTD algorithm (for Backtracking with Tree-Decomposition Jégou and Terrioux, Artificial Intelligence, 146 43–75 28) integrating restart techniques. From a theoretical viewpoint, we prove that reduced nld-nogoods can be safely recorded during the search and that their size is smaller than ones recorded by MAC+RST+NG (Lecoutre et al., JSAT, 1(3–4) 147–167 34). We also show how structural (no)goods may be exploited when the search restarts from a new root cluster. Finally, from a practical viewpoint, we show experimentally the benefits of using independently bag-connected tree-decompositions and restart techniques for solving CSPs by decomposition methods. Above all, we experimentally highlight the advantages brought by exploiting jointly these improvements in order to respond to two major problems generally encountered when solving CSPs by decomposition methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bag-connected tree-decomposition; Constraint satisfaction problems; Restart; Tree-decomposition","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Constraint satisfaction problems; Forestry; Polynomial approximation; Problem solving; Connected component; Decomposition algorithm; Decomposition methods; Graph decompositions; Polynomial-time algorithms; Restart; Single parameter; Tree decomposition; Trees (mathematics)",2-s2.0-84982840408

This paper proposes a framework of an emotion recognition system that fetches huge amount of face images from the social networks into a cloud. In the cloud, the problem of the unlabeled facial images is handled by applying an active learning approach. For the feature extraction, an interlaced derivative pattern is used, while for a base classifier, an extreme learning machine is utilized.

Then, the positive and negative defuzzification values, synthesized from three degrees of the picture fuzzy set, are used to generate crisp outputs. Learning in PIS including training centers, widths, scales and defuzzification parameters is also discussed.

In order to assess the benefits which can be gained by taking advantage of pmc, we performed many experiments, based on benchmarks coming from several data sets. More precisely, we made a differential evaluation of each elementary preprocessing technique in order to evaluate its impact on the number of variables of the instance, its size, as well as the treewidth of its primal graph. We also considered two combinations of preprocessings: eq, based on equivalence-preserving techniques only, and # eq, which additionally exploits techniques preserving only the number of models. Several approaches to model counting have also been considered downstream in our experiments: “direct” model counters, including the exact ones Cachet, sharpSAT, and an approximate one SampleCount, as well as the compilation-based model counters C2D, Dsharp, SDD and cnf2obdd have been used.

In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical aspect-based product ranking approach. We first mine aspect-based pairwise comparative opinions from both user reviews on multiple review websites and community-based question answering pairs containing product comparison information. Next, we use our hierarchical structure-based model to propagate and reassign the aspect-based comparative opinions by using the parent-child and sibling relations between aspects in the product aspect hierarchy. The structure-based model helps to address the data sparsity issue of very few or no comparative reviews for some aspects. Finally, we employ graph-based ordering algorithms to consolidate these reassigned pairwise opinions into listwise comparison results.

Recently established large-scale neuroimaging data repositories have helped clarify the neuroanatomy of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and may prove useful in ASD. Structural brain images from the Autism Brain Imaging Database Exchange (ABIDE), which contains over 1100 participants, were analyzing using DARTEL VBM to investigate total brain and tissue volumes, and regional brain structure abnormalities in ASD. Two, overlapping cohorts were analyzed; an ‘All Subjects’ cohort (n = 833) that included all individuals with usable MRI data, and a ‘Matched Samples’ cohort (n = 600) comprised of ASD and TD individuals matched, within each site, on age and sex. Total brain and grey matter volumes were enlarged by approximately 1–2 % in ASD; however, the effect reached statistical significance in only the All Subjects cohort.

There was a non-significant reduction in the correlation between IQ and TBV in ASD compared to TD.

Hypercliques (HC) have been successfully used in a number of applications, for example clustering and noise removal. Even though the HC collection has been shown to respond well to datasets with skewed support distribution and low support threshold, it may still grow very large for dense datasets and lower h-confidence threshold. Recently, we proposed a condensed representation of HC, the Non-Derivable Hypercliques (NDHC). NDHC was shown to have substantial advantages over HC, especially for dense datasets and lower h-confidence values. In this paper, we propose an approximation of the NDHC collection, called Approximate Non-Derivable Hypercliques (ANDHC). This collection is a subset of NDHC and is generated based on a user-input error. We present an efficient algorithm to mine all ANDHC sets, and an algorithm to approximately derive the HC collection from the ANDHC collection. Through experiments with several datasets and parameter combinations, the ANDHC collection is shown to have significant collection size reduction from NDHC even for small error values. It is also shown that based on ANDHC we can generate a good approximation of the entire HC collection. Finally, we experiment with applying our proposed collections to enhance clustering with encouraging results. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Approximate hyperclique collection; Frequent itemset mining; Hyperclique; Non-derivable itemset","Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Condensed representations; Confidence threshold; Frequent itemset mining; Hyperclique; Non-derivable itemset; Parameter combination; Skewed support distributions; Support threshold; Algorithms",2-s2.0-84964306909

Disorder related differences in NRC involved caudate hyper-connectivity and hypo-connectivity of several cortical areas such as the dorsal cingulate, the cuneus and the right postcentral cortex. These abnormalities were coupled with abnormalities in the amplitude of signal fluctuations and, to a minor extent, with differences in the dimensionality of connectivity patterns as quantified by the number of supervised principal components. Second level seed correlation analyses linked the observed abnormalities to an additional set of brain regions relevant to schizophrenia such as the thalamus and the temporal cortex.

Many researchers concentrate on designing better view selection methods with respect to the running time or the cost of the solution. This paper summarizes our research on the problem of how much space should be allocated for views materialization to ensure good queries performance. In order to comprehensively investigate the problem and minimize the influence of untypical cases, the experiments described in this paper were done on the large data set, including large data cubes, rarely considered in previous papers. In particular, the relation between the number of data cube views and the space limit expressed as a percentage of the fully materialized data cube size and a multiple of the base view size is analysed. According to our experimental results, the allocation of large space for views materialization is not cost effective. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Data cube; Decision support systems; OLAP; View materialization; View selection problem","Artificial intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision support systems; Geometry; Cost-effective storages; Data cube; Large datasets; Multidimensional database; Number of datum; OLAP; View materializations; View selection problem; Digital storage",2-s2.0-84963781734

However, current approaches for prioritizing requirements seldom take these dependencies into consideration, because it is difficult for stakeholders to prioritize requirements considering their preferences as well as the dependencies between requirements. To make requirement prioritization more practical, a method called DRank is proposed. DRank has the following advantages: 1) a prioritization evaluation attributes tree is constructed to make the ranking criteria selection easier and more operable; 2) RankBoost is employed to calculate the subjective requirements prioritization according to stakeholder preferences, which reduces the difficulty of evaluating the prioritization; 3) an algorithm based on the weighted PageRank is proposed to analyze the dependencies between requirements, allowing the objective dependencies to be automatically transformed into partial order relations; and 4) an integrated requirements prioritization method is developed to amend the stakeholders’ subjective preferences with the objective requirements dependencies and make the process of prioritization more reasonable and applicable. A controlled experiment performed to validate the effectiveness of DRank based on comparisons with Case Based Ranking, Analytical Hierarchy Process, and EVOLVE. The results demonstrate that DRank is less time-consuming and more effective than alternative approaches. A simulation experiment demonstrates that taking requirement dependencies into consideration can improve the accuracy of the final prioritization sequence. © 2016","Link analysis; Machine learning; Requirements dependency; Software requirements prioritization","Artificial intelligence; Requirements engineering; Trees (mathematics); Analytical Hierarchy Process; Integrated requirements; Link analysis; Partial order relation; Requirement dependencies; Requirements dependencies; Requirements prioritization; Software requirements; Learning systems",2-s2.0-85006086282

The first approach is called Annealing Search Heuristic with Backpropagation and flexible output (AsHB flex) and uses machine learning concepts to update the amplifier gains through an iterative process. The second one (Exhaustive Method) uses an exhaustive search to evaluate all possible solutions for the problem and obtain the optimum solution. The last one (MaxGain) is a heuristic method that uses previous knowledge about the problem to obtain the solutions. The amplifier characteristics and specifications were obtained experimentally through measurements of gain, noise figure, gain ripple and power consumption on commercially available EDFAs. We performed comparisons among these approaches and others found in the literature, and the results show that the three proposals outperformed the previous ones in terms of noise figure, gain ripple and BER. For example, in a link with four amplifiers the Exhaustive Method achieved a reduction in the cascade noise figure from 10.05 to 5.18 dB, a reduction in the gain ripple from 24.08 to 18.56 dB and a reduction in the BER in almost two orders of magnitude, when compared with the traditional approach, which defines the gain to compensate the loss of the previous link. However, the computation time of Exhaustive Method becomes prohibitive as the number of amplifiers in the link increases. Both MaxGain and AsHBflex obtained similar solutions, close to the optimum operation point in a reasonable time. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptive control of operating point; Dynamic optical network; Heuristics; Machine learning; Optical amplifier; Optical communication","Adaptive control systems; Adaptive optics; Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Fiber amplifiers; Fiber optic networks; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Light amplifiers; Noise figure; Optical communication; Optimization; Dynamic optical networks; Heuristics; Operating points; Optimum operations; Orders of magnitude; Performance enhancements; Search heuristics; Traditional approaches; Erbium doped fiber amplifiers",2-s2.0-84969850950

However, no study has been conducted using a closed-loop system specifically designed for sedation in patients under spinal anesthesia. We developed an automatic anesthesia sedation system that allows for closed-loop delivery of propofol for sedation integrating a decision support system, called the hybrid sedation system (HSS). The objective of this study is to compare this system with standard practice. One hundred fifty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: HSS-Group (N = 75), in which propofol was administered using a closed-loop system; Control Group (N = 75), in which propofol was delivered manually. The clinical performance of the propofol sedation control is defined as efficacy to maintain bispectral index (BIS) near 65. The clinical control was called ‘Excellent’, ‘Good’, ‘Poor’ and ‘Inadequate’ with BIS values within 10 %, from 11 to 20 %, 21 to 30 %, or greater than 30 % of the BIS target of 65, respectively. The controller performance was evaluated using Varvel’s parameters. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, groups were compared using t test or Chi square test, P < 0.05. Clinical performance of sedation showed ‘Excellent’ control in the HSS-group for a significantly longer period of time (49 vs. 26 % in the control group, P < 0.0001). ‘Poor’ and ‘Inadequate’ sedation was significantly shorter in the HSS Group compared to the Control Group (11 and 10 % vs. 20 and 18 %, respectively, P < 0.0001).

Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been in existence for over 50 years. While the literature points to positive impacts on quality and patient safety, outcomes, and the avoidance of medical errors, technical and regulatory challenges continue to retard their rate of integration into clinical care processes and thus delay the refinement of diagnoses towards personalized care. We conducted a systematic review of pertinent articles in the MEDLINE, US Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Health Research and Quality, and US Food and Drug Administration databases, using a Boolean approach to combine terms germane to the discussion (clinical decision support, tools, systems, critical care, trauma, outcome, cost savings, NSQIP, APACHE, SOFA, ICU, and diagnostics). References were selected on the basis of both temporal and thematic relevance, and subsequently aggregated around four distinct themes: the uses of CDSS in the critical and surgical care settings, clinical insertion challenges, utilization leading to cost-savings, and regulatory concerns. Precision diagnosis is the accurate and timely explanation of each patient’s health problem and further requires communication of that explanation to patients and surrogate decision-makers. Both accuracy and timeliness are essential to critical care, yet computed decision support systems (CDSS) are scarce. The limitation arises from the technical complexity associated with integrating and filtering large data sets from diverse sources. Provider mistrust and resistance coupled with the absence of clear guidance from regulatory bodies further retard acceptance of CDSS. While challenges to develop and deploy CDSS are substantial, the clinical, quality, and economic impacts warrant the effort, especially in disciplines requiring complex decision-making, such as critical and surgical care. Improving diagnosis in health care requires accumulation, validation and transformation of data into actionable information. The aggregate of those processes—CDSS—is currently primitive. Despite technical and regulatory challenges, the apparent clinical and economic utilities of CDSS must lead to greater engagement. These tools play the key role in realizing the vision of a more ‘personalized medicine’, one characterized by individualized precision diagnosis rather than population-based risk-stratification. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CDSS; Clinical decision support systems; Complex care; Critical care; Healthcare analytics; Personalized medicine","Aggregates; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Diagnosis; Health care; Intensive care units; Metadata; Surgery; CDSS; Clinical decision support systems; Complex care; Critical care; Personalized medicines; Decision support systems; clinical decision making; clinical decision support system; cost control; diagnostic accuracy; health care; health care utilization; human; intensive care; priority journal; Review; surgery; total quality management; algorithm; device approval; devices; economics; equipment design; food and drug administration; health care cost; intensive care; intraoperative monitoring; medical error; patient safety; personalized medicine; physiologic monitoring; prevention and control; procedures; reproducibility; risk; signal processing; treatment outcome; United States; Algorithms; Critical Care; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Device Approval; Equipment Design; Health Care Costs; Humans; Medical Errors; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Monitoring, Physiologic; Patient Safety; Precision Medicine; Reproducibility of Results; Risk; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",2-s2.0-84959116176

In this paper, we seek to challenge this tendency, and to explore the ways in which explicit consideration of the plurality of big data might inform particular instances of its exploitation. We compare one currently popular big data-inspired innovation - learning analytics - with three other big data contexts - the physical sciences, business intelligence and public health. Through these comparisons, we highlight some dangers of learning analytics implemented without substantial theoretical, ethical and design effort. In so doing, we also highlight just how plural data, analytical approaches and intentions are, and suggest that each new big data context needs to be recognized in its own singularity. © First Monday.",,,2-s2.0-85017136653

These algorithms provide immensely helpful results which have a wide scope of application starting from simple decision problems to complex business intelligence aspects. This paper attempts to apply the same concept of FP mining to solve the location management problem of global system for mobile communication (GSM) networks. In GSM networks, the task of keeping track of a mobile user (MU) and relaying an incoming call is called location management. It basically includes two processes, location update, and paging. Location update deals with managing the current location of the MUs. There are many approaches to do this such as time based, movement based, and distance based. In this paper, the location update procedure relies on the collected data of user movements from one network cell to another cell. These data have a definite pattern, as in daily life a person mostly has a fixed route of traveling, e.g. home to office in the morning and office to home in the evening. During this movement, he crosses a specific set of network cells which remains same throughout the week. Thus, FP mining algorithm can be applied on the user’s mobility log and try to find out the most probable location where the MU could be found. Using the results, a dynamic location area for individual user’s current location can be created. Thus, minimizing cost related to location update which otherwise involves communication between the mobile handset and the base station, and calculations related to keeping track of the location of MUs. © 2017 The Authors.","Apriori algorithm; Dynamic location area; Frequent pattern mining; Global system for mobile communication","calculation; human; mining; travel",2-s2.0-85025476121

In existing studies, a common approach to destination prediction is to match the given query trajectory with massive recorded trajectories by similarity calculation. Unfortunately, due to privacy concerns, budget constraints, and many other factors, in most circumstances, we can only obtain a sparse trajectory dataset. In sparse dataset, the available moving trajectories are far from enough to cover all possible query trajectories; thus the predictability of the matching-based approach will decrease remarkably. Toward destination prediction with sparse dataset, instead of searching similar trajectories over the sparse records, we alternatively examine the changes of distances from sampling locations to final destination on query trajectory. The underlying idea is intuitive: It is directly motivated by travel purpose, people always get closer to the final destination during the movement. By borrowing the conception of gradient descent in optimization theory, we propose a novel moving destination prediction approach, namely MGDPre. Building upon the mobility gradient descent, MGDPre only investigates the behavior characteristics of query trajectory itself without matching historical trajectories, and thus is applicable for sparse dataset. We evaluate our approach based on extensive experiments, using GPS trajectories generated by a sample of taxis over a 10-day period in Shenzhen city, China. The results demonstrate that the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our approach outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods. © 2017 ACM.","Gradient descent; Markov transition model; Moving destination prediction; Space division; Sparse dataset","Budget control; Forecasting; Optimization; Site selection; Behavior characteristic; Gradient descent; Location-based applications; Optimization theory; Similarity calculation; Space division; Sparse dataset; Transition model; Trajectories",2-s2.0-85018464122

These sensor nodes and cluster heads adapt to topological changes in the network graph over time. One of the major challenges with employing CWSNs is to maximize the lifetime of the networks. The ABCC algorithm is able to reduce and balance the energy consumption of nodes across the networks. Artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization is attractive for this application as the cognitive behaviors of artificial bees match perfectly with the intrinsic dynamics in cognitive wireless sensor networks. Additionally, it employs fewer control parameters compared to other heuristic algorithms, making identification of optimal parameter settings easier. Simulation results illustrate that the ABCC algorithm outperforms particle swarm optimisation (PSO), group search optimization (GSO), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), LEACH-centralized (LEACH-C), and hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering (HEED) for energy management in CWSNs. Our proposed algorithm is increasingly superior to these other approaches as the number of nodes in the network grows. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial Bee Colony (ABC); Clustering; Clustering evaluation model; Cognitive Wireless Sensor Network (CWSN); Cognitively inspired algorithm","Cognitive systems; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Leaching; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensor nodes; Topology; Wireless sensor networks; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Clustering; Clustering evaluation; Cognitive wireless sensor networks; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Optimal parameter settings; Particle swarm optimisation; Clustering algorithms",2-s2.0-85009476805

Technical challenges confronting process systems engineers in developing enabling tools and techniques are discussed regarding flexibility and uncertainty, responsiveness and agility, robustness and security, the prediction of mixture properties and function, and new modeling and mathematics paradigms. Exploiting intelligence from big data to drive agility will require tackling new challenges, such as how to ensure the consistency and confidentiality of data through long and complex supply chains. Modeling challenges also exist, and involve ensuring that all key aspects are properly modeled, particularly where health, safety, and environmental concerns require accurate predictions of small but critical amounts at specific locations. Environmental concerns will require us to keep a closer track on all molecular species so that they are optimally used to create sustainable solutions.

Moreover, data transmission through the network is one of the most expensive operations in a distributed system. Therefore, reduction of network usage is highly required by a new graph computational model. In this paper, increasing the degree of machine independency has been considered a key factor of network traffic reduction. The proposed system benefits from a three-layered computational model to perfectly leverage the power of local information as much as possible. Moreover, this model simultaneously takes the advantages of both message-based and shared-state communication paradigms. Vertices can read and update values of others in the lowest layer directly, while they must send messages in other layers. By the use of memorization techniques, the proposed model introduces a new kind of intelligence that has encouraging effects on removing useless communications. Distinctive results of our experiments confirm significant improvements of the proposed model in relation to the previous systems like Pregel, GPS, and Blogel, as well as ExPregel. The results also show that the overhead of making processes independent along with intelligent is negligible in comparison with the cost of additional network communications. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Block-centric model; Distributed computing; Graph processing; Pregel; Vertex-centric model","Computation theory; Computational methods; Communication paradigm; Computational model; Distributed systems; Graph processing; Local information; Natural properties; Network communications; Pregel; Distributed computer systems",2-s2.0-84982243222

Spinners exhibiting at the fairs reported that they had made good sales of yarns for the luxury end of the knitwear market, and a number of spinners at Filo-a fair held in Milan, Italy, which deals mainly in yarns for woven and jersey fabrics-commented that the business transacted was better than they had expected. That said, these impressions contrasted with figures showing that sales of wool, cotton and linen yarns by the Italian yarn industry fell by 2.6% in 2016 compared with 2015 while exports were down by an estimated 4.5%. The quality of the yarns on offer from European spinners continues to be improved by technical advances in spinning techniques. Also, as a result of the use of new mixes and blends, many of the yarns at the fairs for the spring/summer 2018 season were more versatile and suitable for more than one season. Another notable feature of the knitwear yarns and knitwear samples on show was their fineness and transparency, and all the yarns on show seemed smoother and more refined than in previous seasons. This impression even extended to linen yarns, which had lost their natural rusticity. A further development is that of improvements by spinners in the environmental sustainability of their materials and operations as a result of pressure from their customers. In particular, a number of spinners have set about removing some of the chemical substances which were formerly used in processing and more of them are collaborating with the Greenpeace Detox campaign, which is aimed at removing the use of noxious chemicals in the fashion industry. They have been helped in their efforts by research conducted by the Consorzio Italiano Implementazione Detox (CID-Italian Detox Improvement Consortium), which offers training and management advice on how to achieve traceable and measurable results. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2017.",,"Commerce; Flax; Indicators (chemical); Knit fabrics; Linen; Sales; Sustainable development; Weaving; Wool; Yarn; Chemical substance; Economic uncertainty; Environmental sustainability; Fashion industry; Greenpeace; Milan , Italy; Spinning technique; Technical advances; Spinning (fibers)",2-s2.0-85018400780

Research has indicated that individuals with better critical thinking disposition can better recognize and regulate their emotions, though the neuroanatomical mechanisms involved in this process remain to be elucidated. Further, the influence of emotional intelligence on the relationship between brain structure and critical thinking disposition has not been examined. The present study utilized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate the neural structures underlying critical thinking disposition in a large sample of college students (N = 296). Regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the bilateral temporal pole, which reflects an individual’s ability to process social and emotional information, was negatively correlated with critical thinking disposition. In addition, rGMV in bilateral para hippocampal regions —regions involved in contextual association/emotional regulation—exhibited negative correlation with critical thinking disposition. Further analysis revealed that emotional intelligence moderated the relationship between rGMV of the temporal pole and critical thinking disposition. Specifically, critical thinking disposition was associated with decreased GMV of the temporal pole for individuals who have relatively higher emotional intelligence rather than lower emotional intelligence. The results of the present study indicate that people who have higher emotional intelligence exhibit more effective and automatic processing of emotional information and tend to be strong critical thinkers. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Critical thinking; Emotional intelligence; Gray matter volume; Temporal pole; Voxel-based morphometry",,2-s2.0-85016429098

In particular, a university campus, which is one of the highest power consuming institutions, shows a wide variation of electric load depending on time and environment. For stable operation of such institution, reliable electric power supply should be guaranteed. One of possible methods to do that is to forecast the electric load accurately and supply power accordingly. Even though various influencing factors of power consumption have been discovered for educational institutions by analyzing power consumption patterns and usage cases, further studies are required for the quantitative forecasting of their electric load. In this paper, we build a power consumption forecasting model using various machine learning algorithms. To evaluate their effectiveness, we consider four building clusters in a university and collect their power consumption data of 15-min interval over more than one year. For the data, we first extract features based on the periodic characteristic and then perform the principal component analysis and factor analysis for the features. We build two electric load forecasting models using artificial neural network and support vector regression. We evaluate the prediction performance of each forecasting model by 5-fold cross-validation and compare the prediction result to actual electric load. The experimental results show that the two forecasting models can achieve average error rate of 3.46–10 % for all clusters. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Artificial neural network; Forecasting model; Machine learning; Power consumption prediction; Principal component analysis; Support vector regression","Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Societies and institutions; Consumption patterns; Educational institutions; Electric power consumption; Forecasting modeling; Forecasting models; Prediction performance; Reliable electric power; Support vector regression (SVR); Electric load forecasting",2-s2.0-85016420609

Tens of thousands of food delivery orders share the resources of hundreds of delivering staff in a single city. How to assign the orders to delivering staff considering cost and service level becomes a vital operational problem for major food delivery platforms competing in the market. In this paper, the higher-level order assignment problem and the lower-level routing problem are solved simultaneously. Two GA based meta-heuristic methods, hierarchical and integrated, are developed for identifying a near-optimal solution for the problem.

Different aspects of potential for excellence were taken into account, including intelligence, creativity, first-year grade point average (GPA), and personality. A structural equation modeling analysis was applied. The findings demonstrated that only GPA had a negative influence on students’ collaborative values, indicating that the assumption that students with a higher potential for excellence are less motivated to collaborate receives limited support. In addition, the findings showed that different aspects of potential for excellence were related to different aspects of motivation to collaborate.

In addition, good data science is not just rote application of trainable skill sets; it requires the ability to think flexibly about all these areas and understand the connections between them. This book provides a crash course in data science, combining all the necessary skills into a unified discipline. Unlike many analytics books, computer science and software engineering are given extensive coverage since they play such a central role in the daily work of a data scientist. The author also describes classic machine learning algorithms, from their mathematical foundations to real-world applications. Visualization tools are reviewed, and their central importance in data science is highlighted. Classical statistics is addressed to help readers think critically about the interpretation of data and its common pitfalls. The clear communication of technical results, which is perhaps the most undertrained of data science skills, is given its own chapter, and all topics are explained in the context of solving real-world data problems. The book also features: Extensive sample code and tutorials using Python along with its technical libraries Core technologies of ""Big Data,"" including their strengths and limitations and how they can be used to solve real-world problems Coverage of the practical realities of the tools, keeping theory to a minimum; however, when theory is presented, it is done in an intuitive way to encourage critical thinking and creativity A wide variety of case studies from industry Practical advice on the realities of being a data scientist today, including the overall workflow, where time is spent, the types of datasets worked on, and the skill sets needed The Data Science Handbook is an ideal resource for data analysis methodology and big data software tools. The book is appropriate for people who want to practice data science, but lack the required skill sets. This includes software professionals who need to better understand analytics and statisticians who need to understand software.

Increased gyrification is associated with higher scores on cognitive tasks in adults; however, the degree to which this relationship is independent of cortical surface area remains undefined. This study investigates whether regional variation in gyrification is associated with domain-general and domain-specific cognition. Our hypothesis is that increased local gyrification confers a functional advantage that is independent of surface area. To quantify regional gyrification, we computed the local gyrification index (LGI) at each vertex and averaged across a bilateral parietal-frontal region associated with general intelligence and reasoning (Jung and Haier 2007). A sample of 48 healthy adults (24 males/24 females; ages 18–68 years) completed a high-resolution 3 T T1-weighted MRI and standardized administration of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). We found a positive correlation between cortical gyrification and working memory, which remained significant after controlling for cortical surface area. Results suggest that a higher degree of local cortical folding confers a functional advantage that is independent from surface area and evident for more dynamic or “fluid” cognitive processes (i.e., working memory) rather than over-learned or “crystallized” cognitive processes. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Brain-structure function; Cortical folding; Neuroanatomy; Neuroimaging; Working memory",,2-s2.0-85015030551

Users' emotional state extracted from social media contains business information and business value for decision making. Social media platforms, such as Sina Weibo or Twitter, provide a vast source of information, which include user feedbacks, opinions and information on most issues. Many organizations also leverage social media platforms to publish information about events, products, services, policies and other topics frequently, analyzing social media data to identify abnormal events and make decisions in a timely manner is a beneficial topic. This paper adopts the multivariate Gauss distribution with the power-law distribution to model and analyze the users' emotion of micro-blogs and detect abnormal emotion state. With the measure of joint probability density value and the validation of the corpus, anomaly detection accuracy of individual user is 83.49% and of different month is 87.84% by this method. Through the distribution test, the results show that individual users' neutral, happy and sad emotions obey the normal distribution, but the surprised and angry emotions do not. Besides, emotions of micro-blogs released by groups obey power-law distribution, but the individual emotions do not. This paper proposes a quantitative method for abnormal emotion detection on social media, which automatically captures the correlation between different features of the emotions, and saves a certain amount of time by batch calculation of the joint probability density of data sets.

These changes have acquired great relevance among the factors involved in studying audit quality. Thus, the present study analyzed the effect of the normative change that took place in Spain in December 2010, related to opinions modified for going-concern uncertainties. Until that date, the auditor’s uncertainty about the company’s going-concern status led to a qualified opinion. However, under the new regulation, it became an opinion that included an explanatory paragraph stating the reasons for concern, which was considered less serious. In all, 152 small- and medium-sized enterprises that had begun bankruptcy proceedings were studied. Expert systems were used for their analysis, based on classification trees assembled through boosting and bagging. In addition, the logistic regression was used as baseline to compare previous methods. The main result obtained was that a change in the norm that catalogs the going-concern issue as less serious made auditors more likely to report this situation, thus questioning the audit quality. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Audit quality; Bagging; Boosting; Classification trees; Normative changes; Reliable image",,2-s2.0-85014779885

The deployment of various sensing devices plays an essential part in achieving this goal. Nevertheless, data generated by this deployment needs to be well managed so that it can be leveraged for operational improvement. Data aggregation is perceived as an important technique for managing data in the SG in general, and in its Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in particular. Indeed, data aggregation techniques have been used in order to reduce communication overhead in SG networks. However, in order to fully take advantage of the aggregation process, some level of intelligence should be introduced at concentrator nodes to make the network more responsive to local conditions. Moreover, by using a more meaningful aggregation technique, entities can be accurately informed of any disturbance. This paper contributes an agent-based approach for data and energy management in an SG. It also proposes CoDA, a correlation-based data aggregation technique designed for the AMI.

Tremendous success of these algorithms in providing near optimal solutions has inspired the researchers to develop new algorithms. However, very limited efforts have been made to identify the best algorithms for diverse classes of problems. This work attempts to assess the efficacy of five contemporary nature-inspired algorithms i.e. bat algorithm (BA), artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), cuckoo search algorithm (CS), firefly algorithm (FA) and flower pollination algorithm (FPA). The work evaluates the performance of these algorithms on CEC2014 30 benchmark functions which include unimodal, multimodal, hybrid and composite problems over 10, 30, 50 and 100 dimensions. Control parameters of all algorithms are self-adapted so as to obtain best results over benchmark functions. The algorithms have been evaluated along three perspectives (a) statistical significance using Wilcoxon rank sum test (b) computational time complexity (c) convergence rate of algorithms. Experimental results and analysis revealed that ABC algorithm perform best for majority of the problems on high dimension, while on small dimension, CS is the best choice. FPA attain the next best position follow by BA and FA for all kinds of functions. Self adaptation of above algorithms also revealed the best values of input parameters for various algorithms.

This article identifies and discusses three key challenges in designing and managing CBBMs: determining (1) the crowd's value to the firm, (2) how to create superior value for the crowd, and (3) how to capture value from the crowd effectively. Building on the crowd capital perspective and an analysis of the tactics and practices of successful CBBMs, this article offers propositions on how to overcome these challenges and manage such business models effectively. The identified practices can inspire decision makers when designing innovative CBBMs for their industries.

Second, while KPIs are defined by decision makers, their implementation is performed by IT specialists. This often results in discrepancies that are difficult to identify. In this paper, we propose an approach that provides decision makers with an integrated view of strategic business objectives and conceptual data warehouse KPIs. The main benefit of our proposal is that it links strategic business models to the data for monitoring and assessing them.

The fundamental analysis includes looking at any information, other than the trading patterns of the stock itself, which can affect the cost and the perceived value of a stock. Technical analysis is an exchanging apparatus utilized to assess securities and endeavor to forecast their future development by breaking down insights accumulated from exchanging action, such as price movement and volume. This system utilizes data mining techniques to analyze various stock information and the factors to create a logical decision model. This helps new and inexperienced investors to make less errors as well as make the stock market more approachable to the general community. This research focuses on a high performance stock selection using the fundamental analysis of individual stocks, which is reflected in the financial statements. Ten criteria calculated from stock financial statement reports are proposed for the analysis. The 10 years of historical fundamental information on organizations recorded in Thailand stock exchange were clustered into three groups and used the fundamental criteria to classify the interesting return stocks selection. The multilayer perceptron neural network is used in the training process to verify the clustering results. For the technical analysis, experimental results reveal that the exponential moving average technique is the most favorable and thus being selected to apply in our system. To affirm the productivity of the suggested stocks, an experiment using information from the system’s decision model based on the Stock Exchange of Thailand data in the year 2015 is conducted. After the activities from 5000 simulated portfolios, the average returns of the ports are positive. In fact, the ports gain almost three times higher than the average market yield.

Indeed, the scientific method is rapidly being complemented and even replaced in some fields by data-driven approaches to knowledge discovery. This paradigm shift is sometimes referred to as the ""fourth paradigm"" of data-intensive and data-enabled scientific discovery. Interdisciplinary research with a hard emphasis on translational outcomes is becoming the norm in all large-scale scientific endeavors. Yet, graduate education remains largely focused on individual achievement within a single scientific domain, with little training in team-based, interdisciplinary data-oriented approaches designed to translate scientific data into new solutions to today's critical challenges. In this article, we propose a new pedagogy for graduate education: data-centered learning for the domain-data scientist. Our approach is based on four tenets: (1) Graduate training must incorporate interdisciplinary training that couples the domain sciences with data science. (2) Graduate training must prepare students for work in data-enabled research teams. (3) Graduate training must include education in teaming and leadership skills for the data scientist. (4) Graduate training must provide experiential training through academic/industry practicums and internships. We emphasize that this approach is distinct from today's graduate training, which offers training in either data science or a domain science (e.g., biology, sociology, political science, economics, and medicine), but does not integrate the two within a single curriculum designed to prepare the next generation of domain-data scientists. We are in the process of implementing the proposed pedagogy through the development of a new graduate curriculum based on the above four tenets, and we describe herein our strategy, progress, and lessons learned. While our pedagogy was developed in the context of graduate education, the general approach of data-centered learning can and should be applied to students and professionals at any stage of their education, including at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels. We believe that the time is right to embed data-centered learning within our educational system and, thus, generate the talent required to fully harness the potential of big data. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","big data analytics; big data infrastructure design; big data training; business intelligence; data science; graduate education; scientific discovery; team science",,2-s2.0-85016420133

Previous studies have shown that, in a real-world scenario, the use of single sensors do not provide an accurate emotional assessment. Hence, in this study, we propose a framework that takes into account multiple sensors so that conclusions can be drawn about the emotional state of the user at the time of interaction. The proposed multi-sensing approach includes several inputs from users (such as speech, facial movements, and everyday activities), and uses an artificial intelligent strategy to map these different responses into one or more emotional states. The Componential Emotion Theory and Scherer’s Emotional Semantic Space are used to underpin the theoretical framework.

Correlational analysis showed that in male and female adolescents, shame traumatic memories are associated with more depressive symptoms and with lower levels of self-compassion and emotional intelligence. Multigroup analysis showed that emotional intelligence has a greater impact on depression in female adolescents.

For this purpose, the plethora of data stored by public administrations becomes an incredibly rich source of insight and information due to its volume and diversity. However, it was only with the Open Government Movement when governments have been concerned with the need to open their data to citizens and businesses. Thus, with the emergence of open data portals, these myriad of data enables the development of new business models. The achievement of the benefits sought by making this data available triggers new challenges to cope with the diversity of sources involved. The business potential could be jeopardized by the scarcity of relevant data in the different blocks and domains that makes a city and by the lack of a common approach to data publication, in terms of format, content, etc. This paper introduces a holistic approach that relies on the Smart City Ontology as the cornerstone to standardise and structure data. This approach, which is proposed to be an analytical tool to assess the potential of data in a given smart city, analyses three main aspects: availability of data, the criteria that data should fulfil to be considered eligible and the model used to structure and organise data. The approach has been applied to the case of Brussels Capital Region, which first results are presented and discussed in this paper. The main conclusion that has been obtained is that, besides its commitment with open data and smart cities, Brussels is not mature enough to fully exploit the real intelligence that smart cities could provide.

These findings illustrate that when required to make their own choices, autistic people demonstrate rigidity at different performance levels, suggesting that intentional control mechanisms might be important for a better understanding of behavioural rigidity in autism. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Autism; Cognitive control; Intentions; Task switching; Voluntary action","adolescent; adult; Article; Asperger syndrome; association; autism; behavior; behavioral rigidity; cognition; controlled study; executive function; female; Full Scale Intelligence Quotient; health care cost; human; intellectual assessment; intelligence quotient; intelligence test; major clinical study; male; measurement error; mental patient; patient decision making; pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified; priority journal; response time; stimulus response; task performance; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; Wechsler intelligence scale for children; autism; case control study; decision making; psychology; self control; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Choice Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Self-Control; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85008677005

Over the last decade, a large number of variants of ABC have been proposed, making it by now a well-studied swarm intelligence algorithm. Typically, in a paper on algorithmic variants of ABC algorithms, one or at most two of its algorithmic components are modified. Possible changes include variations on the search equations, the selection of candidate solutions to be explored, or the adoption of features from other algorithmic techniques. In this article, we propose to follow a different direction and to build a generalized ABC algorithm, which we call ABC-X. ABC-X collects algorithmic components available from known ABC algorithms into a common algorithm framework that allows not only to instantiate known ABC variants but, more importantly, also many ABC algorithm variants that have never been explored before in the literature.

Suspended load comprises sand + silt + clay-sized particles that are held in suspension due to the turbulence and will only settle when the stream velocity decreases, such as when the streambed becomes flatter, or the streamflow into a pond or lake. The sources of the suspended sediments are the sediments transported from the river basin by runoff or wind and the eroded sediments of the river bed and banks. Suspended-sediment load is a key indicator for assessing the effect of land use changes, water quality studies and engineering practices in watercourses. Measuring suspended sediment in streams is real sampling and the collection process is both complex and expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence methods have been used as a predictor for hydrological phenomenon namely to estimate the amount of suspended sediment. In this paper the abilities of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models among the artificial intelligence methods have been investigated to estimate the suspended sediment load (SSL) in Ispir Bridge gauging station on Coruh River (station number: 2316). Coruh River is located in the northern east part of Turkey and it is one of the world”s the fastest, the deepest and the largest rivers of the Coruh Basin. In this study, in order to estimate the suspended sediment load, different combinations of the streamflow and the SSL were used as the model inputs. Its results accuracy was compared with the results of conventional correlation coefficient analysis between input and output variables and the best combination was identified. Finally, in order to predict SSL, the SVM, ANFIS and various ANNs models were used. The reliability of SVM, ANFIS and ANN models were determined based on performance criteria such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Efficiency Coefficient (EC) and Determination Coefficient (R2). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adaptive network based fuzzy inference system; Artificial neural network; Coruh River; Support vector machine; Suspended sediment load","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent control; Land use; Mean square error; Neural networks; Rivers; Sediment transport; Sediments; Stream flow; Support vector machines; Suspensions (fluids); Water quality; Adaptive network based fuzzy inference system; Artificial intelligence methods; Artificial neural network models; Correlation coefficient; Determination coefficients; Hydrological phenomenon; Root mean square errors; Suspended sediment loads; Suspended sediments; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; bedload; fluvial deposit; fuzzy mathematics; sediment transport; support vector machine; suspended sediment; Coruh River",2-s2.0-85012191686

Meanwhile, with the long-term development and evolution of business in many application domains, some service domain features (such as priori, correlation and similarity) are usually formed, which have strong influences on solving SOPs. Unfortunately, the existing research efforts on SOPs primarily concentrate on designing general algorithms for specific problems without considering the service domain features. This often leads to undesirable results of SOPs. Therefore, how to design a paradigm of service domain-oriented optimization algorithms with service domain features becomes a challenge for providing optimization strategies and algorithms to solve SOPs effectively. By considering the influences of service domain features on solving SOPs, this paper proposes a set of service domain-oriented artificial bee colony algorithms (S-ABC) based on the optimization mechanism of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method. Furthermore, by configuring the items and parameters of the S-ABC paradigm in detail, optimization algorithms for particular SOPs (e.g., service selection and composition) could be derived. In this paper, the superiority of our proposed S-ABC is verified through solving concurrent service selection and service composition problem. By exploiting the artificial bee colony algorithms for the optimization problems in service domains, this work makes novel contributions for solving SOPs, as well as extends the theory of the swarm intelligence optimization. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Algorithm paradigm; Artificial bee colony; Service domain features; Service optimization problems; Service selection and service composition","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computation theory; Distributed computer systems; Quality of service; Social sciences computing; Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Artificial bee colony algorithms; Service compositions; Service domain; Service optimization; Service resource scheduling; Swarm intelligence optimization; Optimization",2-s2.0-84994226518

Aim: To evaluate persistence of learning impairment in prior HE compared to those who never experienced HE (no-HE) in a multicenter study. Methods: A total of 174 outpatient cirrhotics from three centers (94 Virginia, 30 Ohio, and 50 Rome; 36 prior HE) underwent psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) and inhibitory control (ICT) testing at baseline and then at least 7 days apart. ICT learning (change in 2nd half lures compared to 1st half) was compared between patient groups at both visits. Change in the PHES individual sub-tests and total score between visits was compared in both groups. US versus Italian trends were also analyzed. Results: HE patients had worse PHES and ICT results compared to no-HE patients at baseline. Significant improvement (1st half 7.1 vs. 2nd half 6.2, p < 0.0001) was observed in no-HE, but not in HE (1st half 7.9 vs. 2nd half 7.8, p = 0.1) at baseline. At retesting (median 20 days later), no-HE patients continued with significant learning (1st half 6.0 vs. 2nd half 5.4, p < 0.0001), while HE patients again did not improve (1st half 7.8 vs. 2nd half 6.9, p = 0.37). Between visits, no-HE patients improved significantly on four PHES sub-tests and overall score, while HE patients only improved on two sub-tests with similar overall PHES score. Trends were similar between US and Italian subjects. Conclusion: In this multicenter study, prior HE patients showed persistent significant learning impairment compared to those without prior HE, despite adequate medical therapy. This persistent change should increase efforts to reduce the first HE episode. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cirrhosis; Inhibitory control test; Lactulose; Psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score; Rifaximin","lactulose; rifaximin; gastrointestinal agent; adult; Article; comparative study; constipation; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; electrolyte disturbance; eradication therapy; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; gastrointestinal infection; hepatic encephalopathy; hospitalization; human; human tissue; Italy; learning disorder; liver cirrhosis; liver disease; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental health; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; multicenter study; Ohio; patient education; priority journal; prospective study; psychometry; quality of life; trail making test; Virginia; aged; clinical trial; cognition; complication; hepatic encephalopathy; intelligence test; Learning Disorders; liver cirrhosis; mental capacity; pathophysiology; procedures; psychology; United States; Aged; Cognition; Female; Gastrointestinal Agents; Hepatic Encephalopathy; Humans; Intelligence Tests; Italy; Lactulose; Learning Disorders; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Mental Competency; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; United States",2-s2.0-85007508355

A conditional connects a consequence which holds given a precondition. It can be easily recognized in natural languages with certain key words, like “if” in English. A vast amount of literature in both fields, both artificial intelligence and psychology, deals with the questions of how such conditionals can be best represented and how these conditionals can model human reasoning. On the other hand, findings in the psychology of reasoning, such as those in the Suppression Task, have led to a paradigm shift from the monotonicity assumptions in human inferences towards nonmonotonic reasoning. Nonmonotonic reasoning is sensitive for information change, that is, inferences are drawn cautiously such that retraction of previous information is not required with the addition of new information. While many formalisms of nonmonotonic reasoning have been proposed in the field of Artificial Intelligence, their capability to model properties of human reasoning has not yet been extensively investigated. In this paper, we analyzed systematically from both a formal and an empirical perspective the power of formal nonmonotonic systems to model (i) possible explicit defeaters, as in the Suppression Task, and (ii) more implicit conditional rules that trigger nonmonotonic reasoning by the keywords in such rules. The results indicated that the classical evaluation for the correctness of inferences has to be extended in the three major aspects (i) regarding the inference system, (ii) the knowledge base, and (iii) possible assumed exceptions for the rule. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cognitive modeling; Cognitive systems; Defeasible reasoning; Human reasoning; Knowledge representation; Nonmonotonic logic; Reasoning; Suppression task","Artificial intelligence; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Cognitive model; Defeasible reasoning; Human reasoning; Nonmonotonic logic; Reasoning; Suppression task; Cognitive systems",2-s2.0-85013660826

We argue that when employees use IT to share and access work-related experiences openly across organizations, their expectations and assessments of workplaces change. We collected 38,000 reviews of the highest and lowest ranked employers on Glassdoor, an online crowdsourced employer branding platform. Using IBM Watson to analyze the data, we identify seven employer branding value propositions that current, former, and potential employees care about when they collectively evaluate employers. These propositions include (1) social elements of work, (2) interesting and challenging work tasks, (3) the extent to which skills can be applied in meaningful ways, (4) opportunities for professional development, (5) economic issues tied to compensation, (6) the role of management, and (7) work/life balance. We clarify that these value propositions do not all matter to the same extent and demonstrate how their relative valences and weights differ across organizations, especially if institutions are considered particularly good or bad places to work. Based on these findings, we show how employers can use crowdsourced employer branding intelligence to become great places to work that attract highly qualified employees. © 2016 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Artificial intelligence; Crowdsourcing; Employee engagement; Employer attractiveness; Employer branding; Glassdoor; Human resource management; IBM Watson",,2-s2.0-85010698083

There are no data from which to nominate the most effective, efficient and reliable wildlife health signals for public health planning, but there is growing opinion that wildlife health could signal public health vulnerability related to climate change. The objective of this commentary is to explore the potential for wildlife to contribute to climate change early warning for public health protection in Canada. Wildlife impact many determinants of human health through both direct and indirect mechanisms; several of which are strongly interconnected. There is a long history of wildlife serving as bio-sentinels for environmental pollutants and pathogens. Wildlife health could support public health threat detection, risk assessment and risk communication by detecting and tracking infectious and non-infectious hazards, being bio-sentinels of effects of new or changed hazards, providing biologically understandable information to motivate changes in personal risk behaviours and providing insights into new and unanticipated threats. Public health risk communication and strategic planning priorities for climate change could benefit from a wildlife health intelligence system that collects data on incidents of disease and hazard discovery as well as information on social and environmental conditions that affect risk perception and likelihoods of human exposure or harms. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Animals; Biohazards; Digital storage; Hazards; Health; Health hazards; Health risks; Public health; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Climate change adaptation; Early Warning System; Environmental pollutants; Intelligence systems; Preparedness and response; Public health preparedness; Public health protection; Social and environmental; Climate change; climate change; early warning system; environmental conditions; global perspective; health risk; public health; risk assessment; risk perception; vulnerability; wildfire; Canada",2-s2.0-85009290069

Despite the availability of big data from these digital footprints, research into social media science communication is scant. This paper presents a novel empirical study into the features of engaging science-related social media messages, focusing on space science communications. It is hypothesised that these messages contain certain psycholinguistic features that are unique to the field of space science. We built a predictive model to forecast the engagement levels of social media posts. By using four feature sets (n-grams, psycholinguistics, grammar and social media), we were able to achieve prediction accuracies in the vicinity of 90% using three supervised learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, linear classifier and decision tree). We conducted the same experiments on social media messages from three other fields (politics, business and non-profit) and discovered several features that are exclusive to space science communications: anger, authenticity, hashtags, visual descriptions—be it visual perception-related words, or media elements—and a tentative tone. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Facebook; Machine learning; Psychometrics; Science communication; Social media; Twitter","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data mining; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linguistics; Facebook; Psychometrics; Science communications; Social media; Twitter; Social networking (online); anger; Bayesian learning; classifier; decision tree; empiricism; grammar; human; human experiment; learning algorithm; model; nonhuman; politics; prediction; psychology; psychometry; social media; tick; vision",2-s2.0-85002963717

In this paper, we propose a novel feature transfer approach with PCANet (a deep network), which extracts both the domain-shared and the domain-specific latent features to facilitate performance improvement. The proposal attempts to learn multiple intermediate feature representations along an interpolating path between the source and target domains using PCANet by considering the distribution shift between source domain and target domain, and then aligns other feature representations on the path with target subspace to control them to change in the right direction towards the target. To exemplify the effectiveness of our approach, we select the INTERSPEECH 2009 Emotion Challenge’s FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus as the target database and two public databases (ABC and Emo-DB) as source set.

(Ain Shams Eng J 5(4):1093–1113, 2014), Nguyen and Jung (Mob Netw Appl 20(4):475–486, 2015), many related works have used a lexical-based approach (e.g., dictionary and corpus), and machine learning-based approach (e.g., decision tree, rule discovery, and probabilistic methods) to extract sentiment in a given text.

Much attention has been paid to NPS in rural areas, where agricultural activities increase nutrients, toxics, and sediments in surface water. Stormwater from urban areas is also a major contributor to NPS pollution. For watersheds bearing various soil types and land uses, a single type of BMP cannot be the panacea to all stormwater problems. To solve these problems, a Diagnostic Decision Support System (DDSS) was developed in this research. The DDSS can identify and locate the most critical NPS areas (hotspots) within a watershed in high spatial resolution. The DDSS can provide a series of spatially distributed small-scale BMPs which are effective in treating the NPS and are suitable for the physical environment. The BMPs, varying in types and locations, are recommended at HRU (Hydrologic Response Unit) level. The DDSS was tested in Watts Branch, a small urban watershed of the Anacostia River in metropolitan Washington D.C., USA. The process-based hydrologic model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used to simulate watershed responses. The simulation results were then used by the DDSS for BMP recommendation. Hotspots of different NPS were successfully located and prescribed with spatially distributed BMPs. The DDSS serves as a useful tool to better understand urban watersheds and to make proper stormwater management plans. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Best management practices; Geographic information system; Green infrastructures; Nonpoint pollution; Spatial distribution; Stormwater management","Artificial intelligence; Engineering geology; Geographic information systems; Information management; Land use; Pollution; River pollution; Spatial distribution; Storm sewers; Storms; Surface waters; Watersheds; Best management practice (BMPs); Best management practices; Green infrastructure; Hydrologic response units; Non-point source pollution; Nonpoint pollutions; Soil and water assessment tool; Storm-water managements; Decision support systems; best management practice; decision support system; GIS; hydrological modeling; nonpoint source pollution; rural area; spatial distribution; stormwater; urban area; watershed; Anacostia River; District of Columbia; United States",2-s2.0-85014651832

Bourdieu’s social theory with its emphasis on mechanisms of domination can be applied to the academic field, too, where competition is omnipresent, control mechanisms of authorship are loose, and the result of performance assessment can be a matter of symbolic life and death for the researchers. This results in a problem of game-theoretic nature, where researchers’ behaviour will be determined more by the logic of competition, than by individual character or motives. From this follows that changing this practice requires institutionalized mechanisms, and change cannot be expected from simply appealing to researchers’ individual conscience. The article aims at showing that academic capital (administrative power, seniority) is translated into honorary authorship. With little control, undetected honorary authorship gives the appearance of possessing intellectual capital (scientific merit). In this way a dominant position is made to be seen as natural result of intellectual ability or scientific merit, which makes it more acceptable to those in dominated positions. The final conclusion of this paper is that undemocratic authorship decisions and authorship based performance assessment together are a form of symbolic violence. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Authorship decisions; Bourdieu; Honorary authorship; Performance assessment of research; Publication ethics; Symbolic violence","competition; conceptual framework; conscience; death; ethics; human; intelligence; logic; publication; scientist; sociological theory; theoretical model; violence; writing; ethics; medical research; publication; standards; Authorship; Biomedical Research; Humans; Publications; Social Theory",2-s2.0-84982150740

Each resolution was run for the entire Whole Heliosphere Interval which contained two high speed solar wind streams and modest interplanetary magnetic field strengths. Average states of the field-aligned current (FAC) patterns for 8 interplanetary magnetic field clock angle directions are computed using data from these runs. Generally speaking the patterns obtained agree well with results obtained from the Weimer 2005 computing using the solar wind and IMF conditions that correspond to each bin. As the simulation resolution increases the currents become more intense and narrow. A machine learning analysis of the FAC patterns shows that the ratio of Region 1 (R1) to Region 2 (R2) currents decreases as the simulation resolution increases. This brings the simulation results into better agreement with observational predictions and the Weimer 2005 model results. The increase in R2 current strengths also results in the cross polar cap potential (CPCP) pattern being concentrated in higher latitudes. Current-voltage relationships between the R1 and CPCP are quite similar at the higher resolution indicating the simulation is converging on a common solution. We conclude that LFM simulations are capable of reproducing the statistical features of FAC patterns. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ionosphere; Magnetosphere; Modeling; Simulation","Artificial intelligence; Ionosphere; Learning systems; Magnetic fields; Magnetosphere; Models; Solar wind; Cross polar cap potential; Current-voltage relationship; Field aligned currents; High-speed solar wind streams; Interplanetary magnetic fields; Resolution increase; Simulation; Statistical features; Ionospheric measurement",2-s2.0-84978159463

Despite its popularity and success, CF suffers from the data sparsity and cold-start problems. To alleviate these issues, in recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting trust information to improve the performance of CF. In general, trust has a number of distinct properties such as asymmetry, transitivity, dynamicity and context-dependency. However, conventional trust-based CF systems do not address trust computation by considering all the properties of trust. Particularly, the context-dependency property has received less attention in the existing approaches. The consideration of all these properties leads to more accurate recommendations since the quality of the inferred is improved. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-based approach, called Semantic-enhanced Trust based Ant Recommender System (STARS), which satisfies all the properties mentioned above. Using ant colony optimization, the proposed system performs a depth- first search for the optimal trust paths in the trust network and selects the best neighbors of an active user to provide better recommendations. To consider the context-dependency property, trust inference in STARS depends on the semantic descriptions of items. Incorporation of both global and local trust in CF-based recommender systems in addition to the trust computation based on the semantic features of items allows STARS to alleviate the data sparsity, cold-start and “multiple-interests and multiple-content” problems of CF. Experimental results on real-world data sets show that STARS outperforms its counterparts in terms of prediction accuracy and recommendation quality and can overcome the above problems. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony; Collaborative filtering; Global trust; Local trust; Ontology; Recommender system; Semantic similarity; Trust","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Collaborative filtering; Human computer interaction; Ontology; Semantics; Stars; Virtual reality; Ant colonies; Cold start problems; Local trust.

It is first shown that, at the static level, desires should satisfy certain principles that differ from those to which beliefs obey. In this sense, from a static perspective, the logic of desires is different from the logic of beliefs. While the accumulation of beliefs tend to reduce the remaining possible worlds they point at, the accumulation of desires tends to increase the set of states of affairs tentatively considered as satisfactory. Indeed beliefs are expected to be closed under conjunctions, while, in the positive view of desires developed here, one can argue that endorsing φ∨ ψ as a desire means to desire φ and to desire ψ. However, desiring φ and ¬ φ at the same time is not usually regarded as rational, since it does not make much sense to desire one thing and its contrary at the same time. Thus when a new desire is added to the set of desires of an agent, a revision process may be necessary. Just as belief revision relies on an epistemic entrenchment relation, desire revision is based on a hedonic entrenchment relation satisfying other properties, due to the different natures of belief and desire. While epistemic entrenchment relations are known to be qualitative necessity relations (in the sense of possibility theory), hedonic relations obeying a set of reasonable postulates correspond to another set-function in possibility theory, called guaranteed possibility, that drive well-behaved desire revision operations. Then the general framework of possibilistic logic provides a syntactic setting for encoding desire change. The paper also insists that desires should be carefully distinguished from goals. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Desire; Possibility theory; Revision","Artificial intelligence; Philosophical aspects; Belief revision; Desire; Formal approach; Logical approaches; Other properties; Possibilistic logic; Possibility theory; Revision; Computer circuits",2-s2.0-85014711260

With an increase in spatial pressure, the need is increasing to prioritize measures based on the vulnerability of the resources and the impact of surrounding land use functions. This is especially challenging in the Province of Overijssel with groundwater abstraction sites in vulnerable Pleistocene sandy soils and increasing spatial pressure from both agricultural and urban areas. The governance of the groundwater abstractions in the Province of Overijssel is based on a combination of precaution and a risk-based approach. The Province has adopted REFLECT to assess the risks of spatial developments. REFLECT is a negotiation support system that gives an overview of the vulnerability of the groundwater abstractions and risks of several land use functions on the groundwater quality. REFLECT has been used to obtain the current risk scores of all drinking water abstractions in the Province and following the EU Water Framework Directive. Spatial insight of risks was used to identify and target measures reducing these risks. Moreover, REFLECT has been applied to decide on a local spatial development near an abstraction. Knowledge of the impact of land use changes on groundwater quality helped the municipality harmonizing the spatial plan with the interest of the drinking water abstraction and creating a step-forward in the protection level of the abstraction site. These applications illustrate that REFLECT is an instrument that fits well within risk-based groundwater governance which aims at safeguarding of the public water supply by harmonizing land use functions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Decision support system; Governance; Groundwater resources; Land use; Stakeholders; Vulnerability","Abstracting; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Environmental regulations; Groundwater; Land use; Potable water; Risk assessment; Urban growth; Water; Water conservation; Water quality; Water supply; Eu-water framework directives; Governance; Groundwater abstraction; Groundwater governances; Negotiation support system; Risk based approaches; Stakeholders; Vulnerability; Groundwater resources; decision support system; governance approach; groundwater abstraction; groundwater resource; land use planning; resource development; risk assessment; spatial analysis; spatial planning; stakeholder; vulnerability; water supply; Netherlands; Overijssel",2-s2.0-85011851605

LLE (locally linear embedding) is a famous algorithm of NLDR (nonlinear dimensionality reduction), and it is capable of projecting high dimensional image blocks into a low dimensional space of embedding. This paper is concerned with the image prediction by 1D representation of LLE algorithm. Two LLE algorithms have been studied. One is the general LLE algorithm, the other is the proposed distance-keeping based LLE algorithm, which has the merit of preserving the distance property in low dimensional space. 1D representation of LLE algorithms can hugely improve the CR (compression ratio). The training input and output of LLE algorithms are employed as training pair for ERA (embedding and reconstruction algorithm) of testing samples, and the training pair is as large as possible to overcome the inherent disadvantage of classical algorithms for image prediction, which only utilize the adjacent image blocks. Three stable ERAs have been proposed. The first is general ERA, the second is nearest neighbor based ERA, and the third is machine learning based ERA. The nearest neighbor based ERA has the best performance if the training samples are sufficient, while the machine learning based ERA has the best performance if the training samples are insufficient. Three DLAs (dictionary learning algorithms) for selecting training samples are presented. The first is exemplars based DLA, the second is K-means clustering based DLA, and the third is sparse representation based DLA. The K-means clustering based DLA has the best performance. A unified framework for intra-frame, inter-frame, multi-view, 3D and multi-view 3D image prediction, has been built according to the proposed algorithms.

The basic issue to be addressed no longer concerns changes in the banking sector but the ways to better operate in the new business setting in order to redefine relationships with customers, seize the opportunities provided by the innovation processes, and yield adequate returns. A bank willing to progress has to continuously adapt to the evolving economic, financial, and productive context. This work argues about the influence of the advancement and complexity of emerging technologies on the structural and behavioral elements meant as financial criticalities and requirements restricting the strategic development options of banks. Verification of the research hypotheses was made through an empirical analysis of quantitative and qualitative data regarding the period 2008–2011 gathered from a sample of 3190 banks located in 17 countries. The empirical research shows (1) the existence of a negative relationship between financial leverage and the two technological innovations regarding enterprise resource planning software systems and software for management of credit risk were observed; (2) the enterprise resource planning innovation and the software for the management of credit risk seem to influence competences, abilities, and organization of the banking system; (3) the innovations that concern the enterprise resource planning software systems and the software for the management of credit risk increase the earning margin of banks. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Banking sector; Information technology; Performance; Technological innovation",,2-s2.0-85014861203

Hence, reviews are valuable not only to users who would like to find out what others think about an app, but also to developers and software companies interested in customer feedback. The rapid increase in the number of applications and total app store revenue has accelerated app store data mining and opinion aggregation studies. While development companies and app store regulators have pursued upfront opinion mining studies for business intelligence and marketing purposes, research interest into app ecosystem and user reviews is relatively new. In addition to studies examining online product reviews, there are now some academic studies focused on mobile app stores and user reviews.

However, as the problems and domains become more complex, organizations are employing teams of analysts to explore and model data to generate knowledge. Furthermore, given the rapid increase in data collection, organizations are struggling to develop practices for intelligence analysis in the era of big data. Currently, a variety of machine learning and data mining techniques are available to model data and to generate insights and predictions, and developments in the field of visual analytics have focused on how to effectively link data mining algorithms with interactive visuals to enable analysts to explore, understand, and interact with data and data models. Although studies have explored the role of single analysts in the visual analytics pipeline, little work has explored the role of teamwork and visual analytics in the analysis of big data. In this article, we present an experiment integrating statistical models, visual analytics techniques, and user experiments to study the role of teamwork in predictive analytics. We frame our experiment around the analysis of social media data for box office prediction problems and compare the prediction performance of teams, groups, and individuals. Our results indicate that a team's performance is mediated by the team's characteristics such as openness of individual members to others' positions and the type of planning that goes into the team's analysis.

Traditional link prediction methods usually work well on homogeneous networks, but few for the heterogeneous ones. And the military network is a typical heterogeneous network, where there are different types of nodes and edges. In this paper, we proposed a combined link prediction index considering both the nodes’ types effects and nodes’ structural similarities, and demonstrated that it is remarkably superior to all the 25 existing similarity-based methods both in predicting missing links and identifying spurious links in a real military network data; we also investigated the algorithms’ robustness under noisy environment, and found the mistaken information is more misleading than incomplete information in military areas, which is different from that in recommendation systems, and our method maintained the best performance under the condition of small noise. Since the real military network intelligence must be carefully checked at first due to its significance, and link prediction methods are just adopted to purify the network with the left latent noise, the method proposed here is applicable in real situations. In the end, as the FINC-E model, here used to describe the complex military organizations, is also suitable to many other social organizations, such as criminal networks, business organizations, etc., thus our method has its prospects in these areas for many tasks, like detecting the underground relationships between terrorists, predicting the potential business markets for decision-makers, and so on. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Complex military organization; FINC-E model; Link prediction; Social organization","Decision making; Forecasting; Heterogeneous networks; Societies and institutions; E-Model; Identification algorithms; Incomplete information; Link prediction; Military organizations; Quality of information; Similarity-Based Methods; Social organizations; Complex networks",2-s2.0-84999672442

Developing entrepreneurial competencies is increasingly seen as important to foster entrepreneurship. Studies to date have highlighted different entrepreneurial competencies in the context of different sectors, regions and countries. However, there has been a lack of consensus in relation to the perceived relative importance of core entrepreneurial competences and their interdependencies among students, academic and entrepreneurs. Our paper focuses on two key questions: first, what are the core entrepreneurial competencies that need to be developed in educational contexts? Second, what are the interdependencies between these entrepreneurial competencies that need to be developed in educational contexts? Using a collective intelligence methodology a comparative study of Iran and Ireland was undertaken that involved three stakeholder groups of students, academics and entrepreneurs. This methodology was used to identify, rank, and structure entrepreneurial competencies considered important for university students. The results of the study indicated that productive thinking, motivation, interpersonal skills and leadership are core entrepreneurial competences that need to be developed in educational contexts. Findings also highlight critical interdependencies between entrepreneurial competencies and the relative influence of different competencies across groups and regions.

The intension and extension of a concept can be transformed automatically in the human cognition process, while it is difficult for computers. A Gaussian cloud model (GCM) is used to realize the cognitive transformation between intension and extension of a concept through computer algorithms, including forward Gaussian cloud transformation (FGCT) algorithms and backward Gaussian cloud transformation (BGCT) algorithms. A FGCT algorithm can transform a concept’s intension into extension, and a BGCT algorithm can implement the cognitive transformation from a concept’s extension to intension. In this paper, the authors perform a thorough analysis on the existing BGCT algorithms firstly, and find that these BGCT algorithms have some drawbacks. They cannot obtain the stable intension of a concept sometimes. For this reason, a new backward Gaussian cloud cognitive transformation algorithm based on sample division is proposed. The effectiveness and convergence of the proposed method is analyzed in detail, and some comparison experiments on obtaining the concept’s intension and applications to image segmentation are conducted to evaluate this method.

However, existing approaches require users to probabilistically model aspects of the problem, which may entail a substantial investment of time and may be error-prone. We propose to use blackbox optimization instead, a family of techniques that do not require probabilistic modelling by the end user. Specifically, we adopt Bayesian Optimization to approximate the maximum of a utility function quantifying the user's (business-) objectives while minimizing search cost. Our approach is validated in a simulation and three real-world experiments.

Distributed Databases represents a software system that allows a multitude of applications to access the data stored in local or remote databases. In this scenario, the data distribution is achieved through the process of replication. Nowadays many solutions for storing the data are available: Relational distributed Database Management Systems (DBMS), NoSQL storing solutions, NewSQL storing solutions, graph oriented databases, object oriented databases, object-relational databases, etc. The present study analyzes the most commonly used storing solution: The relational model. The replication topology used in the related experiments was the classical publisher-subscriber topology. The distribution of data is made from the publisher system. The present work studies the interaction between the most suited distributed data mining architecture (Distributed Committee Machines) for mining distributed data and real relational distributed databases. The chosen Data Mining task is the classification one. Distributed Committee Machines are a group of neuronal networks working in a distributed procedure to obtain an improved classification performance compared to a single neural structure. In these experiments we used the classical multilayer perceptron trained with the backpropagation algorithm. The execution performance of the Distributed Committee Machine is analyzed, based on some of the most used types of replication in relational databases: snapshot replication, merge replication, transactional replication, and transactional with queued updating replication. For all these types of replications the execution performances (distributed speedup and distributed efficiency) of the entire system is also analyzed.

In this domain, clustering similar time series information is increasingly important due to the large amount of data collected by current mobile and web applications. We evaluate which methods cluster accurately time series of mobile games, focusing on player behavior data. We identify and validate several aspects of the clustering: the similarity measures and the representation techniques to reduce the high dimensionality of time series. As a robustness test, we compare various temporal datasets of player activity from two free-to-play video-games. With these techniques we extract temporal patterns of player behavior relevant for the evaluation of game events and game-business diagnosis.

Modern sensors and sophisticated perception algorithms extract rich 3D textured information, but are limited to the data that are collected from a given location or path. We are interested in closing the loop around perception and planning, in particular to plan paths for better perceptual data, and focus on the problem of planning scanning sequences to improve object classification from range data. We formulate a novel time-constrained active classification problem and propose solution algorithms that employ a variation of Monte Carlo tree search to plan non-myopically. Our algorithms use a particle filter combined with Gaussian process regression to estimate joint distributions of object class and pose. This estimator is used in planning to generate a probabilistic belief about the state of objects in a scene, and also to generate beliefs for predicted sensor observations from future viewpoints. These predictions consider occlusions arising from predicted object positions and shapes. We evaluate our algorithms in simulation, in comparison to passive and greedy strategies. We also describe similar experiments where the algorithms are implemented online, using a mobile ground robot in a farm environment. Results indicate that our non-myopic approach outperforms both passive and myopic strategies, and clearly show the benefit of active perception for outdoor object classification. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Active classification; Monte Carlo tree Search; Object classification; Sequential Monte Carlo","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Monte Carlo methods; Active perceptions; Gaussian process regression; Joint distributions; Monte-Carlo tree searches; Object classification; Probabilistic belief; Sequential Monte Carlo; Solution algorithms; Data mining",2-s2.0-85013149266

Our focus is on detecting multimodal events in time varying sequences as well as generating missing data in any of the modalities. Discriminative classifiers have been shown to achieve higher performances than the corresponding generative likelihood-based classifiers. On the other hand, generative models learn a rich informative space which allows for data generation and joint feature representation that discriminative models lack. We propose a new model that jointly optimizes the representation space using a hybrid energy function. We employ a Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) based model to learn a shared representation across multiple modalities with time varying data. The Conditional RBMs (CRBMs) is an extension of the RBM model that takes into account short term temporal phenomena. The hybrid model involves augmenting CRBMs with a discriminative component for classification. For these purposes we propose a novel Multimodal Discriminative CRBMs (MMDCRBMs) model. First, we train the MMDCRBMs model using labeled data by training each modality, followed by training a fusion layer. Second, we exploit the generative capability of MMDCRBMs to activate the trained model so as to generate the lower-level data corresponding to the specific label that closely matches the actual input data. We evaluate our approach on ChaLearn dataset, audio-mocap, as well as the Tower Game dataset, mocap-mocap as well as three multimodal toy datasets.

Since no “gold standard” method exists for this evaluation, such a technique is needed to ensure patient comfort, procedure quality and safety. In this study we investigated functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as possible monitor of anesthetic effects on the prefrontal cortex. Anesthetic drugs, such as sevoflurane, suppress the cerebral metabolism and alter the cerebral blood flow. We hypothesize that fNIRS derived features carry information on the effects of anesthetics on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that can be used for the classification of the anesthetized state. In this study, patients were continuously monitored using fNIRS, BIS and standard monitoring during surgical procedures under sevoflurane general anesthesia. Maintenance and emergence states were identified and fNIRS features were identified and compared between states. Linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms were investigated as methods for the classification of maintenance/emergence. The results show that changes in oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) concentration and blood volume measured by fNIRS were associated with the transition between maintenance and emergence that occurs as a result of sevoflurane washout. We observed that during maintenance the signal is relatively more stable than during emergence. Maintenance and emergence states were classified with 94.7% accuracy with a non-linear model using the locally derived mean total hemoglobin, standard deviation of HbO2, minimum and range of HbO2 and HHb as features. These features were found to be correlated with the effects of sevoflurane and to carry information that allows real time and automatic classification of the anesthetized state with high accuracy. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Anesthesia; fNIRS; Machine learning; Prefrontal cortex","Anesthesiology; Anesthetics; Artificial intelligence; Blood; Blood vessels; Classification (of information); Hemodynamics; Hemoglobin; Infrared devices; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Near infrared spectroscopy; Patient monitoring; Anesthesia; Automatic classification; fNIRS; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs); Monitoring techniques; Physiological monitoring; Prefrontal cortex; Quality and safeties; Maintenance",2-s2.0-85013074794

Explanations based on employer and client discrimination would predict a monotonic association between physical attractiveness and earnings; explanations based on occupational self-selection would explain the beauty premium as a function of workers’ occupations; and explanations based on individual differences would predict that the beauty premium would disappear once appropriate individual differences are controlled. In this paper, we empirically tested the three competing hypotheses about the “beauty premium”. Design/Methodology/Approach: We analyzed a nationally representative and prospectively longitudinal sample from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Findings: The results contradicted the discrimination and self-selection explanations and strongly supported the individual differences explanation. Very unattractive respondents always earned significantly more than unattractive respondents, sometimes more than average-looking or attractive respondents. Multiple regression analyses showed that there was very weak evidence for the beauty premium, and it disappeared completely once individual differences, such as health, intelligence, and Big Five personality factors, were statistically controlled. Implications: Past findings of beauty premium and ugliness penalty may possibly be due to the fact that: 1) “very unattractive” and “unattractive” categories are usually collapsed into “below average” category; and 2) health, intelligence (as opposed to education) and Big Five personality factors are not controlled. It appears that more beautiful workers earn more, not because they are beautiful, but because they are healthier, more intelligent, and have better (more Conscientious and Extraverted, and less Neurotic) personality. Originality/Value: This is the first study to show that: 1) very unattractive workers have extremely high earnings and earn more than physically more attractive workers, suggesting evidence for the potential ugliness premium; and 2) the apparent beauty premium and ugliness penalty may be a function of unmeasured traits correlated with physical attractiveness, such as health, intelligence, and personality. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Discrimination; Earnings; Individual differences; Occupational self-selection; Physical attractiveness; Productivity",,2-s2.0-85013102408

Both generic and joint alignment methods have been proposed with varying degrees of success. However, many generic methods are heavily sensitive to initializations and usually rely on offline-trained static models, which limit their performance on sequential images with extensive variations. On the other hand, joint methods are restricted to offline applications, since they require all frames to conduct batch alignment. To address these limitations, we propose to exploit incremental learning for personalized ensemble alignment. We sample multiple initial shapes to achieve image congealing within one frame, which enables us to incrementally conduct ensemble alignment by group-sparse regularized rank minimization. At the same time, incremental subspace adaptation is performed to achieve personalized modeling in a unified framework. To alleviate the drifting issue, we leverage a very efficient fitting evaluation network to pick out well-aligned faces for robust incremental learning. Extensive experiments on both controlled and unconstrained datasets have validated our approach in different aspects and demonstrated its superior performance compared with state of the arts in terms of fitting accuracy and efficiency. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Ensemble learning; Face alignment; Incremental learning; Personalized modeling; Sparse coding","Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Ensemble learning; Face alignment; Incremental learning; Personalized model; Sparse coding; Alignment",2-s2.0-85012936332

The recent advances regarding Internet of Things, social computing, and mobile access technologies converge to make pervasive computing truly ubiquitous. The key challenge is to make simple and robust solutions for normal users, which shifts the focus from complex platforms involving machine learning and artificial intelligence to more hands on construction of services that are tailored or personalized for individual users. This chapter discusses Internet of Things together with Social Computing as a basis for components that users in a ""digital city "" could utilize to make their daily life better, safer, etc. A novel environment for user-created services, such as social apps, is presented as a possible solution for this. The vision is that anyone could make a simple service based on Internet- enabled devices (Internet of Things) and encapsulated digital resources such as Open Data, which also can have social aspects embedded. This chapter also aims to identify trends, challenges, and recommendations in regard of Social Interaction for Digital Cities.

The Internet of Things (IoT) involves connections of physical things to the Internet. It is largely about the relationships between things, or non-humans actors. In other cases the 'Things' seem to have inordinate power. The authors will ask: Where does this leave humans? Are the things taking over? As a consideration of interactions like this must be a socio-technical one, in this article the authors will make use of Actor-Network Theory to frame the discussion. While the original applications for IoT technology were in areas such as supply chain management and logistics, now many more examples can be found ranging from control of home appliances to healthcare. It is expected that the 'Things' will become active participants in business, information and social processes and that they will communicate among themselves by exchanging data sensed from the environment, while reacting autonomously. The Things will continue to develop identities and virtual personalities. In the past non-human actors have needed humans to interact with each other, but this is not the case anymore.

Moreover, we discuss the challenges and difficulties concerning emotion recognition and modelling systems responsible for representing the patient's affective state in real life health care environments. In our research, we aim to address these challenges by proposing a novel framework for developing emotion aware health care support systems. The suggested methodology enables a holistic and reflective representation of the patient's affective state, and incorporates a number of design choices that are suitable for emotion modelling and recognition in the context of a real life health care environment. This methodology leads to the development of a unique emotion aware health care support system, which utilizes Fuzzy Logic to recognize the patient's affective state based on basic cognitive/affective cues, such as the patient's predictions and evaluations of a treatment. The system based on the calculated emotion recognition results, delivers tailored feedback to influence the patient towards a desired and beneficial affective state.

From voice services by controlling cost and business partnership. The competitiveness in this industry is very high, so that any efficiency from controlling cost and business partnership can help the company to survive in the very high competitiveness situation. The company trades voice traffic with a large number of business partners. There are four trading schemes that can be chosen by this company, namely, flat rate, class tiering, volume commitment, and revenue capped. Each scheme has a specific characteristic on the rate and volume deal, where the last three schemes are regarded as strategic schemes to be offered to business partner to ensure incoming traffic volume for both parties. This company and each business partner need to choose an optimal agreement in a certain period of time that can maximize the company's profit. In this agreement, both parties agree to use a certain trading scheme, rate and rate/volume/revenue deal. A decision support system is then needed in order to give a comprehensive information to the sales officers to deal with the business partners. This paper discusses the mathematical model of the optimal decision for incoming traffic volume control, which is a part of the analysis needed to build the decision support system. The mathematical model is built by first performing data analysis to see how elastic the incoming traffic volume is. As the level of elasticity is obtained, we then derive a mathematical modelling that can simulate the impact of any decision on trading to the revenue of the company. The optimal decision can be obtained from these simulations results. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method we implement our decision model to the historical data.

In achieving the goal, we first develop two optimization models to support the decisions on (1) the hedge trade by minimizing purchase costs of raw materials, and (2) the production planning by maximizing profits from product sales. We then integrated these two models into a single decision support system using a recursive two-stage programming framework. On the basis of the integrated framework, we systematically identify the optimal solution, that is, the maximum profit, by simultaneously determining timing, amount, and price of raw materials to purchase, and the strategies for facility operation and product sales. To illustrate the capability of the proposed system, it was then applied to the business model of the petrochemical company in Korea. As a result, compared to the base case, it is revealed that the profitability of the petrochemical company could be improved by up to 4.82% by optimized hedging trades and 4.30% by optimizing the production plan. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Economics; Optimization; Petrochemicals; Planning; Production control; Profitability; Sales; Wooden fences; Facility operations; Integrated frameworks; Optimization models; Optimization techniques; Petrochemical company; Petrochemical industry; Production Planning; Programming framework; Decision support systems",2-s2.0-85013188005

Only few studies have attempted to investigate the cognitive processes and psychological mechanisms that subserve metacognitively-based control and the development thereof. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to gain an insight into the cognitive and psychological correlates that relate to metacognitively-based control processes. Specifically, we were interested in two measures of metacognitive control: learners’ ability to self-regulate their study time in a study time allocation paradigm, as well as the efficiency with which they allocated their study time. It was of particular interest to explore the relation between declarative metamemory and procedural metacognitive skills. In addition, we assessed learners’ general cognitive and executive abilities. We tested a group of 10-year olds and a group of adults. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previous studies, the current study does not support a relation between declarative metamemory and procedural skills, or executive functions and intelligence and procedural skills. We interpret our results in line with a dual systems view of metacognitive abilities and further speculate whether procedural skills might become increasingly independent and automated with age. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Declarative metamemory; Efficiency; Metacognitive control; Self-regulation; Study time allocation",,2-s2.0-85011573715

The article outlines the project and its objectives and the importance of determining whether IP addresses can be lawfully shared as cyber threat intelligence. The goal of the project is to enhance cyber-threat intelligence sharing throughout the cyber ecosystem. The findings and recommendations from this project enable businesses to navigate the international legal environment and develop their policy and procedures to enable timely, effective and legal sharing of cyber-threat information. The project is the first of its kind in the world. It is unique in both focus and scope. Unlike the cyber-threat information sharing reviews and initiatives being developed at country and regional levels, the focus of this project and this article is on business-to-business sharing. The scope of this project in terms of the 34 jurisdictions reviewed as to their data protection requirements is more comprehensive than any similar study to date. This article focuses on the sharing of IP addresses as cyber threat intelligence in the context of the new European Union (EU) data protection initiatives agreed in December 2015 and formally adopted by the European Council and Parliament in April 2016. The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to EU member countries, a major focus of the international cyber threat sharing project. The research also reveals that EU data protection requirements, particularly the currently applicable law of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (1995 Directive) (the rules of which the GDPR will replace in practice in 2018), generally form the basis of current data protection requirements in countries outside Europe. It is expected that this influence will continue and that the GDPR will shape the development of data protection internationally. In this article, the authors examine whether static and dynamic IP addresses are “personal data” as defined in the GDPR and its predecessor the 1995 Directive that is currently the model for data protection in many jurisdictions outside Europe. The authors then consider whether sharing of that data by a business without the consent of the data subject, can be justified in the public interest so as to override individual rights under Articles 7 and 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which underpin EU data protection. The analysis shows that the sharing of cyber threat intelligence is in the public interest so as to override the rights of a data subject, as long as it is carried out in ways that are strictly necessary in order to achieve security objectives. The article concludes by summarizing the project findings to date, and how they inform international sharing of cyber-threat intelligence within the private sector. © 2017 Clare Sullivan & Eric Burger","Business-to-business sharing; Cyber-threat; Data collection; Disclosure; Intelligence; Privacy; Privacy and public interest","Security of data; Business to business; Cyber threats; Data collection; Disclosure; Intelligence; Public interest; Data privacy",2-s2.0-85010739039

Patients and people of several backgrounds are now using Web search engines to acquire medical information, including information about a specific disease, medical treatment or professional advice. Nonetheless, due to a lack of medical knowledge, many laypeople have difficulties in forming appropriate queries to articulate their inquiries, which deem their search queries to be imprecise due the use of unclear keywords. The use of these ambiguous and vague queries to describe the patients’ needs has resulted in a failure of Web search engines to retrieve accurate and relevant information. One of the most natural and promising method to overcome this drawback is Query Expansion. In this paper, an original approach based on Bat Algorithm is proposed to improve the retrieval effectiveness of query expansion in medical field. In contrast to the existing literature, the proposed approach uses Bat Algorithm to find the best expanded query among a set of expanded query candidates, while maintaining low computational complexity. Moreover, this new approach allows the determination of the length of the expanded query empirically. Numerical results on MEDLINE, the on-line medical information database, show that the proposed approach is more effective and efficient compared to the baseline. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bat algorithm; Medical data management; MEDLINE; Query expansion; Retrieval feedback; Swarm intelligence; Web intelligence","algorithm; animal behavior; Article; bat algorithm; electronic medical record; evolutionary algorithm; feedback system; fuzzy logic; image processing; information retrieval; intelligence; Internet; loudness; medical information; medical terminology; nonhuman; search engine; social behavior; velocity; consumer health information; information retrieval; information seeking; procedures; Algorithms; Consumer Health Information; Information Seeking Behavior; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Search Engine",2-s2.0-85008657315

The complexity of the product generates a huge challenge for the companies that develop video games. In the development process, level designers play a crucial role: they are in charge of declining the theoretical framework developed by the game designer into game levels, which contain the actual gameplay scenarios. Hence, the final goal of any level designer is to valorize the game design by creating enjoyable gaming experiences while, at the same time, respecting several constraints. To lighten the burden on level designers, several semi-automated approaches to level generation have appeared in time, but the majority of these tools suffer from several drawbacks. In the present work, we tackle the issue of designing, prototyping and testing FUN PLEdGE, a general-purpose automated levels generator and editor for platform video games. Its main goal is to shrink development time while producing – unassisted – levels that are both playable and fun. Moreover, our tool provides the maximum freedom to the level designer, by avoiding to impose unnecessary constraints on the structure of the levels and by guaranteeing the possibility to modify and personalize by hand the generated levels. During this process, the generator assists the designer by suggesting corrections functional to the quality of the player experience. To prove the effectiveness of our prototypal application we have also developed and tested with players a platform game. In the same vein, we asked to a group of game developers to test FUN PLEdGE. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial intelligence for games; Procedural content generation; User experience design; User interfaces; Video games design","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Design; Interactive computer graphics; Software prototyping; User interfaces; Automated approach; Development process; Gaming experiences; Procedural content generations; Software applications; Theoretical framework; User experience design; Video game; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-84978038782

Methods Twitter polls allow users to embed multiple-choice questions within tweets and automatically aggregate responses. Two radiologists attending the 2016 annual meeting of the ACR posted a Twitter poll containing the hashtag #ACR2016 during 10 meeting sessions addressing socioeconomics/advocacy, patient experience, and social media/informatics (20 polls total). Each poll contained a question asking for an opinion regarding the session's content. Polls were open for responses for 24 hours. Results The average number of responses per poll was significantly higher for the user with the larger number of Twitter followers (24.3 ± 14.4 versus 11.2 ± 9.8, P = .015). A total of 57% of respondents agreed that radiologists’ payments should shift to value-based payments, and 86% agreed that radiologists should routinely survey their patients to monitor quality; however, 83% disagreed with basing physician payments on patient satisfaction scores. A total of 85% disagreed that the artificial intelligence supercomputer Watson will entirely replace radiologists. A total of 76% agreed that social media can drive business at less cost than standard marketing. A total of 56% agreed with the direction of the ACR's advocacy and regulatory efforts, whereas 74% considered the ACR's advocacy efforts to be moderately or very useful for their practice. A total of 50% planned to change their practice on the basis of keynote remarks by Dr Ezekiel Emanuel.

These proteins are involved in different functionalities such as ferrying of molecules and nutrients across membrane, recognizing foreign bodies, receiving outside signals and translating them into the cell. Membrane proteins play significant role in drug interaction as nearly 50% of the drug targets are membrane proteins. Due to the momentous role of membrane protein in cell activity, computational models able to predict membrane protein with accurate measures bears indispensable importance. The conventional experimental methods used for annotating membrane proteins are time-consuming and costly and in some cases impossible. Computationally intelligent techniques have emerged to be as a useful resource in the automation of prediction and hence the annotation process. In this study, various techniques have been reviewed that are based on different computational intelligence models used for prediction process. These techniques were formulated by different researchers and were further evaluated to provide a comparative analysis. Analysis shows that the usage of support vector machine-based prediction techniques bears more assiduous results. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Amino acids; Membrane proteins; Position-specific scoring matrix; Probabilistic neural networks; Pseudo amino acids compositions; Support vector machine","amino acid; dipeptide; membrane protein; membrane protein; amino acid composition; amino acid sequence; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automation; cell activity; classification; contingency table; correlation coefficient; data base; Fourier analysis; fuzzy system; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; jackknife test; k nearest neighbor; measurement accuracy; position weight matrix; prediction; probabilistic neural network; probability; Review; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; validation process; algorithm; biology; chemical phenomena; chemistry; classification; procedures; reproducibility; Algorithms; Amino Acids; Computational Biology; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Membrane Proteins; Neural Networks (Computer); Position-Specific Scoring Matrices; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Support Vector Machine",2-s2.0-84995772551

Consequently, the ranking schema places relevant code examples at the top of the result list. However, it is difficult to determine the configurations of the ranking schemas subjectively. In this paper, we propose a code example search approach that applies a machine learning technique to automatically train a ranking schema.

It will assist them in making more informed decisions by either choosing the optimal solution from processing a repository of past decisions or by presenting a set of possible drugs and using criteria specified by them to identify the optimal drug. The evaluation of OptiPres was done by comparing its recommended outcome of three predefined medical scenarios against the recommendations from a group of doctors and the World Health Organization (WHO) manual entitled:‘Guide to Good Prescribing’. The results indicate that OptiPres is effective in prescribing optimal drugs and in reducing the cognitive burden on doctors, especially in subjective decision making contexts where they have to consider multiple parameters. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Analytic hierarchy process; Case-based reasoning; CPOE; Databases; Decision support systems; Drug prescription; EHR; EMR; Mobile agents","Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Database systems; Decision making; Decision support systems; Smartphones; CPOE; Drug prescriptions; EHR; EMR; Informed decision; Intelligent mobile agent; Multiple parameters; World Health Organization; Mobile agents",2-s2.0-84944711584

While FKBP5 has been found associated with a large number of stress-related outcomes and hippocampal features, its potential role in modifying the hippocampal communication transfer mechanisms with other brain regions remains largely unexplored. The putative genetic or environmental roots of the association between depression and structural connectivity alterations of the hippocampus were evaluated combining diffusion weighted imaging with both a quantitative genetics approach and molecular information on the rs1360780 single nucleotide polymorphism, in a sample of 54 informative monozygotic twins (27 pairs). Three main results were derived from the present analyses. First, graph-theoretical measures of hippocampal connectivity were altered in depression. Specifically, decreased connectivity strength and increased network centrality of the right hippocampus were found in depressed individuals. Second, these hippocampal alterations are potentially driven by familial factors (genes plus shared environment). Third, there is an additive interaction effect between FKBP5’s rs1360780 variant and the graph-theoretical metrics of hippocampal connectivity to influence depression risk. Our data reveals alterations of the communication patterns between the hippocampus and the rest of the brain in depression, effects potentially driven by overall familial factors (genes plus shared twin environment) and modified by the FKBP5 gene. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Brain network; Depression; DWI; FKBP5; Hippocampus; MZ twins","adult; age; Article; controlled study; depression; diffusion weighted imaging; environmental factor; female; FKBP5 gene; gene; genotype; heredity; hippocampus; human; intelligence quotient; major clinical study; male; monozygotic twins; nerve cell network; neuroimaging; priority journal; quantitative genetics; right hippocampus; single nucleotide polymorphism",2-s2.0-84955297838

The bearings are installed deep into the home appliances at the beginning of the production process and cannot be physically accessed once they are fully assembled. Before a home appliance is put to sale, it is turned on and passed through a sound-based sensor that produces an acoustic signal. Home appliances with defective embedded bearings are detected by analyzing such signals. The approached task is very challenging, mainly because there is a small number of sample signals and the noise level in the measurements is quite high. In fact, it is showed that the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough to mask important components when applying traditional Fourier decomposition techniques. Hence, a different approach is needed. Experimental results are reported on both laboratory and production line signals. Despite the difficulty of the task, these results are encouraging. Several classification methods were evaluated and most of them achieved acceptable performance.

The aim of these tests is to easily and reliably distinguish between real human users and (malicious) bots. The approach underlying FATCHA is to exploit real time capture of human actions instead of human ability to recognize visual or auditory items. The latter approach explicitly requires proposing a challenge difficult for an automatic responder but easy for a human. However, it is often the case that pursuing the first feature takes to lose the second one. Moreover the user task may be hindered by specific disabilities. According to FATCHA approach the system rather asks the user to carry out some trivial gesture, e.g., rotating or moving the head. The webcam, which is available in almost all computers or mobile devices, captures the user gesture, and the server (hosting the service to protect) matches it with the requested one. It is possible to extend the service with a second module that allows the user to authenticate himself by face recognition instead of using a password. On the contrary, FATCHA gesture challenge can be used as a liveliness test to avoid biometric spoofing.

Given a set of 2-D shapes PA is applied to remove rigid transformations. Later, a non-rigid 2-D model is computed by modeling the residual (e.g., PCA). Although PA has been widely used, it has several limitations for modeling 2-D shapes: occluded landmarks and missing data can result in local minima solutions, and there is no guarantee that the 2-D shapes provide a uniform sampling of the 3-D space of rotations for the object. To address previous issues, this paper proposes subspace PA (SPA). Given several instances of a 3-D object, SPA computes the mean and a 2-D subspace that can model rigid and non-rigid deformations of the 3-D object. We propose a discrete (DSPA) and continuous (CSPA) formulation for SPA, assuming that 3-D samples of an object are provided. DSPA extends the traditional PA, and produces unbiased 2-D models by uniformly sampling different views of the 3-D object. CSPA provides a continuous approach to uniformly sample the space of 3-D rotations, being more efficient in space and time. We illustrate the benefits of SPA in two different applications. First, SPA is used to learn 2-D face and body models from 3-D datasets. Experiments on the FaceWarehouse and CMU motion capture (MoCap) datasets show the benefits of our 2-D models against the state-of-the-art PA approaches and conventional 3-D models.

This paper presents the study conducted in Chenab River catchment, Pakistan, to develop and evaluate a hydrologic model using HEC-HMS for predicting flows based on TRMM rainfall data. The catchment was analyzed for hydro-morphological properties using SRTM DEM in HEC-GeoHMS. To rely on open source data as much as possible, digital soil map of the world developed by FAO and global land cover map developed by European Space Agency were utilized to compute Curve Number grid data for the catchment. These preliminary data analyses were employed to set initial values of different parameters to be used for model calibration. The model was calibrated for five rainfall events occurred in the rainy seasons of 2006, 2010 and 2013. The calibrated model was then validated for four other rainfall events of similar type in the same years. Consistency in simulated and observed flows was found with percent difference in volume ranging from −6.17 % to 5.47 % and percent difference in peak flows to be in the range of 6.96 % to 7.28 %. Values of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency were ranging from 0.299 to 0.909 with an average value of 0.586 for all flow events. The model was found well capable of capturing the hydrologic response of the catchment due to rainfall events and can be helpful in providing alerts of peak flows in real time based on real time/forecasted rainfall data. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Hydrologic modeling; Open source data; Peak flow events; TRMM Rainfall.

However, ELM cannot be easily parallelized, due to the presence of a pseudo-inverse calculation. Therefore, this paper aims to find a reliable method to realize a parallel implementation of ELM that can be applied to large datasets typical of Big Data problems with the employment of the most recent technology for parallel in-memory computation, i.e., Spark, designed to efficiently deal with iterative procedures that recursively perform operations over the same data. Moreover, this paper shows how to take advantage of the most recent advances in statistical learning theory (SLT) in order to address the issue of selecting ELM hyperparameters that give the best generalization performance. This involves assessing the performance of such algorithms (i.e., resampling methods and in-sample methods) by exploiting the most recent results in SLT and adapting them to the Big Data framework. The proposed approach has been tested on two affective analogical reasoning datasets. Affective analogical reasoning can be defined as the intrinsically human capacity to interpret the cognitive and affective information associated with natural language. In particular, we employed two benchmarks, each one composed by 21,743 common-sense concepts; each concept is represented according to two models of a semantic network in which common-sense concepts are linked to a hierarchy of affective domain labels. Results: The labeled data have been split into two sets: The first 20,000 samples have been used for building the model with the ELM with the different SLT strategies, while the rest of the labeled samples, numbering 1743, have been kept apart as reference set in order to test the performance of the learned model. The splitting process has been repeated 30 times in order to obtain statistically relevant results. We ran the experiments through the use of the Google Cloud Platform, in particular, the Google Compute Engine. We employed the Google Compute Engine Platform with NM = 4 machines with two cores and 1.8 GB of RAM (machine type n1-highcpu-2) and an HDD of 30 GB equipped with Spark. Results on the affective dataset both show the effectiveness of the proposed parallel approach and underline the most suitable SLT strategies for the specific Big Data problem. Conclusion: In this paper we showed how to build an ELM model with a novel scalable approach and to carefully assess the performance, with the use of the most recent results from SLT, for a sentiment analysis problem. Thanks to recent technologies and methods, the computational requirements of these methods have been improved to allow for the scaling to large datasets, which are typical of Big Data applications. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Algorithmic stability; Analogical reasoning; Classification; Extreme learning machines; Model selection; Rademacher complexity; Semi-supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Data mining; Engines; Inverse problems; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Parallel processing systems; Random access storage; Semantics; Supervised learning; Algorithmic stability; Analogical reasoning; Extreme learning machine; Model Selection; Rademacher complexity; Semi- supervised learning; Sentiment analysis; Big data",2-s2.0-84992202246

An interesting case in point is flyers distribution. Research and market figures prove that the distribution of advertising flyers still represents a valuable tool to attract potential customers to a company. It goes without saying that including personalized content in a company's flyer is more likely to yield better results than offering the same flyer to all potential clients. However, producing personalized flyers would imply unaffordable costs for a company. An efficient trade-off solution between accuracy and costs could be to define a maximum number of different flyers addressing different groups of users interested in their content. In order to systematically support this and similar trade-off solutions, we propose a novel type of group recommendations, which is able to detect a number of groups of end-users equal to the number of recommendation lists (e.g., flyers) that can be produced (i.e., the granularity with which the system can operate). Moreover, it can provide suggestions to the detected specific groups of users. In particular, we focus on the rating prediction for those items users do not evaluate. Indeed, rating prediction represents the main task that a recommender system is asked to perform and it becomes even more central if included into a group recommender system, since the predictions might be built for each user or for each group. Our approach also gives the possibility to efficiently manage the curse of the dimensionality phenomena caused by the sparsity of the ratings arising from big data handling. We present four granularity-based group recommender systems using different rating prediction algorithms and architectures. These systems employ the same algorithms to carry out other tasks (i.e., those that do not predict the ratings) and this allows us to evaluate which rating prediction approach is the most effective in terms of accuracy. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that, unlike group predictions, single user predictions can lead to improvements in the recommendation accuracy and the dealing of the curse of the dimensionality phenomena. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Clustering; Group recommendation; Rating prediction","Data handling; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Human computer interaction; Rating; Recommender systems; Clustering; Group recommendations; Group recommender systems; Personalized content; Potential customers; Prediction algorithms; Real-world datasets; Recommendation accuracy; Big data",2-s2.0-84994589514

In this paper I bring these two issues together. I argue for two theses, one descriptive and one normative. The descriptive thesis holds that ordinary human agents use what are generally called phenomenal mental states (e.g., pain and other emotions) to assign moral considerability to animals. I examine recent empirical research on the attribution of phenomenal states and agential states (e.g., memory and intelligence) to argue that phenomenal mental states are the primary factor, psychologically, for judging an animal to be morally considerable. I further argue that, given the role of phenomenal states in assigning moral considerability, certain theories in animal ethics will meet significant psychological resistance. The normative thesis holds that ethicists must take the psychology of attributing mental states into account when constructing moral ideals concerning animals. I draw from the literature in political philosophy on ideal and non-ideal theory to argue that non-ideal theories for animals must account for human psychology because—like current social and political conditions—human psychology limits the achievement of moral ideals. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Animal ethics; Mentalizing; Moral considerability; Moral status; Non-ideal theory; Phenomenal states",,2-s2.0-84970021128

Eighty-two Cantonese Chinese-speaking children between the age of 7; 8–9; 5 were assessed. Regression analyses on the full sample offered support for the first question. The children were also classified into four groups: Typically-developing (TD; N = 34), specific language impairment-only (SLI-only; N = 18), SLI-dyslexia comorbid (SLI-D; N = 22) and dyslexia-only (D-only; N = 8). Pair-wise comparisons focusing on the second question revealed that both the SLI-only and the D-only group performed worse than the TD group in reading comprehension after controlling for age and nonverbal intelligence. The SLI-only and the D-only group showed a different profile of deficits: only the SLI-only group performed worse than the TD group in working memory, comprehension monitoring, and inferencing. The SLI-D comorbid group did worse than the SLI-only, but not the D-only group, in reading comprehension. The SLI-D comorbid group did not do worse than either single diagnosis group in the higher-level language skills associated with reading comprehension. These findings suggested adopting different intervention approaches for reading comprehension difficulties in children with SLI versus children with dyslexia. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Chinese; Dyslexia; Reading comprehension; SLI",,2-s2.0-84983424438

Path loss, combined with other wireless propagation effects, makes this a challenging problem. Directing radio frequency (RF) transmissions toward the intended receiver can mitigate this issue; however, operating smart antenna technology is costly for resource-constrained robots, and its performance degrades in light-of-sight (LOS) conditions, which is common in outdoor scenarios. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose adding a secondary radio, combined with a passive reflector, which is only employed when the primary omnidirectional radio is deemed unreliable. The dynamic switching of the directional radio between sleep and idle states provides communication diversity, while striving to conserve energy for battery-powered systems. An efficient link quality (LQ) estimator based on fuzzy logic provides the intelligence necessary to perform the radio switching action.

However, querying such data is inherently sequential due to the nested structure of input data. Existing solutions pessimistically enumerate all execution paths to circumvent dependencies, yielding sub-optimal performance and limited scalability. This paper presents GAP, a parallelization scheme that, for the first time, leverages the grammar of the input data to boost the parallelization efficiency. GAP leverages static analysis to infer feasible execution paths for specific contexts based on the grammar of the semi-structured data. It can eliminate unnecessary paths without compromising the correctness. In the absence of a pre-defined grammar, GAP switches into a speculative execution mode and takes potentially incomplete grammar extracted either from prior inputs. Together, the dual-mode GAP reduces the execution paths from all paths to a minimum, therefore maximizing the parallelization efficiency and scalability. The benefits of path elimination go beyond reducing extra computation - it also enables the use of more efficient data structures, which further improves the efficiency. An evaluation on a large set of standard benchmarks with diverse queries shows that GAP yields significant efficiency increase and boosts the speedup of the state-of-the-art from 2.9X to 17.6X on a 20-core machine for a set of 200 queries. © 2017 ACM.","Grammar; Parallelization; XML; XPath","Input output programs; Parallel programming; Scalability; Static analysis; XML; Efficient data structures; Grammar; Parallelization efficiency; Parallelizations; Semi structured data; Speculative execution; Sub-optimal performance; XPath; Efficiency",2-s2.0-85014433333

With these sensory data, it is desired to provide various kinds of applications to serve the user. In this research, we aim at developing an indoor navigation system on smartphone using solely smartphone sensory data. There are many researches on indoor localization and navigation in the literature. Nevertheless, environmental sensors and/or wearable sensors are usually needed. This can be costly and inconvenient. In this paper, we propose a smartphone indoor localization system using only accelerometer and gyroscope data from the smartphone. The Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) approach is used to build this system. The PDR approach is simple and efficient though seems traditional. The major weakness of the PDR is that the estimation error would accumulate over time. Thus we propose to add so-called calibration marks which look like short arrows and are placed on both the floor plan and the ground. To use the system, the user first finds a calibration mark on the ground, stands on it and faces the right direction. He/she then moves the android icon (representing the user) on top of the calibration mark on the floor plan on the smartphone. When the user starts to move, the android icon also moves on the floor plan following the real-time estimation of step length and moving direction change for each step from accelerometer and gyroscope data. This is a prototype of an indoor navigation system that can become fully functional after an optimal path planning module is included. Experimental results of estimated walking trace tests show high accuracy. The system is promising and useful as long as a floor plan and calibration marks are built in advance. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Ambient intelligence; Indoor localization; Pedestrian dead reckoning; Smartphone applications",,2-s2.0-85009818560

Prediction is implemented using machine learning techniques. Spatial regression models are investigated through a comparative study to model the dataset features relationships for business behavior prediction. Geographically Weighted Regression model is found to be the most appropriate in predicting business turnouts of objects provided by Location Based Social Networks.

Most of the OLAP systems come with a tightly integrated user interface for querying and visualisation of data without the core OLAP operations exposed as an API. Advanced BI applications can be developed and composed to create complex workflows if the OLAP operations are available as an API. In addition, a Web Service based API would enable applications to use Service Oriented Architecture for Big Data Analytics and also easily be deployed on a Cloud. This paper documents the design and prototyping of an OLAP based Platform as a Service, termed OLAP as a Service (OLaaS). OLaaS exposes the core OLAP operations of OLAP Cube design, Slicing, Dicing, Rollup and Drilldown and data retrieval as RESTful Web Services for application programming and composition. Syntax and parsing logic for the Web Service call parameters is developed and an engine for Multidimensional Query (MDX) construction for the OLAP operations is developed. The Web Services are designed to use an existing OLAP engine for running the generated MDX queries. For flexibility and processing huge data sizes, data movement is allowed to be programmed using source and destination database sources set as parameters to the developed OLAP operation services. The designed OLaaS services are implemented in Java and integrated with the open-source Mondrian OLAP engine Olap4j. Standard OLAP Cube data is used to test and validate the OLaaS and its OLAP services. The prototyped OLaaS services have successfully passed the testing and validation. The performance of the services is evaluated on the test data and is found that the overhead of the REST request parsing and MDX query generation is comparable with the standalone MDX query processing time. © 2016 IEEE.","BI; Big Data; Cloud; MDX; OLAP; REST; Web Service; Work Flow","Application programming interfaces (API); Big data; Bismuth; Cloud computing; Clouds; Commerce; Computation theory; Data handling; Engines; Information services; Open source software; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Query languages; Query processing; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Syntactics; User interfaces; Visualization; Websites; Application programming; Complex workflows; Multi-dimensional queries; OLAP; Operation services; REST; RESTful Web services; Work-flows; Web services",2-s2.0-85015242613

Questionnaires measuring the Big Five, personality facets, intelligence, and GPA or vocational success criteria were used. Analyses revealed that intelligence, Conscientiousness, and Need for Achievement (AC) predicted both school and vocational success. Agreeableness and Need for Aggression (AG) (negatively) were associated with only academic success. Need for Affiliation (AF) and Need for Dominance (DO) predicted only professional success. Mediation analyses showed that AC, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness (girls scored higher), and AG (girls scored lower) mediated gender differences in academic success.

It can translate data into information and absorb information into graph knowledge repository by pre-embedded prior objectiveoriented algorithms knowledge in algorithm pool, deduce answers to retail queries from graph knowledge repository by the deductive reasoning ability provided by Jess rule engine. This paper also shows a customer value assessment case study by using RFM and K-means algorithms to demonstrate the proposed graph knowledge repository. © 2016 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Graph Knowledge Repository; KID Model; Knowledge Discovery Rule Engine; Retail Ontology","Competitive intelligence; Costs; Decision making; Engines; Graphic methods; Marketing; Ontology; Sales; Semantics; Cognitive model; Customer value assessments; Deductive reasoning; k-Means algorithm; Knowledge repository; Marketing strategy; Rule engine; Rule-based knowledge; Big data",2-s2.0-85013155815

Discovering these functional regions in cities can enable new types of valuable applications that can benefit different end users: Urban planners can better identify the proximity of existing functional regions and hence, can contribute a better future planning for the cities. Tourists can differentiate scenic areas from other business and residential areas which will help in reducing effort for trip planning. Moreover, local people can better understand each part of their cities by finding areas with particular functionality. With the rise of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) which attract lots of new users everyday with the potential of bridging the gap between the physical world and digital online social network services, we show in this paper that identifying functional regions taking into account temporal variations of geographic user activity has become possible and is more sensible when identifying functional regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach to modeling functional areas taking into account temporal variation by means of place categories. Our proposed approach compares between three clustering algorithms (Hierarchical, K-means, and Spectral) on areas and users of Manhattan borough in New York City using a dataset from one of the most vibrant LBSN, Foursquare. We demonstrate the impact of different temporal variations splits on the quality of the clustering algorithms comparing it to the default approach with no temporal variation. We believe that this research can not only yield a deeper understanding of a complex city but also can offer finer personalized recommendations based on regions' functionality that changes over space and time. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Housing; Location based services; Social networking (online); Functional areas; Location-based social networks; On-line social networks; Personalized recommendation; Residential areas; Residential districts; Spatio-temporal clustering; Temporal variation; Clustering algorithms",2-s2.0-85013634802

This raises the need for modeling a churn prediction system that is not only accurate but also encompasses comprehensibility and justifiability. Also the judgment ability of the domain expert to identify the drivers of churn and determine a correlation between those drivers plays a very important role. For the stakeholder or businessman, it is very important to predict the main drivers of churn to increase the profit. In this paper, we use a technique called Active Learning Based Approach (ALBA), with two rule induction methods, Decision Tree and Ripper to develop a churn prediction model that is not only accurate but also yields comprehensibility and justifiability. ALBA is a rule extraction technique based on a flavor of Support Vector Machine (SVM) called Active Learning. Basically, this approach is used as instance generator. Using this approach, we first remove noise from the data by replacing the SVM predicted labels with the original labels and secondly, we generate artificial instances in the noisy area near support vectors. These newly generated instances are not class-wise balanced. For this purpose, we use SMOTE to make them balanced. © 2016 IEEE.","Active Learning Based Approach; Comprehensibility; Decision Tree; Justifiability; Ripper; SMOTE; Support Vector Machine","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Forecasting; Support vector machines; Active Learning; Comprehensibility; Justifiability; Ripper; SMOTE; Telecommunication industry",2-s2.0-85013055782

Allity is a small IT company specialized in business intelligence applications located in Monterrey, Mexico, and this paper illustrates the process of designing Allity's Innovation Model in order to become an innovative firm. It shows the difficult environment that an SME confronts to innovate, such as the absence of institutions that support the practice of innovation and of qualified personnel to conduct innovation projects. Inside the firm this study identified some inhibitors such as the lack of knowledge of what innovation really is and that employees do not see the real possibilities that innovation can provide to the firm. Therefore the practice of innovation is seen as a risky initiative that inhibits its practice. An innovation model facilitates this process, as it clarifies the path that the firm should follow to develop innovation projects.

To handle e-commerce shipments, warehouses must be able to efficiently handle a large number of stock-keeping units (SKUs), pick and pack small volume orders, and deliver them on time in small parcel shipments to consumers. In this sense, traditional order fulfillment, which encompasses receiving, put-away, picking, and transport through the warehouse, might not be able to fully fulfill the requirements of e-commerce. Considering the fact that order picking in warehouses is one of the most costly activities amongst the logistics operating categories, there is a crucial need to adopt a wave picking strategy to handle e-commerce shipments, an order picking approach that groups the orders for picking at the same time to minimize repeated visits to nearby storage locations. To apply the wave picking strategy properly, decision support for establishing the timing of each wave and the quantity of items to be picked is essential. Therefore, in this paper, a case-based multi-agent wave picking decision support system is proposed to help decision-makers in generating wave picking sequences in order to handle e-commerce shipments, through the integration of case-based reasoning and multi-agent technique. After a pilot study of the proposed system in a third-party logistics service provider, the order-processing efficiency was greatly enhanced. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.",,"Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Commerce; Decision making; Electronic commerce; Multi agent systems; Outsourcing; Ships; Warehouses; Decision supports; E-commerce business; Multi-agent techniques; Order fulfillment; Order processing; Stock keeping unit; Storage location; Third party logistics; Decision support systems",2-s2.0-85016209789

While there is literature for prediction modeling on hospital health care services, non-exist for home-based care services. In this study, logistic regression, random forest and C5.0 decision tree were the models used in building a binary client churn classifier for a home-based care services company based in Australia. All models yielded prediction accuracies over 90% with tree based classifiers marginally higher and C5.0 model found to be suitable for use in this industry.

The Pareto sets construction and the modified ant graph model is introduced and two types of pheromone setting and updating strategies are compared to determine a more efficient multi-objective OR scheduling algorithm. The scheduling results by four different approaches, i.e. the simulation, the ACO with single objective of makespan (ACO-SO), the ACO with multi-objective by weighted sum method (ACO-weighted-sum), and the hybrid Pareto set-ACO with multi-objectives (PSACO-MO) are compared.

These problems need fast and accurate algorithms, not only to locate the optimum in a limited amount of time but also track its trajectories as close as possible. Although lots of research efforts have been given in developing dynamic benchmark generator/problems and proposing algorithms to solve these problems, the role of numerical performance measurements have been barely considered in the literature. Several performance criteria have been already proposed to evaluate the performance of algorithms. However, because they only take confined aspects of the algorithms into consideration, they do not provide enough information about the effectiveness of each algorithm. In this paper, at first we review the existing performance measures and then we present a set of two measures as a framework for comparing algorithms in dynamic environments, named fitness adaptation speed and alpha–accuracy. A comparative study is then conducted among different state-of-the-art algorithms on moving peaks benchmark via proposed metrics, along with several other performance measures, to demonstrate the relative advantages of the introduced measures.

This need has necessitated the adoption of business intelligence tools like data warehousing (DW) to ensure quality and the segregation of analytical operations from mainframe transaction processing. However, the benefits of DW adoption have been primarily enjoyed by the private sector and little effort has been made to adopt business intelligence tools in the public sector.

The study aims to identify which parts of the BI business value process have been studied and are still most in need of research, and to propose specific research questions for the future. The findings show that organizations appear to obtain value from BI systems according to the process suggested by Soh and Markus (1995), as a chain of necessary conditions from BI investments to BI assets to BI impacts to organizational performance; however, researchers have not sufficiently studied the probabilistic processes that link the necessary conditions together.

This has a major impact on the fundamental of the traditional Business Intelligence (BI) and Knowledge Management (KM) processes. How does this trend square with the way we conceptualize knowledge as intellectual capital and value it? Knowledge management and business intelligence have both recognized data and information though generally as non-value precursors of valuable knowledge assets. In establishing the conceptual foundation of big data as an additional valuable assets related to knowledge, we are making a case for bringing big data and business intelligence into the KM fold. In developing this theoretical foundation, concepts such as tacit and explicit knowledge, learning, and others can be deployed to increase understanding. As a result, we believe we can help the field better understand the idea of big data and how it relates to knowledge assets as well as providing a justification for bringing knowledge management tools and processes to bear on big data and business intelligence, a move towards an integrated conceptual model of big data (BD), business intelligence (BI) and knowledge management (KM). KM is the continuum of BD as the main information deposit, and BI is an activity necessary for the mobilization of the information resource. Thus it necessitates the collective intelligence to be structured in the context of BI to convert data into actionable knowledge for strategic advantage relative to the various organizational environments. This paper will contribute to the creation of such a model that is the focus of on-going research.

Given the economic crisis in Portugal and poor healthcare system in need of profound improvements, the need to increase the efficiency of resource management and services is imperative. With the increasing use of Business Intelligence (BI) in organisations and the proven effectiveness of this, comes the desire to use BI in healthcare, specifically in the healthcare of Misericórdia. One of the purposes of this article is to present the results obtained through the development of the dissertation whose theme is ""Prototyping of Business Intelligence component to support the management in the health area of a Misericórdia"". So, in this work, some concepts associated with the use of BI in Misericórdias were addressed, and the Pervasive BI architecture of the developed solution was designed. It is also important to emphasise that the solution presented is pervasive, available anywhere at any time. Furthermore, a set of metrics were developed and the data presented in the form of dashboards, for later use by the users. Through this work, it was possible to gather all the data into a single structure (Data Mart), to identify a set of aspects that can be improved and to have a generalised view of the state of operation of the organisation, as far as health care is concerned.l. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

In this paper, we consider the software process, which is one of the key factors and show how a software process model may be applied to business intelligence (BI) process by defining the entire BI process as a two stage software component process model which internally involves other components. For this purpose, we have defined two software process component models for the entire BI process. We also emphasise all key considerations that need to be followed to achieve successful BI results. We throw light on how the sequential iteration phase can be applied at each component level.

In IoT, collaboration among domain knowledge experts, data scientists, systems architects, and total system consultants are inevitable. Because each specialty is totally different and it is hard to cover all of knowledge in one person. The role of consultants is important how they can coordinate these multi-disciplinary people and knowledge, and manage to create architecture for domain specific IoT applications, such as healthcare, autonomous driving, smart city, and smart home, etc. We show how these multi-disciplinary people interact, design and implement business oriented deep learning applications. In many cases, even domain knowledge people cannot tell where such data are hidden in the companies and how should be analyzed. In business applications, to show rapid prototyping system as Proof of Concept (PoC) is also important for these multi-disciplinary people and business executives to discuss the effectiveness and I direction of data analysis. Especially business executives sometimes only can know how IoT analytics systems are effective only by showing the analytics results in intuitive graphical expression.

In this paper, we are tackling the problem of predicting total sales in order to print the right amount of books and doing so even before the book has reached the stores. A real dataset including the complete sales data for books published in Spain across several years has been used. We have conducted an analysis in three stages: an initial exploratory analysis, by means of data visualisation techniques; a feature selection process, using different techniques to find out what are the variables that have more impact on sales; and a regression or prediction stage, in which a set of machine learning methods has been applied to create forecasting models for book sales. The obtained models are able to predict sales from pre-publication data with remarkable accuracy, and can be visualised as simple decision trees. Thus, these can be used as decision-aid tools for publishers, which can provide a reliable guidance on the decision process of publishing a book. This is also shown in the paper by addressing four example cases of representative publishers, regarding their number of sales and the number of different books they sell. © 2016","Book sales forecasting; Decision-aid models; Feature selection; Regression","Artificial intelligence; Data visualization; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Printing; Trees (mathematics); Business management; Computational intelligence methods; Decision aids; Exploratory analysis; Forecasting models; Machine learning methods; Regression; Sales forecasting; Sales",2-s2.0-84995912428

A cross-sectional survey design was used to measure the EI of third-year undergraduate occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech pathology and second-year business students (n = 369). Results showed that over 40% of therapy students reported scores that are considered low or markedly low in the EI domains of independence, problem-solving and stress tolerance. The EI scores for therapy students that were significantly higher than the Australian EI norms were self-actualization, interpersonal relationships, empathy, and impulse control. The mean scores of business students were within the normal range for all EI domains. A recommendation of our study is to include strategies that develop EI throughout the therapy curriculum and when preparing students for clinical placements.","Business students; Clinical placements; Curriculum; Emotional intelligence; Occupational therapy; Physiotherapy; Speech Pathology; Work-integrated learning",,2-s2.0-85029580176

Integration of data from multiple sources has the potential to enable a user to draw valuable insights, which can be used to enhance service targeting and delivery, and to improve program evaluation. In recognition of the need to improve data integration the University of Wollongong and the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) partnered to create an integrated housing stock database for the Illawarra region. The database serves as the backbone for an online and interactive Housing Stock Mapping Dashboard (HSMD). It assembled multilevel granular information (including at the Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) and Local Government Area (LGA) level) collected from multiple historical programs by multiple agencies. This centralised, integrated data repository can help agencies understand the existing housing stock, and improve access to information to support evidence-based policy. This paper presents a model of how data can be integrated from multiple agencies to provide an online collaboration platform. The platform, HSMD, was designed to demonstrate to government, industry, and the research community the opportunity of data integration and advanced analytics. Potential applications of the HSMD include characterisation of the existing housing stock according to a range of building attributes, for instance the presence of ceiling insulation or rainwater tanks. Comparison of these attributes with energy consumption data can indicate the influence of the attribute, or the impact of a specific intervention. This can help policy makers understand uptake and penetration of previous rebate schemes. © 2017 The Authors.","built environment; energy; energy epidemiology; housing stock mapping; visualisation","Energy utilization; Housing; Mapping; Visualization; Built environment; energy; Energy consumption datum; Existing housing stocks; Granular informations; Housing stock; Local government areas; On-line collaborations; Data integration",2-s2.0-85020816591

It is driven by the need for analysis techniques that allow businesses to understand and improve their processes. One of the most common applications of BPI is reporting, which consists on the structured generation of information (i.e., reports) from raw data. In this article, state-of-the-art process mining techniques are used to periodically produce automated reports that relate the actual performance of students of a Dutch University to their studying behavior. To avoid the tedious manual repetition of the same process mining procedure for each course, we have designed a workflow calling various process mining techniques using RapidProM. To ensure that the actual students’ behavior is related to their actual performance (i.e., grades for courses), our analytic workflows approach leverages on process cubes, which enable the dataset to be sliced and diced based on courses and grades. The article discusses how the approach has been operationalized and what is the structure and concrete results of the reports that have been automatically generated. Two evaluations were performed with lecturers using the real reports. During the second evaluation round, the reports were restructured based on the feedback from the first evaluation round. Also, we analyzed an example report to show the range of insights that they provide. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.","Analytic workflows; Business process reporting; Education; Process cubes; Process mining","Data mining; Geometry; Students; Teaching; Analysis techniques; Automatically generated; Business Process; Business Process Intelligence; Emerging topics; Process mining; State of the art; Work-flows; Education",2-s2.0-85012965460

This paper extends a previous proposal where an innovative ensemble-learning framework for mining business process deviances was introduced, hinging on multi-view learning scheme. Specifically, we introduce here an alternative meta-learning method for probabilistically combining the predictions of different base DDMs. The entire learning method is embedded into a conceptual system architecture that is meant to support the detection and analysis of deviances in a Business Process Management scenario.

In SemNOTAM, many BRs apply across several situations and thus can be collected into super-situations. To support an incremental BR elicita-tion process, required by their number, and later maintenance of BRs, an adequate BR management system is vital. However, current systems provide mostly simple organisation techniques insufficient for SemNOTAM. Many research fields, e.g., library information science, manage large information bases by utilising problem-specific contexts. These contexts may be hierarchically structured.

A machine learning methodology, based on an alternating diffusion process, is applied for organizing the SMEs into a network/graph, and generating management profiles. The method relies on ideas from non-linear dimensionality reduction, where a data-set is parameterized by a small number of intrinsic parameters. Recent advances in this field allow for the construction of a common intrinsic representation for two related dataset by using kernel multiplication. In this work, the method is applied to two related datasets that describe a business from two angles: strategic planning and performance. The goal is to reveal underlying hidden strategic patterns that influence SMEs' performance.The proposed methods are applied to a dataset containing planning and performance measures of 467 businesses. The obtained model yields an SME graph, where SMEs that share similar planning strategies and performances are located close to each other. Thus, the model generates typical strategic planning and performance profiles, describing distinct groups of SMEs. The study reveals two different planning strategies emphasizing different management approaches that lead to successful performance. Thus, in service SMEs there is more than one way to enhance performance via management strategy. Differentiating between various planning strategies was enabled by utilizing kernel based machine learning methods, thereby overcoming limitations of linear methods that cannot provide such sensitive profile configurations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Kernel methods; Low-dimensional embedding; Machine learning; Performance measurement and business improvement","Artificial intelligence; Industrial economics; Strategic planning; Business improvements; Kernel methods; Low dimensional embedding; Machine learning methods; Management strategies; Nonlinear dimensionality reduction; Small and medium sized business; Small and medium-size enterprise; Learning systems",2-s2.0-85030463380

Having identified some undesirable tendencies, conclusions and design recommendations are provided on how to remedy the situation. This includes the need for redefining the ‘smart everything’ paradigm, in order to reconcile humans and technology. It starts out with placing Ambient Intelligence in the context of Ubiquitous Computing, Disappearing Computer and Internet of Things (IoT). The application areas discussed are motivated by living in the Urban Age, i.e. the increasing importance and preeminent role of cities. Examples are ‘transient spaces’ and airports viewed as ‘transient cities’. Different notions of the ‘smart city of the future’ are introduced and complemented by the concept of ‘hybrid cities’, i.e. integrating the virtual, digital world with the real, physical world. The current hype about abundant business opportunities of smart cities requires a critical investigation. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides the infrastructure for collecting data about urban objects and citizens including their behavior. A wide range of information is combined and subjected to extensive ‘big data’ exploitation efforts – very often conducted without explicit consent of the people involved. In order to explore the challenges, but also the venues towards a more human-centered IoT, resp. an Ambient Intelligence approach, one has to explore the implications of matching people’s profiles with service options available at specific locations. A major focus is on the risks resulting from smart city installations, especially the serious infringements of privacy rights, i.e., usage of personal data without consent of the people concerned. Our thesis is that a critical reflection of different manifestations of the ‘smart everything’ paradigm is needed in order to meet the overall goal of reconciling humans and technology. A central aspect of this goal is to keep the ‘human in the loop’ and in control. Therefore, a citizen-centered design approach for future cities is needed, helping us to go ‘beyond smart-only cities’ and transform them into Humane, Sociable and Cooperative Smart Hybrid Cities. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data privacy; Internet of things; Smart city; Ubiquitous computing; Business opportunities; Critical reflections; Design approaches; Design recommendations; Disappearing computers; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Keynote presentation; Ambient intelligence",2-s2.0-85017590122

On the practical side, there are several suites for control flow and data modeling; nonetheless, when it comes to formal verification, the data perspective is abstracted away due to the intrinsic difficulty of handling unbounded data. On the theoretical side, there is significant literature providing decidability results for expressive data-aware processes. However, they struggle to produce a concrete impact as being far from real BPM architectures and, most of all, not providing actual verification tools. In this paper we aim at bridging such a gap: we provide a concrete framework which, on the one hand, being based on Petri Nets and relational models, is close to the widely used BPM suites, and on the other is grounded on solid formal basis which allow to perform formal verification tasks.

To be able to capture such changes, business events have to be considered as bitemporal, where the occurrence (scheduled) time and detection time of events are differentiated. Modifying an event’s content may result in a contingency that has to be handled appropriately.

Food for its communicational and cultural attributes can be regard as a point-cut that intercultural dialogue can be fostered basing on the cultural seminaries and differences. The overseas Chinese community in Milan has reached a considerable population, and the migrants have adapted to the local economy while maintaining forms of social separation that is regarded as a cultural enclave. This paper takes the Chinese migrant food business as the breakthrough since it is one of the most common migratory activities in Milan, and Italian people relatively wider accept Chinese food. This paper adopts two digital methods, OpenStreetMaps (OSM) and Web crawler, to capture the context of Chinese migrant food business in Milan and to explore Italian customers’ viewpoints about it. The result shows the need of improving Chinese migrants’ public image and enriching Italian hosts’ knowledge of migrants.

By doing so, the interactions of the intangibles are better understood and recommendations can be made for the appropriate structure of big data systems in different circumstances. Metrics are also applied to illustrate how one can identify and understand what these different circumstances might look like. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is chiefly conceptual, combining theory from multiple disciplines enhanced with practical applications. Illustrative data drawn from other empirical work are applied to illustrate some concepts. Findings: Theory suggests that the KM theory is particularly useful in guiding big data system installations that focus primarily on the transfer of data/information. For big data systems focused on analytical insights, the CI theory might be a better match, as the system structures are actually quite similar. Practical implications: Though the guidelines are general, practitioners should be able to evaluate their own situations and perhaps make better decisions about the direction of their big data systems. One can make the case that all the disciplines have something to add to improving how intangibles are deployed and applied and that improving coordination between KM and analytics/intelligence functions will help all intangibles systems to work more effectively. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, very few scholars work in this area, at the intersection of multiple types of intangible assets. The metrics are unique, especially in their scale and attachment to theory, allowing insights that provide more clarity to scholars and practical direction to industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Business analytics; Competitive intelligence; Intellectual capital; Knowledge management",,2-s2.0-85014752536

However, there are many organisations that have made significant investments in these technologies without the expected returns. What organisations must understand is that the application of the analytics itself is a small part of the process and if the expected results are to be realized a more structured process model must be followed. The most common approach is the KDDM process model, which includes a very important data preparation stage. Although the steps of these structured processes are well defined, in some cases, especially as it relates to data preparation, there are additional techniques that can be used to harness greater value from the data. These techniques are not well documented and this paper seeks to help fill this void by demonstrating what can be done in the data preparation stage to increase the value of the analytics. As more focus is placed on the importance of following a process model and on demonstrating the power of data preparation techniques the more likely it is that organisations will gain greater returns on their investments in their analytics investments. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Business intelligence; Decision trees; Financial sector; KDDM; Payments analytics","Competitive intelligence; Decision trees; Information analysis; Information systems; Investments; Societies and institutions; Data preparation; Financial sectors; Financial service; KDDM; Payments analytics; Process Modeling; Structured process; Structured process models; Finance",2-s2.0-85018617738

Before we can track performance metrics we need to articulate the data and processes that define the metrics. However, the data sources are often varied and the processes ill-defined making it hard to engineer systems to collect and analyze metrics. Further, the ability to share data between organizations is impacted by culture, technology and privacy issues. To date there are few methodological approaches for modeling a health system from the perspective of metrics, data sources, and touch points to enable performance management of community based healthcare delivery.

In order to understand the new situation, the article introduces the notion of social and multimodal media intelligence. With cases taken primarily from the Swedish media intelligence sector, we argue that data driven media intelligence today needs to pay in-creasing attention to new forms of (A.) crowd-oriented and (B.) multimedia-saturated information. Media intelligence usually refers to the gathering of publicly available information about an organisation or a company's compet-itors-using it to gain business advantages. Traditionally such intelligence has implied a set of techniques and tools that transforms numerical or textual data into useful information for business analysis. Today, however, we argue that such techniques need to consider media alterations in both a social and multimodal direction. By presenting some findings from the so called CIBAS-project (as a case study), we describe how Swedish organisations and companies rely on social networking structures and individual decision making as a means to increase response and agile creativity. Yet if media intelligence has witnessed a social transition during recent years, the analyses of other media modalities than text also pose a number of technical hurdles. In this article we use fashion analytics as another case in point, taken from a commercial sector where visual big data is presently in vogue. © The author.

Theoretically grounded in organizational contingency theory, decision support systems (DSSs) and business process management literature, this design science project proposes the development of a DSS which incorporates bottom-up process mining in addition to other top-down sources of process knowledge for business process transformation. The DSS is intended to provide support in both the selection of an appropriate target process design as well as transformation support on the task level. This design project is conducted within a large-scale digital transformation project of a leading German manufacturing corporation to redesign business processes including the migration of the current SAP R/3 system to the SAP S/4 HANA business suite. Therefore, this design science research (DSR) utilizes a real-life event log comprising transaction data from multiple ERP systems as data source for the process mining module of the DSS and the later evaluation of the artifact.

The development of approaches able to face effectively this problem represents a hard challenge due to several problems. The most important among them are the heterogeneity and the imbalanced class distribution of data, problems that lead toward a reduction of the effectiveness of the most used techniques, making it difficult to define effective models able to evaluate the new transactions. This paper proposes a new strategy able to face the aforementioned problems based on a model defined by using the Discrete Fourier Transform conversion in order to exploit frequency patterns, instead of the canonical ones, in the evaluation process. Such approach presents some advantages, since it allows us to face the imbalanced class distribution and the cold-start issues by involving only the past legitimate transactions, reducing the data heterogeneity problem thanks to the frequency-domain-based data representation, which results less influenced by the data variation. A practical implementation of the proposed approach is given by presenting an algorithm able to classify a new transaction as reliable or unreliable on the basis of the aforementioned strategy.

It is a problem directly correlated with the use of credit cards, considering that almost all the operators that offer goods or services in the e-commerce space allow their customers to use them for making payments. The main disadvantage of these powerful methods of payment concerns the fact that they can be used not only by the legitimate users (cardholders) but also by fraudsters. Literature reports a considerable number of techniques designed to face this problem, although their effectiveness is jeopardized by a series of common problems, such as the imbalanced distribution and the heterogeneity of the involved data. The approach presented in this paper takes advantage of a novel evaluation criterion based on the analysis, in the frequency domain, of the spectral pattern of the data. Such strategy allows us to obtain a more stable model for representing information, with respect to the canonical ones, reducing both the problems of imbalance and heterogeneity of data. Experiments show that the performance of the proposed approach is comparable to that of its state-of-the-art competitor, although the model definition does not use any fraudulent previous case, adopting a proactive strategy able to contrast the cold-start issue.

By applying such an approach to data warehouse (DW) projects, we can minimize a great deal of time and cost. Furthermore, most of OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP) platforms seem to be like black boxes that provide wizards only to business intelligence developers to create and manipulate OLAP objects without allowing their sustainability and migration from a platform to another. That is why many works in the literature have proposed using the MDA approach in DW projects. However, most of them have mainly focused on the generation of the DW relational model from the conceptual one, and they overlooked the OLAP model and the cube implementation. To deal with this problem, we propose in this paper an MDA solution to automate the process of getting OLAP cube and its implementation through a set of metamodels and automatic transformations among them. In fact, the proposal generates the OLAP and DW relational models (PSMs) from the conceptual one, using also a PDM model that describes the target business intelligence platform.

For instance, modelling banking transactions is widely used to not only enhance business performance but also as a security measure. Quite often potential information arises in the form of data clusters. However, challenges and opportunities appear to home in onto the determination of exactly which clusters contain 'interesting' information. Cluster optimisation still remains a major challenge within the data science community. We propose a two-phase algorithm that starts with cluster identification and optimises clusters by testing cluster parameters. To attain optimisation, dimensional reduction methods are carried out iteratively, measuring and testing each pattern for significance. Using transactional banking data, the algorithm sets cluster optimisation as a basis for identifying banking transactional behaviour. The novel method presents potential extensions into forensic investigations in fields such as accounting, criminology, engineering and many others. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Banking narrations; Big data; Business intelligence; Clustering; Data mining; Modelling",,2-s2.0-85030129908

More and more business focus has thus been added to the integration and processing of data in the enterprise environment. Developing and maintaining Extraction-Transform-Load (ETL) processes becomes critical in most data-driven organizations. External Data Sources (EDSs) often change their schema which potentially leaves the ETL processes that extract data from those EDSs invalid. Repairing these ETL processes is time-consuming and tedious. As a remedy, we propose MAIME as a tool to (semi-)automatically maintain ETL processes. MAIME works with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and uses a graph model as a layer of abstraction on top of SSIS Data Flow tasks (ETL processes). We introduce a graph alteration algorithm which propagates detected EDS schema changes through the graph. Modifications done to a graph are directly applied to the underlying ETL process. It can be configured how MAIME handles EDS schema changes for different SSIS transformations. For the considered set of transformations, MAIME can maintain SSIS Data Flow tasks (semi-)automatically. Compared to doing this manually, the amount of user inputs is decreased by a factor of 9.5 and the spent time is reduced by a factor of 9.8 in an evaluation. 2017, Copyright is with the authors.","Information systems [Information integration]: Extraction, transformation and loading","Data flow analysis; Data handling; Data transfer; Data warehouses; Extraction; Flow graphs; Information analysis; Integration; Business intelligence applications; Enterprise environment; External data sources; Information integration; Integration services; Maintenance managers; Schema changes; Success factors; Data integration",2-s2.0-85017118320

However, its application challenges traditional institutional arrangements as well as roles that are related to the management of data.

A Delphi survey was conducted to integrate expert assessments of projections up to the year 2035 and fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to identify future scenarios that span the future of BDA in SCM. The study suggests that BDA will improve demand forecasts, reduce safety stocks and improve the management of supplier performance.

Our protocol consists of three phases: (1) Set-up phase-BeeCluster, (2) Route discovery phase-BeeSearch and (3) Data transmission phase-BeeCarrier. Integration of three phases for clustering, data routing and transmission, is the key aspect of our proposed protocol, which ultimately contributes to its robustness.

In this paper, the link between the actions undertaken by management in retail and the relationship with the environment provided by IT systems is considered. Many retailers in the United Kingdom make use of sensor devices to understand the behaviour of their customers. As retail outlets grow over a period of time, the diversity of sensor devices may change as new devices are installed. Equally, outlets that are operated within retail groups will collect and store data locally. As a consequence, management within the retail sector face a number of challenges to understand the operation of individual outlets and the holistic performance of retail chains. As a result, both the IT systems and also the working practices employed to complete the day to day tasks essential to meet the needs of a retailer's customers rapidly become unfit for purpose. The case study considered in this paper reviews the requisite practices adopted by a service provider in the business intelligence sector, and the positive impact that the company realised through the re-engineering of both IT systems and business workflows.

Based on the context of US network television (TV) programs, we collected measures for Facebook likes and Facebook talk for 38 TV programs and their respective Nielsen ratings over a period of five weeks, resulting in a sample size of 165 weekly observations. In testing OLS regression models, we determined that key social media measures, proxy for social capital, are positively associated with performance ratings. In essence, TV programs with a higher number of Facebook likes (bridging) and Facebook talk (bonding) are likely to relate to higher performance ratings. In addition we conclude that weak ties (bridging) are important as a conduit to connect fans to TV shows but in the long run, strong ties (bonding) are needed to reinforce those relationships towards fan loyalty.

Specifically, it examines the role of the predictive analytics (PA) project initiator in the integration of financial and operational sales forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a field study method to address the studied phenomenon in eight Finnish companies that have recently adopted PA systems. The data are primarily based on 19 interviews in the companies and five interviews with the PA consultants. Findings: The authors found that initiators appear to play a major role regarding the degree of integration of financial and operational sales forecasts. The initiators from an accounting function have a tendency to pay more attention to the integration than the representatives from other functions, such as operations and sales.

Back-office staff citizenship behaviour, in turn, affects customer-related organisational performance. Originality/value: The emotions deployed by employees in interactions with customers clearly shape customers’ perceptions of service quality, as well as employee-level performance outcomes. However, prior literature lacks insights into the simultaneous effects of front-line and back-office employee behaviour, especially in B2B settings. This paper addresses these research gaps by investigating triadic relationships – among back-office employees, front-line employees and customer outcomes – in a B2B setting, where they are of particular managerial interest. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Citizenship behaviours; Customer service employees; Emotional intelligence; Matched data; Moderation; Organizational performance",,2-s2.0-85018875781

Based on the normal distribution of IQ scores within a nation, the population was classified into three groups, specifically intellectual class, average ability, and non-intellectual class, which were represented by the 95th, 50th, and the 5th percentiles of IQ level respectively. Using a robust regression method, the impact of each IQ class on the ease of doing business (EDB) index was examined. The sub-indicators of the ten business regulatory environment across 71 countries were studied. In this study, the effect of IQ was controlled for the levels of economic freedom, GDP per capita, freedom of corruption, and tertiary education. Results revealed strong evidence that the IQ of the intellectual class had contributed most to the enhancement of the regulatory environment, which is supportive for entrepreneurship. This result was consistent with the term 'creative minority' coined by the prominent historian Arnold Toynbee.

This is also extended to draw outan analytical framework to advance our understanding of how BPM mediate ES-MAPs interplay. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional case study was adopted as a research strategy with which to collect data about the ES-BPM-MAPs interplay as a unit of analysis. The latter, in the first stage, was examined across (89) mini-case studies operating in the UK context through reports and documentations collected from cases' websites, vendors and consultants of information systems. Drawn insights from cross-sectional analysis and contributions made by prior studies are blended together to inform the second stage that outlines an analytical framework for ES-BPM-MAPs interplay. Findings: Different ES are mobilised to address different orientations of BPMs and being used for different managerial functions and purposes. Different patterns of ES-BPM-MAPs interplay are identified across (89) UK-case studies and the BPM is a fulcrum understanding. These patterns are centred around three key BPM including customer, logistics and control processes and all oriented by a continuum of an organisation intention focus on control, understanding and strategising. Both processes and orientations explain ES development and MAPs evolution processes. Standardisation, integration and intelligence are key characteristics sought through ES mobilisations. By complementary, information provision, analytics and simulation are three sophisticated ways of using MA information facilitated by ES characteristics. Research limitations/implications: Dynamic processes of MAPs change over time and are beyond the reach of this study. Such approach requires full access to case studies. BPM is fulcrum understanding of MAPs change and/or stability in relation to ES implementation including other components. Practical implications: Findings and analytical framework could be used as a base for establishing the best approach in adopting ES to fully exploit the potential of future ES applications as well as to avoid organisations pitfalls of implementations. Organisations are advised to understand their existing business processes, characteristics of MA information would be achieved first upon which decision of ES components selection and implementation could be outlined. Originality/value: The indirect interplay between ES and MAPs through business processes is rarely examined. By the inclusion of BPM and using cross-sectional case studies, this research contributes to the existing shortcomings of ES-MAPs interplay by broadening the picture and proposing an analytical framework. The latter advances our understanding by focusing on attributes of ES-BPM-MAPs upon which informal changes in-the use of MAPs are recognised. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business process management; Enterprise systems; Erp; Management accounting practices; Organizational change",,2-s2.0-85027464749

Before Social Networking Site came out, the usual way business marketing strategies are TV commercials, print advertisements and activities. After Social Networking Site got popular, more and more businesses turned to use the Internet as a strategy of marketing because the cost is inexpensive and it is easier to gain potential clients through the whole world. One of the Internet’s characteristics is virtually, which is a difficulty for business to run their website because they cannot actually observe their customers’ behavior. In this study, we try to use the data that we collect to analysis the behavior of iCook fan Page’s fans based on Dialogic Theory. Dialogic Theory has five facets, Dialogic Loop, Usefulness of Information, Generation of Return Visits, Ease of the Interface and Conservation of Visitors. Most of the studies used content analysis to analysis the criteria they defined, we define the criteria form user’s perspective and collect the data in a more convenient way. Moreover, we attempt to find out the relationship between Dialogic Theory and the change of fan number. The study found out that some criteria have relationship with fan’s number, which means if a business wants to improve their public strategy on fanpage, they can start from looking for these criteria. These criteria can help a business to run their fanpage more effectively; it also helps to gain fans’ value on the Internet. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Dialogic theory; Facebook; Fanpage; Social networking site","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Data acquisition; Marketing; Planning; Strategic planning; Swarm intelligence; Business marketing; Content analysis; Dialogic theory; Exploratory studies; Facebook; Fanpage; Social networking sites; TV commercial; Social networking (online)",2-s2.0-85026754271

This response time can be reduced substantially by selecting and materializing pre-computed views that can provide answers to analytical queries. In this paper, an attempt has been made to select optimal sets of views, which would significantly reduce response time of analytical queries.

This can take place, inter alia, when an inappropriate choice of a BPM formalism for a given BPM context has been made. Such an improper choice is due not only to the availability of a huge number of BPM formalisms but also to the lack of guidelines assisting in the selection process.

A desirable feature is to produce a minimal yet complete set of behavioral differences. Existing conformance checking techniques that achieve these properties do not scale up to real-life process models and logs. This paper presents an approach that addresses this shortcoming by exploiting automata-based techniques. A log is converted into a deterministic automaton in a lossless manner, the input process model is converted into another minimal automaton, and a minimal error-correcting synchronized product of both automata is calculated using an A* heuristic. The resulting automaton is used to extract alignments between traces of the model and traces of the log, or statements describing behavior observed in the log but not captured in the model. An evaluation on synthetic and real-life models and logs shows that the proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art method for complete conformance checking. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Automata; Behavioral alignment; Conformance checking; Process mining","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Automata; Conformance checking; Desirable features; Deterministic automata; Minimal automaton; Process mining; State-of-the-art methods; Synchronized product; Automata theory",2-s2.0-85032684469

The internal data processing system of a company can only offer minimum support because it is related to transactions. In this case, decision support systems (DSS) combine human skills with the capabilities of computers to provide efficient management of data, reporting, analytics, modeling and planning issues. DSS provide a distinction between structured, semi structured and unstructured data. In particular, a DSS reduces the quantity of data to a high quality structured amount; due to this, decisions are made to support the manufacturing process. In addition, the goal of these systems is to avoid problems within the production process even before they emerge.

This imposes strong requirements on grinding-machine technology and on the understanding of this finalising process. While grinding has unique capabilities it is nevertheless in competition with other machining processes. The evolution of grinding machines is driven by process requirements like accuracy, MRR, and subsurface integrity. The regeneration of the tool on the machine with dressing devices is to be regarded as unique for grinding machines, hence a grinding machine always runs two separate processes. The high accuracy of grinding has, in fact, been an obstacle to simply adopting developments from other machining processes. Also, a lack of experienced machinists and a general trend towards individualized products and one-piece flow has required a transition from an experience-based approach to a science-based approach. Development is further driven by market demands, such as cost-reduction in terms of CAPEX, footprint, TCO versus quality, and throughput, which affect business models and the machine's design and construction. Moreover, the current mega-trends – such as resource efficiency, individualization, ergonomics and Industry 4.0 – are changing the appearance of grinding machines, which is also affected by the availability of new technologies, especially sensors, actuators and the control or machine intelligence.

The business model used in the e-commerce web site, for which the model is implemented, includes many sellers that sell the same product at the same time at different prices where the company operates a market place model. The demand prediction for such a model should consider the price of the same product sold by competing sellers along the features of these sellers. In this study we first applied different regression algorithms for specific set of products of one department of a company that is one of the most popular online e-commerce companies in Turkey. Then we used stacked generalization or also known as stacking ensemble learning to predict demand. Finally, all the approaches are evaluated on a real world data set obtained from the e-commerce company.

Optimization of online analytical query processing (OLAP) could substantially minimize delays in query response time. Materialized view is an efficient and effective OLAP query optimization technique to minimize query response time. Selecting a set of such appropriate views for materialization is referred to as view selection, which is a nontrivial task. In this regard, an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) based view selection algorithm (ABCVSA), which has been adapted by incorporating N-point and GBFS based N-point random insertion operations, to select Top-K views from a multidimensional lattice is proposed.

We introduce POCBR and describe how it can be applied to the experience-based generation of workflows by retrieval and adaptation of available best-practice workflow models. While existing approaches have already demonstrated their feasibility in principle, the generated workflows are not optimized with respect to complexity requirements. However, there is a high interest in workflows with a low complexity, e.g., to ensure the appropriate enactment as well as the understandability of the workflow. The main contribution of this paper is thus a novel approach to consider the workflow complexity during the workflow generation. Therefore, a complexity measure for workflows is proposed and integrated into the retrieval and adaptation process.

Clustering algorithms are useful in analyzing these large datasets but often fall short to provide completely satisfactory results. Integrating clustering and visualization not only yields better clustering results but also leads to a higher degree of confidence in the findings. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a neural network model which is used to obtain a topology-preserving mapping from the (usually high dimensional) input/feature space to an output/map space of fewer dimensions (usually two or three in order to facilitate visualization). Neurons in the output space are connected with each other but this structure remains fixed throughout training and learning is achieved through the updating of neuron reference vectors in feature space. Despite the fact that growing variants of SOM overcome the fixed structure limitation, they increase computational cost and also do not allow the removal of a neuron after its introduction. In this paper, a variant of SOM is presented called AMSOM (Adaptive Moving Self- Organizing Map) that on the one hand creates a more flexible structure where neuron positions are dynamically altered during training and on the other hand tackles the drawback of having a predefined grid by allowing neuron addition and/or removal during training. Experimental evaluation on different literature datasets with diverse characteristics improves SOM training performance, leads to a better visualization of the input dataset, and provides a framework for determining the optimal number and structure of neurons as well as the optimal number of clusters. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Clustering; Self-Organizing Maps; Unsupervised learning; Visualization","Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Conformal mapping; Flexible structures; Flow visualization; Neural networks; Neurons; Structural optimization; Topology; Unsupervised learning; Vector spaces; Visualization; Business applications; Clustering; Computational costs; Computing technology; Degree of confidence; Experimental evaluation; Neural network model; Topology-preserving mappings; Self organizing maps",2-s2.0-85012960756

My-AHA proposes a holistic view of age-related frailty, comprising frailty across interrelated domains of: cognition, physical function, mood, social isolation and sleep. Age-related frailty represents a major burden to older adults and social and health care systems. Early detection and intervention are crucial in sustaining active and healthy ageing (AHA) and slowing or reversing further decline. The main aim of My-AHA is to reduce frailty risk in older adults at risk of becoming frail by improving physical activity and cognitive function, psychological state, social resources, nutrition, sleep and overall well-being. It will empower older citizens to better manage their own health, resulting in healthcare cost savings. My-AHA will use state-of-the-art analytical concepts to provide new ways of health monitoring and disease prevention through individualized profiling and personalized recommendations, feedback and support. An ICT-based platform will detect defined risks in the frailty domains early and accurately via nonstigmatising embedded sensors and data readily available in the daily living environment of older adults. When risk is detected, My-AHA will provide individually tailored ICT-based interventions with a scientific evidence base of efficacy, including vetted interventions from established providers of medical and AHA support. These interventions will be deployed in a manner designed to motivate users to participate in exercise, cognitively stimulating games and social networking to achieve long-term behavioural change, sustained by continued end user engagement with My-AHA. By this, different platforms (Smart Companion, iStoppFalls, etc.) will be connected by the My-AHA Middleware and combine information and data from different sources with a decision support system for choosing the personal interventions. The My-AHA platform will be tested in a multicentre randomized controlled trial involving centres across Europe, Japan, South Korea and Australia. The project is currently in Alpha phase testing. Following alpha wave testing, the RCT will commence including feasibility and manageability testing of the pre-post design. During the first project year, interventions were defined and analysed for their proven effectiveness and their chance for combination. Selection of the platforms has been completed with middleware development approaching completion. The prototype setup has been deployed with the first participants in the Alpha Wave. During this time, experience on the new data protection regulation for EU countries was gained as well as for business opportunities for the developed interventions and results of the trial. This paper provides a short overview of the projects approach and current status.","Frailty prevention; Mixed methods; Social frailty; System integration","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Health care; Human computer interaction; Information management; Middleware; Business opportunities; End-user engagements; Frailty prevention; Mixed method; Personalized recommendation; Randomized controlled trial; Social frailty; System integration; Patient treatment",2-s2.0-85029761307

Natural resources, such as energy and water, enable economy growth and support quality of life. The Water-Energy Nexus is considered as one of the most important multidisciplinary challenges [2] that the global growing water market [3] has to face in the forthcoming years. Currently, many water systems are not managed sustainably enough. Water Utilities face other challenges, such as infrastructure aging and poor cost-recovery, leading to a lack of finance for O&M (Operation and Maintenance). Energy is required in all stages of water production and distribution, from pumping and treatment to transportation. Energy costs are a top-of-mind concern for water utilities, regardless of geography, size and level of water network efficiency [4]. On the other hand, Water Utilities are having a hard time to either improve their services or expand their network to unserved neighborhoods in developing countries. The current trend of water transmission system to the creation of DMAs (District Metered Areas) offers great possibilities of non-structural solutions that use existing data and transform them into useful information to support decision making. The Smart Metering and the use of large amounts of data from a network enhance the use of software for decision support, but it is not the only way. Smart Solutions can also be applied to networks with less recorded data, which would enhance operators' knowledge to these data, turn them into useful information for decision-making either for the operation or the maintenance and network design. In this scope, a Smart Solution is presented. It is developed combining key factors of the energy consumption and the water supply into water networks management to obtain improvements from both water and energy fields. This non-structural solution increases resource efficiency and environmental performance of water distribution networks by using data acquisition and geographical visualization (real time & historical), weather and water demand forecasting, detection of networks events and hydraulic simulation of the network, and finally through a decision support system based on machine learning (pattern recognition and business rules techniques). As a conclusion, a non-structural solution for the Nexus issues can have a great impact on several matters (climate change, carbon footprint, WUs balance sheets, and water losses) with reasonable investment either in smart metering or networks with only a few sensors measuring. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial Intelligence; Business Rules; Energy Management in water Distribution Systems; Machine Learning; Nexus; Pattern Recognition; smart water networks; urban water distribution network management; water energy; Water Utilities","Artificial intelligence; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Decision making; Decision support systems; Depreciation; Developing countries; Economics; Electric measuring instruments; Electric power distribution; Energy management; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Hydraulic machinery; Investments; Learning systems; Network management; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Water resources; Water supply; Water supply systems; Complex networks; Education; Systems analysis; Business rules; Nexus; Urban water distribution networks; Water energy; Water networks; Water utility; Water distribution systems",2-s2.0-85020819561

As the attractiveness of different leadership styles varies in line with staff member cultural preferences, the challenge leaders face is that their behaviours may no longer be apposite. To this end, it is mostly unknown whether those leaders who are deemed culturally intelligent behave in a specific manner, that is, display the empowering and directive leadership styles. Research purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between leader cultural intelligence and the empowering and directive styles of leadership, as perceived by subordinates. Motivation for the study: To operate successfully, leaders need to adopt and display those leadership styles that best match the cultural expectations of their staff members. Cultural intelligence may assist in this respect. Most of the studies on leader cultural intelligence and leadership styles have concentrated on the transformational leadership style. There is, thus, a requirement to examine how leader cultural intelligence relates to other leadership styles. Research design, approach and method: The study was quantitative in nature and made use of a cross-sectional survey design. Data were collected from 1140 staff members spread across 19 diverse organisations carrying on business activities in South Africa. Correlation and regression techniques were performed to identify relationships. Main findings: Leader cultural intelligence was found to have a stronger relationship with empowering leadership than it had with directive leadership. With empowering leadership, leader metacognitive and motivational cultural intelligence acted as important antecedents, whilst for directive leadership, leader’s motivational, cognitive and metacognitive cultural intelligence played a predictive part that carried a medium effect. Practical/managerial implications: The findings can be used by organisations to guide the selection of leaders and to focus initiatives for their development. Contribution and value-add: The study adds to the cultural intelligence and leadership literature by offering empirical evidence of the relationship between leader cultural intelligence and the empowering and directive leadership styles. © 2017.

Additional fat is required when the fat level in the feed ingredients is less than the desired level. This fat can be added either during the mixing process or after the pelleting process. However, adding fat at different time leads to different results. The addition of an increasing amount of fat during the mixing process decreases the pellet durability but enhances the pellet production rate. To avoid a reduction in the pellet durability, limiting the inclusion of fats in the mixer is suggested. The use of suitable fat addition ratios during mixing and after pelleting can improve the pellet quality and the production capability. Many factors significantly affect the decision of how much fat to add, such as the fiber inclusion content in the feed formulation, pellet die size, required feed durability, total required fat, and required additional fat. Due to frequent changes in the feed mix, anticipating the suitable amount of fat addition during the mixing process becomes a cumbersome task for a mill. In this paper, a model for estimating the amount of fat required in the mixer for each feed formulation is proposed. The model is based on the local linear map (LLM) and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) methods. The LLM is used to identify which feed formulations require the addition of fat both during mixing and after pelleting, whereas the BPNN is employed for estimating the proper total fat required in the mixer, and the ratio of fat to add during the mixing process is subsequently estimated by subtracting the fat in the raw material from the total fat required in the mixer. The model is developed using data from one the largest feed mills in Thailand. The proposed model provides an accurate prediction and is practical for implementation in the mill that was studied. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial neural network; Feed industry; Feed pellet; Local linear map","Animals; Backpropagation; Durability; Mixers (machinery); Mixing; Neural networks; Accurate prediction; Animal feed industry; Back-propagation neural networks; Feed industries; Local linear; Pellet production; Pelleting process; Production capabilities; Pelletizing",2-s2.0-84907612073

When an IVR system generates a response, it usually refers to just verbal information of the user’s utterance. However, when a person gloomily says “I’m fine,” people will respond not by saying “That’s wonderful” but “Really?” or “Are you OK?” because we can consider both verbal and non-verbal information such as tone of voice, facial expressions, gestures, and so on. In this article, we propose an intelligent IVR system that considers not only verbal but also non-verbal information. To estimate a speaker’s emotion (positive, negative, or neutral), 384 acoustic features extracted from the speaker’s utterance are utilized to machine learning (SVM). Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML)-based response generating rules are expanded to be able to consider the speaker’s emotion. As a result of the experiment, subjects felt that the proposed dialog system was more likable, enjoyable, and did not give machine-like reactions. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Acoustic features; Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML); Emotion; Interactive Voice Response System (IVR); Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Markup languages; Speech processing; Acoustic features; Artificial intelligence mark up languages; Emotion; Facial Expressions; Interactive voice response; Interactive Voice Response System (IVR); Non-verbal information; Verbal information; Support vector machines",2-s2.0-85009469645

Many developing nations are trying to take advantage of crowdsourcing for information notification to make cost effective system, like real-time transit system, disaster notification system and other services which are available to the masses. However, many of them are still not able to completely benefit from it compared to developed nations. In this paper, we have identified a series of limitations of using crowdsourcing for information gathering and providing real-time notification in developing countries due to their unstable electronic communication infrastructure, their lack of contribution, lack of crowdsource (participating people), less exposure to English language, and unawareness of crowdsourcing. We proposed, and demonstrated, a solution to overcome these limitations by developing a prototype which uses SMS as a reliable method for providing real-time notification and information gathering. Our prototype uses prediction algorithms to fill the gaps in real-time notification.

Managing end-to-end service quality is becoming an increasing challenge. One of the key issues lies in the exchange of quality-related data between service participants in order to analyze not only SLA compliance but also root causes of failure. Formal SLA specification and management approaches today do not facilitate the specification of metric data in conjunction with a convenient way to supply this data to business analytics tools for detailed analysis. In this industry paper, we propose an extension of the rSLA DSL defining data items to be monitored and a specification-driven generator producing relational, denormalized time series tables accordingly. The resulting time series can be ingested by commonly used Business Intelligence tools such as Watson Analytics or Tableau in a straightforward and efficient manner.

BA can be divided into four parts: parameter tuning, initialization, local search, and global search. Since its invention, several studies have sought to enhance the performance of BA by improving some of its parts. Thus, more than one version of the algorithm has been proposed. However, upon searching for the basic version of BA in the literature, unclear and contradictory information can be found. By reviewing the literature and conducting some experiments on a set of standard benchmark functions, three main implementations of the algorithm that researchers should be aware of while working on improving the BA are uncovered. These implementations are Basic BA, Shrinking-based BA and Standard BA. Shrinking-based BA employs a shrinking procedure, and Standard BA uses a site abandonment approach in addition to the shrinking procedure. Thus, various implementations of the shrinking and site-abandonment procedures are explored and incorporated into BA to constitute different BA implementations. This paper proposes a framework of the main implementations of BA, including Basic BA and Standard BA, to give a clear picture of these implementations and the relationships among them. Additionally, the experiments show no significant differences among most of the shrinking implementations. Furthermore, this paper reviews the improvements to BA, which are improvements in the parameter tuning, population initialization, local search and global search. It is hoped that this paper will provide researchers who are working on improving the BA with valuable references and guidance. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Basic Bees Algorithm; Metaheuristic algorithm; Neighborhood shrinking; Shrinking-based Bees Algorithm; Site abandonment; Standard Bees Algorithm","Artificial intelligence; Local search (optimization); Shrinkage; Bees algorithms; Benchmark functions; Global search; Meta heuristic algorithm; Parameter-tuning; Population initializations; Site abandonment; Swarm Intelligence; Algorithms",2-s2.0-84961997662

Despite the increasing risk of those illegal activities, many ports are not equipped to deal with unforeseen security breaches. Although the use of X-ray scanning technology for cargo inspection has been on the rise due to its effectiveness in detecting potential security breaches, it alone cannot protect the port and its surrounding areas from illegal activities. To maximise the full benefit of X-ray based cargo inspection through enhanced maritime logistics visibility, we propose supply chain analytics which can not only add business intelligence to the cargo inspection process, but also guide the port authority to make informed decisions regarding security protocols. This decision-aid tool is designed to improve port security and productivity by systematically gathering, storing, analysing, and updating big data related to cargo movement, port infrastructure, and ocean-going vessel traffic. This paper is one of the first to embed supply chain analytics within the maritime security system and gauge its usefulness for enhancing maritime security in global supply chain operations. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Big data; Business analytics; Global supply chains; Maritime security",,2-s2.0-85029212073

The problem is to find the shortest route to gain commodities from the pickup nodes and supply them to the delivery nodes. The amount of commodities of pickup nodes and delivery nodes is usually assumed to be in equilibrium; thus, all pickup nodes have to be visited for collecting all commodities required. However, some real-world applications, such as rental bikes and wholesaling business, need only to gain sufficient commodities from certain pickup nodes. A variant of PDP, namely the selective pickup and delivery problem (SPDP), is formulated to address the above scenarios. The major difference of SPDP from PDP lies in the requirement of visiting all pickup nodes. The SPDP relaxes this requirement to achieve more efficient transportation. The goal of the SPDP is to seek the shortest path that satisfies the load constraint to supply the commodities demanded by all delivery nodes with some pickup nodes. This study proposes a max-min ant system (MMAS) to solve the SPDP. The ants aim to construct the shortest route for the SPDP considering the number of selected pickup nodes and all delivery nodes. This study conducts experiments to examine the performance of the proposed MMAS, in comparison with genetic algorithm and memetic algorithm. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MMAS in route length and convergence speed for the SPDP. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Swarm intelligence; Convergence speed; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Load constraints; MAX MIN Ant systems; Memetic algorithms; Pickup and delivery problems; Real-world problem; Transportation problem; Pickups",2-s2.0-85026786864

This results in new business models and value chains, but also various risks, e.g. by hacker attacks, data theft or manipulation. Many companies consider Industrie 4.0 much as a security challenge other than an opportunity or enabler for new business models. Therefore, effective security methods to protect the Industrie 4.0 systems and its associated values and assets are needed. One of the aims of Industrie 4.0 is identifying and developing new, appropriate security practices for enterprises and especially for their production systems. Based on the connectivity infrastructure in the shop floor, the diversity in the corporate landscape of the global mechanical and plant engineering ultimately causes that every company has to develop its own way of IT and production security management. In the context of Industrie 4.0, an integral concept is needed, that connects the requirements from manufacturing automation and mechanical engineering to process engineering with the properties of cyber-physical systems as an Industrie 4.0 component and well-established core elements of IT security descriptions. Standards from industry associations and standardization committees have to be included. In this paper, a process model is developed, which consults RAMI 4.0 and well-established core elements of safety and IT security considering the standards IEC 61508 and IEC 62443. A use case driven approach is developed with the goal to demonstrate the functionalities and validation of the process model. In different iterations, the dynamic change of the system by mapping IT security requirements on system assets and processes will be presented.

It serves as an effective way to gain vital information of the target company and acquire business intelligence. Traditional approaches for company profiling rely heavily on the availability of rich finance information about the company, such as finance reports and SEC filings, which may not be readily available for many private companies. However, the rapid prevalence of online employment services enables a new paradigm-to obtain the variety of company's information from their employees' online ratings and comments. This, in turn, raises the challenge to develop company profiles from an employee's perspective. To this end, in this paper, we propose a method named Company Profiling based Collaborative Topic Regression (CPCTR), for learning the latent structural patterns of companies. By formulating a joint optimization framework, CPCTR has the ability in collaboratively modeling both textual (e.g., reviews) and numerical information (e.g., salaries and ratings). Indeed, with the identified patterns, including the positive/negative opinions and the latent variable that influences salary, we can effectively carry out opinion analysis and salary prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted on a real-world data set to validate the effectiveness of CPCTR. The results show that our method provides a comprehensive understanding of company characteristics and delivers a more effective prediction of salaries than other baselines. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The assumption of a fixed distribution in the data renders conventional static DSSs inaccurate and unable to make correct decisions when concept drift occurs. However, it is important to know when, how, and where concept drift occurs so a DSS can adjust its decision processing knowledge to adapt to an ever-changing environment at the appropriate time. This paper presents a data distribution-based concept drift detection method called fuzzy competence model drift detection (FCM-DD). By introducing fuzzy sets theory and replacing crisp boundaries with fuzzy ones, we have improved the competence model to provide a better, more refined empirical distribution of the data stream. FCM-DD requires no prior knowledge of the underlying distribution and provides statistical guarantee of the reliability of the detected drift, based on the theory of bootstrapping. A series of experiments show that our proposed FCM-DD method can detect drift more accurately, has good sensitivity, and is robust. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Competence model; Concept drift; Data-driven decision making; Fuzzy sets theory","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision theory; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Reliability theory; Competence models; Concept drifts; Data driven decision; Data-driven decision support systems; Empirical distributions; Fuzzy sets theory; Statistical guarantee; Underlying distribution; Decision support systems",2-s2.0-85028589984

As the number of human workers shrinks and that of robots increases, how will this change the dynamics of the workplace and human worker motivation? Design/methodology/approach: The approach of this paper is to examine recent academic, business and media writings on the subject of artificial intelligence and robotics in the workplace to identify gaps in our understanding of the new hybrid work environment. Findings: What the author has found is that although there are numerous voices expressing concerns about the replacement of human workers by robots, there has not as yet been a substantive study of the impact on human workers of sharing their work life with robots in this environment. Research limitations/implications: The findings in this paper are limited by the fact that they are drawn from a review of the secondary literature rather than from primary research and are therefore speculative and anecdotal. Practical implications: The practical implications of the findings are to suggest that it is time to establish a systematic and standardized method for analyzing and measuring the impact on human workers of operating in an environment increasingly populated by automated co-workers. Social implications: The author suspects that the social implications will be to suggest that as a human society we will need to establish psychologically and culturally valid means for coping with this new work environment, and the author believes some of the findings may well prove counter intuitive within the social context of work.

The recently introduced Internet Plus strategy is an attempt by Chinese policymakers to boost the Chinese economy by diminishing its reliance on manufacturing and export in favor of a knowledge-based economy driven by services and the tech sector. The IoT is arguably one of the key drivers behind this transformation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducts an analysis of existing literature on the IoT and uses two complimentary theories, resource-based view and dynamic capabilities theory, to determine a set of policy recommendations. Findings: A cooperative relationship between policymakers, start-up firms and academia is essential to the success of the IoT. The artificial intelligence industry also plays a key role in the development of the IoT and requires strategic funding and favorable policy. Finally, established and cost-effective standards and practices are much more likely to be effective than new and costly alternatives. Originality/value: This paper examines the newly established field of the IoT and sets out a number of policy recommendations needed for its success. To achieve this, the author uses two complimentary theories unique to the business management field but increasingly compatible with the Chinese public policy sector. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; China; Economy; Internet of things; Internet plus; IoT",,2-s2.0-85032488945

Especially the branch of mask manufacturing presents a challenge to the concepts of machine learning since the business process intrinsically induces pronounced product variability on the background of small plate numbers. In this paper we present the architectural set up of a machine learning algorithm which successfully deals with the demands and pitfalls of mask manufacturing. A detailed motivation of this basic set up followed by an analysis of its statistical properties is given. The machine learning set up for mask manufacturing involves two learning steps: an initial step which identifies and classifies the basic global CD patterns of a process. These results form the basis for the extraction of an optimized training set via balanced sampling. A second learning step uses this training set to obtain the local as well as global CD relationships induced by the manufacturing process. Using two production motivated examples we show how this approach is flexible and powerful enough to deal with the exacting demands of mask manufacturing. In one example we show how dedicated covariates can be used in conjunction with increased spatial resolution of the CD map model in order to deal with pathological CD effects at the mask boundary. The other example shows how the model set up enables strategies for dealing tool specific CD signature differences. In this case the balanced sampling enables a process control scheme which allows usage of the full tool park within the specified tight tolerance budget. Overall, this paper shows that the current rapid developments off the machine learning algorithms can be successfully used within the context of semiconductor manufacturing. © 2017 SPIE.","Advanced Mask Technology Center (AMTC); advanced process control; CD uniformity (CDU); critical dimensions (CD); machine learning; recursive partitioning; run to run control","Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Intelligent control; Learning systems; Lithography; Manufacture; Process control; Regression analysis; Semiconductor device manufacture; Advanced mask technology centers; Advanced Process Control; CD Uniformity; Critical dimension; Recursive Partitioning; Run-to-run control; Learning algorithms",2-s2.0-85031662241

Owning the right and high quality set of information is a crucial factor for developing business activities and gaining competitive advantages on business arenas. However, today retrieving information is not enough anymore. The possibility to simulate hypothetical scenarios without harming the business using What-If analysis tools and to retrieve highly refined information is an interesting way for achieving such business advantages. In a previous work, we introduced a hybridization model that combines What-If analysis and OLAP usage preferences, which helps filter the information and meet the users’ needs and business requirements without losing data quality. The main advantage is to provide the user with a way to overcome the difficulties that arise when dealing with the conventional What-If analysis scenario process. In this paper, we show an application of this methodology using a sample database, and compare the results of a conventional What-if process and our methodology.

In this article, I test the hypothesis whether configurational (syntactic) properties of an urban street network are relevant for the location of land use. If syntactic features are relevant, then land use types may have a 'syntactic signature'. To identify this blueprint, I apply machine-learning techniques to datasets of syntactic measures, for ten business types. The results are ten models, each with the syntactic blueprint of a type of business. The models are used to predict the existence, or not, of such businesses in segments of the map of London. The performance of the models varies, with fifty per cent reaching statistical significance, including one with 'good' prediction ability. The models for Starbucks coffee shops and solicitor's offices have the strongest prediction ability. The exploratory exercise demonstrates the potential of the machine-learning method Random Forests, when supervised and individually applied to a business activity, to identify the syntactic signature of business types. Such models can be used during planning and design and on location studies. The results strengthen the candidacy of syntactic measurements to location-decision-making. Moreover, they reinforce the theory of Natural Movement.","Land use; Machine-learning; Random forest; Space syntax; Spatial configuration; Urban planning.","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Land use; Learning systems; Location; Urban planning; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Random forests; Space syntax; Space syntax theory; Spatial configuration; Statistical significance; Syntactics",2-s2.0-85031101045

It is now vigorously recognised that traditional approaches to cyber defence have become deficient [Heckman et al, 2012]. The respected solutions that we loyally hanged on to throughout the decades, trusting them to defend our environments are no longer sufficient. Unyielding breaches and cyber-attacks are relentlessly intensifying and becoming the order of the day [PWC, 2015]. Farchi [2016] argues that ""Staying vulnerable while waiting for a security patch from your software vendor is an anachronistic method that won't survive this new world"". This notion corresponds with Bodmer [2012] who stresses that ""Just as intelligence organisations are tracking the activities of terrorist cells trying to stop them before they take action, going after the malicious attackers before they are able to commit attacks is the desired approach"". This article flows from, and builds on previous discussions and publications with regard to the concept of a maturity model for cyber counterintelligence (CCI). It aims to also resonate with and add to previous publications and maturing debates through the proposition of cultivating and implementing such model. It explores the notion of a CCI maturity model and argues that cybersecurity can be intensified-and will be more effective when incorporating a dedicated focus on defensive, offensive, passive and active measures in a multi-disciplinary and integrated CCI approach. The article provides a brief look at the benefits that the implementation of such a model hold for both government and the private sector. It deliberates on the need for cyber counterintelligence (CCI) practices in conjunction with traditional defensive and/or offensive cyber measures within both government and the private sector (business). It also discusses the ideal for the establishment of such a maturity model that can be customised, in a similar way, for organisations (public and private sector), and crowns in discussions on implementation and control.","Cyber counterintelligence; Cyber counterintelligence levels; Cyber counterintelligence maturity; Cyber threat intelligence; Defensive and offensive cybersecurity","Computers; Network security; Terrorism; Cyber counterintelligence; Cyber counterintelligence levels; Cyber counterintelligence maturity; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Computer crime",2-s2.0-85027972405

There are many techniques currently available to encrypt and secure our communication channels. Data hiding techniques can take data confidentiality to a new level as we can hide our secret messages in ordinary, honest-looking data files. Steganography is the science of hiding data. It has several categorizations, and each type has its own techniques in hiding. Steganography has played a vital role in secret communication during wars since the dawn of history. In recent days, few computer users successfully manage to exploit their Windows® machine to conceal their private data. Businesses also have deep concerns about misusing data hiding techniques. Many employers are amazed at how easily their valuable information can get out of their company walls. In many legal cases a disgruntled employee would successfully steal company private data despite all security measures implemented using simple digital hiding techniques. Human right activists who live in countries controlled by oppressive regimes need ways to smuggle their online communications without attracting surveillance monitoring systems, continuously scan in/out internet traffic for interesting keywords and other artifacts. The same applies to journalists and whistleblowers all over the world. Computer forensic investigators, law enforcements officers, intelligence services and IT security professionals need a guide to tell them where criminals can conceal their data in Windows® OS & multimedia files and how they can discover concealed data quickly and retrieve it in a forensic way. Data Hiding Techniques in Windows OS is a response to all these concerns. Data hiding topics are usually approached in most books using an academic method, with long math equations about how each hiding technique algorithm works behind the scene, and are usually targeted at people who work in the academic arenas. This book teaches professionals and end users alike how they can hide their data and discover the hidden ones using a variety of ways under the most commonly used operating system on earth, Windows®. This is your hands-on guide to understand, detect and use today's most popular techniques in hiding and exploring hidden data under Windows® machines, covering all Windows® versions from XP till Windows® 10. Starting with the Roman Emperor, Julius Caesar, and his simple cipher method to the surveillance programs deployed by NSA, to monitor communication and online traffic, this book will teach you everything you need to know to protect your digital data using steganographic & anonymity cryptographic techniques. Written in a simple style and requiring only basic knowledge of main Windows® functions, techniques are presented in a way to easily implement them directly on your computer.

In this paper, we examine the optimal fit between the uncertainty levels of foreign firms in China and their information processing activities. We draw on data from 128 foreign firms' strategic business units (SBUs) in China and unveil that the examined SBUs face substantially different business environments with respect to dynamics and associated information processing requirements. We develop distinct ideal profiles for information processing capacities and assess whether an alignment with the ideal profile results in improved performance. Our study results show that the degree of alignment (i.e. fit) between an SBU's business environment and its ideal information processing profile is positively associated with strategic quality and company performance, empirically confirming OIPT's central tenet of ‘fitting’ organizational information processing capacities with requirements. We stipulate managers to emphasize the ideal information processing profile according to the level of information processing requirement they face. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Emerging markets; Industry intelligence; Institutional view; Organizational information processing; Strategy tripod",,2-s2.0-84994753597

Consequently, many companies could not cope with the customers’ debt and ended up closing the business. In order to overcome this issue, this paper presents a novel decision support system for default prediction specially tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises that retrieves the information related to the customers in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and obtain the default risk probability of a new order or client.

We propose a new approach to sort and map relational data and present predictive models – based on network metrics – to assess risk profiles of clients involved in the factoring business. We find that risk profiles can be predicted by using social network metrics. In our dataset, the most dangerous social actors deal with bigger or more frequent financial operations; they are more peripheral in the transactions network; they mediate transactions across different economic sectors and operate in riskier countries or Italian regions.

A performance comparison between the above mentioned techniques is investigated and the analysis shows superiority of two-loop PID controller in terms of both overshoot and settling time as compared to other mentioned methods. A comprehensive analysis of robustness to model uncertainties will be incorporated in the future work. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Genetic algorithm; Inverted cart-pendulum; LQR and LQG; Two-loop PID","Artificial intelligence; Controllers; Electric control equipment; Genetic algorithms; Linearization; Pendulums; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Uncertainty analysis; Closed loop response; Comprehensive analysis; Controller parameter; LQR and LQG; Modified genetic algorithms; Performance comparison; Proportional integral derivative controllers; Two-loop PID; Proportional control systems",2-s2.0-84996629623

In this paper, we present a novel DCT-based technique for detecting copy-move forgery. DCT is applied to each fixed-size overlapping block of image to represent its features. The dimension of the features is reduced using truncation. Then the feature vectors are lexicographically sorted and, duplicated image blocks will be neighboring in the sorted list. Thus duplicated image blocks will be compared in the matching step. To make the method more robust, a scheme to judge whether two feature vectors are similar is imported. Simulation results show that the proposed technique is capable of detecting the duplicated regions even when an image was distorted by JPEG compression, blurring or additive white Gaussian noise. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Copy-move forgery; DCT; Dimension reduction; Tampered region detection","Artificial intelligence; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; Computer technology; Copy-move forgeries; Digital image; Dimension reduction; Feature vectors; JPEG compression; Region detection; Image compression",2-s2.0-84996939055

Two types of linguistic cues were investigated: word order and morphosyntactic cues. The results show that children with autism can use both types of cues in sentence comprehension. However, compared to age-matched typically developing peers, children with autism relied significantly more on word order cues and exhibited significantly more difficulties in interpreting sentences in which there was a conflict between the morphosyntactic cue and the word order cue. We attribute the difficulties exhibited by children with autism to their deficits in executive function.

Participants included 108 children with ASD, ages 4–7, and their primary caregivers. ASD symptoms and cognitive/language abilities were assessed upon study entry. Parents reported on children’s emotion regulation, social skills and behavior problems at two time points, 10 months apart. Emotion dysregulation was stable and related strongly to social and behavioral functioning but was largely independent of IQ. Further analyses suggested that emotion dysregulation predicts increases in social and behavioral difficulties across time. Implications for intervention are discussed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Emotion regulation; Emotional development; Self-regulation; Social development","Article; autism; child; emotion; emotionality; female; human; intelligence quotient; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; predictive value; priority journal; problem behavior; social adaptation; social evolution; autism; behavior disorder; emotion; language development; parent; preschool child; psychology; questionnaire; social competence; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Child Behavior Disorders; Child Language; Child, Preschool; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Social Skills; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84994779372

The vertical layout has the advantage of scanning only a limited number of records for calculating the support of an item.

Recent studies show that the complex competition interactions among products directly influence products' future development. However, most existing approaches fail to model the evolutionary competition among products and lack the capability to organically reflect multi-level competition analysis in sales forecasting. To address these problems, we propose the Evolutionary Hierarchical Competition Model (EHCM), which effectively considers the time-evolving multi-level competition among products. The EHCM model systematically integrates hierarchical competition analysis with multi-scale time series forecasting. Extensive experiments using a real-world app download dataset show that EHCM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various forecasting granularities.",,"Artificial intelligence; Sales; Time series analysis; Competition analysis; Competition model; Multilevels; Product sales; Real-world; Sales forecasting; State-of-the-art methods; Time series forecasting; Forecasting",2-s2.0-85031894679

A weighted sum approach is then used to combine these objective functions to form a single multi-objective optimization problem. An ant colony optimization algorithm is employed to find the Pareto-optimal solution to this problem.

Many existing matchmaking protocols are based on user’s private and specific data. Malicious participants may opt their attribute set arbitrarily so as to discover more information about the attributes of an honest participant. Hence, there is great chance of information leakage to a dishonest participant. In this context, Sarpong et al. had proposed a first of its kind of an authenticated hybrid matchmaking protocol that will help match-pair initiators to find an appropriate pair which satisfies the predefined threshold number of common attributes. Sarpong et al. had claimed that their protocol restricts attribute leakage to unintended participants and proved to be secure.

The goal is to hedge against business uncertainties, so as to maximize the robustness of operations, maximize responsiveness by generating operational flexibility at the minimum cost, use of inventories and environmental impact, and to build resilience in global manufacturing, in order to achieve strategic flexibility. The Triple R is achieved by integrating major operational items, including planning, scheduling, real-time optimization and control. This article reviews existing contributions in the field of global manufacturing, and synthesizes these into a single conceptual model of Triple R. The overview is provided in terms of the development of decision support tools and methods, particularly the development of mathematical programming. The review reveals the fact that there have been limited contributions on the social side of sustainability. Environmental impact can be assessed by considering the product life cycle, yet the integration of R&D into global manufacturing operations has received limited contributions. On the modelling side, there are three dominant approaches: transfer pricing, strategic sourcing strategy, and logistics networks design.

In active learning paradigm, system first returns a small image set. Inference is drawn from this image set based on relevance as per user perception. Hence image retrieval based on context suffers in terms of precision and recall, as retraining and interactive time response is involved.

The new algorithm introduced here, automatically searches such relationship between various devices of the virtualized environment. Due to its dynamic nature of the virtualized environment, we have to take a measurement at multiple points of time, any relationship which holds good across these time intervals are considered as dependent variables.

The goal in this work is to design suspension parameters, in such a way that the passengers comfort is not decorated by forces induced by the road bump(s) or irregular rough surface. Here, the half car linear passive suspension model with passengers has been considered. Initially, model simulation over different roads is done. Later, by varying the mass of the passengers within a given range the variation and range of the vibration levels of the dynamical system have been analyzed. Then, the vibration level of the system is minimized using genetic algorithm and the suspension parameters are found out. This is done by keeping the masses of the passengers constant. With those parameters, again the vibration analysis is done with changing passenger’s masses in a suitable interval. The tabulated results and graphical representations show that the suspension parameters found can serve as an efficient value to enhance comfort. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Genetic algorithm and optimization; Road bump; Suspension parameters; Vibration","Artificial intelligence; Automobile suspensions; Dynamical systems; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Roads and streets; Suspensions (components); Transportation; Vehicle suspensions; Vibrations (mechanical); Graphical representations; Heuristic approach; Passengers comfort; Passive suspension; Road bumps; Suspension parameters; Vehicle vibrations; Vibration; Vibration analysis",2-s2.0-84996671417

The common objective considered in WDSs design is providing required water with the minimum construction cost. Less attention is paid to “water quality” as an objective in optimal design of WDSs. The aim of this paper is to include a water quality based objective in WDS design alongside other common objectives. For this purpose, the water quality reliability index developed based on “chlorine residual” and “water age”, is used. EPANET2.0 is applied for WDS simulation and ACO (Ant-Colony-Optimization) has been used as the optimization algorithm. Head-Driven-Simulation-Method (HDSM) is also considered.

However, a user has to remember the cryptographic key or maintain it in the database in secure manner by his own risk. Once the stored key is compromised, then an attacker can access the user’s data easily. This motivates us to develop a new security mechanism to protect the user’s persona data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate a biometric-based cryptography key generation using fingerprint data of a user. With respect to the security aspects, our approach is secure and more flexible for the key generation. This key can be used to encrypt the user’s personal data. The fingerprints features (Reference Points) have been generated by directional area (directional component) and probability distribution.

CPU scheduling should control the waiting time, response time, turnaround time, and number of context switches. One of the most extensively used scheduling algorithms is shortest next remaining time first (SRTF), which gives the reduced amount of average waiting time. But this algorithm suffers from some drawbacks. One such is that, every upcoming process if selected for execution, causes a context switch even though it is slightly shorter than the currently running process. As the number of such situations increases, the number of context switches increases, causing the reduction in performance of the system. In this paper, we modify the traditional SRTF to intelligent SRTF, by changing the decision of the preemption, to decrease the number of context switches. The main idea of our proposed algorithm is to make a context switch only if the next process plus context switch over head is shorter than the currently running process.

Usually a distance metric is learned from a training set, while other valuable information, such as group structure, is not. Samples within a short distance form a group, which may contain several classes; each sample may have partial memberships to multiple groups. The group structure exists in both training and test sets. Additionally, outliers have negative effects on a distance metric. Increasing the number of noisy samples during the learning phase may increase the negative effects of outliers. Use of weights is one way to alleviate this problem when more similar samples are given more weight. This paper introduces a learning technique for weighted-distance metric. This semi-supervised method learns labeled information from training set and identifies groups among the samples from test set to form a metric space. In the experiments, the nearest neighbors algorithm is used as a classifier. The proposed weighted-distance metric improves the classification accuracy by more than 10 %.

Since the cloud is accessible by everyone connected in the network the security risk of cloud data is also high. To improve the cloud storage and make the storage more effective we are implementing the audit function in cloud data to reduce the duplication of data in cloud storage. This audit is done using file id and hash key generated for every file during the time of uploading. Proof of Ownership is used to track the owner of the files uploaded. Clustering of user data is included to monitor user file and improve service to the user for that particular type of file.

However, QoS support in WMN is challenging, because of the limited network capacity and intensive resource requirements. In the recent past, multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC) networking is used as a promising approach to boost network capacity. By assigning non-overlapping channels to radios, MRMC-WMN can reduce interference and, hence, increase the network capacity. The performance of MRMC-WMNs is very much dependent on the working of routing and channel assignment. Routing and channel assignment are tightly coupled and should be jointly optimized. Over the years, different research works have been done to address the issues in a joint channel assignment and routing (JCAR). This paper critically reviews the existing JCAR approaches taking different parameters, such as routing metrics used, interference model, and methodology used.

Mitola in 1999 to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity for wireless communication. A Cognitive Radio Ad hoc Network (CRAHN) is one of the cognitive radio-based architectures in which wireless unlicensed nodes communicate in infrastructureless environment. Each node in CRAHN has the cognitive capability of sensing the surrounding radio environment for accessing the underutilized licensed spectrum in an opportunistic manner. But those unlicensed users (secondary users) should not make any interference to the communication of licensed users (primary users). In CRAHNs, each node operates as an end system and also as a router to forward packets for multi-hop communication. Due to the dynamic topology, time and space-varying spectrum availability and lack of centralized system, CRAHNs are vulnerable to various security attacks. Hello flood attack is a network layer attack in CRAHNs which can drain off the limited resources of CRAHN nodes by making excessive flooding of hello messages in the network.

To collect the data from various sensors, and processes them, and to turn on/off, the sprinklers or some other watering system based upon the data is a complex process.

The nature of errors, however, may vary and it is important to intelligently judge the nature of the error to correctly gauge the state of learning of the learner. A better learning experience requires the system to also display benevolence, which is an innately human behavior characteristic, in evaluating the response.

Particularly during data reconciliation and process optimization, the equipment models appear as non-linear constraints which require Jacobians/Hessians of thermodynamic properties. Thermodynamic properties of steam/water are complex functions (Gibbs and Helmholtz functions), and they are repeatedly called during non-linear optimization. The Jacobians/Hessians of these properties are numerically approximated involving further repeated calls to the functions. Legacy approaches involve approximating these functions using higher-order polynomial algorithms or look-up tables. These methods have the limitation of high computational time or need large memory. However, using artificial neural networks (ANNs), these limitations can be overcome, and in this paper, it is demonstrated that ANNs with back-propagation neural networks (BPN) are an effective means to improve the computational performances.

HEVC adopts flexible coding unit (CU) partitioning by applying recursive CU splitting into four sub-CUs, up to four depth levels, which causes a significant complexity increase. Intra-prediction coding in HEVC achieves high coding performance through the exhaustive evaluation of all available CU sizes, with up to 35 prediction modes for each CU, selecting the one with the lower rate distortion cost. This work presents a novel CU size classifier comprising an offline-trained decision tree with three hierarchical nodes. The decision rules computed in each node are based on the content texture properties of CUs as well as the inter-sub-CUs statistics of the same depth level. Our approach can reduce the number of CU sizes to be checked by the Rough Mode Decision and Rate Distortion Optimization stages of intra-prediction coding. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve over 50 % coding time reduction, with no quality penalty in terms of the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, and just a low bit rate increase (2 %) compared to the HEVC reference model.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally used to predict the position using the sensor’s measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the filter performance tails off during periods of GPS failure and may quickly diverge (e.g., in tunnels or due to multipath phenomenon). In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on neural networks (NN) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to circumvent the EKF limitations and improve the accuracy of vehicle position estimation. While GPS signals are available, we train NN and ARIMAmodels to learn the non-linear and linear structures in the vehicle position; therefore they can provide good predictions during GPS signal outages. We obtain empirically an improvement of up to 95% over the simple EKF predictions in case of GPS failures. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Autoregressive integrated moving average; Extended kalman filter; Global positioning system; Intelligent transportation systems; Low cost; Machine learning; Neural networks; Smart cities","Artificial intelligence; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Costs; Extended Kalman filters; Forecasting; Hybrid vehicles; Intelligent systems; Kalman filters; Learning systems; Neural networks; Tracking (position); Transportation; Ubiquitous computing; Vehicles; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Dead reckoning sensors; Hybrid machine learning; Intelligent transportation systems; Low costs; Neural network (nn); Smart cities; Global positioning system",2-s2.0-84996615348

The major preference components modelled by current recommender systems include user and item biases, feature value preferences, conditional dependencies, temporal preference drifts, and social influence on preferences. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid latent factor model that achieves great accuracy by integrating all these preference components in a unified model efficiently. The proposed model employs gradient descent to optimise the model parameters, and an evolutionary algorithm to optimise the hyper-parameters and gradient descent learning rates. Using two popular datasets, we investigate the interaction effects of the preference components with each other. We conclude that depending on the dataset, different interactions exist between the preference components. Therefore, understanding these interaction effects is crucial in designing an accurate preference model in every preference dataset and domain. Our results show that on both datasets, different combinations of components result in different accuracies of recommendation, suggesting that some parts of the model interact strongly. Moreover, these effects are highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the need for exploring these effects before choosing the appropriate combination of components.",,"Artificial intelligence; Optimization; Electronic market; Gradient descent learning rates; Hybrid component; Interaction effect; Latent factor models; Model parameters; Preference modeling; Unified Modeling; Recommender systems",2-s2.0-85020699434

In this perspective, enterprise architecture is characterised by highly uncertain plans in a changing environment, and translates strategic goals into an IT strategy. Typically there are a large number of stakeholders with conflicting views, communicating plans of action, and explaining decisions instead of making them. An enterprise architecture considers qualitative before quantitative data, has stronger business focus than other disciplines, and politics, emotions, and soft skills play a bigger role than in other areas. We view a plan abstractly as a sequence of commitments in time, and each commitment in the plan may come with a number of underlying assumptions. If these underlying assumptions change, then parts of the plan may require revision, which in turn may invalidate other parts of the plan, and so on. Therefore, assumptions have an inherently non-monotonic character: they are assumed to be true, unless it becomes clear they are false.

One way to manage and assure product quality is to use machine learning algorithms based on relationship among various process steps. The purpose of this paper is to integrate manufacturing, inspection and after-sales service data to make full use of machine learning algorithms for estimating the products' quality in a supervised fashion. Proposed frameworks and methods are applied to actual data associated with heavy machinery engines. Design/methodology/approach - By following Lenzerini's formula, manufacturing, inspection and aftersales service data from various sources are integrated. The after-sales service data are used to label each engine as normal or abnormal. In this study, one-class classification algorithms are used due to class imbalance problem. To address multi-dimensionality of time series data, the symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm is used for data segmentation. Then, binary genetic algorithm-based wrapper approach is applied to segmented data to find the optimal feature subset. Findings - By employing machine learning-based anomaly detection models, an anomaly score for each engine is calculated. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect defective engines with a high probability before they are shipped. Originality/value - Through data integration, the actual customer-perceived quality from after-sales service is linked to data from manufacturing and inspection process. In terms of business application, data integration and machine learning-based anomaly detection can help manufacturers establish quality management policies that reflect the actual customer-perceived quality by predicting defective engines.","After-sales service; Anomaly detection; Data integration; Heavy machinery engine; Machine learning; Manufacturing process","Approximation algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Data integration; Engines; Genetic algorithms; Information management; Inspection; Learning systems; Machinery; Manufacture; Quality management; Sales; After-sales services; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection models; Class imbalance problems; Design/methodology/approach; Heavy machinery; Manufacturing process; One-class classification algorithm; Learning algorithms",2-s2.0-85019623490

Despite significant technological advances, current paradigms for developing decision guidance systems lead to a tight-integration of the analytic models, algorithms and underlying tools that comprise these systems, which inhibits both reusability and interoperability. To address these limitations, this paper focuses on the development of the Unity analytics engine, which enables the construction of decision guidance systems from a repository of reusable analytic models that are expressed in JSONiq. Unity extends JSONiq with support for algebraic modeling using a symbolic computation-based technique and compiles reusable analytic models into lower-level, tool-specific representations for analysis. In this paper, we also propose a conceptual architecture for a Decision Guidance Management System, based on Unity, to support the rapid development of decision guidance systems. Finally, we conduct a preliminary experimental study on the overhead introduced by automatically translating reusable analytic models into tool-specific representations for analysis. Initial results indicate that the execution times of optimization models that are automatically generated by Unity from reusable analytic models are within a small constant factor of that of corresponding, manually-crafted optimization models.

A possible remedy is represented by deep learning, which overcomes several shortcomings of traditional methods of text mining. For instance, recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memories, employ hierarchical structures, together with a large number of hidden layers, to automatically extract features from ordered sequences of words and capture highly non-linear relationships such as context-dependent meanings.

In order to improve the prediction, various factors were considered in related literatures, such as US dollar index (USDX), the crude oil price (COP), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the CPI of US (USCPI), the prices of US ten year bond futures (US10BFP), the Hang Seng Index (HIS) and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P500), etc. However, the more factors should be considered, the more difficult data can be gathered. This paper used the random forest method to predict the trend of fluctuations of the gold price. Our predictions are one month ahead. Extensive experiments based on real world data were conducted. Our findings show that (1) the random forest is a powerful method to predict the trends of fluctuations of the gold price and (2) the results also validated that, by using the random forest algorithm, there were only two factors must be considered to ensure the performance of the prediction, which were DJIA and S&P500. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Data mining; Gold price; Influence factors; Machine learning; Prediction","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Crude oil; Data mining; Decision trees; Financial markets; Gold; Learning systems; Management science; Crude oil prices; Dow Jones Industrial averages; Gold prices; Influence factors; Predictive performance; Random forest algorithm; Random forest methods; Us dollar indices; Forecasting",2-s2.0-84984865319

A total of 40 ECG signals, 10 each for normal sinus rhythm, for atrial fibrillation, for supra-ventricular fibrillation and for premature ventricular contraction, were used for experimentation. All ECG signals are of 30 min duration. The R-peak was detected using the Symlet5 wavelet at second level of decomposition. The accuracy of R-peak detection was found to be 97%. Through R-peak detection and through the determination of the RR intervals, we estimated the values of mean and of standard deviation of the 4 parameters. Using the information from RR intervals, we also obtained the Poincaré plots and the power spectral density plots for the 40 signals. Based on the obtained values of the parameters we comment on the nature of values of the parameters in the paper, for normal and abnormal conditions.

This algorithm is the combination of both the region growing and texture-based morphological algorithm of watersheds. An edge-preserving statistical noise reduction method is utilized as a preprocessing phase to calculate a perfect estimate of the image gradient. After that, a preliminary segmentation of the images into primitive regions is generated by employing the region growing. Then, watershed is applied. There are some drawbacks in medical mage study, when watershed is employed after the region growing. The main drawbacks are: over segmentation, sensitivity to noise and incorrect identification of thin or low signal to noise ratio structures. The main issue of over segmentation is controlled by texture local binary pattern (LBP).

Since the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC datasets.

Bokaro Steel Limited have slab caster and during continuous casting, one of the major operational irregularities encountered is breakout. A breakout is a hazard whereby the thin shell of the strand breaks, allowing the still-molten metal inside the strand to leak out from the mould, thus necessitating an expensive machine shutdown. Hence the breakout has a profound influence on the caster availability; affecting the productivity, cost of production, damage of machinery, safety hazards, etc. Breakouts occur due to the presence of a primary crack before solidification of liquid steel. Controlling the primary cracks lead to reduce chances of breakouts. Breakout prediction system of Bokaro Steel Limited uses only thermocouples temperature as an input of logic based algorithm controlled by strand PLC to predict breakout and generate alarm. This system sometimes generates lots of false alarm and sometimes even fails to generate an alarm before breakout. In this paper, two back-propagation neural networks are developed to predict the presence of primary crack that might lead to breakout of liquid steel. One is neural network1 train only with one input parameter (temperatures of thermocouples attached to the mould) and the other is neural network2 train with three input parameters (temperatures of thermocouples, casting speed and mould level). Both the neural network1 and network2 have only one output. Output of neural networks is either 0 for no alarm (no primary crack) or 1 for alarm (presence of primary crack) in breakout conditions. Comparison of the network1 with network2 showed that network2 has less output error, better performance and identifies primary crack more accurately. Performance of neural networks are done using Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm, and also log sigmoid transfer function is used for both the hidden and output layer.

In this context, the presented paper shows the results of a three-year research project by firstly analysing the overall structure and characteristics of a traditional SC in this sector Iannone et al. (2015) in order to identify the most critical aspects and processes. From a risk analysis it emerged that the correct Time Management, intended as the ability of being responsive to market fluctuation, is the most criti- cal target for fashion business. In this context, the presented work proposes a refer- ence framework for the definition and subsequent optimisation of the physical and informative flows, which is based on a deviation analysis of demand and an adjust- ing feedback loop. In last years, the wide spread of e-commerce and mobile pur- chasing is deeply changing the retailing industry leading companied to adopt a new integrated strategy, called Omni-Channel Retailing. The management of both phys- ical and mobile channels not simply means managing an additional on-line demand but requires the actual integration of all the processes of planning and execution in order to optimize performances. With these perspectives, the proposed framework has been revised and extended in order to represent a company implementing this new strategy and, after the definition of a suitable set of Key Performance Indica tors (KPIs), allowed us to evaluate how it may impact on the performances of a traditional SC. The integration of all these analysis and the correct evaluation of the defined set of KPIs may represent a useful system for supporting fashion companies in the strategic decision making process. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Fashion and apparel industry; Key Performance Indicator; Omnichannel retailing; Optimisation; Simulation; Supply chain management","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Commerce; Decision making; Decision support systems; Mobile commerce; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Supply chain management; Sales; Waste disposal; Apparel industry; Key performance indicators; Omnichannel retailing; Optimisations; Simulation; Life cycle",2-s2.0-85013123680

Sensor nodes cooperatively disseminate their data through the network to a base station. In recent years, such networks have shown its wide applicability in various areas. Generally, sensor nodes are small, cost-effective, memory constrained and having limited processing capabilities for sensing data in any particular region from the environment. Energy is one of the significant factors in such network. Whole network lifetime depends on how efficiently consumption of energy takes place. Sensor nodes are combined into groups which is called cluster. The purpose of clustering approach is to make the consumption of energy in more effective way. A cluster head node is used for collecting sensed data from cluster nodes for transmitting to the base station. An efficient election of cluster head minimizes energy consumption, thereby increasing network lifetime. One major drawback in dynamic clustering approach is that in every round, cluster head selection is done locally and decides the cluster region. This process has extra communication cost in massage exchange to select the appropriate cluster head. Transmission of message from one node to another node consumes energy that leads to inefficient use of energy resource. In this paper, a non-probabilistic grid-based approach to prolong the WSNs lifetime using fuzzy logic has been proposed. In this, whole network is divided into predefined grid area and selecting a node as grid head (GH) using two fuzzy variables, viz., base station distance and residual energy of sensor nodes. This approach uses a multi-hop communication approach. GH nodes are authorized to communicate with other GH nodes and base station. Simulation results show that the proposed approach prolongs WSNs network lifetime than existing ones. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.","Fuzzy logic; Grid head; Non-probabilistic; Wireless sensor networks","Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Cost effectiveness; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Fuzzy logic; Sensor nodes; Cluster-head selections; Consumption of energy; Environmental conditions; Grid head; Multi hop communication; Non-probabilistic; Processing capability; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-84996671480

Design/methodology/approach - First, the authors investigate this crisis at three different levels based on network-related indicators: the ""macro"" global level, the ""meso"" country level, and the ""micro"" industry level. This investigation not only provides evidence for the systemic influence, that is, systemic risk, of the crisis, but also reveals the contagion mechanism of the crisis, which supports the stress testing. Second, the authors use a network-related business intelligence algorithm, the combined hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm, to measure the contribution of a given individual industry to the overall risk of the economic system or, in other words, the systemic importance of the individual industry. Findings - The HITS algorithm considers both the market information and the interconnectedness of the industries. Based on the stress testing, the performance of the combined HITS is compared with the purely market-based systemic risk measurement. The results show that the combined HITS outperforms the baseline in finding the top N systemically important industries. Practical implications - The combined HITS algorithm provides a novel network-based perspective of systemic risk measurement. Originality/value - Measuring the systemic importance based on the combined HITS algorithm can help managers and regulators design effective risk management policies. In this respect, the work initiates a research direction of studying the systemic risk in a business system based on a network-related business intelligence algorithm because the business system can be viewed as an interconnected network. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","HITS; Network analysis; Stress testing; Systemic importance; Systemic risk","Commerce; Electric network analysis; Hypertext systems; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Risk assessment; Risk management; Websites; Design/methodology/approach; HITS; Interconnected network; Management policy; Market information; Stress Testing; Systemic importance; Systemic risks; Industrial economics",2-s2.0-85009508857

For that ISO 50.001 demands to formulate a company-wide energy policy, to ensure the determination of the organization and information structures, and is designed for the target of energy efficiency improvement. Overall, the topic addressed by ISO 50.001 is so complex that IT support is required. Actually, more than 120 software systems are offered on the market to support corporate energy management. When checking these systems their very coarse-granular character becomes obvious. A detailed system, regarding single industrial facilities' collection of energy consumption data, is not possible, with a result that exclusively involves a monitoring and reporting function. Planning and controlling is not supported. Thus, existing software systems have elementary deficits concerning Industry 4.0, because they are neither able to receive data (sensor supported) in real time, nor do they have (automated) planning and controlling components based on respective knowledge-based systems, business intelligence and big data procedures.

Further, a modular and self-organizational communication system (as a hard/software combination) has been developed that ""reads"" internal electrical energy data from the production facilities in real time.

This is mainly due to the fact that the impact of parallelism, and more specifically, the impact of concurrent task execution on the running time is not adequately modeled. In this work, we propose a cost modeling solution that aims to accurately reflect the response time of a data flow that is executed in parallel. We focus on the single multi-core machine environment provided by modern business intelligence tools, such as Pentaho Kettle, but our approach can be extended to massively parallel and distributed settings. The distinctive features of our proposal is that we model both time overlaps and the impact of concurrency on task running times in a combined manner; the latter is appropriately quantified and its significance is exemplified. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Data flow analysis; Data mining; Data transfer; Information analysis; Concurrent task executions; Cost modeling; Distributed environments; Execution environments; Massively parallels; Multi-core machines; Parallel environment; State of the art; Big data",2-s2.0-85028452965

In order to achieve high person detection accuracy many authors propose the adoption of a depth sensor mounted in a top-view position in order to mitigate the effects of occlusions and illumination conditions on the performance. Unfortunately, most approaches presented so far in the scientific literature have been tested on very small datasets which do not account for the typical situations arising in real scenarios and consequently do not allow interested readers to figure out which method has to be used in the specific scenario at hand. In this paper we benchmark two different approaches available in the literature for people detection from a zenithal mounted depth camera; the former is an unsupervised method aimed at finding the head of persons defined as the local minimum regions in the depth map, while the latter is based on the combination of the histograms of oriented gradient description and the support vector machine classifier. The benchmarking is performed on a public dataset of images captured in two different lighting conditions and with varying number of persons; this allows to assess the performance of the considered approaches under different real world scenarios.

It computes the performance level by collecting feedback from every student. It gives the appraisal result in the form of 30 points earned to every staff member. It acts as a tool for the management of our college to gauge the performance level of the teacher which in turn helps them in assessing annual increments and other promotions. The main drawback of this system is its inability in grouping of staff members like Group-A, Group-B, Group-C etc. Because, many of the staff members have scored the performance points in the range of 21 to 30 which will creates lot of ambiguities to the management to make clusters of staff members to these groups.

There are a variety of data quality problems such as multi-meaning attributes and inconsistent data schemas in source data, which will not only cause problems for the data integration process but also affect further data mining or data analytics. This paper has summarised typical data quality problems in the data integration and adapted the traditional data quality dimensions to classify those data quality problems. We found that data completeness, timeliness and consistency are critical for data quality management in data integration, and data consistency should be further defined in the pragmatic level. In order to prevent typical data quality problems and proactively manage data quality in ETL, we proposed a set of practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners to conduct data quality management in data integration.

The objective of this paper is to describe requirements, structure and features of SiMON-VC. Requirements demanded were that the information system would enter automatically all critical data from electronic clinical records at each of the visits to the Outpatient Pharmacy Unit, allowing the generation of events and alerts, documenting the pharmaceutical care provided, and allowing the use of data for research purposes. In order to meet these requirements, 5 sections were structured for each patient in SiMON-VC: Main Record, Events, Notes, Monitoring Graphs and Tables, and Follow-up. Each section presents a number of tabs with those coded data needed to monitor patients in the outpatient unit. The system automatically generates alerts for assisted prescription validation, efficacy and safety of using antivirals for the treatment of this disease. It features a completely versatile Indicator Control Panel, where temporary monitoring standards and alerts can be set. It allows the generation of reports, and their export to the electronic clinical record. It also allows data to be exported to the usual operating systems, through Big Data and Business Intelligence.

Design/methodology/approach: Models of the potential range of consciousness development from Western and Eastern psychology are discussed. Research regarding the Transcendental Meditation technique and its effects on mental development, brain functioning and managerial performance is reviewed. Findings: The Transcendental Meditation technique leads to improved performance on multiple measures of intelligence, brain integration and exceptional levels of psychological maturity. Results of this technique in business settings have included growth of leadership behaviors, big-picture awareness, enhanced team problem-solving and high levels of trust. Practical implications: This paper discusses a research-based approach for enhancing learning capabilities – seeing systems, collaborating across boundaries and creating desired futures – through the development of consciousness. Originality/value: Learning in organizational studies has generally been explored in terms of concepts from Western behavioral sciences.

When additional factors are considered, such as the diversity or novelty of the recommendations, the focus typically remains on the algorithm's overall performance. We examine the relationship of the recommender's output characteristics - accuracy, popularity (as an inverse of novelty), and diversity - to characteristics of the user's rating profile. The aims of this analysis are twofold: (1) to probe the conditions under which common algorithms produce more or less diverse or popular recommendations, and (2) to determine if these personalized recommender algorithms reflect a user's preference for diversity or novelty. We trained recommenders on the MovieLens data and looked for correlation between the user profile and the recommender's output for both diversity and popularity bias using different metrics.

It is based on the introduction of Internet of things and servitization concepts into manufacturing companies, leading to vertically and horizontally integrated production systems. The resulting smart factories are able to fulfill dynamic customer demands with high variability in small lot sizes while integrating human ingenuity and automation. To support the manufacturing industry in this conversion process and enhance global competitiveness, policy makers in several countries have established research and technology transfer schemes. Most prominently, Germany has enacted its Industrie 4.0 program, which is increasingly affecting European policy, while the United States focuses on smart manufacturing. Other industrial nations have established their own programs on smart manufacturing, notably Japan and Korea. This shows that manufacturing intelligence has become a crucial topic for researchers and industries worldwide. The main object of these activities are the so-called cyber-physical systems (CPS): physical entities (e.g., machines, vehicles, and work pieces), which are equipped with technologies such as RFIDs, sensors, microprocessors, telematics or complete embedded systems. They are characterized by being able to collect data of themselves and their environment, process and evaluate these data, connect and communicate with other systems, and initiate actions. In addition, CPS enabled new services that can replace traditional business models based solely on product sales. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the Industrie 4.0 and smart manufacturing programs, analyze the application potential of CPS starting from product design through production and logistics up to maintenance and exploitation (e.g., recycling), and identify current and future research issues. Besides the technological perspective, the paper also takes into account the economic side considering the new business strategies and models available. © 2017, Fuji Technology Press.

Their readiness and enthusiasm for AI vary extensively across organizational levels and geographies – raising serious questions about how organizations can best adopt AI and get the most business value from it. Consequently, we believe that AI adoption requires adaptation where executives help managers adjust to new, intelligent technologies. Executives should involve managers from different levels and geographies in initial experimentation with and implementation of AI in the organization. Greater involvement will allow managers to familiarize themselves with skills and potential solutions driven by AI and human input.

The interpretation of these cases has differed amongst biologists and philosophers, leading some to reject the utility of heritability estimates altogether. This paper examines the factors that influence causal reasoning when G–E covariance is present, leading to interpretive disagreement between scholars. It argues that the causal intuitions elicited are influenced by concepts of agency and blame-worthiness, and are intimately tied with the conceptual understanding of the phenotype under investigation. By considering a phenotype-specific approach, I provide an account as to why causal ascriptions can differ depending on the interpreter. Phenotypes like intelligence, which have been the primary focus of this debate, are more likely to spark disagreement for the interpretation of G–E covariance cases because the concept and ideas about its ‘normal development’ relatively ill-defined and are a subject of debate. I contend that philosophical disagreement about causal attributions in G–E covariance cases are in essence disagreements regarding how a phenotype should be defined and understood. This moves the debate from one of an ontological flavour concerning objective causal claims, to one concerning the conceptual, normative and semantic dependencies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Causation; Environment; Genes; Heritability; Phenotype","conceptual framework; heritability; phenotype; philosophy",2-s2.0-84982182231

Background: The study empirically explores how leadership toward creativity occurs in virtual work and uses the theoretical lenses of creativity-conducive leadership and heterarchy to generate a typology. Methodology: A multiple qualitative case study design, interpretivist approach, and abductive analysis are applied. Data is collected by interviewing 21 leaders and employees face-to-face in four companies in the ICT sector and one business advisor company. Contribution: The empirical evidence of this study enriches the understanding of leadership toward creativity in virtual work and contributes to the limited empirical knowledge on leadership that stimulates a virtual workforce to achieve creativity. Findings: The four different types of companies in the typology utilize various transitions toward leadership creativity in virtual work. The trend in leadership in the existing virtually networked business environment is toward the “collective mind” company, which is characterized by shared values, meaningful work, collective intelligence, conscious reflection, transparency, coaching, empowering leadership by example, effective multichannel interaction, and assertiveness. The findings empirically support applying a heterarchy perspective to lead a virtual workforce toward creativity and promote leaders who are genuinely interested in people, their development, collaboration, and technology. Recommendations for Practitioners: The typology helps professionals realize the need to develop leadership, communication, interaction, learning, and growth to foster creative interaction and improve productivity and competitiveness. Recommendation for Researchers: This study enables researchers to more rigorously and creatively conceptualize the conditions and relationships in leadership that facilitate creativity in virtual work. Impact on Society: The findings highlight humanistic values for developing leadership. The study strengthens the view that collective creativity in virtual work cannot emerge without virtual and physical interaction in appropriate spaces and caring for each other. Future Research: Future studies may focus on other fields, industries, networks, roles of materialities, and employees in fostering creativity and on theory development.

In the prevailing customer acquisition phase, it is common to see businesses in e-commerce pitch value-based differentiation to attract and lock-in customers for the long run. It has become imperative to identify the buying levers and take appropriate measures to positively influence them with a view to build sustainable leadership and maintain a strong competitive stance. A detailed study of buying patterns reveals that e-commerce customers make a purchase decision primarily on the basis of Product Pricing, Forward Speed, Order Promise or Reliability, Payment Methods offered and Cancellation Convenience. Forward speed or Order to Delivery lead time being one of the most important differentiating factors, a significant improvement here enables organizations to curb redundancy, introduce new services and enlarge the target market segment, enhance brand image and establish market dominance. It is thus evident that a disruptive innovation in forward movement holds great promise for any e-retail firm providing differentiation and thus a decisive edge over competition. This paper explores the intricacies of Forward Placement of inventory in an e-commerce supply chain with a focus on catering to the increasing demands of express delivery. Supply Chain as a science has always reiterated on maintaining centralized inventory and repeatedly stated the sub-optimality arising out of fragmenting this inventory pool. This framework bases its decision to adopt a decentralized model by harnessing the available intelligence and thus bridging the information asymmetry on customer behavior and demand patterns. The framework has been designed with an intent to allow for such a fundamental modification in a supply chain which exists in the highly volatile e-commerce industry. Multiple levers effecting the decision including order profiling (OP), order clusters (OC), order consolidation (OC), order delivery window (ODW),viable minimum delivery time (VMDT), inventory capacity (IC), inventory days on hand (IDOH), service premium potential (SPP) have been analyzed to efficiently implement the framework. This framework has been applied to assess the situation and identify locations for a leading Indian ecommerce company offering multiple categories with plethora of unique SKUs. This has enabled the company to introduce a new service offering of 4 hour delivery promise, thus introducing a potential to earn premium from customers and cater to new market segments interested in high speed deliveries. Furthermore, this paper discusses a potential design modification to the supply chain to introduce forward placed inventory (FPI) in an e-commerce setup. A brief insight has also been provided to the areas where it can be further optimized and deployed across various industries. © IEOM Society International.","Ecommerce; Forward placed inventory; Fulfilment center; Inventory decentralization; Order to delivery time",,2-s2.0-85019005731

To seize the best accurate output, the approach decided to be implemented is machine learning along with supervised classifier. Results are tested on the binary classification done using SVM classifier with a different set of a feature list. Most of the Machine Learning approach for solving business problems have their privilege over statistical methods that do not include AI, although there is an optimal methodology for certain problems.

As a result of customization, the variety of products handled by a warehouse has increased, making storage location assignment problems more complicated. Different approaches have been proposed by researchers for improving storage assignment and order picking. However, many industrial practitioners find it difficult to adopt such approaches due to complexity and high associated costs. In particular, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), that generally, lack resources and who have staff members with weak artificial intelligence backgrounds, still rely on experience when assigning storage locations for diverse products. In these circumstances, the quality of decision making cannot be guaranteed. In view of this, an intelligent system which can be easily adopted by SMEs is designed to improve storage location assignment problems. The proposed system, an RFID-based storage assignment system (RFID-SAS), is a rule-based system incorporating radio frequency identification (RFID) provides decision support for storage assignment in a warehouse. Unlike many existing situations, RFID tags are attached to products at the item level instead of at the pallet level. As the knowledge embedded in the system is represented in the form of rules, evaluation is important and is outlined in this paper. The effectiveness of the system is verified by means of a case study in which the system is implemented in a typical SME specializing in machinery manufacturing. The results illustrate that RFID-SAS can enhance the efficiency of order picking in a warehouse. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Fuzzy logic; Order picking; RFID; Small and medium enterprise; Storage location assignment","Combinatorial optimization; Decision making; Decision support systems; Efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent systems; Machinery; Warehouses; Decision supports; Industrial practitioners; Machinery manufacturing; Order picking; Rule-based system; Small and medium enterprise; Storage assignment; Storage location assignments; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",2-s2.0-84908520735

Open collaborative innovation practices have emerged in which an increasing number of users mutually collaborate by openly communicating their ideas, sharing best practices, and creating new knowledge across sectors. These online, distributed, crowd-driven networks take advantage of underlying network effects in order to harness the collective power and intelligence of the Crowd. Such novel paradigms fuel an increasing interest in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) methods in the context of IoT/IoE, which leverage the power and the wisdom of the crowd to observe, measure, and make sense of particular phenomena by exploiting user-owned mobile and wearable devices. However, when one examines the design and development of such ecosystems, realises that there is a gap in existing research. While emphasis has been placed upon the technical aspects, the success of such ecosystems is dependent on a number of diverse criteria. This chapter aims to fill this gap by providing a framework, which adopts a holistic approach based on multiple perspectives (namely technical, business, and people perspectives) and facilitates the design and development of crowd-driven ecosystems. This model is examined in the context of a hybrid crowd-driven IoT/IoE ecosystem, IoT Lab, in order to exemplify how these perspectives can be used to promote an ecosystem’s success and detail the challenges faced.

Among these areas, IoT is considered as an important platform in bringing people, processes, data and things/objects together in order to enhance the quality of our everyday lives. However, the key challenges are how to effectively extract useful features from the massive amount of heterogeneous data generated by resource-constrained IoT devices in order to provide real-time information and feedback to the end-users, and how to utilize this data-aware intelligence in enhancing the performance of wireless IoT networks. Although there are parallel advances in cloud computing and edge computing for addressing some issues in data analytics, they have their own benefits and limitations. The convergence of these two computing paradigms, i.e., massive virtually shared pool of computing and storage resources from the cloud and real-time data processing by edge computing, could effectively enable live data analytics in wireless IoT networks. In this regard, we propose a novel framework for coordinated processing between edge and cloud computing/processing by integrating advantages from both the platforms. The proposed framework can exploit the network-wide knowledge and historical information available at the cloud center to guide edge computing units towards satisfying various performance requirements of heterogeneous wireless IoT networks. Starting with the main features, key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics, we provide various synergies and distinctions between cloud and edge processing.

We have built a hypothesis that the kernel of AI has remained more or less the same but that the changes are triggered by certain enabling technologies, used to implement the AI applications of each time. We term these enabling technologies ""resources"". The same progress as that in AI fits many other areas of ICT. We transferred our discussion to the area of data management, which become the second goal of our analysis. The current data driven ICT manifests itself in big data analysis and new database technologies, but has roots in the early decades of computing. In general, at the beginning of the computer era (1940s), the aim was always to develop intelligent computer based software systems within the framework of technical restrictions. We also see the same limitations in the changes of software engineering tools and practices, as well as in the interpretations of ICT related concepts (semantics of concepts changes with time). In our paper, we will briefly introduce our ICT Change Analysis and Categorization framework and introduce the current state-of-the-art of emerging ICTs. The aim of our paper is to act as a discussion opener in the question ""How was the progress of software and software engineering born - what are the factors controlling and enabling the changes?"" Our aim is to point out that, in addition to excellence in the area of frontier technologies and tools, a lot of basic level understanding in the area of computing fundamentals is needed - just to understand the root of the current situation. © Copyright 2017 by the paper's authors.","Technology Analysis","Application programs; Big data; Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Information management; Semantics; Software engineering; Computing fundamentals; Current situation; Database technology; Emerging technologies; Enabling technologies; Software engineering tools; Software systems; Technology analysis; Quality control",2-s2.0-85030785447

This paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The interviewee is Dr Jun Ho Oh, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Director of KAIST's Hubolab. Determined to build a humanoid robot in the early 2000s to compete with Japan's humanoids, Dr Oh and KAIST created the KHR1. This research led to seven more advanced versions of a biped humanoid robot and the founding of the Robot for Artificial Intelligence and Boundless Walking (Rainbow) Co., a professional technological mechatronics company. In this interview, Dr Oh shares the history and success of Korea's humanoid robot research. Findings - Dr Oh received his BSc in 1977 and MSc in Mechanical Engineering in 1979 from Yonsei University. Oh worked as a Researcher for the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute before receiving his PhD from the University of California (UC) Berkeley in mechanical engineering in 1985. After his PhD, Oh remained at UC Berkeley to do Postdoctoral research. Since 1985, Oh has been a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST. He was a Visiting Professor from 1996 to 1997 at the University of Texas Austin. Oh served as the Vice President of KAIST from 2013-2014. In addition to teaching, Oh applied his expertise in robotics, mechatronics, automatic and real-time control to the commercial development of a series of humanoid robots. Originality/value - Highly self-motivated and always determined, Dr Oh's initial dream of building the first Korean humanoid bipedal robot has led him to become one of the world leaders of humanoid robots. He has contributed widely to the field over the nearly past two decades with the development of five versions of the HUBO robot. Oh led Team KAIST to win the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) and a grand prize of US$2m with its humanoid robot DRC-HUBO+, beating 23 teams from six countries. Oh serves as a robotics policy consultant for the Korean Ministry of Commerce Industry and Energy.

Furthermore, the study aims to investigate stress-reducing potentials of personal characteristics (e.g., self-efficacy beliefs, vocational experience). Methods: A mixed-methods design was chosen to investigate in-depth processes during domain-specific problem solving, using a computer-based office simulation. Personal characteristics were assessed by questionnaires and tests before the task. Cardiovascular and electrodermal reactivity were measured continuously during the task. Problem-solving activities were coded on the basis of screencasts and think-aloud recordings. Changes in physiological reactivity were estimated on the basis of problemsolving activities and personal characteristics via multilevel regression analyses. Results: The problem-solving task in general was associated with stress reactions. There were no significant main effects of self-efficacy beliefs, vocational experience, and general intelligence. However, changes in heart rate depended on an interaction between vocational experience and activities including goal elaboration and definition. Furthermore, problem-solving activities including decision making were significantly associated with an increase of amplitudes of detected skin conductance responses. A negative correlation found between the problem-solving score and the LF/HF ratio indicates that higher physiological arousal during the problem-solving task was accompanied by lower problem-solving performance. Conclusion: It seems to be worthwhile to integrate physiological methods in domainspecific research practice to a greater extent. An essential advantage of such methods can be seen in the measurements' relative independence from self-reported biases that seems to be especially important for high-frequency measurements within the scope of process-accompanying surveys and/or when investigating implicit aspects of action processes: from this, some new methodological perspectives for empirical research in VET could be developed. However, one has to consider that physiological measures alone are not objective or meaningful in this context, but rather have to be interpreted in their interplay with psychological parameters (e.g., experiences, behaviors) or with particular situational stimuli. © The Author(s) 2017.","Computer-based office simulation; Heart rate (variability); Mixed-methods study; Perceived stress; Problem-solving activities; Skin conductance responses; Vocational experience",,2-s2.0-85032580358

Different from the previous work on social behavior analysis, in this paper, we present a visual analytics system, Social Check-in Fingerprinting (Sci-Fin), to facilitate the analysis and visualization of social check-in data. We focus on three major components of user check-in data: location, activity, and profile. Visual fingerprints for location, activity, and profile are designed to intuitively represent the high-dimensional attributes. To visually mine and demonstrate the behavior features, we integrate WorldMapper and Voronoi Treemap into our glyph-like designs. Such visual fingerprint designs offer us the opportunity to summarize the interesting features and patterns from different check-in locations, activities and users (groups).

Majority of existing saliency detection algorithms are presented for distortion-free images. However, this situation is not always the case. In this paper, we first evaluate the performances of state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms against different distortion types and levels. A machine learning-based framework for saliency detection is proposed for two common types of distortions, noise and JPEG compression. First, a machine learning method is proposed to predict the distortion level, and then the distortion is removed using the parameter setting that is tuned for that distortion level. Finally, the saliency map is calculated by using saliency detection algorithms. We evaluate the saliency detection algorithms on Tampere Image Database (TID2013), which is proposed for image quality assessment application. We manually label the salient objects in each image and obtain its ground truth saliency map in order to adapt TID2013 for visual saliency detection application. Experimental results demonstrate that the distortions usually decrease the performances of the saliency detection algorithms, particularly in high levels of distortions. The performance rankings of the saliency detection algorithms for the distortion-free images and distorted images are different. Moreover, our proposed machine learning-based framework for saliency detection improves the performances of saliency detection algorithms in distorted images in most of the distortion levels, particularly in high levels of distortions. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Distortion level; Distortion removal; Distortion type; Saliency detection","Artificial intelligence; Digital image storage; Image processing; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Quality control; Signal detection; Visualization; Image processing applications; Image quality assessment; Machine learning methods; Parameter setting; Performance rankings; Saliency detection; State of the art; Visual saliency detections; Image compression",2-s2.0-85006098496

Writing introductory psychology textbooks is challenging given that authors need to cover many areas they themselves may not be intimately familiar with. This challenge is compounded by problems within the scholarly community in which controversial topics may be communicated in ideological terms within scholarly discourse. Psychological science has historically seen concerns raised about the mismatch between claims and data made about certain fields of knowledge, apprehensions that continue in the present “replication crisis.” The concern is that, although acting in good faith, introductory psychology textbook authors may unwittingly communicate information to readers that is factually untrue. Twenty-four leading introductory psychology textbooks were surveyed for their coverage of a number of controversial topics (e.g., media violence, narcissism epidemic, multiple intelligences) and scientific urban legends (e.g., Kitty Genovese, Mozart Effect) for their factual accuracy. Results indicated numerous errors of factual reporting across textbooks, particularly related to failing to inform students of the controversial nature of some research fields and repeating some scientific urban legends as if true.

One simple example could be how people today buy a mobile phone. If in the past, shopping involved moving from one store to the other, these days one cares more about the opinions expressed by people in product reviews rather. There is an increasing tendency to leave one's opinion(s) on a product, service or any entity on the web thus opening doors for an interesting yet challenging field of Sentiment Analysis. Much work has been done in the last decade on Sentiment Analysis not surprisingly for English because of the availability of a large number of resources but other languages are also gradually taking pace, some of them already in advanced stages and already developing competing resources and applications compared to English. Nepali opinionated content is also increasing rapidly in the last few years. Nepal fares as one of the countries with the highest number of Facebook subscribers. Online presence and voicing one's opinion in the Internet through different social media platforms has become a norm both for individuals or businesses. Nepali is a morphologically rich, under-resourced and a free word order language. Although some works related to the language and technology have been done in the past by institutions like Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya1 and Language Technology Kendra2, Nepali still remains an under-resourced language as it has very few tools and annotated corpus available for the language. This makes it challenging and difficult to do any linguistic computational works in the language including Sentiment Analysis. In this work, we look into applying three Machine Learning classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for developing a model to classify book and movie reviews written in Nepali into 'Positive' and 'Negative'.

The abundance of information collected through ad-hoc sensors networks in the smart city context provides a remarkable opportunity to tackle interesting urban challenges and to add intelligences in the urban environment. However, for each data source and type, different spatial and temporal references are potentially used. Hence, the complexity of dealing with such an heterogeneity of data has significantly increased. This paper proposes a distributed business intelligence engine, named BI2CITY, able to efficiently manage the process of integrating and analysing a large volume of heterogeneous data generated by various sources in the smart city context. BI2CITY exploits a Big Data approach to support (i) data storage, (ii) spatio-temporal data aggregation, and (iii) different targeted data analyses, such as correlating urban data and forecasting the expected values of some interesting data (e.g., air pollution). Spatio-temporal data aggregation and analyses are performed on the fly using MapReduce based algorithms. Experimental results on real data collected in a major Italian city demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed system to perform interesting and efficient analysis. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Complex networks; Digital storage; Smart city; Ad hoc sensors; Distributed systems; Efficient analysis; Expected values; Heterogeneous data; Public interest; Spatio-temporal data; Urban environments; Big data",2-s2.0-85013212389

While conventional digital methods are inefficient in implementing massively parallel systems, analog solutions are hard to design and program. Stochastic Computing (SC) is a natural bridge that allows pseudo-analog computations in the digital domain using low complexity hardware. However, large scale SC systems traditionally suffered from long latencies, hence higher energy consumption. This work develops a VLSI architecture for an SC based binocular vision system based on a disparity-energy model that emulates the hierarchical multi-layered neural structure in the primary visual cortex. The 3-layer neural network architecture is biologically plausible and is tuned to detecting 5 different disparities. The architecture is compact, adder-free, and achieves better disparity detection compared to a floating-point version by using a modified disparity-energy model.

Changes in verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ), performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), full intelligence quotient (FIQ), and memory quotient (MQ) were compared between two groups. Re-fMRI data were also collected from two groups to evaluate these changes. Each individual score of neuropsychological testing and memory functional evaluation were higher in control group, which was statistically different (all P < 0.01) while the VIQ, PIQ, FIQ, and MQ showed the same trend (all P < 0.01). The data showed the positive activation differences in brain regions between experimental and control group, namely right frontal lobe, the left middle temporal gyrus back, right superior temporal gyrus, left cerebellum, left angular gyrus, left wedge anterior lobe, and left central back; while the negatively activated brain regions were left prefrontal, right cerebellum, right corner back, and right anterior cingulate gyrus. During the language task, the activated brain regions of the TLE patients were right prefrontal lobe, the lateral temporal gyri, the left cerebellum, left cornu laterale gyrus, left precuneus, and the left postcentral gyrus, whereas the negatively activated brain areas were the left prefrontal cortex, the right cerebellum, right cornu laterale gyrus, and the right anterior cingulate gyrus.

Methods: This is a retrospective observational study that was conducted between the years of 2014 and 2015 and relied on two data sources: the Dorenfest Institute dataset and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Analytics data source. In addition, questionnaires were submitted to collect data about how healthcare settings in the United States had been utilizing QIMs in the last 10 years. The submitted questionnaire invitations yielded 144 responses from 134 hospitals and 10 physician practices. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the condition of the data. This involved the utilization of Box-Whisker plots to visualize the data shape, outliers and variation. The Gamma correlation analysis method was used to evaluate the statistical relationships between the QIM outcomes, efficiency, throughput and financial outcomes, and the employment of HIT systems in QIMs. Results: The study found that 99.3% of the healthcare organizations and physician practices had implemented at least one QIM over the last 10 years. In the QIM implementations, the total numbers of reported utilization instances of manual data collection, electronic health records, lab information systems, pharmacy information systems, computerized provider order entry and radiology information systems were 387, 352, 205, 185, 180 and 158, respectively. Based on a 95% confidence limit, the Gamma statistical test has shown an inverse correlation between the exclusive utilization of manual data collection and the overall QIM efficiency (p = 0.047, Gamma = -0.388) and throughput (p = 0.012, Gamma = -0.593) outcomes. However, the overall QIM financial outcomes were found to have a statistically insignificant correlation (p = 0.159). Conclusions: The study has revealed statistically significant negative impacts on QIMs' efficiency and throughput outcomes when the manual data collection is the sole method used in QIM implementations. This also indicates a positive correlation between the QIMs' efficiency and throughput outcomes and the HIT utilization in QIMs. © 2016 The Author(s).","Clinical and business intelligence; Data analytics; Healthcare challenges; Quality control; Quality improvement","computerized provider order entry; correlation analysis; doctor patient relation; electronic health record; employment; health care organization; human; human experiment; intelligence; laboratory information system; medical information; observational study; pharmacy; questionnaire; radiology information system; statistical model; statistics; total quality management; United States; vibrissa; economics; medical informatics; retrospective study; standards; statistics and numerical data; total quality management; Humans; Medical Informatics; Quality Improvement; Retrospective Studies; United States",2-s2.0-85001930730

Fieldwork was conducted in one UK police force with both analysts and police officers. Findings from the analysis of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions suggest that while crime analysis is acknowledged as being central to the business of everyday policing, police officers’ general lack of understanding of how analysts work and their capability leads to underutilisation of their skills. The research uncovered knowledge and process gaps, deepened by cultural constraints, budget cuts and resource reallocations, which inhibited incorporation of analysis into the heart of policing practice. Findings also indicated that analysts lack the resources, time, and sometimes, motivation to undertake sophisticated analysis, and often feel frustrated when officers’ opinions override analytical wisdom. The paper argues that at least in the UK, better training and cultural change are necessary for creative utilisation of analytical resources and for bridging the knowledge and process gaps in the organisation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","analytical products; Crime analysis; intelligence analysis; police",,2-s2.0-85002050037

Governments, motivated to ensure the safety, security and prosperity of their communities, insist on effective and efficient regulations and advocate for more. Additionally, citizens and interest groups advocate for more or fewer regulations depending on perceived benefits to them. This scenario puts pressure on regulators mandated to administer regulations. They are required to be transparent and accountable in showing the performance of regulations while accommodating the concerns of different stakeholders involved. In this regard, this doctoral research proposes a framework that regulators can use to show the performance of their regulations through modeling and measuring regulations and evaluating and reporting their outcomes.

In particular, several recent works faced the problem of inducing a binary classification model (here named deviance detection model) that can discriminate between deviant traces and normal ones, based on a set of historical log traces (labeled as either deviant or normal). Current solutions rely on applying standard classifier-induction methods to a feature-based representation of the given traces, where the features include sequence-based patterns extracted from the corresponding sequences of activities. However, there is no consensus on which kinds of patterns are the most suitable for such a task. On the other hand, mixing multiple pattern families together may produce a heterogenous, redundant and sparse representation of the traces that likely leads to poor deviance detection models. In this paper, we propose an ensemble-learning method for solving this problem, where multiple base classifiers are trained on different feature-based views of the log (each obtained by mapping the traces onto a distinguished collection of patterns). A stacking procedure is used to combine the discovered base models into an overall probabilistic model that associates any new trace with an estimate of the probability that it reflects a deviant process instance. This helps the analyst prioritize the inspection of the cases that are more likely to be deviant. The method also takes advantage of all nonstructural data available in the log, and employs a resampling mechanism to deal with the rarity of deviances in the training log. It has been conceived as the core of a comprehensive framework for detecting and analyzing business process deviances. The framework supports the analyst to investigate suspect deviances, and provides some feedback to the learning method for improving the accuracy of the discovered deviance detection models. Tests on several real-life datasets proved the validity of the approach, as concerns its capability to discover an accurate deviance detection model, and to effectively exploit new (originally unlabeled) traces via active learning and self-training mechanisms. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Business process intelligence; classification; deviation detection",,2-s2.0-85010006546

Because most of the problems (obstacles) faced by business have to consider a group of complex and interrelated factors, conventional statistics models (e.g., regression) have constraints in resolving these interrelated and complex problems. Therefore, this study proposes a novel multiple attribute decision-making model to resolve—from ranking/selection to improvement planning—the problems of business analytics in finance, based on the similarity with positive contexts (rules) and the dissimilarity with negative ones. The proposed model not only enhances the previous method (i.e., dominance-based rough set approach, DRSA) on ranking within the same decision class, but also provides a contextual approach to guide businesses for systematic improvements. Infused with the modified VIKOR method, the proposed model could support a company to transform analytics into priority contexts, which may guide improvement planning. To show the proposed model, a group of semiconductor companies in Taiwan is analyzed as an empirical case, and three companies are taken as examples to illustrate the ranking and improvement planning processes. The obtained findings thus contribute to bridge the applications of data-driven business analytics to the field of decision science in practice. © 2016, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bipolar decision model; Business analytics (BA); Dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA); Fuzzy-rough machine learning; Modified VIKOR method; Multiple attribute decision making (MADM)","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Rough set theory; Bipolar decisions; Business analytics; Dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA); Modified VIKOR method; Multiple attribute decision making; Learning systems",2-s2.0-84996563858

As expected, emotional intelligence was positively associated with life satisfaction and psychological well-being. The final model revealed a significant path from emotional intelligence through perceived stress to life satisfaction and psychological well-being even controlling for personality traits as covariables. Our findings suggest an underlying process by which high emotional intelligence increases well-being in graduates by reducing the experience of stress.

This is the problem of machine emulation of sense. In the present study, analysis of this problem is carried out based on concepts from structural and post-structural approaches that have been almost entirely overlooked by contemporary philosophy of mind. If we refer to the basic definitions of “sign” and “meaning” found in structuralism and post-structuralism, we see a fundamental difference between the capabilities of a machine and the human brain engaged in the processing of a sign. This research will exemplify and provide additional evidence to support distinctions between syntactic and semantic aspects of intelligence, an issue widely discussed by adepts of contemporary philosophy of mind. The research will demonstrate that some aspect of a number of ideas proposed in relation to semantics and semiosis in structuralism and post-structuralism are similar to those we find in contemporary analytical studies related to the theory and philosophy of artificial intelligence.

Children of parents who view intelligence as static (known as a fixed intelligence mindset), rather than malleable through effort (known as a growth intelligence mindset), experience more academic, self-regulatory, and motivational difficulty. However, associations between parental intelligence mindset and child mental health problems are unclear. Accordingly, we tested whether parents’ intelligence mindsets related to internalizing problems in their children (N = 131, ages 5–8). Overall, parents with stronger fixed intelligence mindsets had children with greater internalizing problems, particularly social anxiety (characterized by fear of negative evaluation). Results further revealed that parents’ fixed intelligence mindsets were associated with overall internalizing problems and depressive symptoms in boys, but not girls.

A novel Artificial Fish Swarm Optimization Algorithm Aided by Ocean Current Power (abbreviation for AFSAOCP) is proposed, which assumes the ocean current always causes certain influence on the fishes’ activity speed. Firstly, the computing model of ocean current is developed and constructed. Then the influence level of the ocean current on fishes is analyzed. If fishes are swimming along ocean current direction, ocean current will drive fishes’ speed increment, which is called positive influence; if fishes are swimming against ocean current, the current will hinder the fishes’ speed, which is called negative influence. In addition, fishes’ speed is not influenced by the ocean current, which is called merits offset faults. To sum this up, fishes in each group have different speed range, respectively. Grouping strategies can not only increase species diversity, but it can also make the algorithm escape from local optimal value in the iteration process. The proposed variant, AFSAOCP, is examined on several widely used benchmarked functions, and the experimental results show that the proposed AFSAOCP algorithm improves the existing performance of other algorithms when dealing with the different dimension and multimodal problems. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial swarm algorithm; Ocean current power; Optimization problem; Swarm intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Iterative methods; Ocean currents; Oceanography; Optimization; Speed; Artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm; Grouping strategies; Information interaction; Multimodal problems; Optimization problems; Swarm algorithms; Swarm Intelligence; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Algorithms",2-s2.0-84976292934

There is also a growing body of manually produced image annotation data. All of this data is of great importance for scientific purposes as well as for commercial applications. Optimizing the usefulness of this, manually or automatically produced, information implies its precise and adequate expression at its different logical levels, making it easily accessible, manipulable and shareable. It also implies the development of associated manipulating tools. However, the expression and manipulation of computer vision results has received less attention than the actual extraction of such results. Hence, it has experienced a smaller advance. Existing metadata tools are poorly structured, in logical terms, as they intermix the declaration of visual detections with that of the observed entities, events and comprising context. This poor structuring renders such tools rigid, limited and cumbersome to use.

Forty-three young males (21 ADHD–Combined Type and 22 controls) aged 10–18 years underwent structural and diffusion weighted MRI. Tractography applying constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) was used to construct frontostriatal tracts between each of caudate and putamen and each of dorsolateral prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (DLPFC, VLPFC and OFC) in each hemisphere, to examine both volumetric and diffusion microstructure properties. Young people with ADHD did not show the right hemisphere lateralization of volume in the Caudate-VLPFC and Caudate-DLPFC tracts that was evident in controls, however the ADHD group displayed a pronounced lateralization to the left for fractional anisotropy in the Putamen-VLPFC tracts. The degree of volume asymmetry did not correlate with symptom severity; however fractional anisotropy (FA) values that were more strongly lateralized to the left in the Putamen-VLPFC white matter were associated with greater symptom severity. ADHD was associated with anomalous hemispheric asymmetries in both tract volume and underlying white-matter microstructure in major fibre tracts of the frontostriatal system. Our observations of both weaker lateralization to the right in terms of tract volume and stronger lateralization to the left in terms of FA values for the ADHD group, suggests that previous inconsistencies in the literature may reflect the influence of such asymmetries. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ADHD; Asymmetry; Attention; Constrained spherical deconvolution; Frontostriatal; Tractography","adolescent; adult; Article; attention deficit disorder; brain asymmetry; brain size; caudate nucleus; child; childhood disease; clinical article; controlled study; diffusion; diffusion weighted imaging; disease severity; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; fractional anisotropy; frontostriatum; hemisphere; hemispheric dominance; human; left hemisphere; male; neuroimaging; orbital cortex; priority journal; putamen; right hemisphere; striate cortex; ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; white matter; analysis of variance; attention deficit disorder; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; intelligence test; nerve tract; organ size; prefrontal cortex; psychological rating scale; regression analysis; severity of illness index; white matter; Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Caudate Nucleus; Child; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Functional Laterality; Humans; Intelligence Tests; Male; Neural Pathways; Organ Size; Prefrontal Cortex; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Putamen; Regression Analysis; Severity of Illness Index; White Matter",2-s2.0-84946117008

This occurs in many natural systems in biology, ecology and physics. Nature-inspired computation tries to capture and exploit natural solutions in order to solve real problems in many different fields such as telecommunication networks, architecture and urban spaces design, sociology or economy planning. The main purpose of the present research is the creation of a computational path connecting a set of low-level interactions with high-level emerging behaviors. The low-level interactions are modeled by very simple neighbor binary rules. The upper level highlights a regular pattern formation. This framework has been applied to approach the pattern formation in the vertebrate limb development under the scope of the French Flag model. Methods: We have developed a four-level theoretical framework. The lowest level defines a set of neighbor binary rules. The second level comes from the iterative application of these rules on sequences of binary values. The resulting sequences are interpreted as arithmetic function values, in binary or decimal representation. The third level highlights a set of computational primitives that have the capability to build directly the function values. Any function can be carried out by means of a particular combination of these primitives, denoted seed behavior. In the fourth level, the emergent behavioral effect is highlighted as a scaling process of the seed behavior. Results: Some functions that have been defined by the four-level framework have been successfully applied to model the French Flag model (progressive specification, intercalary specification and early specification) which is a well-known approach to the pattern formation in the vertebrate limb development. Conclusions: Our empirical research highlights it is possible to develop a computational model which connects very simple rules to complex behavioral patterns. The way consists of a hierarchical organization of computing embedded steps. Our model provides a numerical and geometrical counterpart to the French Flag model and therefore proves its capability to be a formal basis to the case of vertebrate limb development. These encouraging results suggest as a future work the improvement in this model. The composition of functions must be explored as well as new combinations of building primitives in order to identify more emergent effects. More, the relevance of quantitative emergent effects must be highlighted in future applications to natural cases. It is expected that the development of these operations will help addressing new issues such as truncation and graft in vertebrate limbs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Computational intelligence; Emergent effect; French Flag model; Neighbor rules; Pattern formation; Vertebrate limb development","Artificial intelligence; Bins; Biology; Complex networks; Computational methods; Iterative methods; Number theory; Telecommunication networks; Computational approach; Developmental biology; Emergent effect; Hierarchical organizations; Neighbor rules; Pattern formation; Theoretical framework; Vertebrate limb; Specifications",2-s2.0-84986257769

Despite the clear value this tripartite approach would afford to researchers in search of cases with similar fact patterns and desired (or undesired) outcomes, this approach has not been applied consistently in the intervening years since its introduction.

The IWS structure allows the intersection of tidsets between two itemsets to be performed very fast. A map array is proposed for storing a 1-bit index for words.

A weighted tree similarity algorithm has been developed earlier which combines matching and missing values between two taxonomy trees. It is shown in this paper that this algorithm has some limitations when the same sub-tree appears at different positions in a pair of trees. In this paper, we introduce a generalized formula to combine matching and missing values. Subsequently, two generalized weighted tree similarity algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm calculates matching and missing values between two taxonomy trees separately and combines them globally. The second algorithm calculates matching and missing values at each level of the two trees and combines them at every level recursively which preserves the structural information between the two trees. The proposed algorithms efficiently use the missing value in similarity computation in order to distinguish among taxonomy trees that have the same matching value but with different miss trees at different positions.

The quality of the received contextual information, however, impacts predictive analytics tasks especially when dealing with uncertain data, outliers data, and data containing missing values. Low quality of received contextual data significantly spoils the progressive inference and on-line statistical reasoning tasks, thus, bias is introduced in the induced knowledge, e.g., classification and decision making. To alleviate such situation, which is not so rare in real time contextual information processing systems, we propose a progressive time-optimized data quality-aware mechanism, which attempts to deliver contextual information of high quality to predictive analytics engines by progressively introducing a certain controlled delay. Such a mechanism progressively delivers high quality data as much as possible, thus eliminating possible biases in knowledge extraction and predictive analysis tasks. We propose an analytical model for this mechanism and show the benefits stem from this approach through comprehensive experimental evaluation and comparative assessment with quality-unaware methods over real sensory multivariate contextual data. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Contextual data streams; Optimal stopping theory; Predictive analytics; Quality of information; Stochastic decision making","Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Decision making; Decision theory; Extraction; Learning systems; Quality control; Real time systems; Stochastic systems; Wireless sensor networks; Comparative assessment; Contextual information; Data stream; Experimental evaluation; Optimal stopping theories; Predictive analytics; Quality of information; Statistical reasoning; Data mining",2-s2.0-84976300444

The decision is usually about selecting the move with the highest expectation, or exploring new scenarios. Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which was developed as a game playing agent, deals with this exploration–exploitation ‘dilemma’ using a multi-armed bandits strategy. The success of MCTS in a wide range of problems, such as combinatorial optimisation, reinforcement learning, and games, is due to its ability to rapidly evaluate problem states without requiring domain-specific knowledge. However, it has been acknowledged that the trade-off between exploration and exploitation is crucial for the performance of the algorithm, and affects the efficiency of the agent in learning deceptive states. One type of deception is states that give immediate rewards, but lead to a suboptimal solution in the long run. These states are known as trap states, and have been thoroughly investigated in previous research. In this work, we study the opposite of trap states, known as sacrifice states, which are deceptive moves that result in a local loss but are globally optimal, and investigate the efficiency of MCTS enhancements in identifying this type of moves. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial intelligence; Games; Monte-Carlo Tree Search; Sacrifice moves","Combinatorial optimization; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Monte Carlo methods; Reinforcement learning; Domain-specific knowledge; Exploration and exploitation; Games; Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS); Monte-Carlo tree searches; Multi armed bandit; Sacrifice moves; Suboptimal solution; Artificial intelligence",2-s2.0-84991073416

Groups representing lower and higher numbers of shunt revisions were coded to generate effect sizes for differences in IQ scores. Mean effect size across studies was statistically significant, but small (Hedges’ g = 0.25, p < 0.001, 95 % CI [0.08, 0.43]) with more shunt revisions associated with lower IQ scores. Results show an association of lower IQ and more shunt revisions of about 3 IQ points, a small effect, but within the error of measurement associated with IQ tests.

This study collected spatialtemporal data of property crime that occurred at city A located in South China in the period from 2008 to 2012, filtered the factors of property crime by correlation analysis, and selected the neighbors by spatial autocorrelation.

Current researches demonstrate that the correlation between property crime and factors, like urban transport, network density, floating population and economic indicator, is significant. This study confirms that the GA−BP neural network model based on GIS is a reasonable forecast model in the field of property crime forecast research.

Here, we test the hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to social cognition through EA from faces. We examined 57 patients with cerebellar disorders and 57 healthy controls. Thirty-one patients had complex cerebrocerebellar disease (complex cerebrocerebellar disease group (CD)); 26 had disease isolated to cerebellum (isolated cerebellar disease group (ID)). EA was measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMET), and informants were administered a novel questionnaire, the Cerebellar Neuropsychiatric Rating Scale (CNRS). EA was impaired in all patients (CD p < 0.001, ID p < 0.001). When analyzed for valence categories, both CD and ID missed more positive and negative stimuli. Positive targets produced the highest deficit (CD p < 0.001, ID p = 0.004). EA impairments correlated with CNRS measures of deficient social skills (p < 0.05) and autism spectrum behaviors (p < 0.005). Patients had difficulties with emotion regulation (CD p < 0.001, ID p < 0.001), autism spectrum behaviors (CD p < 0.049, ID p < 0.001), and psychosis spectrum symptoms (CD p < 0.021, ID p < 0.002). ID informants endorsed deficient social skills (CD p < 0.746, ID p < 0.003) and impaired attention regulation (CD p < 0.144, ID p < 0.001). Within the psychosis spectrum domain, CD patients were worse than controls for lack of empathy (CD p = 0.05; ID p = 0.49). Thus, patients with cerebellar damage were impaired on an EA task associated with deficient social skills and autism spectrum behaviors and experienced psychosocial difficulties on the CNRS.

I begin by outlining the Google effect, which (allegedly) shows that when we know information is available online, we put less effort into storing that information in the brain. Some argue that this strategy is adaptive because it frees up internal resources which can then be used for other cognitive tasks, whereas others argue that this is maladaptive because it makes us less knowledgeable. I argue that the currently available empirical evidence in cognitive psychology does not support strong conclusions about the negative effects of the Internet on memory. Before we can make value-judgements about the cognitive effects of the Internet, we need more robust and ecologically-valid evidence. Having sketched a more nuanced picture of the Google effect, I then argue that the value of our cognitive abilities is in part intrinsic and in part instrumental, that is, they are both valuable in themselves and determined by the socio-cultural context in which these cognitive abilities are utilised. Focussing on instrumental value, I argue that, in an information society such as ours, having the skills to efficiently navigate, evaluate, compare, and synthesize online information are (under most circumstances) more valuable than having a lot of facts stored in biological memory.

Software historical defect data has a complicated structure and a marked characteristic of class-imbalance; how to fully analyze and utilize the existing historical defect data and build more precise and effective classifiers has attracted considerable researchers’ interest from both academia and industry. Multiple kernel learning and ensemble learning are effective techniques in the field of machine learning. Multiple kernel learning can map the historical defect data to a higher-dimensional feature space and make them express better, and ensemble learning can use a series of weak classifiers to reduce the bias generated by the majority class and obtain better predictive performance. In this paper, we propose to use the multiple kernel learning to predict software defect. By using the characteristics of the metrics mined from the open source software, we get a multiple kernel classifier through ensemble learning method, which has the advantages of both multiple kernel learning and ensemble learning. We thus propose a multiple kernel ensemble learning (MKEL) approach for software defect classification and prediction. Considering the cost of risk in software defect prediction, we design a new sample weight vector updating strategy to reduce the cost of risk caused by misclassifying defective modules as non-defective ones. We employ the widely used NASA MDP datasets as test data to evaluate the performance of all compared methods; experimental results show that MKEL outperforms several representative state-of-the-art defect prediction methods. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ensemble learning; Multiple kernel ensemble learning (MKEL); Multiple kernel learning; Software defect prediction","Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Defects; Forecasting; Learning systems; NASA; Open systems; Software engineering; Complicated structures; Defect prediction methods; Ensemble learning; Higher dimensional features; Multiple Kernel Learning; Predictive performance; Software defect prediction; Updating strategy; Open source software",2-s2.0-84926613328

Selective attention and cortical magnification are two such important phenomena that have been the subject of a large body of research in recent years. In this paper, we focus on designing a new model for visual acquisition that takes these important properties into account. Methods: We propose a new framework for visual information acquisition and representation that emulates the architecture of the primate visual system by integrating features such as retinal sampling and cortical magnification while avoiding spatial deformations and other side effects produced by models that tried to implement these two features. It also explicitly integrates the notion of visual angle, which is rarely taken into account by vision models. We argue that this framework can provide the infrastructure for implementing vision tasks such as object recognition and computational visual attention algorithms. Results: To demonstrate the utility of the proposed vision framework, we propose an algorithm for bottom-up saliency prediction implemented using the proposed architecture. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on the MIT saliency benchmark and show that it attains state-of-the-art performance, while providing some advantages over other models. Conclusion: Here is a summary of the main contributions of this paper: (1) Introducing a new bio-inspired framework for visual information acquisition and representation that offers the following properties: (a) Providing a method for taking the distance between an image and the viewer into account.

Also, one observer said the industry will look to Washington to see if lawmakers react to pressure and repeal the medical device excise tax. Also driving operations improvements with a view toward the bottom line are investments by private equity groups. While companies are in cost-cutting mode, they're paying a lot of attention to quality to eliminate the cost of defects. Jack Curran, industry research analyst at IBISWorld said that as manufacturers try to maintain their profit margins in the United States, expect to see lower employment and less innovation in factories. McDaniel, medical industry manager at SME, said she also expects to see growth in biological 3D printing.

We obtained questionnaire data from college students (N = 261) on implicit theories, goals, and attributions, as well as emotions and behavior after a hypothetical failure. Path analysis showed that learning goal and effort attribution mediated the association between incremental theory and post-failure intention to plan remedial action.

In addition to satellites providing information which facilitates a better understanding of the space environment and improved performance of physics experiments, satellite observations are also used to actively monitor weather, geological processes, agricultural development and the evolution of natural and man-made hazards. Defence agencies depend on satellite services for communication in remote locations, as well as for reconnaissance and intelligence. Both commercial and government users rely on communication satellites to provide communication in the event of a disaster that damages ground-based communication systems, provide news, education and entertainment to remote areas and connect global businesses. The space radiation environment is an hazard to most satellite missions and can lead to extremely difficult operating conditions for all of the equipment travelling in space.

In so doing, they exploit recent technological advances in Bayesian artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistics, but also consider established principles from cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Although these tweaks and heuristics are highly pragmatic in character and are often deployed unsystematically, Bayesian reverse-engineering avoids several important worries that have been raised about the explanatory credentials of Bayesian cognitive science: the worry that the lower levels of analysis are being ignored altogether; the challenge that the mathematical models being developed are unfalsifiable; and the charge that the terms ‘optimal’ and ‘rational’ have lost their customary normative force.

After the analysis of the academic history of the concept follows an examination of the implementation of a range of assessment instruments and training programmes related to social skills (and lack hereof) in contemporary Danish welfare institutions (more specifically, day nurseries and schools, employment and penal services). The analysis forwarded in the article thus demonstrates how an intellectual idea may develop and travel - and on its journey connect to pre-existing cultural logics and societal concerns. The idea of social skills has through its development been made uncontroversial – everybody wants to be skilful. The concept does, however, convey an individualistic view on social life and imposes a reflexivity over own performance on the participants. Further, its normative character contributes to a problematization of those who are perceived to lack these skills. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Behaviourism; Construction of social problems; Genealogy; Scandinavian welfare institutions; Self-governance; Social skills; Travelling concepts; Travelling theories",,2-s2.0-84984904191

This paper demonstrates a few initial footprints on the large “continent” of this type of neural time-series analysis, and discusses a few of the many further possibilities opened up by this new approach to “decoding” the neural code (Heller et al., 1995). © 2016 Werbos and Davis.","Alpha rhythm; Backpropagation; Bursts; Consciousness; Neural codes; Prefrontal cortex (PFC); Spike sorting; Synchronization","alpha rhythm; calculation; consciousness; finance; intelligence; learning; market; prediction; prefrontal cortex; spike; statistical model; theoretical model; time series analysis",2-s2.0-85007415713

Hence, the essential for an intelligent system to reflect the different issues and recognize an appropriate model between the different parameters is evident. In recent decades, rough set theory (RST) has been broadly applied in various fields such as medicine, business, education, engineering and multimedia. In this study, a hybrid intelligent system that combines rough set (RST) and bijective soft set theory (BISO) to build a robust classifier model is proposed. The aim of the hybrid system is to exploit the advantages of the constituent components while eliminating their limitations. The resulting approach is thus able to handle data inconsistency in datasets through rough sets, while obtaining high classification accuracy based on prediction using bijective soft sets. Toward estimating the performance of the hybrid rough-bijective soft set (RBISO)-based classification approach, six benchmark medical datasets (Wisconsin breast cancer, liver disorder, hepatitis, Pima Indian diabetes, echocardiogram data and thyroid gland) from the UCI repository of machine learning databases are utilized. Experimental results, based on evaluation in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, are compared with other well-known classification methods, and the proposed algorithm provides an effective method for medical data classification. © 2016 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Bijective soft set; Medical data classification; Rough set; Rough-bijective soft set","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Diseases; Hybrid systems; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Patient treatment; Set theory; Classification accuracy; Classification approach; Classification methods; Hybrid intelligent system; Machine-learning database; Medical data; Rough set theory (RST); Soft sets; Rough set theory",2-s2.0-84997755051

This article presents a novel approach to the hexagonal gridded maps, which integrates diverse information layers with adaptive zoom. These layers are complementary, providing different points of view over the same dataset and various levels of abstraction. Starting with a dot map, which portrays the impact of supermarket localization on customers choices, up to a choropleth map, which depicts population density in an adaptive form depending on the different granularities of administrative units. Ultimately, the presented visualization provides means to: (i) explore and analyze data regarding customer-supermarket relations; (ii) reveal the impact of supermarkets localization on customer preferences; (iii) suggest areas of low coverage by supermarkets.

In this paper, we propose a data and metadata model for Learning Analytics applications using data from LMS.

Our model considers the use of historical data from LMS treated under three perspectives that can be analyzed individually or correlated.

The manager’s managerial expertise is his private information and characterized as an uncertain variable. The revenue brought about by the project in the future is also assumed to be uncertain. In light of these challenges, this paper investigates the impacts of the manager’s risk attitude and the type-and-effort dependent outside option on the optimal compensation contracts under different information structures. Through developing the manager’s decision criterion based on his risk attitude instead of the expected-utility-maximization criterion, we find that, if the manager is conservative and the outside option’s revenue uncertainty is sufficiently high, the optimal commission rate will be distorted upwards under asymmetric managerial expertise information compared with that under symmetric managerial expertise information. Our analysis also confirms that the existence of a type-and-effort dependent outside option distorts up the compensation structure tailored at a fixed outside option. We further show that, comparing with the setting of a fixed outside option when the manager is aggressive, the presence of a type-and-effort dependent outside option results in a surprising phenomenon that the manager’s private information makes no distortion of the firm’s profit. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Compensation contracts; Information asymmetry; Outside option; Risk attitude; Uncertainty theory","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Compensation contract; Information asymmetry; Outside options; Risk attitude; Uncertainty theory; Managers",2-s2.0-84997554028

In such applications, use of cryptographic methods is very necessary. The two popularly used cryptographic methods are secret key cryptosystem and public key cryptosystem. Data encryption standard is the most popular secret key cryptosystem. Rivest–Shamir–Adleman algorithm is the most widely used public key cryptosystem. Secret key ciphers are faster than the public key ciphers. But security of public key ciphers is more than that of secret key ciphers. Simulation speed of Nth degree-truncated polynomial ring units (NTRU) is greater than that of Rivest–Shamir–Adleman algorithm. Also, NTRU requires smaller memory space. Therefore, in order to construct a very secure and high speed cryptosystem, it is required to optimize the NTRU cryptosystem with respect to simulation time. In this paper, NTRU is optimized using advanced optimization techniques, that is, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and ant colony optimization algorithm. Also, the complexity of NTRU and optimized NTRU using genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization, and PSO algorithms are calculated and compared.

The text-based CAPTCHAs offer users to recognize the distorted text from the challenged images. Having based on hard AI problem, they have emerged as a hot research topic in computer vision and machine learning. The contemporary text-based CAPTCHAs are based on the segmentation problem that involves their decomposition into sub-images of individual characters. This is a challenging task for current OCR programs which is not yet solved to a great extent. In this paper, we present a novel segmentation and recognition method which uses simple image processing techniques including thresholding, thinning and pixel count methods along with an artificial neural network for text-based CAPTCHAs. We attack the popular CCT (Crowded Characters Together) based CAPTCHAs and compare our results with other schemes. As overall, our system achieves an overall precision of 51.3, 27.1 and 53.2% for Taobao, MSN and eBay datasets with 1000,500 and 1000 CAPTCHAs respectively. The benefits of this research are twofold: by recognizing text-based CAPTCHAs, we not only explore the weaknesses in the current design but also find a way to segment and recognize the connected characters from images.

The vehicle for this change is implementing a Business Intelligence (BI) platform, which includes On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) Cubes, data visualization tools, and integrated data warehouse (DW). Extracting sensitive data (Personally Identifiable Information-PII, Personal Health Information-PHI) from operational databases, then saving them into a consolidated central repository to facilitate efficient analysis are the best solution. This solution demonstrates a good understanding of overall business operational performance and trends as well as improves the business processes through using statistical and data mining methods. Nonetheless, this huge data warehouse (DW) constitutes one of the most serious privacy breach threats that any healthcare organization might face when many internal users of different security levels have access to BI components. Data masking techniques are used to minimize the inadvertent disclosure risk of sensitive data as well as to preserve the basic quality of data analytics (data utility). However, the traditional masking methods fail to maintain the utility of data analysis for reporting and research purposes. In this paper a practical classification component for a built-in data masking framework (IMETU-Identify, Map, Execute, Test, and Utilize) is proposed and focuses on the first two modules. The analyzed health data attributes are based on the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD - Acute Inpatient in Canada). The proposed component is to identify the sensitive data, and select the best masking format to provide more data privacy and protection at rest (i.e., it can accurately be drilled down to a monthly aggregated level). This Module allows sensitive data attributes to be safely used and complies with the privacy regulatory requirements within the healthcare data warehouse by mapping them with the proper irreversible or reversible masking techniques. Native encryption techniques are avoided due to complex calculation and increase storage space. © 2016 IEEE.","Anonymization; Business Intelligence; Data Masking; Data Security and Privacy; Data Warehouse; Healthcare Data; Software Framework","Competitive intelligence; Computer programming; Cryptography; Data mining; Data privacy; Data visualization; Data warehouses; Digital storage; Health care; Information analysis; Mobile telecommunication systems; Anonymization; Business Intelligence platform; Data masking; Data security and privacy; On-line analytical processing; Personal health informations; Personally identifiable information; Software frameworks; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85006042013

New found interest in Machine Learning has made its usage ubiquitous. Its applications encompass a wide plethora of scenarios ranging from Business and Banking to Bioinformatics and Psychology. These problems are often characterized by imbalanced data, the presence of which often leads to inaccurate predictive models, since the distribution of testing data may differ from that of training data while learning, leading to misclassification of the response variable. The primary focus of the paper is on Credit Risk which is defined as the probability of defaulting on the loan or credit acquired from a banking or financial institution. The base risk is that of the loss of primary principal and interest, disruption of cash flows and increased collection costs. Loan Default is an uncommon phenomena, henceforth we obtain the imbalanced data.

Online Reviews play a very important role in this field and proving itself to be auspicious in terms of decision making from a customer's point of view. Even though these are very sensitive and significant information, ensuring the authenticity of user-generated content (Reviews, forums, blogs, discussion groups etc.) is erratically visible. That is why spamming, fake reviews and fabricated opinions are on the rise. Materially, it has become a profitable business which hampers the ingenuousness of the real fact. Several techniques have been introduced regarding this problem which depend mostly upon empirical conditions, rating consistency, obvious content features, and helpfulness voting etc. which confines the effectiveness of this undertaking. Most of the existing researches are supervised models whereas, good quality large-scale datasets are still very scarce and most of the models use pseudo fake reviews instead of real fake reviews. In this research, we introduce active learning approach to detect review spam using the TF-IDF features of the review content. Our model achieves phenomenal improvements in performance measures, working on almost 3600 reviews from different domains. In the best case, it achieves up to 88% accuracy and precision, recall and f-scores are above 85% in most cases. Additionally, about 2000 reviews were manually labeled during the process.

Since social network texts are usually short, learning tasks have to deal with a very high dimensional and sparse feature space, in which most features have low frequencies. As a result, extracting useful knowledge from such noisy data is a challenging task, that converts large-scale short-text learning tasks in social environments into one of the most relevant problems in machine learning and data mining. Feature selection is one of the most known and commonly used techniques for reducing the impact of the high dimensional feature space in text learning. A wide variety of feature selection techniques can be found in the literature applied to traditional, long-texts and document collections. However, short-texts coming from the social Web pose new challenges to this well-studied problem as texts’ shortness offers a limited context to extract enough statistical evidence about words relations (e.g. correlation), and instances usually arrive in continuous streams (e.g. Twitter timeline), so that the number of features and instances is unknown, among other problems.

Using the theory of swarm intelligence, a comprehensive model is presented setting forth the basic theoretical framework for both firms and fish, and identifying the analogous environmental factors and cultural values. It is posited that fish social behavior is dependent upon the work of consumption and energy involved in foraging. Comparatively, for organizational units the cultural values of task and risk orientations influence the development of social networks. Fuzzy set-based rules are used to conduct the analysis and it is found that the results for organizations and fish are similar with both risk and task orientations shown to affect social network behavior with an acceptable certainty of belief. Low risk to foraging and small need for consumption for fish do not send them from the safe haven reef. The fish self-organization which tends to follow collective behavior based on a looser rule system was more dominated by risk taking contributing to its social networking. Overall, the organization’s units responded to high risk taking as contributing to the social network behavior but also a high level of task orientation fostered social behavior.

The monitoring system is a great help to quickly gain insight of the system from all sides. By the monitoring system, the administrator can evaluate various metrics on the different fields in one single arranged page and understands the whole picture of current system status from brief reports. Although this kind of problem solving flow does well in certain circumstance, it may still be too late for some critical BSS. To further improve the speed of trouble-shooting, administrator sets the thresholds to each performance metric. Those thresholds are set based on knowledge and experience of administrator. If the performance metric collected from the system is over the set threshold, monitoring system will send alerts to administrator to inform current BSS status, and he can check the system status in advance before the situation get worse. This kind of traditional approach finds the problem about ten minutes before the emergency break out. In our work, we leverage a machine learning approach to determine emergency earlier.

However, requirements of such systems may change over time and the supporting static rule base may not be able to provide accurate interpolation results in the long run. Dynamic fuzzy rule interpolation (D-FRI) is one of the potential solutions for this problem, a such has been developed in the last few years to fulfil the requirements of dynamic and pertinent rule bases for intelligent systems. Nevertheless, applications of the proposed D-FRI approach need further investigation. One potential application is for network security that is one of the biggest concerns of any organisation irrespective of their size and nature of business. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are considered as one of the most popular and effective security tools for generating alerts to systems or network administrators to inform possible or existing threats. A standard IDS may not be very effective or even unsuitable for an organisational or individual's requirements. This paper presents an application of D-FRI for building an effective IDS. In this implementation, the most popular open source IDS, Snort is used and the resultant intelligent IDS is named D-FRI-Snort. Experimental analysis shows that the integration of D-FRI with the IDS Snort provides an additional level of intelligence to predict the level/sensitivity of possible threats. It also provides a dynamic rule base by promoting new rules based on the current network traffic conditions, which helps Snort to reduce both false positives and false negatives. © 2016 IEEE.","D-FRI; D-FRI-snort; FRI; IDS; IPS; Snort","Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; Interpolation; Intrusion detection; Mercury (metal); Dynamic fuzzy rules; Experimental analysis; False negatives; Fuzzy rule interpolation; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network traffic; Security tools; Snort; Network security",2-s2.0-85006747554

However, documentation of country experiences in the use of HRIS to improve strategic planning and management has been lacking. The purpose of this case presentation is to document for the first time Mozambique's novel approach to HRIS, sharing key success factors and contributing to the scant global knowledge base on HRIS. Case presentation: Core components of the system are a Government of Mozambique (GOM) registry covering all workers in the GOM payroll and a ""health extension"" which adds health-sector-specific data to the GOM registry. Separate databases for pre-service and in-service training are integrated through a business intelligence tool. The first aim of the HRIS was to identify the following: who and where are Mozambique's health workers? As of July 2015, 95 % of countrywide health workforce deployment information was populated in the HRIS, allowing the identification of health professionals' physical working location and their pay point. HRIS data are also used to quantify chronic issues affecting the Ministry of Health (MOH) health workforce. Examples include the following: HRIS information was used to examine the deployment of nurses trained in antiretroviral therapy (ART) vis-à-vis the health facilities where ART is being provided. Such results help the MOH align specialized skill sets with service provision. Conclusion: The Mozambican system is an important example of an HRIS built on a local platform with local staff. Notable models of strategic data use demonstrate that the system is empowering the MOH to improve health services delivery, health workforce allocation, and management. Combined with committed country leadership and ownership of the program, this suggests strong chances of sustainability and real impact on public health equity and quality. © 2016 The Author(s).","Data use; Deployment; Health workforce registry; HIV/AIDS; Human resources information system (HRIS); Retirement; Staffing","clinical competence; employment; government; health care cost; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care planning; health service; human; medical information system; Mozambique; personnel management; public sector; register; retirement; salary and fringe benefit; work; workplace; Clinical Competence; Delivery of Health Care; Employment; Government; Health Care Sector; Health Information Systems; Health Personnel; Health Resources; Health Services; Humans; Mozambique; Personnel Management; Public Sector; Registries; Retirement; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Work; Workplace",2-s2.0-84994361913

Software and hardware are now commodities leased on demand. Because computer systems leased from a cloud service provider, virtual machines, are typically connected to internet, they can host web services, which are frequently components of service oriented architectures (SOAs). Such architectures have recently been adopted in factory automation, as they allow systems to reach high levels of decentralization and loose-coupling. SOA-based Factory automation systems combine physical production equipment with web services that belong to the information processing (cyber) domain, and they are therefore highly cyber-physical. When some of the services are deployed on cloud resources, SOA-based factory automation systems can be classified cloud-based cyber-physical systems. Each service in such a system is typically able to perform rather simple, atomic operations, whereas achievement of complex goals requires that the services be composed to collaboratively carry out workflows. This article investigates the use of cloud resources in automatic service workflow composition. To facilitate the acquisition and utilization of cloud resources, a system of two specialized web services is proposed. The system includes a web service that dynamically deploys virtual machines to carry out planning processes, thereby exhibiting artificial intelligence. Finally, this paper demonstrates the integration of the system with a previously proposed semantic web service composition framework. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Cloud computing; Factory automation; Web services","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Cloud computing; Couplings; Distributed computer systems; Electronic trading; Embedded systems; Factory automation; Information services; Quality of service; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Websites; Cloud service providers; Computing resource; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Factory automation systems; Production equipments; Semantic web service compositions; Software and hardwares; Web service composition; Web services",2-s2.0-84994218554

Middleware systems solutions for IoT have been developed in both research and industrial environments to supply this need. However, decision analytics remain a critical challenge. In this work we present the Decision Support IoT Framework composed of COBASEN, an IoT search engine to address the research challenge regarding the discovery and selection of IoT devices when large number of devices with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available in IoT middleware systems, and DMS, a rule-based reasoner engine allowing to set up computational analytics on device data when it is still in motion, extracting valuable information from it for automated decision making. DMS uses Complex Event Processing to analyze and react over streaming data, allowing for example, to trigger an actuator when a specific error or condition appears in the stream.

This statistical data is beneficial if it can be used to obtain meaningful inferences from data-driven models. Analysis and visualization of such data has been a challenge and has become an imperative requirement for executive decision making. The challenge could be attributed to the fact that the set of features that an attribute is dependent on is subjective and data-dependent. Hence, there is a need to provide a pervasive and flexible data analytics framework that would allow this data to drive decision making.

This technology will permit billions of devices to interconnect over the Internet giving rise to an unprecedented number of new applications, services and business opportunities: from smart energy management to intelligent cities and intelligent transportation, from surveillance to eHealthcare and ambient environments. Technology in its bare form, as devices and equipment used by humans, will be pushed far in the background. The interaction of humans will be based on devices hidden in the environment (device physically ""disappearing) or devices that are not perceived as computational objects but rather through the changes, they create in terms of sound, movement, light, smell or taste. Today's devices, which can be characterized by a single type (mode) of interface, will be replaced by multi-modal interfaces that have the ability to simultaneously affect several of the seven human senses. This paradigm is defined as Ambient Intelligence (AmI). The Ambient Intelligence is a way to extend human capabilities and empower people by means of interactions with the new ambient environment. AmI has opened the way to new technologies and platforms and can be applied in numerous areas, but when specifically related to ""assisted living"" the term Ambient Assisted Living is adopted. This chapter focuses on introducing the M2M technology, the existing standards and challenges, and the role it can play in realizing the AAL paradigm, in the context of eHealthcare systems. Such systems are especially suitable for elderly people, who naturally have much reduced sensory or physical interaction abilities.

Therefore, the aim of the study is to examine post-adoption cognitive beliefs and factors influencing users’ intention to continue using BI systems. This study compares three theoretical models, namely, the Expectation-Confirmation Model of IS Continuance (ECM), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and a synthesized model combining ECM and TAM to examine which model can best explain users’ intentions to continue using BI systems. Survey data collected from 330 respondents in the Taiwanese electronics industry were examined using structural equation modeling.

The recent BAI (business analytics and business intelligence) systems have also supported the activities of analyzing the social networking issues on employees of companies and their work-sharing relationships, and have used the analyzed issues as a sort of organizational knowledge to deliver quantum improvements in decision-makings and organizational performances. Accordingly this paper focuses on a special type of social networking knowledge called “workflow-supported social network” that is formed through the deployments and operations of workflow and BPM (business process management) technologies on a workflow-supported organization. In this paper, we formalize a theoretical framework coping with discovery phase and analysis phase, and conceive a series of formalisms and algorithms for representing, discovering, and analyzing the workflow-supported social network. As a theoretical basis, it uses the conceptual methodology of information control nets that used to formally describe workflow procedures and business processes. The theoretical framework is expansively implemented in the name of a systematic framework that is able to automatically discover a workflow-supported social network from an XPDL-based workflow package, construct SocioMatrices from the discovered workflow-supported social network, analyze the SocioMatrices, and visualize the workload centrality measures of all the actors in the corresponding workflow-supported social network. In order to verify the correctnesses of all the discovery algorithms, analysis equations, and the implemented system, we carried out two operational examples. One is for the theoretical framework, the other is for the systematic framework. We applied the theoretical framework to an information control net model of the typical enterprise Hiring workflow procedure, and presented its analyzed results and visualizations. At the same time, by the implemented system we analyzed an XPDL-based workflow package fulfilled by 17 participants, which comprises two imaginary workflow models: Hiring workflow procedure and Presentation workflow procedure consisting of 17 activities and 7 activities, respectively. The analyzed outputs are presented via a series of the captured screen-snapshots produced from the system.

The motivation for this study is to examine the impact of BI system usage on organizational performance. This study develops a multidimensional measurement for assessing organizational performance, based on the balanced scorecard (BSC) approach developed by Kaplan and Norton. Data for the study were collected from 139 companies in the semiconductor industry in Taiwan and the relationships proposed in the framework were tested using Partial Least Squares method. The results indicate that higher levels of BI system usage will lead to improved financial performance indirectly through enhanced internal process, learning and growth and customer performance (non-financial performance). Moreover, higher levels of BI system usage can also lead to improved internal process, customer, and learning and growth performance in organizations. The results also show that internal process and customer performance have positive significant impact on financial performance. While learning and growth does not directly lead to the improvement of financial performance, it indirectly influences financial performance through the mediating effect of internal process performance. The findings of this study provide initial evidence that the adoption of BI systems leads to increased financial performance. The results indicate that these four BSC performance measures for BI system usage are interrelated, supporting the core premise of the BSC. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","balanced scorecard; business intelligence; non-financial performance; organizational performance; financial performance; semiconductor industry; Taiwan",,2-s2.0-84989260411

In the proposed methodology, first, ABC analyses using three different MCDM methods (i.e. simple-additive weighting, analytical hierarchy process, and VIKOR) are employed to determine the appropriate class for each of the inventory items. Following this, naïve Bayes, Bayesian network, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are implemented to predict classes of initially determined stock items. Finally, the detailed prediction performance metrics of algorithms for each method are determined. The comprehensive case study executed at a large-scale automotive company revealed that the best classification accuracy is achieved by SVMs. The results also revealed that Bayesian networks, SVMs and ANNs are all capable of successfully dealing with the unbalanced data problems associated with Pareto distribution, and each of these algorithms performed well against all examined measures, thus validating the fact that machine learning algorithms are highly applicable to inventory classification problems. Therefore, this study presents uniqueness in that it is the first and foremost of its kind to effectively combine MCDM methods with machine learning algorithms in multi-attribute inventory classification and is practically applicable in various inventory settings.

The importance of credit scoring has increased recently because of the financial crisis and increased capital requirements for banks. There are, however, only few studies that develop credit coring models for SME lending. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel, more accurate credit risk estimation approach for SMEs business lending. Based on traditional statistical methods and recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we proposed a hybrid model which combines the logistic regression approach and artificial neural networks (ANN). In order to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed hybrid model, we use the data of Finnish SMEs from the fiscal years 2004 to 2012. Our results suggest that the proposed ANN/logistic hybrid model is more accurate than either of the initial models ANN or logistic regression. This improvement in the accuracy of the credit scoring model decreases evaluation errors and has thereby many potential practical implications. First of all, a more accurate credit scoring model can result in better performance of the whole SME loan portfolio. Second, it can also result in lower capital requirements from the banks perspective and lower interest rates from the individual firm's perspective. Combined, these effects will enhance the banks competitiveness in the market for SME loans. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Organizations are urged to improve the quality of chemical products while minimizing the environmental impacts during production. In current practice, chemists and formulators have to determine both the ingredients to be used and the machine parameter settings during product development and production. Without appropriate operations strategies for managing sustainable consumption and production, a significant portion of the ingredients, toxic materials and pollutants are wasted or emitted during the trial-and-error processes when developing chemical products. In addition, inappropriate machine parameter settings, such as blending speed and blending temperature, result in inefficient energy use. Motivated by these issues, this paper describes a recursive operations strategy (ROS) model for achieving sustainable consumption and production in the chemical industry. The ROS model first identifies the business strategy, and then defines operations strategies by assessing the competitive priorities and policies with the use of artificial intelligence, including case-based reasoning and fuzzy logic, so as to manage the operations functions. The effectiveness of the model is verified by means of a case study. The results indicate that the model can provide direct guidelines for the users to develop products based on previously developed products. By so doing, the number of trials for testing various ingredient formulae can be reduced, minimizing the ingredient waste. The proposed model is also capable of achieving continuous improvement and determining the optimal production process conditions for avoiding unnecessary energy consumption. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Case-based reasoning; Fuzzy logic; Operations strategy; Product development; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable production","Accident prevention; Artificial intelligence; Blending; Case based reasoning; Chemical industry; Computer circuits; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fuzzy logic; Planning; Product development; Reconfigurable hardware; Sustainable development; Toxic materials; Blending temperature; Competitive priorities; Continuous improvements; Operations strategies; Recursive operations; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable production; Trial-and-error process; Chemical operations",2-s2.0-84992424413

There is limited research examining what facets of adult social competence predict parenting style. The present study contributes to the literature by examining the relationship between multiple facets of adult social competence and overall quality of parenting style as assessed by parents. Four-hundred parents completed self-report measures evaluating their parenting style and seven facets of their social competence including: emotional intelligence, assertion, conflict management, empathy, agency, communion, and social support. Stepwise regression was used to examine the additional contribution made to the prediction of parenting style quality after first accounting for parent and child sexes and ages, and frequency of child misbehavior. Results suggest that the aforementioned facets of social competence can account for approximately 25 % of the variance beyond control factors.

A knowledge-intensive process is influenced by user decision making and coupled with contextual data and knowledge production, and involves performing complex tasks in the ""physical"" real world to achieve a common goal. The physical world, however, is not entirely predictable, and knowledgeintensive processes must be robust to unexpected conditions and adaptable to unanticipated exceptions, recognizing that in real-world environments it is not adequate to assume that all possible recovery activities can be predefined for dealing with the exceptions that can ensue. To tackle this issue, in this paper we present SmartPM, a model and a prototype Process Management System featuring a set of techniques providing support for automated adaptation of knowledge-intensive processes at runtime. Such techniques are able to automatically adapt process instances when unanticipated exceptions occur, without explicitly defining policies to recover from exceptions and without the intervention of domain experts at runtime, aiming at reducing error-prone and costly manual ad-hoc changes, and thus at relieving users from complex adaptations tasks. To accomplish this, we make use of well-established techniques and frameworks from Artificial Intelligence, such as situation calculus, IndiGolog and classical planning. The approach, which is backed by a formal model, has been implemented and validated with a case study based on real knowledgeintensive processes coming from an emergency management domain. © 2016 ACM.","Classical planning; IndiGolog; Knowledge-intensive processes; Pervasive applications; Process adaptation; Process modeling and execution; Situation calculus","Artificial intelligence; Civil defense; Decision making; Disasters; Risk management; Classical planning; IndiGolog; Knowledge intensive process; Pervasive applications; Process adaptations; Process Modeling; Situation calculus; Calculations",2-s2.0-84995584212

We evaluated the system with both toddlers with ASD (n = 8) as well as typically developing infants (n = 8).

Using affective data and its label, the redundant codeword would be generated to correct signals noise and recover emotional label information.

At the same time, enterprise data warehouses (EDWs) continue to support critical business analytics. This has created the need for a new generation of a special federation between Hadoop-like big data platforms and EDWs, which we call the hybrid warehouse. There are many applications that require correlating data stored in HDFS with EDW data, such as the analysis that associates click logs stored in HDFS with the sales data stored in the database. All existing solutions reach out to HDFS and read the data into the EDW to perform the joins, assuming that the Hadoop side does not have efficient SQL support. In this article, we show that it is actually better to do most data processing on the HDFS side, provided that we can leverage a sophisticated execution engine for joins on the Hadoop side. We identify the best hybrid warehouse architecture by studying various algorithms to join database and HDFS tables. We utilize Bloom filters to minimize the data movement and exploit the massive parallelism in both systems to the fullest extent possible. We describe a new zigzag join algorithm and show that it is a robust join algorithm for hybrid warehouses that performs well in almost all cases.

In order to reduce the data redundancy and the communication load, in-network data aggregation is usually applied to merge the packets during the routing process. Aggregation protocols with deterministic routing pre-construct the stationary structure to perform data aggregation. However, the overhead of construction and maintenance always outweighs the benefits of data aggregation under dynamic scenarios. This paper proposes an Adaptive Data Aggregation protocol with Probabilistic Routing for the periodical data collection events. The main idea is to encourage the nodes to use an optimal routing structure for data aggregation with certain probability. The optimal routing structure is defined as a Multi-Objective Steiner Tree, which can be explored and exploited by the routing scheme based on the Ant Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithm hybrid approach. The probabilistic routing decision ensures the adaptability for some topology transformations. Moreover, by using the prediction model based on the sliding window for future arriving packets, the adaptive timing policy can reduce the transmission delay and can enhance the aggregation probability. Therefore, the packet transmission converges from both spatial and temporal aspects for the data aggregation. Finally, the theoretical analysis and the simulation results validate the feasibility and the high efficiency of the novel protocol when compared with other existing approaches. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony optimization; Data aggregation; Genetic algorithm; Wireless sensor networks","Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Network routing; Optimization; Structural optimization; Trees (mathematics); Communication load; Data aggregation; Deterministic routing; In-network data aggregation; Packet transmissions; Probabilistic routing; Topology transformation; Transmission delays; Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-84946762157

This paper reports on an international initiative to develop ‘materials experience’ as a formal subject of study, complementary to traditional technical and engineering approaches to materials and design education. General learning objectives for materials experience are established, followed by specific attention to three kinds of experience that arise during user–material–product interaction: gratification of senses, conveyance of meanings, and elicitation of emotions. For each of these kinds of experience, a specially devised active learning exercise is explained in detail. In combination, these exercises are argued to deliver a good foundation for student appreciation and action on designing for material experiences in product design.

These links were explored in a sample of 169 economically-disadvantaged kindergarteners (66 % male; 68 % African American, 22 % Hispanic, 10 % Caucasian) oversampled for elevated aggression. Physiological measures of emotional reactivity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA], heart rate [HR], and cardiac pre-ejection period [PEP]) were collected, and teachers and peers provided ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior, prosocial competence, and peer rejection. RSA withdrawal, HR reactivity, and PEP shortening (indicating increased arousal) were correlated with reduced prosocial competence, and RSA withdrawal and HR reactivity were correlated with elevated internalizing problems. HR reactivity was also correlated with elevated externalizing problems and peer rejection. Linear regressions controlling for age, sex, race, verbal proficiency, and resting physiology showed that HR reactivity explained unique variance in both teacher-rated prosocial competence and peer rejection, and contributed indirectly to these outcomes through pathways mediated by internalizing and externalizing problems. A trend also emerged for the unique contribution of PEP reactivity to peer-rated prosocial competence.

Novelty of this technique originates from using diagonally placed piezoelectric strip sensor and machine learning technology to provide a highly accurate and cost-effective alternative to current vehicle classification systems. Diagonal placements of the piezoelectric strip sensor ensure detection of passing vehicle tires by facilitating vehicle classification process. Presented technology is capable of accurately classifying vehicles into a relatively large number of classifications, including motorcycle, which has proven to be a challenging category in present-day commercial vehicle classifiers. Vehicle classification is a vital intelligent transportation systems application. Accurate data reporting aids suitable roadway design for safety and capacity and can also support other purposes, such as reporting highway congestion to the general public or providing area denseness data to interested businesses. To make a classification decision, a vehicle's signal is acquired from diagonal piezoelectric strip sensor, processed, and then applied to a machine learning algorithm. A speed estimation technique using the same single-element piezoelectric sensor was also developed, tested, and compared with an embedded vehicle classifier currently used by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation. Testing on several highway sites indicated up to 97% classification accuracy.
