Recently developed real-time monitoring methods are creating new opportunities for scientific and clinical advances. For instance, recent real-time monitoring studies of suicidal thoughts show that they typically are episodic, with quick onset and short duration. Many known risk factors that predict changes in suicidal thoughts over months/years (e.g. hopelessness) do not predict changes over hours/days — highlighting the gap in our abilities for short-term prediction. Current and future studies using newer streams of data from smartphone sensors (e.g. GPS) and wearables (e.g. heart rate) are further expanding knowledge and clinical possibilities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,2-s2.0-85026785766

As a result, a number of psychological models have been developed to better understand the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. One such model is the integrated motivational–volitional model, a tri-partite model of suicidal behavior, which posits that entrapment is central to the final common pathway to suicide. In this review, we summarize the extant research evidence for the relationship between entrapment and suicidal ideation and behavior. Although there is robust evidence for the relationship between entrapment and suicidal ideation and behavior, there are gaps in our knowledge.

The objective of the present paper is to propose an empirical application of this framework, with the aim of unravelling the constitutive ‘ingredients’ of energy-consuming practices. Therefore, we investigate whether discussing the relationship of people with their homes could help circumventing the methodological difficulties that inevitably arise when trying to approach less tangible (albeit crucial) elements such as norms and attached meanings. The empirical material comes from group conversations where participants discussed the extent to which a home has to be practical, comfortable and convivial in connection with a series of elements. The results confirm that this methodological setting generated useful insights for a finer understanding of energy-consuming practices and their underlying drivers. A related crucial finding is the role of key appliances – those with more contrasted use and attached meanings – which appear to mediate the interplay between comfort, conviviality, and practicality. A promising avenue for future research would thus be to further investigate the role of those key appliances as potential markers of wider tendencies in energy consumption and useful for designing segmentation strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption; Habits; Relationship with homes; Theories of practice",,2-s2.0-85031910369

The assumed structure consists of an initially bell-shaped doubly clamped microbeam with a rectangular cross section. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is assumed to model the nonlinear structural behavior of the bistable system under the combined effect of both the direct current (DC) actuating load and the shaking waves. Moreover, the structural model takes into account both geometric midplane stretching and electric actuation nonlinear terms. A multimode Galerkin-based decomposition is used to discretize the beam equations to extract a reduced-order model (ROM). The convergence of the ROM simulations are first verified and furthermore compared to published experimental data. A thorough ROM parametric study showed that the effect of increasing the shallow arch initial rise alter drastically the system behavior from undergoing a uninterrupted snap-through motion to a sudden snap-through instability. Moreover, the arch rise relationship with its shock spectrum response (SSR) is investigated and it was concluded that as increasing the rise value can cause the system to collapse under the combined DC and shock wave loadings if the shock wave duration is lower or near the system fundamental natural period. All the presented graphs in this investigation represent some robust numerical approaches and design tools to help MEMS designers in improving both the reliability and efficiency of these bistable-based microdevices under shaking dynamic environments.","doubly clamped; electrostatic; Galerkin decomposition; MEMS; shallow arch; shock spectrum response; shock wave","Arches; Continuum mechanics; Electromechanical devices; Electrostatics; Galerkin methods; MEMS; Shock waves; Structural analysis; Vibrations (mechanical); doubly clamped; Euler Bernoulli beam theory; Galerkin decomposition; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Nonlinear structural behavior; Rectangular cross-sections; Shallow arch; Shock spectrum; Beams and girders",2-s2.0-85032641023

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) can be activated under oxidative stress, which is the hallmark of parthanatos. Autophagy, which serves either a pro-survival or pro-death function, can also be stimulated by oxidative stress, but the role of autophagy and its relationship with parthanatos underlying this activation in the inner ear remains unknown. In this study, we established an oxidative stress model in vitro by glucose oxidase/glucose (GO/G), which could continuously generate low concentrations of H2O2 to mimic continuous exposure to H2O2 in physiological conditions, for investigation of oxidative stress-induced cell death mechanisms and the regulatory role of PARP-1 in this process. We observed that GO/G induced stria marginal cells (MCs) death via upregulation of PARP-1 expression, accumulation of polyADP-ribose (PAR) polymers, decline of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which all are biochemical features of parthanatos. PARP-1 knockdown rescued GO/G-induced MCs death, as well as abrogated downstream molecular events of PARP-1 activation. In addition, we demonstrated that GO/G stimulated autophagy and PARP-1 knockdown suppressed GO/G-induced autophagy in MCs. Interestingly, autophagy suppression by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) accelerated GO/G-induced parthanatos, indicating a pro-survival function of autophagy in GO/G-induced MCs death. Taken together, these data suggested that PARP-1 played dual roles by modulating parthanatos and autophagy in oxidative stress-induced MCs death, which may be considered as a promising therapeutic target for ameliorating oxidative stress-related hearing disorders. © 2017","Autophagy; Glucose oxidase; Marginal cells; Oxidative stress; PARP-1; Parthanatos",,2-s2.0-85031709537

Here, we examined the menthol-evoked Ca2+ signals in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. The effect of menthol (50–500 µM) was predicted to be mediated by the transient receptor potential ion channel melastatin subtype 8 (TRPM8). However, the intensity of menthol-evoked Ca2+ signals did not correlate with the expression levels of TRPM8 in breast and prostate cancer cells indicating a TRPM8-independent signaling pathway. Menthol-evoked Ca2+ signals were analyzed in detail in Du 145 prostate cancer cells, as well as in CRISPR/Cas9 TRPM8-knockout Du 145 cells. Menthol (500 µM) induced Ca2+ oscillations in both cell lines, thus independent of TRPM8, which were however dependent on the production of inositol trisphosphate. Results based on pharmacological tools point to an involvement of the purinergic pathway in menthol-evoked Ca2+ responses. Finally, menthol (50–500 µM) decreased cell viability and induced oxidative stress independently of the presence of TRPM8 channels, despite that temperature-evoked TRPM8-mediated inward currents were significantly decreased in TRPM8-knockout Du 145 cells compared to wild type Du 145 cells. © 2017 The Authors","Ca2+ oscillations; Menthol; Oxidative stress; Purinergic signaling; TRPM8",,2-s2.0-85032016798

The glucose meter includes a custom-built smartphone case that houses a permanent bare sensor strip, a stylus that is loaded with enzyme-carbon composite pellets, and sensor instrumentation circuits. A custom-designed Android-based software application was developed to enable easy and clear display of measured glucose concentration. A typical test involves the user loading the software, using the stylus to dispense an enzymatic pellet on top of the bare sensor strip affixed to the case, and then introducing the sample. The electronic module then acquires and wirelessly transmits the data to the application software to be displayed on the screen. The deployed pellet is then discarded to regain the fresh bare sensor surface. Such a unique working principle allows the system to overcome challenges faced by previously reported reusable sensors, such as enzyme degradation, leaching, and hysteresis effects. Studies reveal that the enzyme loaded in the pellets are stable for up to 8 months at ambient conditions, and generate reproducible sensor signals. The work illustrates the significance of the pellet-based sensing system towards realizing a reusable, point-of-care sensor that snugly fits around a smartphone and which does not face issues usually common to reusable sensors. The versatility of this system allows it to be easily modified to detect other analytes for application in a wide range of healthcare, environmental and defense domains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electrochemical biosensors; Glucometer; Glucose; Smartphone","Application programs; Carbon; Carbon carbon composites; Computer software reusability; Enzyme sensors; Enzymes; Glucose; mHealth; Pelletizing; Smartphones; Software testing; Ambient conditions; Carbon composite pellets; Electrochemical biosensor; Electrochemical glucose sensors; Electronic modules; Glucometer; Glucose concentration; Software applications; Glucose sensors",2-s2.0-85031930766

The proposed framework has been extensively evaluated using two public datasets (MAHNOB, DEAP) and a new dataset acquired with a mobile EEG sensor. The results confirm that EC algorithms can effectively support feature selection to identify the best EEG features and the best channels to maximize performance over a four-quadrant emotion classification problem.

However, little attention has been paid so far to quantifying the relationship between environment changes and their impact on our bodies in real-life settings. In this paper, we identify a data driven approach based on direct and continuous sensor data to assess the impact of the surrounding environment and physiological changes and emotion. We aim at investigating the potential of fusing on-body physiological signals, environmental sensory data and on-line self-report emotion measures in order to achieve the following objectives: (1) model the short term impact of the ambient environment on human body, (2) predict emotions based on-body sensors and environmental data. To achieve this, we have conducted a real-world study ‘in the wild’ with on-body and mobile sensors. Data was collected from participants walking around Nottingham city centre, in order to develop analytical and predictive models. Multiple regression, after allowing for possible confounders, showed a noticeable correlation between noise exposure and heart rate. Similarly, UV and environmental noise have been shown to have a noticeable effect on changes in ElectroDermal Activity (EDA). Air pressure demonstrated the greatest contribution towards the detected changes in body temperature and motion. Also, significant correlation was found between air pressure and heart rate.

Activity recognition provides core functionality to many types of systems including: Ambient Assisted Living, fitness trackers, behavior monitoring, security, and so on. The advent of wearable devices along with their diverse set of embedded sensors opens new opportunities for ubiquitous context sensing. Recently, wearable devices such as smartphones and smart-watches have been used for activity recognition and monitoring. Most of the previous works use inertial sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes) for activity recognition and combine them using an aggregation approach, i.e., extract features from each sensor and aggregate them to build the final classification model. This is not optimal since each sensor data source has its own statistical properties. In this work, we propose the use of a multi-view stacking method to fuse the data from heterogeneous types of sensors for activity recognition. Specifically, we used sound and accelerometer data collected with a smartphone and a wrist-band while performing home task activities. The proposed method is based on multi-view learning and stacked generalization, and consists of training a model for each of the sensor views and combining them with stacking.

Here, we believe that the contribution of different neighbors to their focal node is different, and then classify the neighbors of the focal node according to the removal order of the neighbor in the process of k-shell decomposition. By assigning different weights for each class of neighbors and summing up the neighbors’ contributions, the spreading capacity of the focal node can be accurately characterized. Through extensive simulation experiments over 9 real-world networks, the weight distribution of different types of neighbors has been optimized, and the results strongly indicate that the current algorithm has the higher ranking accuracy and differentiation extent when compared to other algorithms, such as degree centrality, k-shell decomposition method and mixed degree decomposition approach.

This work aims at developing a highly sensitive and low-cost light emitting diode (LED)-based epifluorescence sensor module for qPCR sensor development and relevant bioassay applications. Inspired by the light stop design and dark-field detection of microscopes, this paper first reports a compact confocal LED epifluorescence sensor using a light stop with an arc-shaped aperture for enhancing the flexibility of quick DNA and PCR detection. The sensor features the advantages of the dichroic mirror-free and confocal (shared-focus) characteristics, which benefits size reduction and minimal optics used. It also allows extension to integrate with in situ real-time PCR thermal cycling since the sample slide is placed apart from the epi-sensing module. The epifluorescence sensor can detect as low as sub-ng/μL standard DNA and 101 copies of Salmonella typhimurium InvA gene sequences (cloned in E. coli and after 30-cycle PCR) with SYBR® Green I from non-purified culture samples, having highly sensitive and specific signal responses comparable with that of a commercial qPCR instrument. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dark-field optics; Epifluorescence; Light-emitting diode (LED); Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR); Salmonella InvA gene","Bioassay; Chains; Cloning; DNA sequences; Escherichia coli; Genes; Light; Light emitting diodes; Salmonella; Dark field; Dichroic mirrors; Epifluorescences; Point of care diagnostic; Quantitative polymerase chain reaction; Salmonella typhimurium; Sensor development; Size reductions; Polymerase chain reaction",2-s2.0-85028386270

We explore the influence of the decision makers’ loss sensitivity and decision adjustment speed on the stability of the supply chain. It is found that when the retailer is not sensitive to the loss or adjusts decisions cautiously, the system can be stable. The single-retailer model is extended to a multi-retailer one to study the influence of competition on the system stability. The results show that the market share of each retailer does not affect the system stability when it is fixed. The decision of each retailer does not affect that of any other retailer and the system stability. We present two decision adjustment rules (“bounded rationality expectation (BRE)” and “adaptive exponential smoothing (AES)”) and compare their performances on the system stability, and find that the AES rule does not affect the system stability, while the BRE rule will make the system stability be sensitive to the retailers’ loss sensitivity and the decision adjustment speed.

However adults and children have different usage patterns. A major challenge with research on mobile phone use is the reliability of self-reported phone activity for accurate exposure assessment. We investigated the agreement between self-reported mobile phone use data and objective mobile operator traffic data in a subset of adolescents aged 11–12 years participating in the Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (SCAMP) cohort. We examined self-reported mobile phone use, including call frequency, cumulative call time duration and text messages sent among adolescents from SCAMP and matched these data with records provided by mobile network operators (n = 350). The extent of agreement between self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data use was evaluated using Cohen's weighted Kappa (ĸ) statistics. Sensitivity and specificity of self-reported low (< 1 call/day, ≤ 5 min of call/day or ≤ 5 text messages sent/day) and high (≥ 11 calls/day, > 30 min of call/day or ≥ 11 text messages sent /day) use were estimated. Agreement between self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data was highest for the duration spent talking on mobile phones per day on weekdays (38.9%) and weekends (29.4%) compared to frequency of calls and number of text messages sent. Adolescents overestimated their mobile phone use during weekends compared to weekdays. Analysis of agreement showed little difference overall between the sexes and socio-economic groups. Weighted kappa between self-reported and mobile operator traffic data for call frequency during weekdays was κ = 0.12, 95% CI 0.06–0.18. Of the three modes of mobile phone use measured in the questionnaire, call frequency was the most sensitive for low mobile phone users on weekdays and weekends (77.1, 95% CI: 69.3—83.7 and 72.0, 95% CI: 65.0–78.4, respectively). Specificity was moderate to high for high users with the highest for call frequency during weekdays (98.4, 95% CI: 96.4–99.5). Despite differential agreement between adolescents’ self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data, our findings demonstrate that self-reported usage adequately distinguishes between high and low use. The greater use of mobile smartphones over Wi-Fi networks by adolescents, as opposed to mobile phone networks, means operator data are not the gold standard for exposure assessment in this age group.

In this study, we used detailed cell phone location data, the call detail record (CDR), to account for the impact of spatiotemporal subject mobility on estimates of ambient air pollutant exposure. This approach was applied on a sample with 9886 unique simcard IDs in Shenzhen, China, on one mid-week day in October 2013. Hourly ambient concentrations of six chosen pollutants were simulated by the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model fused with observational data, and matched with detailed location data for these IDs. The results were compared with exposure estimates using home addresses to assess potential exposure misclassification errors. We found the misclassifications errors are likely to be substantial when home location alone is applied. The CDR based approach indicates that the home based approach tends to over-estimate exposures for subjects with higher exposure levels and under-estimate exposures for those with lower exposure levels. Our results show that the cell phone location based approach can be used to assess exposure misclassification error and has the potential for improving exposure estimates in air pollution epidemiology studies. Cell phone location-based exposure estimation has the potential for improving exposure estimates vs. home address-based approaches that are likely to have increased misclassification errors because it does not account for individual mobility. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Call detail record; Exposure estimation; Exposure misclassification; Health assessment",,2-s2.0-85032302053

Launchers can be designed to ease older adults' use of smartphones by addressing perceptual, cognitive, and motoric changes that might hinder their ability to operate smartphones. However, little research currently exists that analyses the characteristics and assesses the usability of launchers with an adapted user interface (UI) for older adults. Thus, we present a study in which we compared a set of commercialised smartphone launchers with an adapted UI and ATs for older adults by means of heuristic evaluation. The results showed that launchers generally integrate only basic features (i.e., calls, texting, contacts) and only one AT (i.e., an SOS service). Although considerable variation exists between them in terms of overall usability, we also report the limited adequacy of launcher UIs in meeting older adults' needs and abilities. In particular, usability problems linked to content and perception were discovered that limit the older adults’ capability for error recovery as well as visual, auditory, and haptic access to the information provided by the UI. Interestingly, launchers with a larger number of features and ATs were found to have, on average, less usability problems. This indicates that reducing the number of features is not necessarily a feasible way to increase usability. Instead, more research-based development is needed, which should better consider recommendations for the age-friendly design of UIs on smartphones. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Age-friendly design; Assistive technology; Heuristic evaluation; Launcher; Older adult; Smartphone","Smartphones; Usability engineering; User interfaces; Age-friendly; Assistive technology; Heuristic evaluation; Launcher; Older adults; Launching",2-s2.0-85032258419

The results showed 78.7% (n = 2347) never used a computer, 86.9% (n = 2587) had a cellphone, 32.7% (n = 207) owned an email account, and 85.4% (n = 544) owned a social media account. Less than half of the participants reported ever using ICTs for HIV management. Only 26.2% (n = 266) were willing to join a web-based HIV prevention program. Findings of this study suggest that there was an imbalance in the participants’ ICT device ownership and choices of media platform. Social media appeared to be a potential platform for health intervention among this group. There was a low penetration of computer use among rural participants and a large disparity between the urban and rural participants, which indicated a need to expand the current infrastructure related to ICTs and increase people's health literacy. Future research also needs to pay attention to security and trustworthiness of the intervention program to better promote ICTs as an efficient and reliable platform for HIV prevention and care. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer use; HIV prevention and care; ICT; PLHIV","Network security; Social networking (online); Computer use; Demographic characteristics; HIV prevention and care; Information and Communication Technologies; Information communication technology; Intervention programs; PLHIV; Questionnaire surveys; Surveys",2-s2.0-85029693548

These findings were replicated in Study 2, using a sample of 340 full-time employees from different companies in different industries in China. Further analyses showed that work schedule and location control mediated the moderating effect of work-home integration preference on the relationship between W_ICTs and emotional exhaustion.

The audio-MOOC should incorporate a learner-centric approach to provide effective learning capabilities to the oral and low-literate population. For long, audio-based learning (which includes variances in audio technologies) has been an established practice and has proved to be a successful means of conveying information to the mass especially for illiterate and semi-literate population. However, it is widely used as a supplement to Distance Education mode without exploiting its full potential. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive evaluation of existing audio learning systems which is missing in recent literature. There is no formal and established evaluation framework for evaluating such systems. Hence, this paper contributes to the audio-based learning research area by proposing a Technology, Organisation and Learner (TOL) evaluation model to analyse the existing audio learning systems. The proposed evaluation model uses a set of 50 criteria which is derived from a review of methodologies and strategies for multimedia evaluation. Besides, this work makes use of empirical data in the proposed TOL evaluation model to critically appraise various audio technologies used in learning. Recommendations are made for the development of full-fledge Audio-only Learning Management Systems/MOOCs.

The current paper bridges this gap through an exploration of upgrade intentions that incorporates the status quo bias (SQB) theory with Warshaw's purchase intention model (PIM). Data collected from 213 system users was analyzed using partial least squares (PLS). The results show that perceived need (positively) and inertia (negatively) influenced users’ behavioral intentions to upgrade to a new generation system. The indirect effects of inertia mediated the impact of incumbent system habit, procedural switching costs, and benefit loss costs on the behavioral intention to upgrade. In addition, perceived need mediated the impacts of procedural switching costs, benefit loss costs, and social norms on the behavioral intention to upgrade. Finally, inertia significantly weakened the positive relationship between perceived need and behavioral intention to upgrade. Based on these findings, this study proposed a theoretical framework of a technology upgrade model (TUM) and provided valuable information to both academics and practitioners that is highly pertinent to understanding IT upgrading behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Inertia; Perceived need; Purchase intention model (PIM); Status quo bias (SQB) theory; Technology upgrade model","Least squares approximations; Purchasing; Inertia; Perceived need; Purchase intention model; Status quo; Technology upgrade; Costs",2-s2.0-85029690626

Over the past few years, two approaches to the assessment of spatial-emotional interactions have emerged: the assessment of emotion using subjective self-reported measures and the exploration of objective physiological measures of emotional arousal using ambulatory sensing techniques. To date, most empirical research exploring spatial-emotional interactions has focused on the individual level. The present study is the first to systematically map the emotional characteristics of a large-scale urban environment using aggregative measures of emotion (subjective and objective). By mapping the subjective emotional experience of 144 individuals through real-time surveys administered through Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) as well as mapping an objective physiological measurement of emotional arousal (Skin Conductance Level) of 68 tourists, we were able to create ‘emotional maps’ of the city of Jerusalem.

While many studies collect EDA data in short, laboratory-based experiments, recent developments in wireless biosensing have enabled longer, ‘out-of-lab’ ambulatory studies to become more common [2]. Such ambulatory methods are beneficial in that they facilitate more longitudinal and environmentally diverse EDA data collection. However, they also introduce challenges for efficiently and accurately identifying discrete skin conductance responses (SCRs) and measurement artifacts, which complicate analyses of ambulatory EDA data. Therefore, interest in developing automated systems that facilitate analysis of EDA signals has increased in recent years. Ledalab is one such system that automatically identifies SCRs and is currently considered a gold standard in the field of ambulatory EDA recording. However, Ledalab, like other current systems, cannot distinguish between SCRs and artifacts. The present manuscript describes a novel technique to accurately and efficiently identify SCRs and artifacts using curve fitting and sparse recovery methods We show that our novel approach, when applied to expertly labeled EDA data, detected 69% of the total labeled SCRs in an EDA signal compared to 45% detection ability of Ledalab. Additionally, we demonstrate that our system can distinguish between artifact and SCR shapes with an accuracy of 74%. This work, along with our previous work [3], suggests that matching pursuit is a viable methodology to quickly and accurately identify SCRs in ambulatory collected EDA data, and that artifact shapes can be separated from SCR shapes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artifact detection; Electrodermal activity; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Skin conductance response; Sparse recovery","Automation; Curve fitting; Electrodes; Recovery; Signal analysis; Artifact detection; Electrodermal activity; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Skin conductance; Sparse recovery; Data acquisition",2-s2.0-85029397276

It is crucial to monitor the cardiovascular parameters reliably and conveniently. Non-contact measurement has been widely studied. However, there are some inevitable factors that limit the use of the platform and even lead to inaccuracy estimation. Hence, a novel non-contact method that estimates cardiovascular parameters under ambient light is proposed. The most suitable region of interest (ROI) is determined by a colormap, which is a map consists of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) peak amplitude of every pixel. Comparisons suggest that the region includes cheeks and nose is the most appropriate, followed by the forehead. To remove the motion artifacts caused by body movement, face detection and tracking algorithms are performed. Further, a multi-step signal process that combines independent component analysis (ICA) and wavelet de-noising is utilized to extract clean signal from the noise-corrupted raw waveform. Moreover, various distance between subject and camera and the change of ambient light intensity are considered, where statistics results reveal that this non-contact methodology is blind to these factors.

The cost, size, limited robustness of these DFMs limits their utility for non-laboratory settings. Most nanoparticle analyses use high-magnification DFM images, which are labor intensive to acquire and subject to operator bias. Low-magnification DFM image capture is faster, but is subject to background from surface artifacts and debris, although image processing can partially compensate for background signal. We thus mated an LED light source, a dark-field condenser and a 20× objective lens with a mobile phone camera to create an inexpensive, portable and robust DFM system suitable for use in non-laboratory conditions. This proof-of-concept mobile DFM device weighs less than 400 g and costs less than $2000, but analysis of images captured with this device reveal similar nanoparticle quantitation results to those acquired with a much larger and more expensive desktop DFMM system. Our results suggest that similar devices may be useful for quantification of stable, nanoparticle-based activity and quantitation assays in resource-limited areas where conventional assay approaches are not practical. © 2017","Dark field microscope; ImageJ; Immunoassay; Mobile phone; Nanoparticle","Assays; Cellular telephones; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Fourier optics; Image analysis; Image processing; Light emitting diodes; Light sources; Medical applications; Microscopes; Mobile phones; Nanoparticles; Telephone sets; Background signals; Biomedical applications; Dark field; High magnifications; ImageJ; Immunoassay; Laboratory conditions; Mobile phone cameras; Cellular telephone systems",2-s2.0-85027517976

We observe the phase transition of traffic load in the hybrid network when the packet generation rate goes from below and then above a critical value, which measures the network capacity of packets delivery. We obtain the optimal speed of moving nodes leading to the maximum network capacity.

A growing number of web-based and mobile software applications have appeared that aim to address various barriers with respect to access to care. Our objective was to review and summarize recent advancements in such interventions for caregivers of individuals with a SMI. Methods We conducted a systematic search for papers evaluating interactive mobile or web-based software (using no or only minimal support from a professional) specifically aimed at supporting informal caregivers. We also searched for those supporting patients with SMI so as to not to miss any which might include relatives. Results Out of a total of 1673 initial hits, we identified 11 articles reporting on 9 different mobile or web-based software programs. The main result is that none of those studies focused on caregivers, and the ones we identified using mobile or web-based applications were just for patients and not their relatives. Limitations Differentiating between online and offline available software might not always have been totally reliable, and we might have therefore missed some studies. Conclusions In summary, the studies provided evidence that remotely accessible interventions for patients with SMI are feasible and acceptable to patients. No such empirically evaluated program was available for informal caregivers such as relatives. Keeping in mind the influential role of those informal caregivers in the process of treatment and self-management, this is highly relevant for public health. Supporting informal caregivers can improve well-being of both caregivers and patients. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Apps; Caregivers; Mood disorders; Online; Serious mental illness; Support; Web-based interventions",,2-s2.0-85030663643

In this system, identification codes for the LED street lights are transmitted to camera-equipped vehicles through a visible light communication (VLC) channel. Given that the camera parameters are known, the positions of the vehicles are determined based on the geometric relationship between the coordinates of the LEDs in the images and their real world coordinates, which are obtained through the LED identification codes. The main contributions of the paper are twofold. First, the collinear arrangement of the LED street lights makes traditional camera-based positioning algorithms fail to determine the position of the vehicles. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to fuse data received from the two cameras attached to the vehicles in order to solve the collinearity problem of the LEDs. Second, the rolling shutter mechanism of the CMOS sensors combined with the movement of the vehicles creates image artifacts that may severely degrade the positioning accuracy. This paper also proposes a method to compensate for the rolling shutter artifact, and a high positioning accuracy can be achieved even when the vehicle is moving at high speeds. The performance of the proposed positioning system corresponding to different system parameters is examined by conducting Matlab simulations. Small-scale experiments are also conducted to study the performance of the proposed algorithm in real applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CMOS sensor; Positioning; Rolling shutter; Vehicle; Visible light communication","Cameras; CMOS integrated circuits; Codes (symbols); Light; Light emitting diodes; MATLAB; Vehicles; Visible light communication; CMOS sensors; Collinear arrangement; Geometric relationships; Positioning; Positioning algorithms; Rolling shutters; Small-scale experiment; Visible light communications (VLC); Vehicle to vehicle communications",2-s2.0-85029595659

Despite the physiological reasons, emotion contagion between peoples is pivotal to understand people's emotional changes. However, most existing works at the individual level focus on small groups in the short term. Because negative emotions are natural to appear and can largely affect the dynamics of emotion spreading, therefore this paper aims to investigate the negative emotion spreading mechanism at the individual level of large user groups in the long term, and finally infer individuals’ ability of the negative emotion spreading by observing people's behaviors on mobile social networking. Specifically, we first propose a novel metric for measuring individuals’ degree of negative emotion spreading. We then put forward a Graph-Coupled Hidden Markov Sentiment Model for modeling the propagation of infectious negative sentiment locally within a social network using data collected by mobile phones. In this model, we assume that one can infect others even if he/she is not infected, which is an extension of the traditional assumption in epidemic spreading. Because the proposed model involves parameters, to infer those parameters, Gibbs sampling method is employed. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world network datasets are carried out, and the efficacy of our proposed model is verified. The case study on real-world, as a potential application, demonstrates that the proposed model provides a useful insight for understanding the correlation between network structure and the emotion shift. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic social networks; Emotion contamination; Gibbs sampling; Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Cellular telephones; mHealth; Mobile phones; Statistics; Telephone sets; Dynamic social networks; Gibbs sampling; Gibbs sampling methods; Health informations; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Mobile-phone users; Negative sentiments; Real-world networks; Social networking (online)",2-s2.0-85018301222

Different trust and reputation systems have been proposed in literature to monitor participants’ behavior and to estimate their honesty. A trust mapping function is exploited to assign a score to each contribution which reflects its quality as perceived by the application server. Thus, the application server can aggregate the data more accurately.

However, there is hardly any one-handed use for actually touching the largerscreen, making one-handed operation (using the thumb operation) more difficult; in particular, users with short thumbs may suffer an uncomfortable experience in its use. The participants’ typing gestures were then observed when using their phones in a natural manner. Finally, the participants were asked use one thumb with extended, natural and bending gestures, respectively, to slide on a specified typing screen, and the sizes of these three sliding areas, named Stretch, Natural and OW, were measured to find the suitable typing area for different hand sizes. The results of this study found that the typing gestures could be classified into four types: One-Handed (15.6%), Two-Handed (68.8%), Hold & Tap, (6.3%) and Cradle (9.4%). Moreover, the Natural and OW areas for the larger and middle hands were both bigger than the one for the small hand, while there were no significant differences between the larger and middle hands. this indicated that the length of the thumb would affect the usability of the phone.

A CDPR posture is called twist-feasible if all the twists (point-velocity and angular-velocity combinations), within a given set, can be produced at the CDPR mobile platform, within given actuator speed limits. Two problems are solved in this paper: (1) determining the set of required cable winding speeds at the CDPR winches being given a prescribed set of required mobile platform twists; and (2) determining the set of available twists at the CDPR mobile platform from the available cable winding speeds at its winches. The solutions to both problems can be used to determine the twist feasibility of n-degree-of-freedom (DOF) CDPRs driven by m ≥ n cables.

First, the paper presents the architecture of the three-degree-of-freedom (three-DOF) manipulator and its corresponding kinematic equations. Then, the static workspace of the mechanism is determined analytically based on the simplification of the Jacobian matrix for a constant orientation of the mobile platform.

The use of system is suitable for continuous long-time monitoring, as a part of a diagnostic procedure or can achieve medical assistance of a chronic condition.

In existing PAKE protocols, it is assumed that short passwords are pre-shared between users. This assumption, however, would be impractical in certain applications. For instance, in the Internet of Things and Fog computing, billions of devices will be wirelessly connected. In practice, the devices are produced by different factories, and it is not practical to assume that these devices are pre-loaded with passwords when they leave factories. As a result, existing PAKE protocols cannot be directly employed in these applications. Moreover, it is investigated that devices can extract secrets using the wireless fading channel. However, the key extraction rate at the physical layer is slow. Motivated by these observations, this paper presents a variant of password authenticated key exchange (vPAKE) protocol without the password sharing assumption. To obtain the passwords, wireless devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops, are used to extract short secrets at the physical layer. Using the extracted secrets, users can establish a secret key at higher layers. The performance analysis shows that comparing with other PAKE protocols (which are proved secure in the standard model), the communication and computation consumptions of our protocol are significantly reduced. Additionally, the proposed protocol is proved secure in the standard model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fog computing; Higher layers; Internet of Things; Mobile devices; Password; Physical layer; Secret key","Fading channels; Internet of things; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Network layers; Higher layers; Password; Password authenticated key exchange protocols; Password-authenticated key exchange; Performance analysis; Physical layers; Secret key; Wireless fading channels; Authentication",2-s2.0-85016477377

A limitation of the program is that it only works on Missouri fields. The app is linked to the state agricultural weather station network which supplies daily standardized, short-crop evapotranspiration (ETo). For farmers outside the network, the cost of installing and maintaining appropriately maintained weather stations is cost prohibitive. A less costly option would be to install atmometers within the field of interest. The objective of this study was to compare ETo data from atmometers to electronic weather stations with traditional sensors. In 2015 and 2016, electronic atmometers were installed at three locations in Missouri. Atmometers were placed near electronic weather stations programmed to calculate daily ETo. Each atmometer ceramic cup was fitted with a disposable paper wafer and #30 diffusion canvas cover and wired to an event data logger to record daily ETo measurements. Regression analysis showed a close relationship between ETo measured with atmometers and weather station across locations and years (R2 = 0.74). However, ETo from atmometers averaged 15% lower than weather stations. Regional or localized calibration equations may be required before using ETo from atmometers in irrigation scheduling apps, but additional research is needed to determine if the observed differences impact recommended irrigation intervals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atmometer; ETgage; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation scheduling; Phone app; Weather station","Agriculture; Application programs; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Regression analysis; Scheduling; Telephone sets; Water supply; Weather information services; Atmometer; Calibration equations; Crop evapotranspiration; ETgage; Irrigation interval; Irrigation scheduling; Reference evapotranspiration; Weather stations; Meteorological instruments",2-s2.0-85032006045

In this chapter, a method to detect human eye blink patterns is proposed. Our system detects the user’s eye blink patterns in real time and responds with an action on a mobile device, such as the phone call, text message, and/or an alarm. In this chapter, several image processing techniques are used for detecting human eye blinks. To examine the state of the eyelid, whether it’s opened or closed, the eye state value is used by computing the minimum threshold. The system is able to track the blinking of the eyes efficiently and accurately from the video using the proposed method. This system is user-friendly and easy to operate. The experiment was performed under different conditions by changing the distance from the camera and light in the room. The experimental results showed that the overall detection rate for eye blink is 98%. The proposed method takes only 8 ms as the average execution time for each frame, which makes it work more efficiently in real time applications. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Android mobile control; Computer vision; Eye detection; Eye tracking; Face detection; Human computer interaction; Median blur filter",,2-s2.0-85032582377

This paper deals with walking detection by using the gyroscope of any commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphone, which can be placed at different positions of the user. Inspired by the fact that the walking activity often results in notable features in the frequency domain, we propose a novel algorithm based on fast Fourier transformation (FFT) to identify the walking activity of a user who may perform various activities and may hold the smartphone in different manners. A thorough experiment involving three testers and multiple activities is carried out and confirms that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing well-known counterparts. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Angular velocities; Fast Fourier transformation(FFT); Smartphone; Unconstrained; Walking detection","Angular velocity; Fast Fourier transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Gyroscopes; Inertial navigation systems; Smartphones; Commercial off-the shelves; Fast fourier transformation (FFT); Frequency domains; Inertial sensor; Mobile applications; Novel algorithm; Unconstrained; Walking activity; mHealth",2-s2.0-85031301322

The described system was created by reviewing related areas of research, capturing stakeholder's requirements, designing system components and then implementing within an actual EoL EEE processer. The research presented in this paper details user requirements, relevant to any EoL EEE processer, and provides information of the challenges and benefits of utilising CPSs systems within this domain. The system implemented allowed an EoL processer to attach passive Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags to cores (i.e. mobile phones and other IT assets) upon entry to the facility allowing monitoring and control of the core's refurbishment. The CPS deployed supported the processing and monitoring requirements of PAS 141:2011, a standard for the correct refurbishment of both used and waste EEE for reuse. The implemented system controls how an operator can process a core, informing them which process or processes should be followed based upon the quality of the core, the recorded results of previous testing and any repair efforts. The system provides Human-Computer Interfaces (HCIs) to aid the user in recording core and process information which is then used to make decisions on the additional processes required. This research has contributed to the knowledge of the advantages and challenges of CPS development, specifically within the EoL domain, and documents future research goals to aid EoL processing through more advanced decision support on a core's processes. © 2017 The Authors","Cyber-Physical System; EEE; Recycling; Refurbishment; Traceability; WEEE","Cyber Physical System; Decision support systems; Electronic equipment; Embedded systems; Human computer interaction; Oscillators (electronic); Processing; Quality control; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Recycling; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Electrical and electronic equipment; Human computer interfaces; Monitoring and control; Radio-frequency-identification tags (RFID); Refurbishment; Traceability; WEEE; Cellular telephone systems",2-s2.0-85031924018

In this work, local authentication and remote authentication are respectively designed for cloud assisted wearable devices. In the local authentication mode, hash based selective disclosure mechanism and Chebyshev chaotic map are jointly applied to achieve mutual authentication between a wearable device and a smart phone. In the remote authentication mode, Merkle hash tree based selective disclosure mechanism is designed to improve the structure of data fields in the certificate, and a yoking-proof is established to realize interactions between two wearable devices and a smart phone, and is further transmitted to the cloud server for simultaneous verification.

It is difficult to quickly immersed in a game, this makes the game makers spend a lot of methods and strategies on the background of the game, lead the players into the game. Traditional control methods including gesture and touch sometimes cannot help players very well, so sound control then plays a essential role in game control. As an interactive product that can give people different modality (such as nervous, happy and exciting), game must give people multiple sensory experience. There are 2 reasons for this. First, human’s sensory system can transmit all kinds of sensory. Any miss of sensory will make people aware the unnatural element around the atmosphere and then affect the immersion experience within the interaction of game. Second, to keep the game continuing, the basic requirement is to keep awaking state about player, and multiple sensory system stimulations can promote the awaking state of player. So even the game itself does not have sound, the customer needs and characteristics of game decide game will not stay on visual stimulation stage.

This study investigated the effects of texting on the walking patterns of healthy young adults while walking on a split-belt treadmill. Following full adaptation to the split-belt treadmill, thirteen healthy adults (23 ± 3 years) walked on a tied-belt and split-belt treadmill, both with and without a simultaneous texting task. Inertial-based movement monitors recorded spatiotemporal components of gait and stability. Measures of spatial and temporal gait symmetry were calculated to compare gait patterns between treadmill (tied-belt and split-belt) and between texting (absent or present) conditions. Typing speed and accuracy were recorded to monitor texting performance. Similar to previous research, the split-belt treadmill caused an alteration to both spatial and temporal aspects of gait, but not to time spent in dual support or stability. However, all participants successfully maintained balance while walking and were able to perform the texting task with no significant change to accuracy or speed on either treadmill. From this paradigm it is evident that when university students are challenged to text while walking on either a tied-belt or split-belt treadmill, without any other distraction, their gait is minimally affected and they are able to maintain texting performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dual-task; Gait; Split-belt treadmill; Texting",,2-s2.0-85031722030

Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; eHealth; Fog Computing; Internet of Things","Automation; Big data; Data handling; Ecology; Ecosystems; Fog; Health care; Information management; Intelligent buildings; Network architecture; Patient treatment; Smart city; Distributed environments; Early Warning System; Ehealth; Healthcare services; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-layer architectures; Population monitoring; Services and applications; Internet of things",2-s2.0-85020832978

A sensing task originator accomplishes its sensing data collection work by publishing them on crowdsensing platforms. All the platforms want to attract the task originator to use their services in order to make higher profit. Thus, the issue of competition arises. In this paper, we study the incentive mechanism based on pricing strategy for crowdsensing platforms. We formulate the competition among platforms as a dynamic non-cooperative game and use a multi-leader Stackelberg game model, where platforms are leaders and the task originator is the follower. In the real world, it is difficult for a platform to know the strategies of others. So we propose an iterative learning algorithm to compute its Nash equilibrium. The iterative learning algorithm is that each platform learns from its historic strategy and the originator’s response. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of our incentive mechanism. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Crowdsensing; Incentive mechanism; Nash equilibrium; Pricing strategy; Stackelberg game","Computation theory; Game theory; Iterative methods; Crowdsensing; Incentive mechanism; Nash equilibria; Pricing strategy; Stackelberg Games; Learning algorithms",2-s2.0-85031312219

The number of Android applications (apps) has seen a massive surge. Unsurprisingly, Android platform has also become the primary target of attackers. The management of the explosively expansive app markets has thus become an important issue. On the one hand, it requires effectively detecting malicious applications (malapps) in order to keep the malapps out of the app market. On the other hand, it needs to automatically categorize a big number of benign apps so as to ease the management, such as correcting an app's category falsely designated by the app developer. In this work, we propose a framework to effectively and efficiently manage a big app market in terms of detecting malapps and categorizing benign apps. We extract 11 types of static features from each app to characterize the behaviors of the app, and employ the ensemble of multiple classifiers, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF), to detect malapps and to categorize benign apps. An alarm will be triggered if an app is identified as malicious. Otherwise, the benign app will be identified as a specific category. We evaluate the framework on a large app set consisting of 107,327 benign apps as well as 8,701 malapps. The experimental results show that our method achieves the accuracy of 99.39% in the detection of malapps and achieves the best accuracy of 82.93% in the categorization of benign apps. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Android security; Classification; Ensemble learning; Intrusion detection; Malware detection; Static analysis","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Commerce; Decision trees; Intrusion detection; Malware; Nearest neighbor search; Static analysis; Support vector machines; Android applications; Android securities; Classification and regression tree; Ensemble learning; Ensemble of classifiers; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Malware detection; Multiple classifiers; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85011337840

In this paper a feasibility study is presented on a new monitoring concept in which an acoustic pattern classification algorithm running in a wireless sensor is used to automatically assign the measured sound level to different noise sources. A supervised noise source classifier is learned from a small amount of manually annotated recordings and the learned classifier is used to automatically detect the activity of target noise source in the presence of interfering noise sources. The sensor is based on an inexpensive credit-card-sized single-board computer with a microphone and associated electronics and wireless connectivity. The measurement results and the noise source information are transferred from the sensors scattered around the measurement site to a cloud service and a noise portal is used to visualise the measurements to users. The proposed noise monitoring concept was piloted on a rock crushing site. The system ran reliably over 50 days on site, during which it was able to recognise more than 90% of the noise sources correctly.

Overall, the process of building a HAR system starts with a feature extraction phase and then a classification model is trained. In the work of Siirtola et al. is proposed an intermediate clustering step to find the homogeneous groups of activities. For the recognition step, an instance is assigned to one of the groups and the final classification is performed inside that group. In this work we evaluate the clustering-based approach for activity classification proposed by Siirtola with two additional improvements: automatic selection of the number of groups and an instance reassignment procedure. In the original work, they evaluated their method using decision trees on a sports activities dataset. For our experiments, we evaluated seven different classification models on four public activity recognition datasets. Our results with 10-fold Cross Validation showed that the method proposed by Siirtola with our additional two improvements performed better in the majority of cases as compared to using the single classification model under consideration.

We rest on the edge computing paradigm where pushing processing and inference to the edge of the IoT network allows the complexity of analytics to be distributed into many smaller and more manageable pieces and to be physically located at the source of the contextual information it needs to work on. This enables a huge amount of rich contextual data to be processed in real time that would be prohibitively complex and costly to deliver on a traditional centralized cloud/back-end processing system. We propose a lightweight, distributed, predictive intelligence mechanism that supports communication efficient aggregation analytics within the edge network. Our idea is based on the capability of the edge nodes to perform sensing and locally determine (through prediction) whether to disseminate contextual data in the edge network or to locally re-construct undelivered contextual data in light of minimizing the required communication interaction at the expense of accurate analytics tasks. Based on this decision making, we eliminate data transfer at the edge of the network, thus saving network resources for sensing and receiving data, by exploiting the nature of the captured contextual data. We provide comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed mechanism over a real contextual dataset and show the benefits stemmed from its adoption in edge computing environments. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Aggregation analytics; Communication efficiency; Context prediction; Edge analytics; Predictive intelligence",,2-s2.0-85021651153

To address this gap in the literature, the case study empirically investigates a company that attempted to apply a pay-per-use model to sustainable transportation, based on its success in the telecommunications industry. Information collected from the interviews and from secondary external data is used to juxtapose between the industries. The Cambridge business model innovation process provides a framework to analyze the company's development stages. Results indicate that the company didn't succeed to bridge the design-implementation gap because it failed to acknowledge key marketing differences between industries. While cross-industry innovation offers entrepreneurial opportunities, organizations should consider the constraints imposed by the scale of investment required to build supportive infrastructure before emulating servitized business models. The study concludes with implications which may provide useful lessons to other sustainable transportation projects in-progress, such as Tesla and Riversimple, in terms of business model, technology, and prospects for commercialization.

In this study, we propose a method for unobtrusively detecting body movements during sleep by measuring changes in Wi-Fi signal strength between two Wi-Fi-enabled devices because prior research has found a correlation between sleep state and body movements such as rolling over. In our method, users place two Wi-Fi-enabled devices, on the left and right sides of their bed when sleeping. Our method then detects body movement by measuring changes in Wi-Fi signal strength between the two devices. By doing so, our method can detect motion without any sensors connected to the user, using devices that are equipped with commercially available Wi-Fi modules. The main feature of our method is its ability to train a user's body movement detection model on other users’ training data.

First we train the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to estimate the sentiment of microblog with traffic information, then using the emotional tendency to predict whether traffic jams happen or not. In order to reduce the data annotated by manpower, we propose a new idea to employ the Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) to generate samples which are as a supplement to the training set of GRU.

Drones-based monitoring is of great importance in variety of civilian domains, such as road safety, homeland security, and even environmental control. In its military aspect, efficiently detecting evading targets by a fleet of unmanned drones has an ever increasing impact on the ability of modern armies to engage in warfare.

Mapping and localization from a large set of planar markers is yet a scarcely treated problem in favour of keypoint-based approaches. However, while keypoint detectors are not robust to rapid motion, large changes in viewpoint, or significant changes in appearance, fiducial markers can be robustly detected under a wider range of conditions. This paper proposes a novel method to simultaneously solve the problems of mapping and localization from a set of squared planar markers. First, a quiver of pairwise relative marker poses is created, from which an initial pose graph is obtained. The pose graph may contain small pairwise pose errors, that when propagated, leads to large errors. Thus, we distribute the rotational and translational error along the basis cycles of the graph so as to obtain a corrected pose graph. Finally, we perform a global pose optimization by minimizing the reprojection errors of the planar markers in all observed frames.

However, few studies have assessed perceived parental permissibility of alcohol use (PPP) longitudinally across the later college years, and few have assessed variation in changes in PPP and whether or not these changes differentially predict drinking. This study assessed whether PPP changed across college and used two approaches to determine whether PPP predicted binge drinking frequency and peak drinking. Data on college students' daily lives and risk behaviors were collected from 687 students (51% female) in a large university in the Northeast United States over four years. Perceived parental permissibility of alcohol use increased from the last year of high school through the third year of college with males reporting significantly higher PPP by the third year of college. From 12th grade through the third year of college, between-person differences in mean PPP were positively associated with binge drinking frequency and peak drinking, and patterns of PPP change differentially predicted both drinking outcomes through fourth year. These findings suggest that PPP is a dynamic construct that may evidence important developmental changes across college and the transition to adulthood. More broadly, the results indicate that aspects of the parent-child relationship continue to change after high school and may be important as they are linked with college student risk behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","College drinking; Perceived parental permissibility of alcohol use; Transition to adulthood","adult; adulthood; binge drinking; child; child parent relation; college drinking; female; high school; human; major clinical study; male; United States",2-s2.0-85028732909

In this paper, a physical recycling method, grinding flotation, is creatively proposed for the separation and recovery of LiCoO2 and graphite from spent LIBs. According to the exploratory experiments, if the mixed electrode materials is ground in the hardgrove machine for 5 min before reverse flotation, the concentrate grade of LiCoO2 sinks and graphite floats can reach 97.13% and 73.56%, respectively. Moreover, with the help of advanced analytical technologies, the surface morphology, elemental chemical states and element distribution on the very surface of electrode particles before and after grinding were systematically analyzed to reveal the mechanism of dry surface modification. Results indicate that the mechanical grinding destroys the lamellar structure of graphite, exposing massive newborn hydrophobic surfaces. Meanwhile, the abrasion of organic film coating the LiCoO2 particles causes its original hydrophilic surface partially regained. Hence, the great wettability difference between LiCoO2 and graphite contributes to an excellent flotation separation. This grinding flotation method is a promising separation method without any toxic emissions or introducing other impurities in industrial application. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dry surface modification; Grinding flotation; Mechanical abrasion; Mixed electrode materials; Spent lithium-ion battery","Abrasion; Chemical analysis; Chemical modification; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Electronic Waste; Flotation; Graphite; Grinding (machining); Hydrophobicity; Industrial emissions; Ions; Lithium; Lithium compounds; Recycling; Separation; Surface chemistry; Surface treatment; Analytical technology; Dry surfaces; Electrode material; Flotation separation; Hydrophilic surfaces; Mechanical abrasion; Recycling technology; Spent lithium-ion batteries; Lithium-ion batteries",2-s2.0-85028359839

After an initial calibration with the reduced installation error, quaternion notation is used to represent three-dimensional orientation and an extend Kalman filter (EKF) is deployed to fuse different types of data. A clustering algorithm is proposed to accurately distinguish stance phases, during which integral error can be minimized using Zero Velocity Updates (ZVU) method.

The position estimation accuracy, stride length and foot angle estimation error are studied.

Akin to the methylene blue active substances (MBAS), liquid-phase extraction (LPE) is employed to extract the hydrophobic ion-pair of dye (ethyl violet)-AS to an organic phase (ethyl acetate). The colour (RGB) of the organic phase is read using a smartphone camera with the help of a reading kit. The value of RGB is carefully corrected and linked to the concentration of ASs with a standard deviation of <10% in the 10–1000 ppb (part per billion) range. In order to avoid the interference arising from inorganic anions (such as those found in tap water and groundwater), the water sample is pre-treated either by solid-phase extraction (SPE), which takes ∼30 min, or by dual liquid-phase extraction (dual-LPE, developed by us), which takes ∼5 min. In the latter case, the organic phase of the first LPE (equilibrium with water sample) is transferred and subjected to a second LPE (equilibrium with Milli-Q water) to remove any potential background interference. In the meantime, SPE can also pre-concentrate ASs at 100–1000 times (in volume) to benefit the sensitivity. Consequently, our smartphone app can detect PFOA spiked in tap/groundwater with an LOD of 10 ppb (∼12 nM, dual-LPE of ∼5 min), or 0.5 ppb (∼1.2 nM, SPE of ∼3 h), suggesting that it has the potential to succeed as a pre-screening tool for on-site application and in common laboratory tests. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dual-LPE; Fluoro-surfactant; On-site; PFOA; Pre-screening tool; Smartphone app",,2-s2.0-85031760133

Irrespective of prices, consumers have shown a higher preference for refurbished products from the OEMs and OEM-authorized TPRs than non-authorized TPRs. As a result, some OEMs choose to provide refurbishing authorization to TPRs who are required to meet specific standards and pay an authorization fee. Besides the strategy of refurbishing authorization, an OEM could choose strategies such as participating in direct refurbishing work or not at all. The main goal of this paper is to examine under what conditions the refurbishing authorization strategy is optimal for the OEM. The essential tradeoff is whether the indirect benefit from authorizing a TPR, which includes an enlarging market share, can outweigh the direct cannibalization effect of authorized refurbished products on new products sales. To that end, we develop Bertrand competition models between an OEM and a TPR using several strategies. Results show that when the consumers' preference for refurbished products relative to new products is not large enough, the OEM should choose the authorization strategy.

Within the experiments a decrease in battery voltage is monitored at different ambient temperature levels and discharge currents. Then, discharge courses are modelled and simulated using Wiener processes to obtain a set of time points when the battery voltage drops below a critical value. The first hitting time, i.e., a guaranteed period of an up-state with respect both to given operating conditions and critical threshold, is assessed by non-parametric methods, namely by the kernel density estimation.

Given this rapid growth, issues related to e-waste are a serious concern. Increasing amounts of e-waste pose detrimental effects to the environment and public health through improper recycling and disposal techniques. Such informal recycling practices are common in several developing countries, where recycling methods are rudimentary, and a significant proportion of e-waste components ends up in unsanitary (uncontrolled) landfill and open dump sites. To address these issues, this paper aims to introduce a systematic approach to e-waste management; a process termed integrated e-waste management (IEWM) is a theoretically viable technique in which municipal solid waste and e-waste management systems are managed. This is possible because both systems share common waste fractions and treatment and disposal technologies. Therefore, integrated e-waste management represents an advance in the controlled disposal of e-waste and improvements in local environments and public health in developing countries. This study employs a systematic approach that combines field trip work, systematic literature review, and quantitative data analysis to propose a solution that can bring benefits in the short, medium and long-term. The study proposes the hypothesis that an integrated approach can improve e-waste handling in developing countries by addressing region-specific issues simultaneously. This study considers the technical aspects of implementing an integrated approach and, by comparing these aspects against more traditional, widely practiced approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Developing countries; E-waste; Integrated thinking; Integrated waste management","Developing countries; Electronic equipment; Electronic Waste; Integrated control; Municipal solid waste; Oscillators (electronic); Public health; Recycling; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Wastes; Disposal techniques; Integrated approach; Integrated thinking; Integrated waste management; Systematic literature review; Treatment and disposal; Waste electrical and electronic equipment; Waste management systems; Waste management",2-s2.0-85031908478

Deposition monitoring networks in the United States generally avoid urban areas in order to capture regional patterns of N deposition, and studies measuring N deposition in cities usually include only one or two urban sites in an urban-rural comparison or as an anchor along an urban-to-rural gradient. Describing patterns and drivers of atmospheric N inputs is crucial for understanding the effects of N deposition; however, little is known about the variability and drivers of atmospheric N inputs or their effects on soil biogeochemistry within urban ecosystems. We measured rates of canopy throughfall N as a measure of atmospheric N inputs, as well as soil net N mineralization and nitrification, soil solution N, and soil respiration at 15 sites across the greater Boston, Massachusetts area. Rates of throughfall N are 8.70 ± 0.68 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1, vary 3.5-fold across sites, and are positively correlated with rates of local vehicle N emissions. Ammonium (NH4 +) composes 69.9 ± 2.2% of inorganic throughfall N inputs and is highest in late spring, suggesting a contribution from local fertilizer inputs. Soil solution NO3 − is positively correlated with throughfall NO3 − inputs. In contrast, soil solution NH4 +, net N mineralization, nitrification, and soil respiration are not correlated with rates of throughfall N inputs. Rather, these processes are correlated with soil properties such as soil organic matter. Our results demonstrate high variability in rates of urban throughfall N inputs, correlation of throughfall N inputs with local vehicle N emissions, and a decoupling of urban soil biogeochemistry and throughfall N inputs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric deposition; Nitrogen cycle; Soil nutrient cycling; Soil respiration; Urban biogeochemistry; Vehicle NOx and NH3 emissions","Atmospheric chemistry; Biogeochemistry; Deposition; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Meteorological problems; Mineralogy; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Rural areas; Soil moisture; Soils; Vehicles; Atmospheric depositions; Boston ,Massachusetts; Deposition monitoring networks; Nitrogen cycles; Pre-industrial levels; Soil biogeochemistry; Soil nutrient cycling; Soil respiration; Urban growth; ammonia; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric deposition; biogeochemistry; human activity; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen oxides; nutrient cycling; soil nutrient; soil respiration; urban area; Article; atmospheric deposition; biogeochemical cycling; canopy; concentration (parameters); exhaust gas; nitrification; nitrogen deposition; nitrogen mineralization; organic matter production; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil chemistry; soil respiration; spring; United States; urban area; Boston; Massachusetts; United States",2-s2.0-85026834243

The permittivity (εr) and quality factor (Q × f) value decreased with an increase in the x value, and the temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (τf) reached nearly zero. Raman and infrared reflection spectroscopy were employed to reveal the relationship between vibrational modes and microwave dielectric properties.

Among these factors, user preference usually affects user experience most. Moreover, previous work which took into account the other factors cannot generate adaptive partitioning results.

Combined with information multiplexing technology, wavelength multiplexed (or color multiplexed) FP imaging can be implemented by lighting up R/G/B LED units simultaneously. Furthermore, a HR image can be recovered at each wavelength from the multiplexed dataset. This enhances the efficiency of data acquisition. However, since the same dataset of intensity measurement is used to recover the HR image at each wavelength, the mean value in each channel would converge to the same value. In this paper, a color correction strategy embedded in the multiplexing FP scheme is demonstrated, which is termed as color corrected wavelength multiplexed Fourier ptychography (CWMFP).

VLC technology has emerged as an alternative solution to radio-frequency (RF) wireless systems, due to its various merits, e.g., ubiquity, power efficiency, no RF radiation, and security. With VLC, critical bio-medical signals, including electrocardiography (ECG), can be transmitted in places where RF radiation is restricted. This potential advantage of VLC could save more lives in emergency situations. A time hopping (TH) scheme is employed to transfer multiple medical-data streams in real time with a simple system design. Multiple data streams are transmitted using identical color LEDs and go into an optical detector. The received multiple data streams are demodulated and rearranged using a TH-based demodulator.

Physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) are key risk factors that can ameliorate the risk of metabolic disease among this population. However, PA is often seen as luxury and/or a secondary component within the management of people with affective disorders. Methods The current article provides a non-systematic best-evidence synthesis of the available literature, detailing a number of suggestions for the implementation of PA into clinical practice. Results Whilst the evidence is unequivocal for the efficacy of PA to prevent and manage metabolic disease in the general population, it is in its infancy in this patient group. Nonetheless, action must be taken now to ensure that PA and reducing SB are given a priority to prevent and manage metabolic diseases and improve wider health outcomes. PA should be treated as a vital sign and all people with affective disorders asked about their activity levels and if appropriate advised to increase this. There is a need for investment in qualified exercise specialists in clinical practice such as physiotherapists to undertake and oversee PA in practice. Behavioural strategies such as the self-determined theory should be employed to encourage adherence. Funding is required to develop the evidence base and elucidate the optimal intervention characteristics. Conclusion PA interventions should form an integral part of the multidisciplinary management of people with affective disorders and our article outlines the evidence and strategies to implement this in practice. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,"aerobic exercise; cardiometabolic risk; clinical practice; exercise; human; metabolic disorder; mood disorder; patient compliance; physical activity; physiotherapist; prevalence; priority journal; resistance training; Review; risk factor; sedentary lifestyle; teamwork",2-s2.0-84994234485

Quantifiable approaches to survivability analysis of such infrastructures are crucial. The objective of this paper is to propose a model for quantification of the survivability of a two-tier infrastructure-based wireless network subject to massive failures, caused by e.g. natural disasters, common mode hardware and software failures, and security attacks. We use a Markov modelling approach to analyze the transient behavior of the recovery phases of a two-tier infrastructure-based wireless network. In order to take location information of base stations into consideration, the spatial average network performance is estimated by means of a stochastic geometry based approach. In order to avoid state space explosion while addressing large networks, an approximate product-form analysis approach is also presented, where the two base stations tiers are decoupled such that their survivability analysis can be studied independently. The assumptions used in the proposed models, including Poisson point process and product-form decomposition, are validated on real data. Numerical experiments are also performed to investigate the approximation accuracy and computational efficiency of the product-form analysis approach, as well as to examine the effects of different parameters on the network's survivability.

In this study, we present a novel approach to uncovering urban functions by aggregating human activities inferred from mobile phone positioning and social media data. First, the homes and workplaces (of travelers) are estimated from mobile phone positioning data to annotate the activities conducted at these locations. The remaining activities (such as shopping, schooling, transportation, recreation and entertainment) are labeled using a hidden Markov model with social knowledge learned from social media check-in data over a lengthy period. By aggregating identified human activities, hourly urban functions are inferred, and the diurnal dynamics of those functions are revealed. An empirical analysis was conducted for the case of Shenzhen, China. The results indicate that the proposed approach can capture citywide dynamics of both human activities and urban functions. It also suggests that although many urban areas have been officially labeled with a single land-use type, they may provide different functions over time depending on the types and range of human activities. The study demonstrates that combining different data on human activities could yield an improved understanding of urban functions, which would benefit short-term urban decision-making and long-term urban policy making. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","data fusion; human activity; mobile phone position data; social media data; Urban function","data processing; empirical analysis; human activity; Markov chain; mobile phone; positioning system; social media; urban area; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",2-s2.0-85026554590

Many studies have introduced spatial networks into human mobility analyses at the collective level. However, these studies merely analyzed spatial network structure, and the underlying collective mobility patterns were not further discussed. In this paper, we propose a collective mobility discovery method based on community differences (CMDCD). We constructed spatial networks where nodes represent geographical entities and edge weights denote collective mobility intensity between geographical entities. The differences between communities detected from the networks constructed in different periods were then identified. Since collective spatial movement has a large influence on network structure, we can discover groups with different mobility patterns based on community differences. By applying the method to data usage detail records collected from the cellular networks in a city of China, we analyzed different collective mobility patterns between the Spring Festival vacation and workdays. The experimental results show that our method can solve these two problems of identifying community differences and discovering users with different mobility patterns simultaneously. Moreover, the CMDCD method is an integrated approach to discover groups whose mobility patterns have changed in different periods at the large spatial scale and the small spatial scale. The discovered collective mobility patterns can be used to guide urban planning, traffic forecasting, urban resource allocation, providing new insights into human mobility patterns and spatial interaction analyses. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community detection; data usage detail records; geographic information system; Human mobility patterns; spatial network",,2-s2.0-85028774845

Mobile phone data, also called CDR, are generated everytime phones are used and recorded by carriers at scale. CDR have generated groundbreaking insights in public health, official statistics, and logistics. However, the fact that most phones in developing countries are prepaid means that the data lacks key information about the user, including gender and other demographic variables. This precludes numerous uses of this data in social science and development economic research. It furthermore severely prevents the development of humanitarian applications such as the use of mobile phone data to target aid towards the most vulnerable groups during crisis. We developed a framework to extract more than 1400 features from standard mobile phone data and used them to predict useful individual characteristics and group estimates. We here present a systematic cross-country study of the applicability of machine learning for dataset augmentation at low cost. We validate our framework by showing how it can be used to reliably predict gender and other information for more than half a million people in two countries. We show how standard machine learning algorithms trained on only 10,000 users are sufficient to predict individual’s gender with an accuracy ranging from 74.3 to 88.4% in a developed country and from 74.5 to 79.7% in a developing country using only metadata. This is significantly higher than previous approaches and, once calibrated, gives highly accurate estimates of gender balance in groups. Performance suffers only marginally if we reduce the training size to 5,000, but significantly decreases in a smaller training set. We finally show that our indicators capture a large range of behavioral traits using factor analysis and that the framework can be used to predict other indicators of vulnerability such as age or socio-economic status.

LLR+ ranged from 1.3-4.2; LLR-ranged from 0.13-0.88; the treatment decision 'peri-wound debridement' was the only item with 'strong diagnostic evidence'. Inter-observer reliability kappa ranged from 0.09-0.71; test-retest reliability from 0.45-0.86; the treatment decision 'peri-wound debridement' was the only item with 'adequate agreement'. In conclusion, mobile phone images had low validity and reliability for remote assessment of diabetic foot ulcers and should not be used as a stand-alone diagnostic instrument. Clinicians who use mobile phone images in clinical practice should obtain as much additional information as possible when making treatment decisions based on these images, and be cautious of the low diagnostic accuracy. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85028309111

Published literature from PubMed and other databases were retrieved and screened, and 7 cross-sectional studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We found that the risk of headache was increased by 38% in MP user compared with non-MP user (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18-1.61, p < 0.001). Among MP users, the risk of headache was also increased in those who had longer daily call duration (2-15 min vs. <2 min: OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.34-1.98, p < 0.001; >15 min vs. <2 min: OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.76-3.54, p < 0.001) and higher daily call frequency (2-4 calls vs. <2 calls: OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.76, p < 0.001; >4 calls vs. <2 calls: OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.78-3.58, p < 0.001).

However, the true impact of Pokémon Go on people’s mobility patterns in a city is still largely unknown. In this paper, we perform a natural experiment using data from mobile phone networks to evaluate the effect of Pokémon Go on the pulse of a big city: Santiago, capital of Chile. We found significant effects of the game on the floating population of Santiago compared to movement prior to the game’s release in August 2016: in the following week, up to 13.8% more people spent time outside at certain times of the day, even if they do not seem to go out of their usual way. These effects were found by performing regressions using count models over the states of the cellphone network during each day under study. The models used controlled for land use, daily patterns, and points of interest in the city. Our results indicate that, on business days, there are more people on the street at commuting times, meaning that people did not change their daily routines but slightly adapted them to play the game. Conversely, on Saturday and Sunday night, people indeed went out to play, but favored places close to where they live. Even if the statistical effects of the game do not reflect the massive change in mobility behavior portrayed by the media, at least in terms of expanse, they do show how ‘the street’ may become a new place of leisure. This change should have an impact on long-term infrastructure investment by city officials, and on the drafting of public policies aimed at stimulating pedestrian traffic. © 2017, The Author(s).","call detail records; floating population; mobile phone data; Pokémon; urban informatics","Augmented reality; Cellular telephones; Economics; Investments; Land use; Mobile phones; Motor transportation; Telephone sets; Call detail records; Floating populations; Infrastructure investment; Location based games; Mobile phone datum; Mobile phone networks; Statistical effects; Urban Informatics; Population statistics",2-s2.0-85029741812

As a result, many social species compensate for weakened relationships by investing more heavily in them. Here we study how humans behave in similar situations, using data from mobile call detail records from a European country. For the less frequent contacts between pairs of communicating individuals we observe a logarithmic dependence of the duration of the succeeding call on the time gap with the previous call. We find that such behaviour is likely when the individuals in these dyadic pairs have the same gender and are in the same age bracket as well as being geographically distant.

Methods Preregistered systematic review of RCTs investigating internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) targeting adults with diagnosed depression. IMIs had to be compared with waitlist, attention placebo, other IMIs or other (face-to-face) therapies. A comprehensive search of primary studies was conducted. Study selection and data extraction was done by two independent researchers. Primary outcome was symptom severity of depression. Furthermore, treatment response, depression remission, treatment adherence, anxiety and quality of life were investigated. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted where possible, as well as pre-planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Results Database search resulted in 4858 references, of which 19 studies were eligible for inclusion and provided data on 29 IMIs. IMIs showed beneficial effects on depression severity when compared to waitlist conditions at the end of treatment (pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) g = −0.90, 95% CI −1.07 to −0.73, n = 10). The comparison between different IMIs did not result in any superiority or inferiority. All IMIs reduced depression symptoms from pre- to post-treatment (within group SMD range −2.24; −0.64, n = 29) and from pre-treatment to follow-up assessments (SMD range −3.07; −0.93, n = 27). Conclusion IMIs significantly reduce depression symptoms in adults with diagnosed depression at the end of treatment and at follow-up assessments when compared to waitlist conditions. These findings argue for IMIs to be recommended in depression treatment guidelines. © 2017","Depression; Internet; Meta-analysis; Review; Web-based","adult; anxiety; attention; clinical effectiveness; depression; disease severity; human; Internet; meta analysis; mobile phone; patient care; patient compliance; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); remission; Review; treatment response",2-s2.0-85023646022

Two of the channels are “smart” (technological) channels, comprising (i) where consumers shop using a computer and (ii) where consumers shop using a mobile phone. These two channels are compared with (iii) the traditional store channel. The paper explores the effect that consumers’ interactions with these channels has on their wellbeing, with a focus on individuals who perceive themselves as being socially excluded, for example, lacking access to goods, services and information. We make a connection between social exclusion and channel contribution to wellbeing for multiple channels, through the lens of the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The online survey findings (n = 1368) indicate that for each channel, there is a higher contribution to wellbeing for that channel for people who are more socially excluded. Social exclusion can have many underlying causes, but channel contributions to wellbeing remain for consumers suffering from financial stress and also those with mobility disability. For the mobile phone channel, the positive channel contributions to wellbeing are greater for younger than for older people.

The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that personality traits related to affect regulation would be associated with greater frequency of other tobacco product (OTP) use in a sample of young adult non-daily smokers. Methods Participants (n = 518, 51% male) aged 18–24 were non-daily cigarette smokers recruited from the community for a longitudinal study of tobacco use. Personality characteristics (impulsivity, anhedonia, and negative affectivity) were measured at baseline, and participants reported recent tobacco use at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months later. Assessments were conducted online or via mobile phone. Results Across the 4 assessments, 33–52% of participants reported recent OTP use, with frequency of use decreasing over time. Longitudinal negative binomial regression models indicated that greater sensation seeking and lack of premeditation were associated with more frequent OTP use (ps < 0.05). These effects were consistent over time. Conclusions Findings suggest that young adult non-daily cigarette smokers with greater propensity for immediately rewarding behaviors may use OTPs more frequently. Young, non-daily cigarette smokers with high levels of sensation seeking and/or lack of premeditation may be at increased risk for harms related to OTP use and may benefit from prevention and cessation strategies that specifically address affect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Affect regulation; Personality; Tobacco; Young adult","adult; affect; anhedonia; Article; human; impulsiveness; longitudinal study; male; mobile phone; personality; sensation seeking; smoking; time; tobacco use; young adult",2-s2.0-85023594041

Recent researches on mobile cloud computing mainly focus on the code partitioning and offloading techniques, assuming that mobile codes are offloaded to a prepared server. However, the context of a mobile device, such as locations, network conditions and available cloud resources, changes continuously as it moves throughout the day. And applications are also different in computation complexity and coupling degree. So it needs to dynamically select the appropriate cloud resources and offload mobile codes to them on demand, in order to offload in a more effective way. Supporting such capability is not easy for application developers due to (1) adaptability: mobile applications often face changes of runtime environments so that the adaptation on offloading is needed. (2) effectiveness: when the context of the mobile device changes, it needs to decide which cloud resource is used for offloading, and the reduced execution time must be greater than the network delay caused by offloading. This paper proposes a framework, which supports mobile applications with the context-aware computation offloading capability. First, a design pattern is proposed to enable an application to be computation offloaded on-demand. Second, an estimation model is presented to automatically select the cloud resource for offloading. Third, a framework at both client and server sides is implemented to support the design pattern and the estimation model. A thorough evaluation on two real-world applications is proposed, and the results show that our approach can help reduce execution time by 6–96% and power consumption by 60–96% for computation-intensive applications. © 2017, The Author(s).","Computation Offloading; Context-aware; Mobile Cloud Computing","Cloud computing; Codes (symbols); Electric power utilization; Green computing; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network function virtualization; Application developers; Battery power consumption; Computation complexity; Computation intensives; Computation offloading; Context-Aware; Mobile applications; Runtime environments; Mobile cloud computing",2-s2.0-85015846502

However, the flexible nature of the mobile device is a critical challenge for the mobile cloud computing environment. The mobile phone significantly degrades the data transfer performance when initiating the handover process. Thus, an energy-efficient handover process could improve the quality of service (QoS). Here, we introduce a secure energy-efficient and quality-of-service architecture (EEQoSA) for the handover process in the mobile cloud computing environment. The proposed architecture involves four layers: application, the Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IPMS), communication, and media with connectivity layers. These four layers collectively handle the energy-efficiency, security and QoS parameters. Existing service-oriented architectures designed for mobile cloud computing are based on the symmetric encryption cryptography to support different media services. However, this approach easily allows an adversary to expose the symmetric key and gain access to private data. Thus, our proposed architecture uses the secure and strong authentication (SSA) process at the IPMS layer by protecting the media services from unauthorized users, as the IPMS is the central layer that could be the entry point for an adversary. Furthermore, to extend the mobile lifetime during the handover process, an energy detection (ED) model is deployed at the communication layer to detect the energy level of the mobile device prior to the handover initialization process.

Online app markets, such as the Google Play Store, use a star-rating mechanism to quantify the user-perceived quality of mobile apps. Users may rate apps on a five point (star) scale where a five star-rating is the highest rating. Having considered the importance of a high star-rating to the success of an app, recent studies continue to explore the relationship between the app attributes, such as User Interface (UI) complexity, and the user-perceived quality. However, the user-perceived quality reflects the users’ experience using an app on a particular mobile device. Hence, the user-perceived quality of an app is not solely determined by app attributes. In this paper, we study the relation of both device attributes and app attributes with the user-perceived quality of Android apps from the Google Play Store. We study 20 device attributes, such as the CPU and the display size, and 13 app attributes, such as code size and UI complexity. Our study is based on data from 30 types of Android mobile devices and 280 Android apps. We use linear mixed effect models to identify the device attributes and app attributes with the strongest relationship with the user-perceived quality. We find that the code size has the strongest relationship with the user-perceived quality. However, some device attributes, such as the CPU, have stronger relationships with the user-perceived quality than some app attributes, such as the number of UI inputs and outputs of an app. Our work helps both device manufacturers and app developers. Manufacturers can focus on the attributes that have significant relationships with the user-perceived quality. Moreover, app developers should be careful about the devices for which they make their apps available because the device attributes have a strong relationship with the ratings that users give to apps. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Device attributes; Mobile applications; Software attributes; User-perceived quality","Application programs; Display devices; Manufacture; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Rating; Stars; User interfaces; Android apps; Device attributes; Display size; Google plays; Mixed-effect models; Mobile applications; Perceived quality; Star ratings; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85014955102

Among mobile advertising applications, barcodes are becoming a very powerful mobile commerce tool. By capturing a barcode with a camera scanner, people can easily access a wealth of information online. Barcodes have thus converted hard copies of newspapers, wallpapers, and magazines into crucial platforms for mobile commerce. However, although barcodes are frequently used for embedding information in printed matter, they have unsightly overt patterns. Concealing data in visually meaningful image barcodes (such as trademarks) instead of using extra barcode areas has the advantage of increasing the added value of using conventional barcode patterns, and thus, it is desirable for future mobile advertising. This paper presents a novel data-hiding method for halftone images. Without obeying the barcode format, we treat the image itself as an entire carrier to embed data. Hence, data-hiding and halftoning algorithms are integrated into our method to against the extreme bi-level quantization in the printing process. © 2017, The Author(s).","Data-hiding; Halftoning; Image barcode; Mobile advertising","Bar codes; Commerce; Data visualization; Marketing; Steganography; Data hiding; Embedding information; Halftoning; Halftoning algorithms; Level quantization; Mobile advertising; Potential customers; Wealth of information; Mobile commerce",2-s2.0-85010952031

This paper examines consumer behavior responses while using a mobile instant messaging (MIM) channel adopted by a Chinese pure-play retailer. MIM is text-based, mobile computer-mediated communication technology accomplishing real-time interaction with other users. WeChat, a full service MIM application, contains functional and social features including SMS, LBS, voice message, video calls and “Moments” sharing, which is its social propagating feature. There is a paucity of literature on the role of MIM in building relationships and the relevance of emotion and WOM for consumers engaging in MIM interactions. The model was derived from prior research on Stimuli-Organism-Response (SOR) that depicts the effects of environmental/informational stimuli on consumers' responses. Research objectives included investigating the prediction that environmental stimuli comprising socialness perception, media richness, and involvement induce a positive emotional state, which results in positive WOM. The study employed a quantitative approach. The sample comprised young Chinese WeChat users (n = 486). SEM was used to analyse the data. Prior research has indicated that building relationships with consumers is more difficult when the relationships are consumer-computer as compared to consumer-person. The findings of this study suggest that such a negative effect can be alleviated by the use of MIM. This study is original in integrating socialness perception, media richness and WOM into the SOR framework. The implications for practitioners are discussed, including retailers' need to be aware of the extent to which consumers are willing to engage with MIM applications. © 2017","Involvement; Media richness; Mobile instant messaging (MIM); Socialness perception; WeChat; Word-of-mouth (WOM)","Behavioral research; Message passing; Sales; Ubiquitous computing; Instant messaging; Involvement; Media richness; WeChat; Word of mouth; Consumer behavior; adult; consumer attitude; controlled study; emotion; empiricism; human; major clinical study; perception; physician; prediction; stimulus; transcription initiation; videorecording; voice",2-s2.0-85029172410

Through 48 automatic stations, the SIAM provides data about temperature, wind speed, solar radiation or humidity, on a not very user-friendly web page which is not adapted to mobile devices and shows some shortcomings in downloading data. In addition, the key reference parameter in irrigation, the daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo), is not provided on the current day and the hourly ETo and the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) are not offered either. This paper presents a new software application for mobile devices capable of providing the required data by an easy-to-use and friendly app. This tool employs the GPS co-ordinates of a place under study to get the data required from the closest SIAM stations and interpolates station data to increase accuracy. The hourly and daily ETo are automatically calculated using the Penman–Monteith equation, declared by the FAO in 1990 as the only valid method for calculating evapotranspiration. The ETo computation entails the calculation of the net solar radiation, the heat soil flux or the psychometric constant. A new extension of the tool also allows calculation of the ETc for a set of typical crops of the southeast of Spain.

We found that making the mobile money service usable for the drivers took considerable work and was largely achieved because it was embedded in the wider, trusted, loan payment ecosystem. Although Airtel Money promises anytime, anywhere payments, payment remains time and place bound for the drivers. It is tempting to take a transactional approach to payments, and indeed we initially approached the problem of enabling frequent payments as one of payment mechanism. However, in practice payments are embedded in sets of social relations and a socio-technical ecosystem.

In addition to quantifying smartphone ownership, the survey also tracked whether youth would integrate their previously-established safety plan with a specific safety planning application on their smartphone (Be Safe) at the time of discharge. Results: Sixty-six percent (50/76) of discharged youth owned a smartphone, which is consistent with prior reports of high smartphone ownership in adult psychiatric populations. A minority of youth (18%) downloaded the Be Safe app prior to discharge, with most (68%) suggesting they would download the app after discharge. Notably, all patients who downloaded the app prior to discharge were on their first admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit. Conclusion: Child and adolescent psychiatric inpatients have a clear interest in smartphone-based safety planning. Our results suggest that integrating smartphone-related interventions earlier in an admission might improve access before discharge. This highlights the tension between restricting and incorporating smartphone access for child and adolescent inpatients and may inform future study in this area. © 2016, Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

Here, we introduce a new method—activity correlation spectroscopy—for inferring relationships by exploiting the spectral and distributional structure of activity correlation within dyads. Unlike existing techniques, our approach can be employed with minimal, individual-level (i.e., non-relational), and non-identifying data that are easily collected using commodity hardware.

From a survey of 528 consumers, we ran two structural equation models: model #1 is a base model of direct effects of attitudes and satisfaction on continuance intention; model #2 adds habit as a mediator variable. We show that consumer attitudes are stronger predictors of continuance intention, without mediation effects from habit. Consumer satisfaction only weakly predicts continuance intention and is mediated by habit. While satisfaction is correlated with consumer attitude, and satisfaction is correlated with habit, consumer attitudes seem unrelated to any habits. Attitude seems to be the strongest determinant of continuance intention; second, in the absence of compelling rational data, or given beliefs that competitors are largely undifferentiated, consumers might continue using the same product. Such complex interactions between variables may not be adequately captured in a straightforward variance model, however this study extends research in habit and continuance intention and provides for future research exploring the importance of habit over satisfaction and predominance of consumer attitudes in predicting continuance intention. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Continuance intention; Emotions; Habit; Mobile applications; Satisfaction","Computer networks; Information management; Attitude; Continuance intentions; Emotions; Habit; Mobile applications; Satisfaction; Digital storage",2-s2.0-85021937022

The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is independent of the accumulative error, but the positioning accuracy is suffered by the irregular jump error resulted from the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) jitter. Considering the requirement of accurate, seamless, and consecutive positioning by the existing commercial systems, we propose a new integrated BLE and MEMS Wireless (BMW) system for multi-floor positioning. In concrete terms, first of all, the way of fingerprint database construction with the reduced workload is introduced. Second, the fingerprint database is denoised by the process of affinity propagation clustering, outlier detection, and RSSI filtering. Third, the robust M estimation-based extended Kalman filter is applied to estimate the two-dimensional coordinates of the target on each floor. Finally, the barometer data are used to calculate the height of the target. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed system can not only restrain the accumulative error caused by the MEMS sensors but also eliminate the irregular jump error from the BLE RSSI jitter. In an actual multi-floor environment, the proposed system is verified to be able to achieve the Root Mean Square (RMS) positioning error within 1 m. © 2017, The Author(s).","BLE; Data fusion; MEMS; Multi-floor positioning; Robust M estimation","Data fusion; Errors; Floors; Image enhancement; Jitter; Kalman filters; Mobile computing; Software design; Affinity propagation clustering; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Hardware and software designs; M-estimation; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Multi-floor positioning; Positioning accuracy; Received signal strength indicators; MEMS",2-s2.0-85027726932

The Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) was designed as an assessment tool to evaluate BR domains comprehensively. In the context of a trial evaluating a smartphone application delivering personalized psychoeducational contents for BD (SIMPLe 1.0), the main aim of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of SIMPLe 1.0 in BR regulation using the BRIAN scale. Methods 51 remitted BD patients were asked to use the application for 3 months. Paired t-test analyses were employed to compare baseline and follow-up BRIAN´s total and domains scores. The sample was divided into completers and non-completers of the study to evaluate differences between groups regarding BRIAN scores using ANCOVA analyses. Results The BRIAN's mean total score of the whole sample significantly decreased from baseline to post-intervention (35.89 (SD 6.64) vs. 31.18 (SD 6.33), t = 4.29, p = 0.001). At post-intervention, there was a significant difference between groups regarding the total BRIAN mean score (29.47 (SD 6.21) completers vs. 35.92 (SD 3.90) non-completers, t = 2.50, p = 0.02). This difference was maintained after conducting a one-way ANCOVA controlling for pre-intervention BRIAN scores, F (1, 46) = 10.545, p=0.002. Limitations A limited sample, pre-post measures, and a short study timeframe could have affected the results. Additional factors affecting BR, such as medication, could not be ruled out.

Methods Thirty-two participants downloaded and used the app for 28 consecutive days (4 weeks). At the end of this period, they all answered an online questionnaire and ten of them were interviewed. Usability, feasibility, message receptivity, and perceived impact of the app were assessed. Results Compliance with cancer prevention guidelines was lower than expected. Happy was considered simple, intuitive and easy to use. Messages sent by the app were considered easy to understand, providing good advice and meaningful information that catch reader's attention. Participants also considered that Happy might be an effective way to promote cancer prevention. Collected data showed an increased frequency in several cancer prevention related behaviours and an increase in the overall putative cancer prevention level. Conclusions This study showed the viability of designing and implementing smartphone-based interventions to promote cancer prevention behaviours.

Delivering CT remotely via tablets may increase accessibility, improve scheduling flexibility, and diminish patient burden. Methods In this reanalysis of data from a larger trial of CT, we compared two samples of individuals with SZ who chose to complete 40 h of CT either on desktop computers in the laboratory (N = 33) or remotely via iPads (N = 41). We examined attrition rates and adherence to training, and investigated whether remote iPad-based CT and in-person desktop-based CT induced significantly different improvements in cognitive and real-world functioning. Results The attrition rate was 36.6%. On average, participants completed 3.06 h of CT per week. There were no significant between-group differences in attrition and adherence to CT requirements. Participants who completed iPad-based CT were significantly younger and had lower symptoms at baseline compared to participants who completed CT on the lab desktops. Controlling for age and symptom severity, rANCOVA showed that iPad-based and desktop-based CT similarly and significantly improved verbal learning and problem solving. Main effects of time, at trend level significance, were evident in global cognition, verbal memory, quality of life, and social functioning. All group by time interactions were non-significant except for verbal memory, where iPad users showed greater gains. Within-group effect sizes for changes in outcomes were in the small range. Conclusion Although underpowered and not randomized, this study demonstrates that delivering CT remotely to people with SZ using tablets is feasible and results in retention rates, adherence, and cognitive and functional outcome improvements that are comparable to those observed when CT is delivered in the laboratory. This has important implications in terms of scalability and dissemination of CT.

We find that the nocturnal resting period is strongly influenced by the length of daylight, and that its seasonal variation depends on the latitude, such that for people living in two different cities separated by eight latitudinal degrees, the difference in the resting periods of people between the summer and winter in southern cities is almost twice that in the northern cities.

A research frontier is hence emerging which involves exploring the type of measures that can be drawn from data stores such as mobile phone logs, Internet searches and contributions to social media platforms and the extent to which these measures are accurate reflections of the wider population. This paper contributes to this research frontier, by exploring the extent to which local commuting patterns can be estimated from data drawn from Twitter. It makes three contributions in particular. First, it shows that heuristics applied to geolocated Twitter data offer a good proxy for local commuting patterns; one which outperforms the current best method for estimating these patterns (the radiation model). This finding is of particular significance because we make use of relatively coarse geolocation data (at the city level) and use simple heuristics based on frequency counts. Second, it investigates sources of error in the proxy measure, showing that the model performs better on short trips with higher volumes of commuters; it also looks at demographic biases but finds that, surprisingly, measurements are not significantly affected by the fact that the demographic makeup of Twitter users differs significantly from the population as a whole. Finally, it looks at potential ways of going beyond simple frequency heuristics by incorporating temporal information into models. © 2017, The Author(s).","geolocation; mobility; social media; transport","Carrier mobility; Digital devices; Heuristic methods; Search engines; Social networking (online); Geolocations; Radiation modeling; Research frontiers; Social media; Social media platforms; Temporal information; Transactional data; transport; Population statistics",2-s2.0-85030454223

We study the drivers of its geographical distribution in Senegal via a spatially explicit network model accounting for epidemiological dynamics driven by local socioeconomic and environmental conditions, and human mobility. The model is parameterized by tapping several available geodatabases and a large dataset of mobile phone traces. It reliably reproduces the observed spatial patterns of regional schistosomiasis prevalence throughout the country, provided that spatial heterogeneity and human mobility are suitably accounted for. Specifically, a fine-grained description of the socioeconomic and environmental heterogeneities involved in local disease transmission is crucial to capturing the spatial variability of disease prevalence, while the inclusion of human mobility significantly improves the explanatory power of the model. Concerning human movement, we find that moderate mobility may reduce disease prevalence, whereas either high or low mobility may result in increased prevalence of infection.

Instead, a feasible solution is to extract and compress features from videos and then transmit the compact features to the cloud. Meanwhile, many recent studies also indicate that the features extracted from the deep convolutional neural networks will lead to high performance for various analysis and recognition tasks. However, how to compress video deep features meanwhile maintaining the analysis or retrieval performance still remains open. To address this problem, we propose a high-efficiency deep feature coding (DFC) framework in this paper. In the DFC framework, we define three types of features in a group-of-features (GOFs) according to their coding modes (i.e., I-feature, P-feature, and S-feature). We then design two prediction structures for these features in a GOF, including a sequential prediction structure and an adaptive prediction structure. Similar to video coding, it is important for P-feature residual coding optimization to make a tradeoff between feature bitrate and analysis/retrieval performance when encoding residuals. To do so, we propose a rate-performance-loss optimization model. To evaluate various feature coding methods for large-scale video retrieval, we construct a video feature coding data set, called VFC-1M, which consists of uncompressed videos from different scenarios captured from real-world surveillance cameras, with totally 1M visual objects. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DFC can significantly reduce the bitrate of deep features in the videos while maintaining the retrieval accuracy. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep feature; Deep feature coding; Rate-performance-loss optimization","Adaptive optics; Big data; Cameras; Cellular telephone systems; Codes (symbols); Convolution; Deep neural networks; Economic and social effects; Encoding (symbols); Feature extraction; Forecasting; Image coding; Monitoring; Neural networks; Optical fibers; Optimization; Search engines; Signal encoding; Space surveillance; Convolutional neural network; Deep feature; Feature coding; Rate performance; Videos; Security systems",2-s2.0-85028694104

However, coverage might not be sufficient to avoid chaotic crowd behaviours that could possibly occur when there is lack of accurate sensing data, and of distributed coordination among the main actors. In this paper, we investigate the role that Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) smartphones can play in emergency scenarios. Modern smartphones hide a great potential for emergency monitoring and management: (i) they are truly pervasive, (ii) they can establish peer-to-peer wireless links using short-range communication technologies, thus guaranteeing coverage even when fixed infrastructures are unavailable, and finally (iii) they can sense the environment through several embedded sensors. In order to maximally exploit such capabilities, we propose the SENSE-ME framework, which enables the creation of a spontaneous phone-sensing platform, by providing integrated functionalities of opportunistic networking, mobile sensing, and distributed information processing. Moreover, we introduce a realistic usage scenario (building evacuation), characterized by the presence of Android devices deployed over a two-dimensional space. Through SENSE-ME, each smartphone is able to quantify its level of danger by analysing its sensor data, to share such metrics with the surrounding devices via Wi-Fi Direct links, and finally to detect an emergency event, and compute a safe path, by applying a consensus-based algorithm to the received observations. In this scenario, we present a modular evaluation of the SENSE-ME networking/sensing/information processing components, clearly highlighting the strengths of a multi-layer approach for emergency monitoring and management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Behavioral research; Risk management; Wireless ad hoc networks; Commercial off-the shelves; Distributed coordination; Distributed information processing; Emergency management; Opportunistic networking; Peer-to-peer wireless links; Short-range communication; Two dimensional spaces; Smartphones",2-s2.0-85032438749

Although it is known that the network of physical contacts, for example, is distinct from the network arising from communication events via phone calls and instant messages, the extent to which these networks differ is not clear. We show here that the network structure of these channels show large structural variations. The various channels account for diverse relationships between pairs of individuals and the corresponding interaction patterns across channels differ to an extent that social ties cannot easily be reduced to a single layer. Each network of interactions, however, contains both central and peripheral individuals: central members are characterized by higher connectivity and can reach a large fraction of the network within a low number of steps, in contrast to the nodes on the periphery. The origin and purpose of each communication network also determine the role of their respective central members: highly connected individuals in the person-to-person networks interact with their environment in a regular manner, while members central in the social communication networks display irregular behavior with respect to their physical contacts and are more active through irregular social events. Our results suggest that due to the inherently different functions of communication channels, each one favors different social behaviors and different strategies for interacting with the environment. These findings can facilitate the understanding of the varying roles and impact individuals have on the population, which can further shed light on the prediction and prevention of epidemic outbreaks, or information propagation. © 2017, The Author(s).","contact patterns; online behavior; physical proximity; social networks","Information dissemination; Social networking (online); Telephone sets; Contact pattern; Information propagation; Interaction pattern; Network structures; Online behavior; Physical proximity; Social communication networks; Structural variations; Communication channels (information theory)",2-s2.0-85020201729

The disease has no cure and diseases management is necessary throughout the life of the patient. Medical adherence for preventing further progression of the disease and stroke is very important. The purpose of this study is to review the effect of self-management program and telephone follow up on medical adherence in patients with ischemic heart disease. Materials and Methods: The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which contains 60 patients with ischemic heart disease who are eligible for inclusion criteria. They divided randomaly into two equal control and experimental groups. All samples were examined with demographic and medical adherence questionnaire at first. The intervention group participated in the workshop of self management program during the first week after discharging. Then, it was followed up by phone for 8 weeks. Finally 3 and 6 months weeks after the last call, the questionnaire of medical adherence were fulfilled again by all samples and the results of the two different periods were compared. Results: The results showed that there is no meaningful statistical difference due to demographic characteristic and medical adherence between two groups of examination before interference. But medical adherence of the intervention group after instruction of self management program and telephone follow up increased in a meaningful way compared to pre-intervention on 3 and 6 month periods (p <0.001), while changes in medical adherence in the control group was not statistically significant.

In this paper, we show how county employment and unemployment statistics are encoded in the daily rhythm of people by decomposing the activity timelines into a linear combination of two dominant patterns. The mixing ratio of these patterns defines a measure for each county, that correlates significantly with employment (0.46 ± 0.02) and unemployment rates (− 0.34 ± 0.02). Thus, the two dominant activity patterns can be linked to rhythms signaling presence or lack of regular working hours of individuals.

This study questions this assumption by assessing the extent to which small-scale tuna fishers in Indonesia engaged in enumeration programs are able to understand, interpret and find value in the data collected from them when presented in graphical and numerically-aggregated forms. The analysis was based on structured interviews held with twenty tuna hand-line fishers on Buru Island, Maluku, Indonesia. We found that scientific displays such as graphs, tables and maps are understandable even for semi-literate fishers. Different forms of displays have more or less relevance and value for them in reflexive way. The sequence in which scientific displays are presented also matters, indicating that displays should be presented and explained in gradations from simple to more complex forms. Overall, however, the results show that face-to-face explanation remains necessary when communicating graphical and numerical information to fishers. Further attention should be given to forms of communication with fishers that allow for more reflexive decision-making and a shift to user-centric information systems. The ongoing development of mobile technologies aimed at incentivizing fishers to engage with and contribute to data and information collection, would benefit from selecting suitable information displays, presenting these in a guided sequence, and monitoring how fishers use this information to make decisions on the water. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Communication; Decision-making; Numerical and graphical literacy; Scientific information displays; Small-scale fisheries; Tuna",,2-s2.0-85028983820

Sferics consist of partially polarized electromagnetic pulses with an oscillating carrier signal in the very low frequency (VLF) band and a pulse repetition frequency in the extremely low frequency (ELF) band. Their ELF intensity may reach ~ 5 mV/m at global ranges, and ~ 0.5 V/m at ~ 1000 km from the lightning. The health symptoms associated with sferics are also associated with antennas of mobile telephony base stations and handsets, which emit radio frequency (RF) radiation pulsed on ELF, and expose humans at similar or stronger electric field intensities with sferics. According to the Ion Forced-Oscillation mechanism, polarized ELF EMFs of intensities down to 0.1–1 mV/m are able to disrupt any living cell's electrochemical balance and function by irregular gating of electro-sensitive ion channels on the cell membranes, and thus initiate a variety of health symptoms, while VLF EMFs need to be thousands of times stronger in order to be able to initiate health effects. We examine EMFs from sferics in terms of their bioactivity on the basis of this mechanism. We introduce the hypothesis that stronger atmospheric discharges may reasonably be considered to be ~ 70% along a straight line, and thus the associated EMFs (sferics) ~ 70% polarized. We find that sferics mainly in the ELF band have adequate intensity and polarization to cause biological/health effects. We provide explanation for the effects of sferics on human/animal health on the basis of this mechanism. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric discharges; Biological effects; ELF; Health effects; Mechanism of action; Schumann resonances; Sferics; VLF","Atmospherics; Biology; Cytology; Electric fields; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetic pulse; Health; Atmospheric discharge; Biological effects; Health effects; Mechanism of action; Schumann resonances; Electric discharges; atmospheric electricity; biophysics; electromagnetic field; health impact; health risk; lightning; thunderstorm; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric discharge; biophysics; electric field; electromagnetism; human; nonhuman; oscillation; polarization; priority journal; radiofrequency",2-s2.0-85019930133

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PA interventions for AYA survivors are sparse, but necessary to determine effective programs for increasing PA among this population. Thus, we conducted a pilot RCT, testing the feasibility of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to promote PA among AYA survivors. Procedure: We recruited 14– to 18–year–olds who were ≥1-year post cancer therapy from Seattle Children's Hospital. The 10-week intervention consisted of a wearable PA-tracking device (Fitbit Flex) and a peer-based virtual support group (Facebook group). Research staff helped set step goals and awarded badges weekly. Controls received usual care. Baseline assessments occurred before randomization and follow-up assessments occurred during weeks 8–10 of the intervention period. Feasibility criteria are defined below. Qualitative interviews assessed acceptability. Exploratory outcomes included PA, quality of life, and motivation for PA. Results: All feasibility criteria were met: we recruited 60 survivors, intervention participants wore the Fitbit on the majority (71.5%) of intervention days, and ≥90% of all participants completed questionnaires. Qualitative data confirmed intervention acceptability. Exploratory analyses found no significant adjusted group differences for change in moderate-to-vigorous PA (4.4 vs. 5.0 min/day; P = 0.92) or sedentary time (−4.5 vs. 1.0 min/day; P = 0.73), comparing intervention subjects to controls. Some modest differences were found for select subscales of quality of life and motivation for PA. Conclusions: This mHealth PA intervention was feasible and acceptable to AYA childhood cancer survivors and warrants a fully powered RCT. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","exercise; home based; obesity; prevention; survivorship; teenage","adolescent; controlled study; exercise; female; human; male; mortality; neoplasm; pilot study; randomized controlled trial; survivor; telemedicine; Adolescent; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Pilot Projects; Survivors; Telemedicine",2-s2.0-85020753935

Yet the sequential conceptualisation of healthcare-seeking processes has not diffused into quantitative research, which continues to analyse healthcare access as a “one-off” event. The ensuing lack of understanding healthcare behaviour is problematic in light of the immense burden of premature death especially in low- and middle-income countries. This paper presents an alternative approach. Based on a novel survey instrument, we analyse original survey data from rural India and China that contain 119 unique healthcare pathways among 637 respondents. We offer three applications of how such sequential data can be analysed to enhance our understanding of people's health behaviour. First, descriptive analysis of sequential data enables more a comprehensive representation of people's health behaviours, for example the time spent in various healthcare activities, common healthcare pathways across different groups, or shifts in healthcare provider access during a typical illness. Second, by analysing the effect of mobile technology on healthcare-seeking process characteristics, we demonstrate that conventional, sequence-insensitive indicators are potentially inconsistent and misleading approximations when compared to a more precise, sequence-sensitive measure. Third, we describe how sequential data enable transparent and flexible evaluations of people's healthcare behaviour. The example of a sequence-insensitive evaluation suggests that household wealth has no statistical link to an illustrative “ideal” form of public healthcare utilisation. In contrast, sequence-sensitive evaluations demonstrate that household wealth is associated with an increased likelihood of bypassing referral processes and approaching unregulated and costly informal and private practitioners before accessing a public clinic. Sequential data therefore do not only reveal otherwise neglected locational idiosyncrasies, but they also yield deeper insights into the drivers of people's health behaviours compared to a conventional approach to “access to healthcare.” © 2016 The Authors","China; Healthcare-seeking behavior; India; Methodology; Rural survey; Sequence analysis",,2-s2.0-85000919252

Increasing number of people now rely on mobile health apps and online health websites to meet their information needs and often receive conflicting health advice from these sources. This problem is more prevalent and severe in the setting of multi-morbidities. In addition, often medical information can be conflicting with regular activity patterns of an individual. In this work, we formulate the problem of finding conflicts in heterogeneous health applications including health websites, health apps, online drug usage guidelines, and daily activity logging applications. We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of conflicts based on the semantics of textual health advice and activities of daily living. Finding conflicts in health applications poses its own unique lexical and semantic challenges. These include large structural variation between pairs of textual advice, finding conceptual overlap between pairs of advice, inferring the semantics of an advice (i.e., what to do, why and how) and activities, and aligning activities suggested in advice with the activities of daily living based on their underlying dependencies and polarity. Hence, we develop Preclude2, a novel semantic rule-based solution to detect conflicts in activities and health advice derived from heterogeneous sources. Preclude2 utilizes linguistic rules and external knowledge bases to infer advice. In addition, Preclude2 considers personalization and context-awareness while detecting conflicts. We evaluate Preclude2 using 1156 real advice statements covering 8 important health topics, 90 online drug usage guidelines, 1124 online disease specific health advice covering 34 chronic diseases, and 2 activity datasets. The evaluation is personalized based on 34 real prescriptions. Preclude2 detects direct, conditional, sub-typical, quantitative, and temporal conflicts from 2129 advice statements with 0.91, 0.83, 0.98, 0.85 and 0.98 recall, respectively. Overall, it results in 0.88 recall for detecting inter advice conflicts and 0.89 recall for detecting activity–advice conflicts.

Telehealth has the potential to increase public access to healthcare in China, where large segments of the population remain underserved, yet little is known about current attitudes and use of telehealth in the country. Objective Our aim was to determine attitudes and use of telehealth in China among medical professionals and patients, as well as identify factors that may affect its use. Methods Using a custom-designed questionnaire, we performed a cross-sectional survey of medical professionals, medical students and patients at three large hospitals in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. We used a structural model to analyze the influence of factors that may affect use of telehealth. Results Of 600 questionnaires that were distributed, 550 (96.49%) were analyzed. Most respondents (63.28%) were familiar with using telehealth to “schedule medical appointments/pay medical fees online”, but relatively few (28.55%) used this feature. Nearly half of respondents were familiar with the concept of a “virtual visit” (46.18%), but only 12.18% had ever engaged in such visits. Medical professionals and students generally showed higher awareness and greater use of telehealth than patients. The strongest concern about telehealth among respondents was “authenticity and reliability of data from remote monitoring of patients” (75.17%). The proportion of respondents concerned about the potential disadvantages of telehealth was highest among students and lowest among patients. Awareness and use of telehealth were associated with previous experience with health-related use of the Internet and experience with traditional forms of telehealth, but not with social status or attitude toward telehealth. Conclusions Medical professionals and patients alike in China have a high awareness of telehealth, primarily traditional forms of telehealth, but only a small percentage actually use it. Patients have much lower awareness and use of telehealth than medical professionals and medical students, though they have generally positive attitudes towards telehealth. Telehealth is still in its infancy in China, and the environment for its development is largely favorable among current and future medical professionals. © 2017","Attitudes; Structural model; Telehealth; Usage","Health care; Home health care; Hospitals; mHealth; Remote patient monitoring; Students; Surveys; Attitudes; Cross-sectional surveys; Medical professionals; Positive attitude; Remote monitoring; Structural modeling; Telehealth; Usage; Medical computing",2-s2.0-85030483579

This paper presents the results of a preliminary epidemiological study, combining Epidemiology, Statistics and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), in which we analyzed the correlation between exposure to RF-EMF in the city of Albacete (166,000 inhabitants, southeast Spain) and the incidence of several cancers with unspecific causes (lymphomas, and brain tumors). We used statistical tools to analyze the spatial point patterns and aggregate data with the aim to study the spatial randomness and to determine the zones with the highest incidence from 95 tumors studied (65 lymphomas, 12 gliomas and 18 meningiomas).

This is exemplified in the assessment of acute abdominal pain, in which a physician's palpation determines if a patient's pain is life-Threatening requiring emergency intervention/surgery or due to some less-urgent cause. In a step towards virtual physical examinations, we developed and report for the first time a ""touch-capable"" mHealth technology that enables a patient's own hands to serve as remote surrogates for the physician's in the screening of acute abdominal pain. Leveraging only a smartphone with its native accelerometers, our system guides a patient through an exact probing motion that precisely matches the palpation motion set by the physician. An integrated feedback algorithm, with 95% sensitivity and specificity, enabled 81% of tested patients to match a physician abdominal palpation curve with <20% error after 6 attempts.

While the advantages of this new technology are clear, constant use may also bring negative consequences, such as a loss of productivity due to interruptions in work life. A link between smartphone overuse and loss of productivity has often been hypothesized, but empirical evidence on this question is scarce. The present study addressed this question by collecting self-report data from N = 262 participants, assessing private and work-related smartphone use, smartphone addiction and self-rated productivity. Our results indicate a moderate relationship between smartphone addiction and a self-reported decrease in productivity due to spending time on the smartphone during work, as well as with the number of work hours lost to smartphone use. Smartphone addiction was also related to a greater amount of leisure time spent on the smartphone and was strongly related to a negative impact of smartphone use on daily non-work related activities. These data support the idea that tendencies towards smartphone addiction and overt checking of the smartphone could result in less productivity both in the workplace and at home.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel heading estimation approach based on two unscented Kalman filters (UKFs) fusing inertial sensors and landmarks. The first UKF is developed for the recalibration of device attitude estimation. We mathematically derive the measurement equation connecting observed user heading from landmarks with the quaternion vector representing device attitude. To decrease the nonlinearity of the measurement equation and make the filter more robust, we deploy the difference between user heading derived from the landmark and estimation result of PCA-based approach as the observation variable. The second UKF is developed for user heading estimation fusing estimation results of PCA-based approach and observed user headings from landmarks. Besides, we develop a robust landmark identification method by exploiting the acceleration and device pitch patterns, while noisy barometers are no longer required as previous methods. Experiments show that the proposed landmark-aided user heading estimation approach may improve accuracy performance significantly, which is very useful for continuous indoor navigation. © 2017, The Author(s).","Indoor navigation; Principal component analysis (PCA); Unscented Kalman filter; User heading estimation","Air navigation; Control nonlinearities; Indoor positioning systems; Inertial navigation systems; Kalman filters; Navigation; Smartphones; Acceleration signals; Attitude estimation; Estimation approaches; Estimation results; In-door navigations; Landmark identification; Measurement equations; Unscented Kalman Filter; Principal component analysis",2-s2.0-85029953826

Steering and navigation tasks through an environment constitute an essential activity in our daily lives. They have a high degree of practical value in a variety of domains, such as public area design, architectural Wayfinding, geo-positioning and navigation, as well as urban planning and environmental design. At times, people with a visual impairment may also have problems in navigating autonomously and without personal assistance, especially in unknown environments (outdoor and indoor) using a smartphone. There could also be emergency situations in which the receiving of information in real time could be crucial. People with motor disabilities usually need information to avoid environments with obstacles, to arrive at a target or to manage touchscreens in daily activities and different environments. The use of landmarks is therefore vitally important in human navigation. Wayfinding systems must change, given that according to the United Nations (UN) Development Program, people with a disability represent around 10% of the world's population, which is approximately 650 million people. Additionally, according to the World Health Organization, the world's population of people 60 years of age and older has doubled since 1980 and is predicted to reach 2 billion by 2050. Most Wayfinding applications in the Smartphone market suffer from at least one of the following problems: the information is not dynamic, the design is not universal or the interface is not adapted to different users and preferences. Accordingly, apps do not currently have a universal design. The GAWA platform provides a universal and accessible solution to manage Wayfinding applications that focuses on people with a disability in outdoor and indoor environments in Smartcities.

Hence there is a necessity of the end point detection. The end point detection can be performed easily if the speech is clean. However the presence of degradation tends to give errors in the estimation of the end points and this error propagates into the overall accuracy of the speaker verification system. Temporal and spectral enhancement is performed on the degraded speech so that ideally the nature of the enhanced speech will be similar to the clean speech.

The aim of this study was to determine the extent patients use a paper-pencil symptom-monitoring diary during chemotherapy treatment, to identify factors that mediate its use at home, and to determine perceptions patients have of the diary. Methods A quantitative survey assessed patients’ use of the diary, their experiences and opinions. A secondary analysis of semi-structured interviews used was performed to determine how patients perceived being offered the diary for tracking symptoms and, if they did use it, their experiences with the diary. Results Eighty-seven patients (78%) used or had been using the diary during their chemotherapy treatment. Most patients felt that the diary supported them in discussing treatment-related symptoms with their doctors and nurses during hospital visits and helped them to deal with symptoms at home. However, diary users felt that their professional caregivers viewed the diary differently, specifically not valuing it enough to actively use it in their care. Conclusions This study indicates that the majority of chemotherapy patients at our hospital perceive the symptom diary to be a feasible tool in terms of ease of use and time investment and that it is helpful.

The prevalence of this disease is expected to increase in coming years although the death rate may be lower due to better treatment. To present the design and development of a technology solution for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic patients. The system aims to raise the population’s awareness of the importance of adopting healthy heart habits by using self-feedback techniques. A series of sensors which makes it possible to detect cardiovascular risk factors in asymptomatic patients were used. These sensors enable evaluation of heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 -oxygen saturation in blood- and body temperature. This work has developed a modular solution centred on four parts: iOS app, sensors, server and web. The CoreBluetooth library, which carries out Bluetooth 4.0 communication, was used for the connection between the app and the sensors. The data files are stored on the iPad and the server by using CoreData and SQL mechanisms. The system was validated with 20 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with established structural heart disease.

Malware authors create new versions of malware from previous ones by implementing code obfuscation techniques. Obfuscated malware is potentially contributed to the exponential increase in the number of generated malware variants. Detection of obfuscated malware is a continuous challenge because it can easily evade the signature-based malware detectors, and behaviour-based detectors are not able to detect them accurately. Therefore, an efficient technique for obfuscated malware detection in Android-based smartphones is needed. In the literature on Android malware classification, few malware detection approaches are designed with the capability of detecting obfuscated malware. However, these malware detection approaches were not equipped with the capacity to improve their performance by learning and evolving their malware detection rules. Based on the concept of evolving soft computing systems, this paper proposes an evolving hybrid neuro-fuzzy classifier (EHNFC) for Android malware classification using permission-based features. The proposed EHNFC not only has the capability of detecting obfuscated malware using fuzzy rules, but can also evolve its structure by learning new malware detection fuzzy rules to improve its detection accuracy when used in detection of more malware applications. To this end, an evolving clustering method for adapting and evolving malware detection fuzzy rules was modified to incorporate an adaptive procedure for updating the radii and centres of clustered permission-based features. This modification to the evolving clustering method enhances cluster convergence and generates rules that are better tailored to the input data, hence improving the classification accuracy of the proposed EHNFC. The experimental results for the proposed EHNFC show that the proposal outperforms several state-of-the-art obfuscated malware classification approaches in terms of false negative rate (0.05) and false positive rate (0.05). The results also demonstrate that the proposal detects the Android malware better than other neuro-fuzzy systems (viz., the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and the dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy system) in terms of accuracy (90%). © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Android security; Evolving clustering algorithm; Evolving hybrid neuro-fuzzy classifier; Malware; Malware detection","Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Computer crime; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Malware; Neural networks; Soft computing; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Android securities; Classification accuracy; Evolving clustering methods; False positive rates; Malware classifications; Malware detection; Neuro fuzzy classifier; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84996629718

GPs have traditionally encountered out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) as a component of routine patient care but have not been formally linked with the statutory ambulance service. Computer aided dispatch technology now allows real time GP text message alert to nearby cardiac arrest events. Aim To examine the feasibility, uptake and outcome of a novel scheme to alert GPs to nearby OHCA events in their communities. Methods GPs are recruited to voluntarily participate in a cardiac arrest text alert initiative called the ‘MERIT 3′ project. GPs indicate the hours during which they wish to receive OHCA text alerts, and also specify a geo-location from which they will receive alerts to OHCA events occurring within a specified radius. Data on alerts, responses, OHCA incidents and outcomes are gathered prospectively, using ambulance control and GP data and with corroborative data from the national OHCA registry. Results 423 general practices throughout Ireland were invited to participate. In the initial 12 months, 100 GPs from 85 individual practices have enrolled, 74 GPs have received alerts and 26 GPs have responded to incidents. Only 222/781 (28.4%) text alerts issued by ambulance control have proven to be recognised as cardiac arrests with resuscitation attempts. GPs have attended 51/776 (6.6%) OHCA incidents to which they have been alerted, with resuscitation undertaken in 34 cases with three survivors. Conclusion Text alert activation of GPs to nearby OHCA events has proven feasible, with significant activity during the establishment period, but a low survival rate which is similar to the overall national OHCA survival rate. A high proportion of alerts do not involve resuscitation opportunities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Emergency responder; General practice; Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; Resuscitation",,2-s2.0-85032577653

Haus Ruth is a place designed to resolve the “problem” of two types of women living in Port Moresby: unmarried professional women and married women fleeing domestic violence. The “problem” of Port Moresby’s female population stems from the colonial history of the city, a city that was not originally meant to have either Papua New Guineans or women living in it. Following decolonization, the city’s burgeoning female population created pressure on existing housing arrangements and also gave rise to rapidly changing and contested notions of what it means to be an urban Papua New Guinean woman. As such, Haus Ruth offers a complicating case study to theories of urban space and of the “right to the city.” While the future that Haus Ruth offers to its residents is a hopeful one, it is also one constrained by the enclaved and fragmentary nature of the city around them and by the aspirational discourses of class mobility and Christian companionate marriage espoused by Haus Ruth as an evangelical institution. The colonial and mission histories of Port Moresby serve to elucidate how the unusual arrangement of Haus Ruth emerged and how it has accidentally become the site of an almost unprecedented social form for Papua New Guinea: single-sex female consociation. Although this consociation is mediated by the institutional space of the house, it also opens up the possibility of future spaces in which this city of the postcolony not only contains but is shaped by the women who inhabit it. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.

With the sophistication of vehicle instrumentation, reckless maneuvers, such as abrupt turns, acceleration, and deceleration, can now be accurately detected by analyzing data related to the driver-vehicle interactions. Such analysis usually requires very specific in-vehicle hardware and infrastructure sensors (e.g. loop detectors and radars), which can be costly. Hence, in this paper, we investigated if off-the-shelf smartphones can be used to online detect and classify the driver’s behavior in near real-time. To do so, we first modeled and performed an intrinsic evaluation to assess the performance of three outlier detection algorithms formulated as a data stream processing network which receives as input and processes data streams of smartphone and vehicle sensors. Next, we implemented a novel scoring mechanism based on online outlier detection to quantitatively evaluate drivers’ maneuvers as either cautious or reckless. Thus, we adapted a data mining mechanism which takes into account a sensor’s data rates and power to determine driver behavior in the scoring process. Finally, as the intrinsic evaluation does not necessarily reveal how well an algorithm will perform in a real-world scenario, we evaluated the algorithm that achieved the best result in a real-world case study to assess drivers’ driving behavior. Our results indicate that the algorithm performs quickly and accurately; the algorithm classifies driver behavior with 95.45% accuracy. Moreover, such results are obtained within 100 milliseconds of processing time on average. © 2017, The Author(s).","In-Vehicle sensing; Online driving behavior detection; Online outlier detection; Smartphone","Accidents; Data communication systems; Data handling; Data mining; Smartphones; Statistics; Vehicles; Complex event processing; Data stream processing; Driving behavior; Outlier Detection; Outlier detection algorithm; Real-world scenario; Reckless driving; Vehicle interactions; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85029939870

Therefore, recycling and reusing these materials could mitigate environmental impacts and provide economic gains. The present research is aimed at assessing the economic and environmental advantages of adopting Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) reverse logistics for recycling and reuse by three Brazilian manufacturers of electro-electronic products,and three recyclers,two located in Brazil and one located in Switzerland. Specifically, this study maps the processes used by three recyclers. These multiple case studies incorporated both observation and semi-structured interview. The Mass Intensity Factor was used for the environmental impact assessment. We found that the adoption of electronic waste reverse logistics for recycling and reuse resulted in reduction of the environmental impact in the abiotic, biotic, water and air compartments and economic gains for the manufactures and recyclers, indicating a promising market in the Brazil. Another relevant result was the presentation of a simple eco-efficiency tool to be used in organizational practice. This tool provides a performance indicator based on indexes to implement goals for continuous recycling and reuse improvements, aimed at achieving a closed cycle. However, electronic waste recycling and reuse processes in Brazil are decentralized and, therefore, the development of a cooperation network as a whole is complex. Furthermore, precious metal recovery from printed circuit boards is a process carried out specifically by foreign enterprises because the Brazilian manufacturers and recyclers do not have enough technology due the lack of resources for investment. Thus, the Brazilian government has been holding meetings with the manufacturers and recyclers to develop a sectoral agreement in order to support financially the transfer of this technology for recycling of printed circuit boards to Brazil. In addition, this fact contributes to the National Solid Waste Policy, and it increases the financial profitability of Brazilian recyclers because with this process the recyclers could extract precious metals for sale increasing the economic gain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Economic and environmental assessment; Recycling; Reuse; WEEE; WEEE reverse logistics",,2-s2.0-85028358456

The statistically significant spatial dependency between energy use and returners' human mobility networks indicate the dominant role of this population in relation to residential and commercial building energy consumption.

Methods: In this study, a novel approach is proposed that is based upon the integration of conventional usability testing and heuristic evaluation with data-mining knowledge discovery process. An experiment is conducted to evaluate ISO 9241-151 guidelines under 16-different categories by hundred participants who are frequent users of academic websites. After evaluation, the qualitative usability data is collected and different data-mining techniques i.e. association rule and decision tree are applied to recognize fully functional and problematic usability attributes. Identified problematic attributes represent common usability problems patterns related to academic websites from the qualitative viewpoint only. This study further prioritizes these problematic attributes by using the ranking algorithm that represents the order in which usability issues must be resolved. Results: In this study, 16-different categories are considered for usability evaluation of academic websites. The results show that no issues are identified in two-categories i.e. {Headings_Titles_Labels and The Home_Page}. In Scrolling and Paging category, horizontal scrolling is identified as a major issue whereas, in Internationalization category, the users do not identify supported languages on most of the academic websites. Users do not find websites to be highly secured under Security category. Our findings investigate that most of the issues are found in Search and Social Media categories. Furthermore, users easily locate 50.53% guidelines on websites as fully functional whereas, 49.46% of characteristics are considered as problematic usability features that are not functional on the academic website as a whole. Conclusions: Identification of common usability problems at an early stage can lower substantially the development efforts in cost and time. Software developers can restrain from these potential usability problems during the development of novel systems under the same context. Providing appropriate solutions for these problems can become valuable in software development. The proposed approach concludes that conventional usability evaluation methods can go beyond just than testing of systems. The study is a milestone towards identification and prioritizing problematic usability features for academic websites and helps in providing the wholistic approach of usability problematic patterns for web-domain. © 2017, The Author(s).","Association rule; Attribute selection; Data-mining knowledge discovering in databases; Decision tree; Heuristic evaluation; Qualitative usability testing; Usability; Usability engineering",,2-s2.0-85032203112

The role of telemedicine within the Japanese health system may be of wide interest, yet it has not been comprehensively explored and documented. Thus, the aim of this study was to systematically review the Japanese and English language literature relating to the clinical use of telemedicine in Japan. Methods: For studies published in Japanese, we searched Ichushi and CiNii. For English language publications, we searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. All peer-reviewed articles describing the clinical use of telemedicine and published between 2007 and 2016 were included. Data on clinical area, study type, technology used, and type of communication were extracted. Studies were categorised by prevention, screening, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment. Results: The search yielded 1476 records; 26 Japanese language and 15 English language articles were selected for review. A wide range of clinical areas were represented; however, home care and life-style related studies were dominant. More than 50% of studies were related to prevention and early diagnosis. The majority of Japanese studies involved doctor-to-doctor consultation. Smartphones and remote monitoring systems were the main types of technology used. Conclusions: Most studies of telemedicine in Japan are published in the Japanese language and are thus relatively inaccessible to the rest of the world; for the first time, this study has provided an overview of the clinical use of telemedicine in Japan. The clinically related papers reflect the Japanese cultural focus on disease prevention. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","clinical use; Japan; review; telemedicine",,2-s2.0-85032584649

Studies were independently extracted and classified according to the following telemedicine strategies: teleeducation, telemonitoring, telecase-management, telementoring and teleconsultation. Traditional and network meta-analysis were performed to estimate the relative treatment effects. A total of 107 studies involving 20,501 participants were included. Over a median of 6 months follow-up, telemedicine reduced haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by a mean of 0.43% (95% CI: -0.64% to -0.21%). Network meta-analysis showed that all telemedicine strategies were effective in reducing HbA1c significantly compared to usual care except for telecase-management and telementoring, with mean difference ranging from 0.37% and 0.71%. Ranking indicated that teleconsultation was the most effective telemedicine strategy, followed by telecase-management plus telemonitoring, and finally teleeducation plus telecase-management.

The paper estimates the relationship between smoking and alcohol consumption using several self-reported and objective smoking measures, while also implementing a two-stage least squares estimation strategy that utilizes the randomized smoking cessation program assignment as an instrument for smoking. The analysis leads to three salient findings. First, self-reported and clinically verified smoking measures provide mixed evidence on the short-term impact of quitting smoking on alcohol consumption. Second, the long-term impact of smoking on alcohol consumption, measured with the historic 5 years smoking behavior, suggests that those with the highest average cigarette consumption and those with the longest smoking history see the largest increase in alcohol consumption. Specifically, abstaining from smoking or reducing the average cigarette consumption to the mean level lowers alcohol consumption by roughly 25% per week. As a result, these findings present comprehensive evidence that smoking and drinking are complements in the long-term and that the public health and finance benefits in smoking cessations treatments are undervalued. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Addiction; Drinking; Randomized experiment; Risky behaviors; Smoking",,2-s2.0-85026920874

Product developers can choose to design products according to an environmentally favorable EoL scenario. Such strategies may also assist societies in the transition to a more circular economy. However, at the end of a product's useful life, it is uncertain whether the end users will handle the product according to the original intention of the product developers. Situated within this context, this research investigated how end users perceive three EoL scenarios (reuse, recycling and remanufacturing) and two disposal methods (door-to-door collection and delivery at point of purchase) for eight household electrical and electronic products (e-products) spanning a representative range of product categories. To this end, a quantitative Kano survey (N = 146) was used to classify product features related to EoL and disposal methods according to users' preferences. An extension developed by the authors was also deployed to identify differences within user segments in terms of demographic (e.g., age, gender, education level) and relevant psychographic variables (e.g., environmental awareness). Taken collectively, the results showed that the majority of EoL scenarios were actually regarded as attractive features in the Kano framework, meaning that users would be very satisfied with a product that can be disposed of according to a favorable EoL scenarios, but may not have any prior expectations at point of purchase. Reuse potential emerged as the most attractive EoL scenario, suggesting that users' preferences are largely aligned with the concept of circular economy. Interestingly, women were found to prefer all EoL scenarios more than men, and were also more willing to pay a premium price for environmentally friendly e-products. These results suggest that gender may be the most important basis for user segmentation (e.g. in the context of product development), and that products targeted towards women are more likely to enter favorable EoL scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; End of life; Product design","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Circular economy; Door-to-door collection; Electrical and electronic products; Electronic appliances; End of lives; Environmental awareness; Product categories; Product developers; Product design",2-s2.0-85030663413

IPIN uses the technique of hybrid images to blend two keypads with different digit orderings in such a way, that the user who is close to the device is seeing one keypad to enter her PIN, while the attacker who is looking at the device from a bigger distance is seeing only the other keypad. The user's keypad is shuffled in every authentication attempt, since the attacker may memorize the spatial arrangement of the pressed digits. To reason about the security of IPIN, we developed an algorithm which is based on human visual perception and estimates the minimum distance from which an observer is unable to interpret the keypad of the user. We tested our estimations with 84 simulated shoulder-surfing attacks from 21 different people. None of the attacks was successful against our estimations. In addition, we estimated the minimum distance from which a camera is unable to capture the visual information from the keypad of the user.

The recycling potential of the contained metals was measured according to those four aspects. As a result, the priority level of these substances recycled from waste LCDs is aluminum (Al) > mercury (Hg) > indium (In) > tin (Sn) > zinc (Zn), and the technological level would be an important factor that affect the recycling potential value of Hg. The toxicity and the price are two key issues that affect the recycling potential of Sn compared with Zn. When the price of In increased twenty-fold or more, the recycling potential should be taken fully into account. © 2017","E-waste; Evaluation; Liquid crystal display; Method; Recycling potential","Electronic Waste; Indium; Liquid crystal displays; Tin; Toxicity; Wastes; Zinc; Environmental risks; Evaluation; Existence conditions; Liquid crystal display(LCD); Method; Recycling potential; Technical conditions; Technological level; Recycling",2-s2.0-85026326655

The objective of this paper is threefold: first, the paper serves as a guideline for people seeking to design their own monocular SLAM according to specific environmental constraints. Second, it presents a survey that covers the various keyframe-based monocular SLAM systems in the literature, detailing the components of their implementation, and critically assessing the specific strategies made in each proposed solution. Third, the paper provides insight into the direction of future research in this field, to address the major limitations still facing monocular SLAM; namely, in the issues of illumination changes, initialization, highly dynamic motion, poorly textured scenes, repetitive textures, map maintenance, and failure recovery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Keyframe based; Monocular; Visual SLAM","Augmented reality; Surveys; Vision; Dynamic motions; Environmental constraints; Failure recovery; Illumination changes; Key frames; Monocular; Repetitive textures; Visual SLAM; Robotics",2-s2.0-85032293015

The problem of multi-class classification is an important issue in the applications which naturally has more than two classes. A well-known strategy to convert a multi-class classification problem into binary sub-problems is the error-correcting output coding (ECOC) method. Since existing methods use a single classifier with ECOC without considering the dependency among multiple classifiers, it often fails to generalize the performance and parameters in a real-life application, where different numbers of devices, sensors and sampling rates are used. To address this problem, we propose a unique hierarchical classification model based on the combination of two base binary classifiers using selective learning of slacked hierarchy and integrating the training of binary classifiers into a unified objective function. Our method maps the multi-class classification problem to multi-level classification. A multi-tier voting scheme has been introduced to provide a final classification label at each level of the solicited model. The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets and compared with independent base classifiers. Furthermore, it has also been tested on real-life sensor readings for 3 different subjects to recognize four activities i.e. Walking, Standing, Jogging and Sitting. The presented method uses same hierarchical levels and parameters to achieve better performance on all three datasets having different number of devices, sensors and sampling rates. The average accuracies on publicly available dataset and real-life sensor readings were recorded to be 95% and 85%, respectively. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method in terms of performance and parameters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Activity recognition; Error-correcting output coding; Hierarchical classification; Multi-class classification; Slacked Hierarchy","Ambient intelligence; Behavioral research; Bins; Classifiers; Education; Hierarchical systems; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Wearable sensors; Activity recognition; Error-correcting output coding; Hierarchical classification; Multi-class classification; Slacked Hierarchy; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85021931326

However, promotion, uptake and use among patients and health-care professionals remain low. Many barriers and facilitators to effective self-management have been reported, and views and beliefs of patients and health care professionals have been explored in qualitative studies. We conducted a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative research into self-management in patients, carers and health care professionals regarding self-management of asthma, to identify perceived barriers and facilitators associated with reduced effectiveness of asthma self-management interventions. Electronic databases and guidelines were searched systematically for qualitative literature that explored factors relevant to facilitators and barriers to uptake, adherence, or outcomes of self-management in patients with asthma. Thematic synthesis of the 56 included studies identified 11 themes: (1) partnership between patient and health care professional; (2) issues around medication; (3) education about asthma and its management; (4) health beliefs; (5) self-management interventions; (6) co-morbidities (7) mood disorders and anxiety; (8) social support; (9) non-pharmacological methods; (10) access to healthcare; (11) professional factors. From this, perceived barriers and facilitators were identified at the level of individuals with asthma (and carers), and health-care professionals. Future work addressing the concerns and beliefs of adults, adolescents and children (and carers) with asthma, effective communication and partnership, tailored support and education (including for ethnic minorities and at risk groups), and telehealthcare may improve how self-management is recommended by professionals and used by patients. Ultimately, this may achieve better outcomes for people with asthma. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85030992307

However, the systematic study on dose-dependent, frequency-dependent and accumulative effects of microwave exposure at different frequencies was lacking.

After microwave radiation, declines in spatial learning and memory and fluctuations of brain electric activities were found in the 10 mW/cm2 single frequency exposure groups and accumulative exposure groups. Meanwhile, morphological evidences in hippocampus also supported the cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, the decrease of Nissl contents in neurons indicated protein-based metabolic disorders in neurons. By detecting the key functional proteins of cholinergic transmitter metabolism, cytokines, energy metabolism and oxidative stress in the hippocampus, we found that microwave could lead to multiple metabolic disorders.

Acting as a sintering aid, CuO addition improved the sinterability and promoted the densification of the NZCT–NNT ceramics due to the production of a liquid phase. The sintering temperature of the NZCT–NNT ceramics was successfully reduced from 1410 °C to 1250 °C. The addition of CuO resulted in a change in the grain shape of the NZCT–NNT ceramics, ranging from a plate-like layered shape to a round–like shape. Additionally, CuO addition adjusted the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (τf) toward near–zero without inducing an obvious deterioration in the dielectric constant (εr) and the quality factor (Q × f) of the NZCT–NNT ceramics.

Accessibility evaluation in location models often assumes that trips originate from fixed locations (usually home) and are single purpose. These assumptions contradict the empirical evidence that suggests trips also commonly originate from non-home locations and may involve multiple stops. In this study, a new multi-objective location model is developed that extents the classic p-median problem (PMP) to account for a more realistic assessment of accessibility. Based on the individual accessibility assessment, notions of trip chaining and activity space are incorporated into the model development. In addition to fixed home locations, stops along chained trips are allowed for potential service site visits, and activity space is introduced as an additional dimension to evaluate accessibility of alternative opportunities.

Crime Survey for England and Wales data are analysed from 1992 to 2011/12 via a series of data signatures indicating the nature of, and change in, the relationship between security devices and burglary. The causal role of improved security is strongly indicated by a set of interlocking data signatures: rapid increases in the prevalence of security, particularly in the availability of combinations of the most effective devices (door and window locks plus security lighting); a steep decline in the proportion of households without security accompanied by disproportionate rises in their burglary risk; and the decline being solely in forced rather than unforced entries to households. The study concludes that there is strong evidence that security caused the decline in burglary in England and Wales in the 1990s. Testing the security hypothesis across a wider range of crime types, countries and forms of security than examined to date, is required both to understand the crime drop and to derive lessons for future crime prevention practice and policy. © The Author(s) 2017.","Crime drop; Crime Survey for England and Wales; Data signatures; Domestic burglary; Security hypothesis",,2-s2.0-85015790169

The factors that determine the diversity and composition of microbiomes in a built environment remain unclear. Herein, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to investigate the relationships between building attributes and surface bacterial communities among four HCIs located in three buildings. We examined the surface bacterial communities and environmental parameters in the buildings supplied with different ventilation types and compared the results using a Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM)-based approach. A total of 203 samples from the four HCIs were analyzed. Four bacterial communities were grouped using the DMM-based approach, which were highly similar to those in the 4 HCIs. The α-diversity and β-diversity in the naturally ventilated building were different from the conditioner-ventilated building. The bacterial source composition varied across each building. Nine genera were found as the core microbiota shared by all the areas, of which Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus are regarded as healthcare-associated pathogens (HAPs). The observed relationship between environmental parameters such as core microbiota and surface bacterial diversity suggests that we might manage indoor environments by creating new sanitation protocols, adjusting the ventilation design, and further understanding the transmission routes of HAPs. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85027581123

And the effect of aging can be observed in both systems. Based on the analogy with the Trap Model of spin glasses, we derive a model with a unified power-function form for the growth of independent spreading activities. Our model takes several key factors into consideration, including memory effect, the dynamics of human interest, and the fact that older messages are more difficult to discover.

There are several issues with the life cycle of a product when looked from the environmental impact perspective. These issues impact resource scarcity, cause adverse effects on the environment and loss of embodied energy as waste. Some of the potential solutions to these issues, as proposed in literature, are to carry out various End-of-Life (EoL) recovery processes on products including their recycling, reuse and remanufacturing. These EoL recovery processes help in reclaiming materials, components and sub-assemblies from used products and make them available for new products, or extend life of the products as a whole. In order to efficiently carry out these EoL recovery processes, a pre-requisite is disassembly. Disassembly processes are closely related to the design specifications of a product. Therefore, designers should incorporate disassembly considerations into a product during its early design stage itself in order to make disassembly of the product easier when it reaches the EoL phase. Therefore, the objective of the work reported in this paper is to support designers in evaluating some of the major factors influencing disassembly, both individually and together, so as to assess the trade-off among these in an integrated manner during early design stages of the product's life cycle, thereby helping designers compare and select alternative designs of a product that have better disassembly potential at the EoL phase. An Integrated Framework has been developed to support designers in the above evaluation process. For practical application, the Framework has been implemented into a computer based tool called IdeAssemble, and the usefulness of the tool is tested with a design experiment. The results indicate that the tool supported designers in decision making on alternative designs better than when designers evaluated without the tool. IdeAssemble tool could be used as early as during the embodiment design stage of a product when information on materials, geometry, disassembly tools and types of disassembly task are available to the designer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Disassembly effort; Disassembly time; End of life phase; Environmental impact; Product design; Product disassembly","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Product design; Recovery; Computer based tools; Design specification; Disassembly effort; Disassembly time; End of lives; End-of-life disassembly; Integrated frameworks; Product disassembly; Life cycle",2-s2.0-85030696482

The aim of the current study was to determine the feasibility of a home-based telehealth model for delivering SP and ND reviews, to provide patients with more convenient access to these appointments. Methods: Service outcomes, costs, and consumer satisfaction were examined across 30 matched participants: 15 supported via the standard model of care (SMOC), and 15 via the home-based telehealth model of care (TMOC). Results: All patients were successfully managed via telehealth. The TMOC was more efficient, with a reduced number (p < 0.003) and duration (p < 0.01) of appointments required until discharge. Significant patient cost savings (p = 0.002) were reported for the TMOC due to decreased travel requirements. While staff costs were reduced, additional telehealth equipment levies resulted in a lower but non-significant overall cost difference to the health service when using the TMOC. High satisfaction was reported by all participants attending the TMOC.

However, despite the number of studies on aggregated topological structures and their effects on the spread of disease, the temporal sequence of flights that connect different airports have not been examined. In this study, to analyze the temporal pattern of the Chinese Aviation Network (CAN), we obtain a time series of topological statistics through sliding the temporal CAN with an hourly time window. In addition, we build two types of Susceptible-Infectious (SI) spreading models to study the effects of linking sequence and temporal duration on the spread of diseases. The results reveal that the absence of links formed by flights without alternatives at dawn and night causes a significant decrease in the centralization of the network. The temporal sparsity of linking sequence slows down the spread of disease on CAN, and the duration of flights intensifies the sensitiveness of CAN to targeted infection.

The dc-dc converters can provide more stable power output thereby improving the overall efficiency of TEG system. However, to facilitate better performance improvement, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm can be applied to extract maximum power from TEG system. Therefore, parameter analysis of a TEG/dc-dc converter system in different modes is being carried out. A TEG-dc-dc boost converter model is analysed in both MPPT and direct pulse width modulation (PWM) modes subjected to a variable load. To further study the capability of dc-dc converters to stabilise the TEG power output, increasing ramp and random hot side temperature is applied to the MPPT and direct PWM based modes so that the effect on output parameters i.e. voltage and power, can be analysed. It is noted that even for the random temperature input to the TEG, the output voltage resulting from the converter is almost constant. Therefore dc-dc converters are able to stabilise the power generated from TEG. It is also observed that dc-dc converter with MPPT based model is able to effectively extract the maximum power without having to adjust any component from the MPPT algorithm as it is the case with direct PWM based model. From the study, it has been established that proper selection of converter components is necessary to reduce converter losses as well interferences on the load connected to TEG-dc-dc converter system. © 2017 International Energy Initiative","Dc-dc converter; Direct PWM; MPPT; Random temperature; TEG devices",,2-s2.0-85027969381

Around Orkney, northern Scotland, UK, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) population has decreased by 78% over 20 years. Concern for the declining harbour seal population has led to constraints being placed on tidal energy generation developments. For this study area, telemetry data from 54 animals tagged between 2003 and 2015 were used to produce density estimation maps. Predictive habitat models using GAM-GEEs provided robust predictions in areas where telemetry data were absent, and were combined with density estimation maps, and then scaled to population levels using August terrestrial counts between 2008 and 2015, to produce harbour seal usage maps with confidence intervals around Orkney and the North coast of Scotland. The selected habitat model showed that distance from haul out, proportion of sand in seabed sediment, and annual mean power were important predictors of space use.

At first, a measure of dynamic burstiness is introduced to quantify burstiness of word occurrence in a textbook. The advantage of this measure is that the dynamic burstiness is decomposable into two contributions: one coming from the inter-event variance and the other from the memory effects. Comparing network structures of physics textbook systems with those of surrogate random textbooks without the memory or variance effects are absent, we show that the network modularity increases systematically with the dynamic burstiness. The intra-connectivity of individual word representing the strength of a tie with which a node is bound to a module accordingly increases with the dynamic burstiness, suggesting individual words with high burstiness are strongly bound to one module. Based on the frequency and dynamic burstiness, physics terminology is classified into four categories: fundamental words, topical words, special words, and common words.

These campaigns contribute to the shaping of collective opinions. While most information campaigns are benign, some may be deployed for nefarious purposes, including terrorist propaganda, political astroturf, and financial market manipulation. It is therefore important to be able to detect whether a meme is being artificially promoted at the very moment it becomes wildly popular. This problem has important social implications and poses numerous technical challenges. As a first step, here we focus on discriminating between trending memes that are either organic or promoted by means of advertisement. The classification is not trivial: ads cause bursts of attention that can be easily mistaken for those of organic trends. We designed a machine learning framework to classify memes that have been labeled as trending on Twitter. After trending, we can rely on a large volume of activity data. Early detection, occurring immediately at trending time, is a more challenging problem due to the minimal volume of activity data that is available prior to trending. Our supervised learning framework exploits hundreds of time-varying features to capture changing network and diffusion patterns, content and sentiment information, timing signals, and user meta-data. We explore different methods for encoding feature time series. Using millions of tweets containing trending hashtags, we achieve 75% AUC score for early detection, increasing to above 95% after trending. We evaluate the robustness of the algorithms by introducing random temporal shifts on the trend time series. Feature selection analysis reveals that content cues provide consistently useful signals; user features are more informative for early detection, while network and timing features are more helpful once more data is available. © 2017, The Author(s).","advertising; early detection; information campaigns; social media","Education; Marketing; Time series; Diffusion patterns; information campaigns; Market manipulation; Social implication; Social media; Technical challenges; Temporal shifts; Timing signals; Social networking (online)",2-s2.0-85021772851

In this study, we investigated the roles of body-esteem attribution, the internalization of media models, and body objectification as predictors of three sexting motivations: sexual purposes, body-image reinforcement, and instrumental/aggravated reasons. The participants were 190 Italian adolescents aged from 13 to 20 years old (Mage = 17.4, SDage = 1.8; 44.7% females). Sexual purposes were predicted by body-esteem attribution and body objectification; body-image reinforcement was predicted by the internalization of media models, and instrumental/aggravated reasons were not predicted by any variable. Thus, only sexual purposes and body-image reinforcement appeared to be affected by body-image concerns due to media models. © 2017 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents","Adolescents; Body esteem; Media models; Objectified-body consciousness; Sexting motivations","adolescent; adult; body image; consciousness; female; human; internalization; Italian (citizen); major clinical study; male; motivation; reinforcement; sexting",2-s2.0-85032349779

The experience of the group composed of masonry instructors and master masons averaged five times that of the other groups, their productivity was highest, and the loads on their joints were the lowest. Thus, they were deemed experts in this paper. Inertial measurement units (IMU) and video cameras were used to collect kinematic data of the masons, from which pose clusters were identified. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify masons' poses into expert and inexpert classes based on the relative frequency of poses in the motions used to lay each of 945 masonry units. Two classification scenarios were tested. While both scenarios achieved similar levels of accuracy, 91.23% and 92.04% respectively, the processing time for binary classification was only 13 s compared to 523 s for inter-group multiclass SVM. Like characteristic vibration frequencies in machine diagnostics and system identification, the characteristic poses identified provide insight into differing methods between expert and less experienced masons. For example, results show that experts utilize fewer and more ergonomicaly safe poses, while being more productive, which indicates lower energy expenditure (less wasted motions). The classification method and the poses identified contribute knowledge to help develop affordable mason training systems that utilize IMU and video feedback to improve health and productivity of apprentice masons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Data analytics; Efficiency; Masonry; Musculoskeletal injuries; Safety; Support vector machine; Training","Accident prevention; Classification (of information); Efficiency; Learning systems; Masonry materials; Personnel training; Productivity; Support vector machines; Units of measurement; Video cameras; Binary classification; Classification methods; Concrete masonry units; Data analytics; Inertial measurement unit; Masonry; Musculo-skeletal injuries; Support vector machine algorithm; Gesture recognition",2-s2.0-85030539003

One of these challenges is the implementation of requirements reuse approaches. Although several theoretical proposals exist, little is known about the practices that are currently adopted in industry. Our goal is to contribute to the investigation of the state of the practice in the reuse of requirements, eliciting current practices from practitioners, and their opinions whenever appropriate. Besides reuse in general, we focus on requirement patterns as a particular strategy to reuse. We conducted an exploratory survey based on an online questionnaire. We received 71 responses from requirements engineers with industrial experience in the field, which were analyzed in order to derive observations. Although we found that a high majority of respondents declared some level of reuse in their projects (in particular, non-functional requirements were identified as the most similar and recurrent among projects), it is true that only a minority of them declared such reuse as a regular practice. Larger IT organizations and IT organizations with well-established software processes and methods present higher levels of reuse. Ignorance of reuse techniques and processes is the main reason preventing wider adoption. From the different existing reuse techniques, the simplest ones based on textual copy and subsequent tailoring of former requirements are the most adopted techniques. However, participants who apply reuse more often tend to use more elaborate techniques. Opinions of respondents about the use of requirement patterns show that they can be expected to mitigate problems related to the quality of the resulting requirements, such as lack of uniformity, inconsistency, or ambiguity. The main reasons behind the lack of adoption of requirement patterns by practitioners (in spite of the increasing research approaches proposed in the community) are related to the lack of a well-defined reuse method and involvement of requirement engineers. The results of our paper are interesting for practitioners since we highlight relevant observations from the survey participants’ experiences when deciding to implement requirements reuse practices. We also suggest future lines of research based on the needs pointed out in the results. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Empirical studies; Online questionnaire; Requirement patterns; Requirements engineering; Requirements reuse; Surveys","Requirements engineering; Surveying; Surveys; Empirical studies; Exploratory surveys; Industrial experience; Non-functional requirements; Online questionnaire; Requirement patterns; Requirements reuse; State of the practice; Computer software reusability",2-s2.0-85006476262

We demonstrate also that the language herein proposed, named Building Information Modeling Sensor Language(BIMSL) provides substantial gains of expressiveness and ease of use in developing queries that process sensor data with complex conditions over BIM models. BIMSL is validated with experienced software developers according to a consistent evaluation protocol for DSLs focused on effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, and usability attributes.

We mined data from Instagram, and used generalized linear models with site- A nd country-level deviations to explore which socio-economic, geographical and biological factors explain social media use in sub-Saharan African protected areas. We found that charismatic species richness did not explain social media usage.

Interestingly, protected areas with lower richness in non-charismatic species had more users.

Studies consistently show gap-acceptance difficulties, especially in complex traffic situations such as two-way streets and when vehicles approached rapidly. In this context, the present research was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a vibrotactile device and study older pedestrian's behavior when wearing the wristband designed to help them make safer street-crossing decisions. Method Twenty younger-old participants (age 60–69), 20 older-old participants (age 70–80) and 17 younger adults (age 20–45) carried out a street-crossing task in a simulated two-way traffic environment with and without a vibrotactile wristband delivering warning messages. Results The percentage of decisions that led to collisions with approaching cars decreased significantly when participants wore the wristband. Benefits tended to be greater particularly among very old women, with fewer collisions in the far lane and when vehicles approached rapidly when they wore the wristband. But collisions did not fall to zero, and responses that were in accordance with the wristband advice went up to only 51.6% on average, for all participants. The wristband was nevertheless considered useful and easy to use by all participants. Moreover, behavioral intentions to buy and use such a device in the future were greater in both groups of older participants, but not among the younger adults. Practical applications This haptic device was able to partly compensate for some age-related gap-acceptance difficulties and reduce street-crossing risks for all users. These findings could be fruitfully applied to the design of devices allowing communication between vehicles, infrastructures, and pedestrians. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aging; Haptics; Pedestrians; Safety; Street crossing; Vibrotactile; Virtual environment","Accident prevention; Aging of materials; Pedestrian safety; Vehicles; Virtual reality; Behavioral intention; Haptics; Pedestrians; Street crossing; Traffic environment; Traffic situations; Vibrotactile; Vibrotactile device; Vehicle to vehicle communications",2-s2.0-85030461653

Its basic principle lies in using natural energy resources in an efficient way and yet in reducing risks and impacts on the environment and on human beings throughout the life cycle of a product. Electrodialysis is a membrane separation process which uses an electrical potential difference as a driving force to promote ionic separation in aqueous solutions. The technique was initially developed for the production of drinking water from brackish water. However, the use of electrodialysis in the treatment of industrial wastewaters is becoming more attractive, due to its characteristics. The technique is considered a clean process, since it allows the reuse of water and the recovery of substances. In this work, the advancement of electrodialysis applied to cleaner production in electroplating industry will be discussed. The aim of this work is to present electrodialysis as a technology which can fulfill the requirements of cleaner production concepts in the electroplating industry. The research was performed starting from a predefined question: “how is electrodialysis becoming a cleaner production strategy in the electroplating industry?”. The research was divided in two main themes. The first search was related to the most important cleaner production practices applied for the plating industry. The second search was associated with the electrodialysis application in the electroplating industry. The results obtained from the collected publications were compared in order to propose an answer to the research question. The results showed that almost a half of the published articles evaluated the improvement of the wastewater treatment as a cleaner production strategy to be applied in plating industries. In addition, the wastewater treatment was the most cited application of electrodialysis in the plating industry, especially for copper, nickel and zinc recovery and for chromium VI removal. Results shows that electrodialysis is becoming an important and solid strategy to promote cleaner production in the plating industry. The two most important issues to be improved for this application are the system efficiency for macromolecules and the energy waste when dilute solutions are used. For the latter, the use of hybrid techniques such as electrodeionization was the most evaluated alternative. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Electrodialysis; Electroplating; Wastewater treatment","Chemicals removal (water treatment); Dialysis membranes; Electrodialysis; Electroplating; Electroplating shops; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Industrial water treatment; Metal recovery; Plating; Pollution control; Potable water; Reclamation; Solutions; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Cleaner production; Electrical potential; Electro-deionization; Electroplating industry; Industrial wastewaters; Membrane separation process; Natural energy resources; Preventive strategies; Life cycle",2-s2.0-85018594806

This involves different temporal patterns of coordination of child and parent (and other close relationships) that lead to accumulating regulatory developments that afford benefits for managing illness. This process begins early in infancy through attachment and develops into childhood and adolescence to involve the coordination of parental monitoring and child disclosure that serves as a training ground for the expansion of social relationships beyond the family during emerging adulthood.

The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems.

The dual neural network, which is categorized under the recurrent neural network inherits parallel processing capabilities, are widely investigated for the control of serial manipulators in past decades and has been extended to the control of parallel Stewart platforms in our previous work. However, conventional dual neural network solutions for redundancy resolution requires prior knowledge of the robot, which may not accessible accurately in real applications. In this paper, we establish a model-free dual neural network to control the end-effector of a Stewart platform for the tracking of a desired spacial trajectory, at the same time as learning the unknown time-varying parameters. The proposed model is purely data driven. It does not rely on the system parameters as a priori and provides a new solution for stabilization of the self motion of Stewart platforms. Theoretical analysis and results show that global convergence can be achieved for the neural network employed in this paper with dual dynamics.

At regular time intervals, for each traffic lane, the method calculates the lane-changing-out ratio of vehicles and judges whether a traffic incident has happened. For a traffic-incident lane, entry points and exit points of lane-changing vehicles are considered as positive and negative samples, respectively, then the traffic incident is confirmed further and its position is calculated by searching for the optimal separating surface of the two kinds of samples.

Methods: This pilot study explored six wearers’ and their support persons’ experience of using three different wearable GPS devices (a pendant, watch, and mini GPS phone), each for a two-week period. Results: Participants identified safety as the main value of using a wearable GPS device. The acceptability and value of these devices was strongly influenced by device features, ease of use, cost, appearance, the reliability of the GPS coordinates, the wearer’s health condition and the users familiarity with technology. Overall, participants indicated that they preferred the pendant. Conclusions: Wearable GPS devices are potentially useful in providing individuals who have safety concerns with reassurance and access to assistance as required. To ensure successful utilization, future device design and device selection should consider the user’s familiarity with technology and their health condition. This study also revealed that not all wearable GPS devices provide continuous location tracking.

The findings indicate that the original constructs of TPB model, attitude (ATT), subjective norm (SN) and perceived behavioral control has a positive and significant impact on the customer intention to use Islamic home financing. Furthermore, ATT is found to be the most influential factor in determining the customer intention toward Islamic home financing. On the other hand, we introduced two new factors, pricing on home financing (PHF) and religious belief (RB), which proved their presence in the TPB model by showing a significant impact on the customer intention to use the facility of home financing. In addition, PHF has a negative impact while religious belief has a positive relationship with the customer intention to use Islamic home financing in Pakistan.

In this paper, we argue that the spreading process should be taken into account for identifying the node spreading influence and investigate the effect of the network structure, measured by the clustering coefficient, on the performance of spreading dynamics. Firstly, we generate a series of networks with tunable clustering coefficients. Then, taking into account the spreading process, we explore the performances among the Dynamics-sensitive (DS) index and the degree, between, closeness, eigenvector indices. Comparing with the Susceptible–Infective–Removed (SIR) model, the extensive results show that, for different spreading time steps and clustering coefficients, the DS centrality outperforms the performance, τ>0.97, of degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector measures. Moreover, the accuracy of closeness and eigenvector centrality is similar and conducts better in networks with larger spreading rate β=0.20,τ>0.93. As the clustering coefficient increases, all the performances decrease but DS centrality with least percent of 1.16 at most under β=0.10, and Closeness with the largest percent of 9.75 under β=0.05.

Traditional experimental approaches used for fiber reinforced composites have been widely applied to study CNT's-cement composites; nevertheless, high statistical dispersions and conflicting reports have been found to be a common issue due to the nanometric nature of CNT's. This review presents a critical analysis of the most commonly used techniques to test CNT's-cement composites, opening the discussion of the necessity of specific testing standardization for the development of the technology. Topics such as CNT's dispersion and measurement of mechanical performance, electromagnetic properties and durability of CNT's-cement composites are addressed. It is concluded that the benefits of CNT's in cement composites have been fairly identified, but the mechanisms by which nanotubes maintain dispersion within the matrix, interact with hydrating cement, and modify properties of composites are not yet fully understood. Understanding these mechanisms is considered of most importance to identify the limitations of CNT's-cement composites and define which applications are achievable with the use of CNT's. Better characterization of the interaction between CNT's and hydration products at the nanoscale is required to develop more efficient composites, targeting the enhancement of multiple properties at the same time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bridge effect; Calcium-silicate-hidrate; Cement composite; Dispersion; Durability; Hydration kinetics; Piezoresistivity","Carbon; Cements; Composite materials; Dispersion (waves); Durability; Fiber reinforced plastics; Hydration; Nanotubes; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive waste vitrification; Silicates; Yarn; Bridge effects; Cement composite; Electromagnetic properties; Fiber reinforced composites; Hydration kinetics; Micro-structural characterization; Piezoresistivity; Properties of composites; Carbon nanotubes",2-s2.0-85026896198

This process suggests the selective breaking of metallic bonds to release gold from its substrate without grinding stages or pollutants generation. Waste printed circuit boards were analyzed to determinate base metals (Ni, Fe, Cu) and gold (Au) using microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. After chemical characterization, aqueous commercial grade ammonium persulfate was used to produce the persulfate anion (S2O8 2−) and the oxidative sulfate ion (SO4 2−), which partially oxidized and leached the base metals breaking the Au–Ni–Fe–Cu bonds and allowing gold to be recovered in its original non-leaching state. The influence of oxygen and pressure in the base metals oxidation and gold recovery were separately studied in two different oxidative systems and evaluated by analysis of variance. Firstly, the system S2O8 2−/O2 was studied under the addition of oxygen (0.1–1.0 L/min) with (NH4)2S2O8 concentration (0.66–1.31 M), and liquid/solid ratio (15–25 mL/g). Secondly, the system S2O8 2−/Pressure was evaluated increasing pressure (101–203 kPa) with (NH4)2S2O8 concentration (0.66–1.31 M), and liquid/solid ratio (15–25 mL/g). The recovery of gold was made using optimal conditions and reaction times of 30 min in the S2O8 2−/O2 system and 5 min in the S2O8 2−/Pressure system. At those reaction times, gold was recovered in its solid state and was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. The findings presented in this paper suggest that the oxidative reaction produced by the system S2O8 2−/Pressure could be applied to release and recover gold from e-waste with an effective reduction of the agent consumption and minimum time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electronic waste; Gold recovery; Oxygen; Persulfate; Pressure; Selective oxidation","Ammonium persulfate; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Electronic equipment; Electronic Waste; Emission spectroscopy; Leaching; Metal recovery; Metals; Nickel; Oxidation; Oxygen; Pressure; Printed circuit boards; Recovery; Scanning electron microscopy; Timing circuits; Wastes; Activated persulfate; Chemical characterization; Electronic waste (e waste); Gold recoveries; Influence of oxygen; Persulfate; Selective oxidation; Waste printed circuit board; Gold",2-s2.0-85029417816

This study proposed an integrated and environment-friendly technology for recycling waste tantalum capacitors (WTCs) of WPCBs. Firstly, the WTCs were treated by argon pyrolysis to decompose mold resin. The pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C and holding time for 30 min were considered as the optimal parameters. Then, the pyrolysis residues were performed by crush and magnetic separation to recover nickel-iron terminals. Finally, chloride metallurgy (CM) was used to recover rare metal tantalum (Ta). The Ta recovery rate could reach 92.87 ± 0.36%. The optimal parameters were determined as temperature of 493 °C, adding FeCl2·4H2O of 53 wt% and holding time for 150 min based on the response surface methodology (RSM).

However, for some diseases like schistosomiasis, a widespread parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma worms, accounting for heterogeneity is crucial to both characterize long-term dynamics and evaluate opportunities for disease control. Elaborating on the classic Macdonald model for macroparasite transmission, we analyze families of models including explicit descriptions of heterogeneity related to differential transmission risk within a community, water contact patterns, the distribution of the snail host population, human mobility, and the seasonal fluctuations of the environment. Through simple numerical examples, we show that heterogeneous multigroup communities may be more prone to schistosomiasis than homogeneous ones, that the availability of multiple water sources can hinder parasite transmission, and that both spatial and temporal heterogeneities may have nontrivial implications for disease endemicity. Finally, we discuss the implications of heterogeneity for disease control.

We argue that mobile payments should be understood in the context of changing consumption practices and the wider problematic of the consumer subject in International Political Economy. One (managerialist) view of these changes suggests that certain ‘immaterial’ values in brands, logos or networks can become an important element in economic growth. Thus, businesses increasingly craft user experiences to realise brand value as the indicator of future consumption, for example, Facebook, Netflix. Against this view, the critical literature has underlined how the customer relationship should be understood as an element in corporate power; enticing consumer subjects to dedicate their social lives to the task of monetisation. Rather than choose between sides of this dichotomy, we suggest it may be more fruitful to reflect upon the unanticipated potentialities of mobile payments. By reflecting on the sociality of money, we move beyond a simple cost-benefit analysis, or a structural determinism, to emphasise the contingency of market subjects, questioning how to think about the relationship between consumer subjects, on the one hand, and and a putatively impersonal (yet palpable) global economy, on the other. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer subjectivity; Cultural Political Economy; digitalization; International Political Economy; mobile money; mobile payments","consumption behavior; corporate strategy; global economy; mobile phone; political economy; social network; Malus x domestica",2-s2.0-85016468291

The current study investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of LiveOCDFree, an App designed to help OCD patients conduct exposure and response prevention (ERP). Twenty-one participants with mild to moderate symptoms of OCD were enrolled in a 12-week open trial of App-guided self-help ERP. Self-report assessments of OCD, depression, anxiety, and quality of life were completed at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. App-guided ERP was a feasible and acceptable self-help intervention for individuals with OCD, with high rates of retention and satisfaction. Participants reported significant improvement in OCD and anxiety symptoms pre- to post-treatment. Findings suggest that LiveOCDFree is a feasible and acceptable self-help intervention for OCD.

The rats in the experimental group were exposed to 2.4 GHz RFR emitted from a Wi-Fi generator for 24 h/day for one year. The same procedure was applied to the rats in the sham group, except that the Wi-Fi generator was turned off. All groups were kept in Faraday cages during the 12 months to eliminate external electromagnetic fields. The distance between the Wi-Fi generator antenna and the exposure cages was 50 cm. Pre-exposure distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) of all rats were measured at the beginning, 6th and 12th months of the study. The DPOAE values of the sham, baseline and exposure groups were compared statistically. For the 6000 Hz hearing frequency, the DPOAE values in the exposure group were lower than those in the sham group (p < 0.05). Similarly, the 6000 Hz hearing frequency values obtained at the end of the 12th month were also lower than the baseline and 6-month values in the exposure group (p < 0.05). In contrast, the DPOAE values at the 6th and 12th months of exposure for the 2000 Hz hearing frequency were higher than the baseline value (p < 0.05).

Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the façades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their façade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","GSV (Google Street View); image features; machine learning; urban land-use mapping",,2-s2.0-85020716375

To examine the effects of contextual advertising in games, the present article affords two independent experiments investigating how positive and negative game contexts influence players’ memories and attitudes with respect to brands advertised via billboards in games. Drawing from literature on the limited capacity model, the authors demonstrate that positive and negative game contexts decrease brand memory since they require a high level of cognitive effort. The authors also find that varying a game context influence the perception of brands advertised in the game via the contextual priming mechanism and that positive contexts generate more positive brand attitudes than negative or neutral contexts.

This self-similarity can be measured by either the power-law exponent or the ht-index, which is a recently proposed method for characterizing the fractal nature of geographic features. Although increasingly popular in geography, the ht-index is not sensitive to changes or evolutions of fractals, limiting its usefulness as an alternative “fractal dimension” to the power-law exponent. Two improvements to the ht-index were suggested in the literature, namely, the cumulative rate of growth (the CRG index) and the ratio of areas in a rank-size plot (the RA index). The CRG index is sensitive but not monotonic, however, with respect to the evolution of fractals. The RA index is both sensitive and monotonic but not interpretable in fractal terms. In this article, two novel metrics, referred to as unified metrics, are proposed by combining advantages of the ht-index and all of its improvements, being simultaneously easy to interpret, monotonic with respect to the evolution of fractals, and sensitive to changes in the evolution. The usefulness of unified metrics was demonstrated by both numerical experiments and case studies. Given that the idea behind the ht-index has led to a relaxed, emerging popular definition of fractals, the proposed unified metrics have great potential to be used as the standard fractal dimension along with such a definition. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.","fractal; head/tail breaks; heavy-tailed distribution; ht-index; scaling structure","algorithm; computer simulation; fractal analysis; numerical model; outlier; power law",2-s2.0-85020236702

People now have increasingly rich, digital records of highly personal data about what they said, did, and felt in the past. But social science research shows that people have difficulty in tracking and regulating their emotions. New reflective technologies that promote constructive analysis of rich personal data potentially offer transformative ways that individuals might better understand themselves and improve well-being. However, there are important system design challenges in supporting effective reflection about personal data. We explore fidelity in recording and representing past personal mood data, and forecasting future actions, feelings, and thoughts. Much prior personal informatics work has been dedicated to past-centric tools for recording and capture. In contrast, forecasting examines how we might use such past data to inform and motivate our future selves, providing recommendations about remedial actions to improve future well-being. Fidelity addresses both how and what reflective systems should show people about their pasts, in particular whether we should filter negative past experiences. To inform reflective system design, we examine forecasting and fidelity in controlled field trial interventions that explore two novel system designs for presenting and reflecting on mood data. We detail findings from 165 participants, 4,693 participant logfiles, 65 surveys, and 15 user interviews. Our novel forecasting system, EmotiCal, uses past mood data to model and visualize future user moods with the goal of encouraging participants to adopt remedial new behaviors to regulate negative moods before they occur. Such forecasting both improved mood and subsequent emotional self-awareness compared with controls who simply monitored their past. Consistent with system goals, interview responses also indicated that participants generated important insights into behaviors that affect their moods. Our second intervention examined filtering; it assessed the impact on well-being of recording and revisiting past experiences containing negative emotions. We compared participants who were encouraged to record and reflect on positive versus negative experiences. Long-term measures of happiness and ruminative behaviors improved by recording and reflecting on positive but not negative experiences, although this depended on the intensity of the negative experience. We discuss general design and theory implications for future systems that support monitoring, reflection, and forecasting to facilitate productive examination of our emotional lives.

Areas covered: For our update we collected available studies via PubMed searches. This review highlights that already consulting of the patient is able to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks. Relaxation techniques, especially progressive muscle relaxation, and various types of biofeedback are effective, as is the implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy. However, recent reviews also point to some existing inconsistencies and methodological limitations. The advent of modern information technology based approaches (e.g. online therapy, smartphone applications) further advanced the arsenal of behavioral treatment regimes. The combination of behavioral treatment options and the combination with pharmacotherapy lead to additive effects. In modern multidisciplinary treatment approaches, behavioral therapy is an indispensable component. Expert commentary: Behavioral treatment in prophylaxis of migraine is as effective as pharmacological treatment with additional effects when pharmacological and behavioral treatment is applied in combination. Novel treatment approaches using online technology and electronic devices offer interesting options that will spread more in the future. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behavioral treatment; biofeedback; counselling; endurance sports; migraine; Relaxation",,2-s2.0-85030851652

This secondary analysis was conducted among the entire cohort (N = 200) of women, irrespective of randomization status. We assessed whether cHTC attendance, early disclosure of HIV-positive status, and partner ART reminders were associated with retention and adherence at one month after starting treatment. Retention was defined as attending HIV clinic follow-up within one day of running out of pills. Adherence was defined as taking ≥95% of ARTs by pill count. We used binomial regression to calculate adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Median female age was 26 years. Most women (79%) were retained; of these, 68% were adherent. Receiving cHTC was associated with improved retention (aRR 1.33, 95% CI 1.12, 1.59). Receiving male partner ART reminders was weakly associated with retention (aRR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96, 1.39). Disclosure within one day was not associated with retention (aRR 1.08, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.28). Among those who were retained, these three behaviors were not associated with improved 95% adherence.

This technology enables transfer of data directly into computer applications and cross-references to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps, which enhances assessment of coverage and trends. Objective Utilization of these systems in low and middle income countries is currently limited, particularly for immunization coverage assessments and polio vaccination campaigns. We piloted the use of this system and discussed its potential to improve the efficiency of field-based health providers and health managers for monitoring of the immunization program. Methods Using “30 × 7” WHO sampling technique, a survey of children less than five years of age was conducted in random clusters of Karachi, Pakistan in three high risk towns where a polio case was detected in 2011. Center point of the cluster was calculated by the application on the mobile. Data and location coordinates were collected through a mobile phone. This data was linked with an automated mHealth based monitoring system for monitoring of Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) in Karachi. After each SIA, a visual report was generated according to the coordinates collected from the survey. Result A total of 3535 participants consented to answer to a baseline survey. We found that the mobile phones incorporated with GIS maps can improve efficiency of health providers through real-time reporting and replacing paper based questionnaire for collection of data at household level.

Very few literature on mobile phone use in indigenous communities in the Philippines has been written. Currently, there are no indigeneity-segregated data on mobile phone use in the country. Even mobile phone use in rural Philippines remains understudied. The country is home to 110 groups of indigenous peoples (IP) with 126 distinct languages and very diverse traditions and practices. The Cordillera mountain range in the northern part of the Philippines is recognized as the traditional domain of the Igorot, or people of the mountains. Its geopolitical location, the Cordillera Administrative Region, has one of the densest populations of indigenous peoples in the country. Under the label Igorot are a number of indigenous communities that has embraced the label as a form of resistance. The paper focuses on three indigenous communities in Mountain Province: (1) Barangay Laylaya, Besao, an Applai community that speaks the Western Kankana-ey language, the farthest with only one transport vehicle that leaves the village very early in the morning and returns late in the afternoon; (2) Payag-eo, Suyo, an Applai community that also speaks the Western Kankana-ey language; politically part of the tourist destination Sagada but is completely cut-off in terms of transport accessibility and is closer to the Bontok tribe geographically; and (3) Guina-ang, Bontoc, with people from the Bontok tribe who speaks iGuina-ang, one of the variations of the Bontok language, the village is an hour away from the provincial center where branches of national offices are housed and major trade activities take place. Guided by the culture-centered approach, an alternative lens built on the notion that understanding and negotiating meanings are embedded within cultural contexts and values, the paper looks into how mobile phones has affected, mediated, manifested and complicated the indigeneity of the Igorot. Specifically, it discusses how the indigenous social code inayan/nga-ag permeated the community's use of their mobile phones. From simple “Do not bring your mobile phones on the table.” to more morally imposing “Do not use your mobile phone for indecent and illicit acts.” This concept of inayan remains integral to the Igorot culture and is now intertwined with their use of their mobile phones. And as the Applai and Bontok Igorot struggle to keep their lifeways and traditions intact, the mobile phone continues to both facilitate this and at the same time get in the way. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Applai; Bontok; Culture-centered approach; Igorot; Inayan; Indigenous media; Indigenous peoples; Indigenous social code; Mobile phone taboo; Mobile phones","Codes (symbols); Global system for mobile communications; Landforms; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Rural areas; Telephone sets; Applai; Bontok; Igorot; Inayan; Indigenous media; Indigenous people; Indigenous social code; Cellular telephones",2-s2.0-85002918186

This development is motivated by the increasing interest in using industrial robots to replace human operators for percussive impact riveting in aerospace assembly. In percussive riveting, the rivet gun generates repetitive impacts acting on the rivet. These impacts not only deform the rivet but also induce forced vibration to the robot, and thus the robot must hold the gun firmly during riveting. The process parameters for the mobile robotic riveting system include those related to the impact force generation for planning the rivet gun input and those related to the robot pose with respect to the joined panels for planning the mobile platform motion. These parameters are incorporated into a structural dynamic model of the robot under a periodic impact force. Then an approximate analytical solution is formulated to calculate the displacement of the rivet gun mounted on the end effector for its misalignment evaluation. It is found that both the force frequency and the mobile platform position have strong influence on the robotic riveting performance in terms of alignment during operation. Global optimization of these process parameters is carried out to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed method for the planning of the robotic percussive riveting system. © 2017 by ASME.",,"Flexible manipulators; Global optimization; Industrial robots; Mobile phones; Riveting; Rivets; Robotics; Robots; Structural dynamics; Approximate analytical solutions; Flexible joints; Forced vibration; Human operator; Mobile platform; Mobile robotic; Process parameter optimization; Process parameters; Robot programming",2-s2.0-85029162625

Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between three age groups (18-29 years, 30-50 years, and 51+ years), technology access, and motivators and barriers to participating in mHealth research. Sixty-five percent of men owned a smartphone and a laptop. Men aged 18 to 29 years were more likely willing to use a health app and smartwatch/wristband monitor than older men (p <.01). Men aged 18 to 29 years were also more likely than older men to be motivated to participate for a free cell phone/upgraded data plan and contribution to the greater good (p <.05). Older men were more likely than younger ones to be motivated to become more educated about the topic (p <.05). Younger men were more likely than older ones to report lack of interest in the topic as a barrier to participating (p <.01), while older men were more likely than younger ones to cite lack of research targeted to minority communities as a barrier (p <.05). This study suggests that culturally tailored mHealth research using smartphones may be of interest to AA men interested in risk reduction and chronic disease self-management. Opportunities also exist to educate AA men about the topic at hand and why minority men are being targeted for the programs and interventions. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Black/African American men; mobile health; mobile phone; telemedicine",,2-s2.0-85032472824

Methods This was a two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomised controlled trial with assessments at baseline and six months follow-up. Subjects in both groups received tailored mobile phone text messages to support smoking cessation for 3 months, and the option of registering for a program incorporating strategies for smoking cessation centred around a self-defined quit date. Subjects in the integrated intervention group also received tailored feedback regarding their consumption of alcohol and, for binge drinkers, tailored mobile phone text messages encouraging them to maintain their drinking within low-risk limits over a 3-month period. Primary outcome measures were the 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence and change in cigarette consumption. Results In 360 Swiss vocational and upper secondary school classes, 2127 students who smoked tobacco regularly and owned a mobile phone were invited to participate in the study. Of these, 1471 (69.2%) participated and 6-month follow-up data were obtained for 1116 (75.9%). No significant group differences were observed for any of the primary or secondary outcomes. Moderator analyses revealed beneficial intervention effects concerning 7-day smoking abstinence in participants with higher versus lower alcohol consumption. Conclusions Overall, the integrated smoking cessation and alcohol intervention exhibited no advantages over a smoking cessation only intervention, but it might be more effective for the subgroup of adolescent smokers with higher alcohol consumption. Providing a combined smoking cessation and alcohol intervention might be recommended for adolescent smokers with higher-level alcohol consumption. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Adolescents; Alcohol; Mobile phone; Text messaging; Tobacco",,2-s2.0-85029392377

To ensure the comfort of exercise, wearable health monitoring devices are the most lucrative for real-time and continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, which is essential for making individualized fitness plans and avoiding the occurrence of cardiac arrest. Moreover, the ECG monitoring data obtained are instrumental in the computation of the individual lactate threshold heart rate, which is the inflection point of the heart rate-time curve and indicates the exercise intensity level, at which the blood concentration of lactate and lactic acid begins to exponentially increase and will result in overstraining, unless the exercise efforts (running speed or muscle intensity) are temporarily reduced. The respective monitoring and overstrain-warning devices have a large potential for the individual assessment of the endurance performance, as well as for prescribing intensities in the endurance training. However, the common drawbacks of commercial wearable devices used in healthcare and medical fields for continuous monitoring of ECG, electroencephalogram, respiration, temperature, SpO2, and human activity, such as smart helmets, wearable patches, and activity-tracking bands, are motion artifacts and unstable skin-electrode contact, which jeopardize the accurate measurements during exercise. Given this, the Health shirt (H-shirt) integrated with conductive fabric ECG electrodes enabling the accurate ECG monitoring during physical exercise has been introduced and validated by the authors. In this paper, the modified design of the sports H-shirt with the lactate threshold heart rate computing is proposed and implemented. High elasticity of the H-shirt not only ensures a stable skin-electrode contact but also avoids the discomfort caused by the measurement. A highly integrated printed circuit board is used to filter, amplify, digitalize, and transmit the ECG signal sampled from the electrodes, while a high input impedance amplifier circuit is designed to improve its signal-to-noise ratio. The Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is used as the data transmission protocol between the H-shirt and the mobile phone. A mobile phone-based ECG analysis and exercise evaluation platform have been developed, which allow one to detect six types of abnormal ECG (tachycardia, bradycardia, a dropped beat, premature beat, bigeminy, and trigeminy) and individual lactate threshold, as well as to provide real-time health warning and exercise optimization hints through mobile phone voice messages. Being powered by a 150 mAh 3.7 V lithium battery, the H-shirt operated for at least 24 h and was tested on four volunteers of both genders and age from 14 to 32 years, whose ECG and the lactate threshold heart rate values were accurately measured during their test exercise on a treadmill with running speed up to 16 km/h and used as a reference for the users to adjust their exercise intensity. The available options of adding sensors for measurement of more physiological parameters by the proposed sports H-shirt make it quite lucrative for the rehabilitation exercise monitoring. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Accurate; Exercise ECG; H-shirt; Lactate threshold; Wearable","Cellular telephones; Electrocardiography; Electrodes; Health; Heart; Lactic acid; Lithium batteries; mHealth; Mobile phones; Monitoring; Physiological models; Printed circuit boards; Signal to noise ratio; Sports; Telephone sets; Wearable technology; Accurate; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Data transmission protocols; H-shirt; Health monitoring devices; Lactate threshold; Physiological parameters; Wearable; Biomedical signal processing",2-s2.0-85020774630

This study analyzed system logs recorded by a Learning Management System in which 59 computer science students participated in a blended learning course to learn mobile phone programming. The results revealed several significant findings. First, the students viewed the learning materials related to their classroom lectures (i.e., lecture slides and video lectures) for longer and more often than other learning materials (i.e., shared assignments and posted messages). Second, although the students spent a great deal of time viewing the online learning materials, most did not use annotation tools. Third, students’ viewing behaviors showed great variety and were clustered into three behavior patterns: “consistent use students” who intensively used all of the learning materials, “slide intensive use students” who intensively used the lecture slides, and “less use students” who infrequently used any learning material. These different behavior patterns were also associated with their motivation and learning performance.

The controllers can be viewed as financial advisors for an individual's resource allocation problem, which is modeled as a nonlinear discrete time stochastic system with income uncertainties, asset losses, and constraints on cash flow and credit. We introduce a model predictive controller (MPC) and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and compare them with a benchmark method employed in finance and economics, stochastic dynamic programming (DP). Both MPC and PID produce similar consistency in financial management compared with DP. They also offer the advantage of low computational complexity relative to DP, which allows us to efficiently perform assessments of robustness (reliability) and disturbance rejection (e.g., effects of uncertainties), both of which are of significant practical engineering importance. In addition, this flexibility enables us to uncover the system's properties, such as the existence of a 'poverty trap' caused by constraints in the control space and dynamics. The effectiveness of a PID-based aid intervention for low-skilled and low-endowed agents that lie within the trap is assessed and contrasted with other existing cash transfer programs, with results that support a further implementation analysis. These assessments constitute a novel application of feedback controllers that, besides effectively dealing with scarcity constraints, present practical advantages that are shown to translate into an ability to implement the MPC or PID controller in a variety of ways for low-income individuals via computer-assistive methods (e.g., a cell phone). © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Feedback control; model predictive control (MPC); poverty trap; proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control; reliability; safety net","Controllers; Disturbance rejection; Dynamic programming; Economics; Feedback control; Finance; Mobile phones; Predictive control systems; Proportional control systems; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Implementation analysis; Low computational complexity; Model predictive controllers; Nonlinear discrete-time; Practical engineering; Proportional integral derivative controllers; Resource allocation problem; Stochastic dynamic programming; Feedback",2-s2.0-85003666437

However, these conventional schemes disclose to the verifier the complete plaintext location and thus jeopardize users' privacy.

These algorithms are evaluated in environments of different structure, focusing on problems commonly encountered when a mobile device camera is used. The conclusions drawn from this evaluation are guidelines to design the FastABLE system, which is based on the ABLE-M algorithm but introduces major modifications to the concept of image matching. The improvements radically cut down the processing time and improve scalability, making it possible to localize the user in long image sequences with the limited computing power of a mobile device. The resulting place recognition system compares favorably to both the ABLE-M and the FAB-MAP solutions in the context of real-time personal localization. © 2017, The Author(s).","Indoor localization; Mobile localization; Visual place recognition","Indoor positioning systems; Computing power; Different structure; Image sequence; Indoor localization; M-algorithms; Mobile localization; Place recognition; Processing time; Mobile devices",2-s2.0-85019660749

The key challenge of enabling incentives is to effectively track the value of a message under such a unique network setting with intermittent connectivity and multiple interest data types. We propose two data dissemination models: the data pulling model where mobile users pull data from data providers, and the data pushing model where data providers generate personalized data and push them to the intended users. For data pulling, we present effective mechanisms to estimate the expected credit reward of a message that helps intermediate nodes to evaluate the potential reward of it. Nodal message communication is formulated as a two-person cooperative game, whose solution is found by a heuristic approach which achieves Pareto optimality. Under the data pushing model, ""virtual checks"" are introduced to eliminate the needs of accurate knowledge about whom and how many credits data providers should pay. The check buying process is formulated as an online auction model to further accelerate the circulation of credits. Extensive simulations carried out based on real-world traces show the proposed schemes achieve better performance than fully cooperative scheme, but significantly reduce communication cost. © 2017 IEEE.","autonomous mobile social networks; data dissemination; Incentive; optimal stopping theory; secretary problem; two-person cooperative game","Game theory; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Pareto principle; Social networking (online); Cooperative game; Data dissemination; Incentive; Mobile social networks; Optimal stopping theories; Secretary problem; Cooperative communication",2-s2.0-85032274059

In such scenarios, hand gestures offer some unique capabilities for human–robot interaction inherent to nonverbal communication with features and application scenarios not possible with the currently predominant vision-based systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and develop an effective inertial-sensor-based system, worn by the user, along with a microprocessor and wireless module for communication with the robot at distances of up to 250 m. Possible features describing hand-gesture dynamics are introduced and their feasibility is demonstrated in an off-line scenario by using several classification methods (e.g., random forests and artificial neural networks). Refined motion features are then used in K-means unsupervised clustering for motion primitive extraction, which forms the motion strings used for real-time classification. The system demonstrated an F1 score of 90.05% with the possibility of gesture spotting and null class classification (e.g., undefined gestures were discarded from the analysis).

It is of interest to find optimal assignments of tasks to local and remote devices that can take into account the application-specific profile, availability of computational resources, and link connectivity, and find a balance between energy consumption costs of mobile devices and latency for delay-sensitive applications. We formulate an NP-hard problem to minimize the application latency while meeting prescribed resource utilization constraints. Different from most of existing works that either rely on the integer programming solver, or on heuristics that offer no theoretical performance guarantees, we propose HERMES, a novel fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). We identify for a subset of problem instances, where the application task graphs can be described as serial trees, HERMES provides a solution with latency no more than (1+ϵ) times of the minimum while incurring complexity that is polynomial in problem size and 1. We further propose an online algorithm to learn the unknown dynamic environment and guarantee that the performance gap compared to the optimal strategy is bounded by a logarithmic function with time. Evaluation is done by using real data set collected from several benchmarks, and is shown that HERMES improves the latency by 16 percent compared to a previously published heuristic and increases CPU computing time by only 0.4 percent of overall latency. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","approximation algorithms; computational offloading; Mobile cloud computing; on-line learning","Approximation algorithms; Cloud computing; Computational complexity; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Mobile cloud computing; Polynomial approximation; Polynomials; Trees (mathematics); computational offloading; Computational resources; Delay-sensitive applications; Fully polynomial time approximation schemes; Logarithmic functions; Online learning; Resourceconstrained devices; Theoretical performance; Optimization",2-s2.0-85032296153

Economic analysis shows that with the actual product price (14 €/kg) only the process, in which solution recirculation is present, provides a return on the investment. Positive gain is possible if the plant works at its highest capacity and if the price growths up to 20 €/kg the gain increases about 20% of operating costs (process with recirculation, 2 batch/day).

We fit Bayesian and classical multinomial logistic regression models to test if the intervention improved adherence with scheduled appointments. Main results Among the 953 predominantly African American and Hispanic/Latino patients, 475 patients were randomly selected to receive a language-congruent, human reminder call, while 478 were assigned to receive no prior contact, (after we excluded 10 patients, scheduled for repeat appointments).

Since the data communication and services occur on a variety of devices, which not only include traditional computing environments and mobile devices such as smartphones, but also household appliances, embedded devices, and sensor nodes, the security requirements are becoming increasingly important at this point in time. Already, in the case of mobile applications, security has emerged as a new issue, as the dissemination and use of mobile applications have been rapidly expanding. This software, including IoT services and mobile applications, is continuously exposed to malicious attacks by hackers, because it exchanges data in the open Internet environment. The security weaknesses of this software are the direct cause of software breaches causing serious economic loss. In recent years, the awareness that developing secure software is intrinsically the most effective way to eliminate the software vulnerability, rather than strengthening the security system of the external environment, has increased. Therefore, methodology based on the use of secure coding rules and checking tools is attracting attention to prevent software breaches in the coding stage to eliminate the above vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a compiler and a virtual machine with secure software concepts for developing secure and trustworthy services for IoT environments. By using a compiler and virtual machine, we approach the problem in two stages: a prevention stage, in which the secure compiler removes the security weaknesses from the source code during the application development phase, and a monitoring stage, in which the secure virtual machine monitors abnormal behavior such as buffer overflow attacks or untrusted input data handling while applications are running. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Compiler construction; IoT services; Program analysis; S/W weakness; Secure software; Virtual machine","Application programs; Codes (symbols); Computer programming; Data handling; Domestic appliances; Internet; Internet of things; Losses; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Personal computing; Sensor nodes; Compiler construction; Iot services; Program analysis; S/W weakness; Secure software; Virtual machines; Program compilers",2-s2.0-84964597300

We sought to describe the main purpose of commonly available renal diet apps and to quantify the accuracy of information, technical quality, and health literacy demand of renal diet apps. Design The design was content analysis. All eligible renal diet apps in the Australian Apple App Store, Google Play, Windows Phone, and Blackberry App World were evaluated. Subjects Eligible apps were in English and were related to kidney disease in humans (of any type or stage). Exclusion criteria included apps which were prohibited because of password protection. Main Outcome Measure Renal diet information in the apps was compared with evidence-based guidelines for the management of kidney disease to quantify information accuracy. App information was evaluated using the Silberg Scale. Technical quality and health literacy demand were evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale. Results A total of 21 apps were eligible for evaluation. The main purpose of these apps was to provide food and nutrition information (57.1%) or for educative purposes for CKD patients (38.1%). Only 47.6% (10/21) of apps contained accurate evidence-based information. Overall, app technical quality was considered acceptable (mean Mobile Application Rating Scale score 3.19 ± 0.35 out of 5), with 80.9% of apps scoring acceptable or greater for app technical quality. Scores for health literacy demand also indicated that most apps (15/21, 71.4%) were acceptable. Conclusions A range of apps currently exist that may provide individuals with CKD with useful food and nutrition information or increase their knowledge of the renal diet. These apps are also mainly of acceptable technical quality and health literacy demand. However, caution is required when using renal diet apps because more than half of the apps evaluated were not accurate and evidence based. © 2017 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-85032026842

Two sets of questionnaires were developed, piloted and refined, and then were administered to 52 instructors and 319 students from various universities throughout Taiwan. Statistical analysis of the data included descriptive data, t test, and a one-way ANOVA. The results indicated that both the instructors and students had high levels of perception and acceptance toward M-learning for EFL. A positive relationship between perception and acceptance was perceived with the level of perception positively associated with the acceptance of M-learning. Analysis of the results indicated significant differences in terms of participants’ background characteristics. Most notably, the younger the instructor, the higher the level of perception and acceptance of M-learning. Finally, several pedagogical implications were made toward M-learning and it is the responsibility of the EFL educators to integrate M-learning into their classrooms and made M-learning available for their students. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Acceptance; English as a foreign language (EFL); Instructors; Mobile learning (M-learning); Perception; Students","E-learning; Sensory perception; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Acceptance; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Higher education; Instructors; M-Learning; Mobile Learning; Mobile Technology; One-way anova; Education",2-s2.0-84988416216

Surgical instruments and sutures can be purchased (or loaned from another department), but the most expensive and space-occupying device is the microscope. In developing countries, microscopes are used where they are needed most, in operating rooms. Furthermore, a conventional microscope is not portable. For all of these reasons, the availability of microscopes for training microsurgery is limited. Method We used a coffee cup and smartphone (CCS) as a training device instead of a microscope. The coffee cup was the base, and the smartphone functioned to magnify, illuminate, and visualize objects. We measured 2 residents’ performance on end-to-end artificial bypass before and after 5 days of CCS-based training. Results We were able to quickly set up the environment for practicing microsurgical skills in any surrounding. After 5 days of training with CCS we could see significant development of microsurgical performance with a conventional microscope as well. The learning curve was dependent on baseline performance. Conclusion CCS is efficient, mobile, and easy to set up. Even though our smartphone-based training was in 2 dimensions, we could improve our microsurgical performance with conventional microscopes, which have 3-dimensional capability. CCS also provides an easy method to record one's microsurgical training. CCS improved both of the subjects’ microsurgical performance, making it a good alternative for a traditional microscope. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Developing countries; Microsurgery; Residency; Smartphone; Training","Article; human; learning curve; microscope; microsurgery; neurosurgery; residency education; skill; smartphone; surgical training; tactile feedback",2-s2.0-85028509788

RP-trees integrates an R-tree index and a boolean expression index together, can efficiently and simultaneously prune boolean expressions and spatial dimensions. RP-trees is also extensible to support complex environment such as prefix-matching and subscriptions in format of CNF and DNF. Our experimental results show that RP-trees achieves good performance on a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets (58 city and ebay). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Boolean expressions; Location-aware pub/sub; OTO","Cellular telephone systems; Decision trees; Forestry; Smartphones; Boolean expressions; Complex environments; Mobile Internet; Prefix matching; Pub/sub; Publish/subscribe; Real-world datasets; Spatial dimension; Location",2-s2.0-85012225000

In heart failure (HF), mHealth has been associated with improved self-management and quality of life. However, it is known that older adults continue to lag behind their younger counterparts when it comes to mobile technology adoption. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to examine factors that influence intention to use mHealth among older adults with HF. Methods: An adapted Technology Acceptance Model was used to guide this cross-sectional, correlational study. Convenience sampling was used to identify participants from a large university hospital and online. Results: A total of 129 older adults with HF participated in the study. Social influence (β = 0.17, P =.010), perceived ease of use (β = 0.16, P <.001), and perceived usefulness (β = 0.33, P <.001) were significantly associated with intention to use mHealth even after controlling for potential confounders (age, gender, race, education, income, and smartphone use). Perceived financial cost and eHealth literacy were not significantly associated with intention to use mHealth. Conclusions: Researchers should consider using the participatory approach in developing their interventions to ensure that their mHealth-based interventions will not only address the patient's HF self-management needs but also be easy enough to use even for those who are less technology savvy. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

On the one side, interactive kiosks and smart mirrors make use of dedicated devices and software to explain, configure, and recommend products. On the other side, computer programs – so-called apps – are installed on the consumer's own device for the same purpose. They can be used at home, or – if installed on a mobile device – in retail outlets or on the move. In all cases, augmented reality (AR) can support these purposes by placing virtual content (e.g. new furniture) in a real environment (the consumer's home). The overall perception and acceptance toward such interactive technologies are discussed in this paper. Users' perceptions and experiences are measured by applying a modified technology acceptance model (TAM). Four experiments, two with marker-based and two with markerless AR apps are presented to support the generalization of the results, the measurement models and the measurement approach. The results are satisfactory with regard to the robustness of the TAM model. However, the relative importance of hedonic (enjoyment, pleasure, fun) and utilitarian (information) aspects varies for different kinds of AR apps and has to be considered for improvement to occur.

For this purpose, the microstrip double square loop MDSL is modified in the first stage. As for the second stage, an FSS array (2 × 2) is built up arranging the unit MDSLs in a periodic structure and finally these FSS unit arrays are fixed perpendicularly covering the aperture of a ridged horn antenna which is a part of the available radar system operating between 0.5 and 3 GHz in our laboratory, to construct an integrated module having both bandstop prefilter and horn antenna called “filtenna.” The simulated and experimental results are agreed that the proposed FSS structure attenuates GSM signals at the 900 and 1800 MHz through the high reflection and very poor transmission mechanisms meanwhile enhances return loss characteristics, radiation pattern, and gain of the horn antenna in the desired band. Thus, it can be concluded that these simple microstrip FSS structure can be effectively adapted to the horn antennas which need the GSM prefiltering. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","broadband; filtenna; frequency selective surface; GSM; horn antenna; performance enhancement","Antenna arrays; Directional patterns (antenna); Frequency selective surfaces; Global system for mobile communications; Microwave antennas; Radar antennas; Radar systems; Broadband; Dual-band frequency selective surfaces; Filtenna; Integrated module; Performance enhancements; Ridged horn antennas; Signal reception; Transmission mechanisms; Horn antennas",2-s2.0-85021319102

To examine the evidence around these claims, we conducted a scoping review of the academic and grey literature, coving the period between January 2007 and August 2014. A framework analysis approach, based on six domains of QOL derived from the ASCOT and WHOQOL models, was adopted to deductively code and analyse relevant literature. The review revealed mixed results. Older people's use of ICT in both mainstream and care contexts has been shown to have both positive and negative impacts on several aspects of QOL. Studies which have rigorously assessed the impact of older people's use of ICT on their QOL mostly demonstrate little effect. A number of qualitative studies have reported on the positive effects for older people who use ICT such as email or Skype to keep in touch with family and friends. Overall, the review unearthed several inconsistencies around the effects of older people's ICT use on their QOL, suggesting that implicit agreement is needed on the best research methods and instrumentation to adequately describe older people's experiences in today's digital age.

The current paper investigates the prospects of utilizing software agents in negotiations with the human counterparts. It presents the findings from experiment where human subjects acted as buyers negotiating with software agent sellers over a mobile phone plan. An electronic negotiation system incorporating software agents was used in the experiment. The agents employed various concession-making schedules while engaging in negotiation tasks involving one of two complexity levels. Negotiation task complexity was manipulated using different number of issues involved in the negotiations. Subjects were recruited among university students. Negotiations between the subjects and agents took place during a two-day period in an asynchronous mode through the web.

Both experiments used adaptive procedures to equate task difficulty throughout training to keep second-target accuracy below ceiling levels. The results showed strong training effects on the rate of processing sequential information. Despite this, there were (a) robust AB effects after training for most participants, (b) no benefit for training on difficult versus easy target tasks, and (c) substantial correlations between the magnitude of the AB before and after extensive training.

Methods Point prevalence abstinence rates were calculated for subscribers who initiated treatment in the program (n=18 080). The primary outcomes for this study were treatment completion and point prevalence abstinence rate at the end of the 42-day treatment. Secondary outcomes were point prevalence abstinence rates at 7 days postquit, 3 months post-treatment and 6 months post-treatment, as well as response rates to point prevalence abstinence assessments. Results Over half the sample completed the 42-day treatment (n=9686). The end-of-treatment point prevalence abstinence for subscribers who initiated treatment was 7.2%. Among those who completed the entire 42 days of treatment, the end-of-treatment point prevalence abstinence was 12.9%.

Currently symmetric encryption algorithms are used in IoT but when considering multimedia big data in IoT, symmetric encryption algorithms incur more computational cost. In this paper, we have designed and developed a resource-efficient encryption system for encrypting multimedia big data in IoT. The proposed system takes the advantages of the Feistel Encryption Scheme, an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and genetic algorithms. To satisfy high throughput, the GPU has also been used in the proposed system. This system is evaluated on real IoT medical multimedia data to benchmark the encryption algorithms such as MARS, RC6, 3-DES, DES, and Blowfish in terms of computational running time and throughput for both encryption and decryption processes as well as the avalanche effect. The results show that the proposed system has the lowest running time and highest throughput for both encryption and decryption processes and highest avalanche effect with compared to the existing encryption algorithms. To satisfy the security objective, the developed algorithm has better Avalanche Effect with compared to any of the other existing algorithms and hence can be incorporated in the process of encryption/decryption of any plain multimedia big data. Also, it has shown that the classical and modern ciphers have very less Avalanche Effect and hence cannot be used for encryption of confidential multimedia messages or confidential big data. The developed encryption algorithm has higher Avalanche Effect and for instance, AES in the proposed system has an Avalanche Effect of %52.50. Therefore, such system is able to secure the multimedia big data against real-time attacks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","AES; Encryption; GPU; Internet of things; Multimedia big data","Big data; Data privacy; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Multimedia systems; Throughput; Advanced Encryption Standard; Computational costs; Encryption algorithms; Encryption and decryption; Encryption/decryption; Multimedia messages; Security objectives; Symmetric encryption; Cryptography",2-s2.0-85010722901

Digicel quickly usurped the dominance of the incumbent, Cable and Wireless - in the mobile segment of the market - using a strategy of affordable phones and a user-friendly approach to mass marketing. This strategy was used to enter other small underdeveloped markets in the Caribbean and Central America and thus challenge the incumbent by competing aggressively on price. In 2014, Digicel commenced a strategic change, with an evolution from a pure mobile services company to becoming a communications and entertainment provider. Price competition in its most lucrative segment (mobile) saw revenue plummet; the competition from non-traditional players and the existing competitor C&W strategic acquisition of a leading cable/internet provider forced the change in strategy. Digicel's founder and chairman, Dennis O'Brien, raised equity by issuing an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). O'Brien surprised observers when he canceled the IPO days before the shares were to be listed on the NYSE. This created a strategic conundrum for O'Brien, which was exacerbated when it was announced that Liberty Global, had agreed to acquire Cable and Wireless Communications plc (CWC), the C&W parent company, for US$8.2B (The Gleaner: Liberty Global to Acquire CWC in a US$8.2b deal). O'Brien's expansion strategy was now in jeopardy. The market was evolving rapidly, the IPO that was required to fund the new strategy was aborted, and its main competitor was now awash with cash.

(b) A similar methodology was carried out, but adding the Cold Stress Test (CST) of the dominant hand during the phone call, obtaining a second physiologic marker (the percentage of thermal recovery) to detect the lie. Further, it established a control condition where it generated anxiety in the participants using IAPS images with negative valence and high arousal, which were described by phone to a loved one. We obtained results that showed significant correlations between changes in body temperature and mental set. Of particular interest was the temperature of the nose and hand, which tended to decrease during lying (Experiment 1). The participants also showed a lower recovery of the temperature after the CST when they were lying (Experiment 2).

The government in India routinely provides basic care at religious mass gatherings. However, in 2015, at the Kumbh Mela in Nashik and Trimbakeshwar, the state government extended its services to include a hypertension screening programme. We examine here the value and implications of such opportunistic screening at mass gatherings. At the Kumbh, 5760 persons voluntarily opted for hypertension screening, and received a single blood pressure measurement. In all, 1783 (33.6%) screened positive, of whom, 1580 were previously unaware of their diagnosis. Of the 303 that had previously known hypertension, 240 (79%) were prescribed medications, and 160 were compliant (that is, 52.8% under treatment). Fifty-five (18%) had normal blood pressure readings (BP under control). The data also demonstrated higher prevalence (39%) of hypertension among tobacco users compared to non-users (28%) (P<0.001).

Cancer patients need to receive information that helps them to better understand the disease, assists them in decision-making, and helps them deal with treatment. Patients are interested in receiving such information. The degree of satisfaction with the information received has been associated with positive health outcomes, specifically regarding quality of life, severity of side effects, and psychological well-being. This study investigates a method of guiding cancer patients, in relation to outpatient chemotherapy treatment, using SMS (short message service) text messaging. A smartphone application called cHEmotHErApp was developed, and its primary function is to send out SMS text messages with guidance for self-care and emotional support for oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the acceptance and perception of patients of the receipt of these SMS messages, as well as to evaluate the possible benefits reported by the participants. Adult patients diagnosed with cancer, who started the first outpatient chemotherapy treatment scheme between August and November 2016 at the School Hospital (HE) of the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel), were invited to participate in this pilot study. In total, 14 cancer patients were adherent to this study. Each of these patients received a daily text message on their cell phone with some guidance on encouraging self-care and emotional support. Patients reported that, because of the SMS text messages they received, they felt more confident in their treatment, felt more supported and encouraged, and that the text messages facilitated self-care. In addition, patients reported that the SMS text messages they received helped them to take better care of themselves and to continue further treatment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cancer care; Intervention; Patient education; Self-care; Text messages",,2-s2.0-85030839067

We address this issue by developing a dynamic scheduling system that utilizes mobile computing via geo-location data to estimate the likelihood of a patient arriving on time for a scheduled appointment. These likelihoods are used to update the clinic’s schedule in real time. When a patient’s arrival probability falls below a given threshold, the patient’s appointment is canceled. This appointment is immediately reassigned to another patient drawn from a pool of patients who are actively seeking an appointment. The replacement patients are prioritized using their arrival probability. Real-world data were not available for this study, so synthetic patient data were generated to test the feasibility of the design. The method for predicting the arrival probability was verified on a real set of taxicab data.

More flexible methodologies are needed to evaluate mHealth technologies, particularly simple, self-help tools. One approach is to combine a variety of methods and data to build a comprehensive picture of how a technology is used and its impact on users. Objective This paper aims to demonstrate how analytical data and user feedback can be triangulated to provide a proportionate and practical approach to the evaluation of a mental well-being smartphone app (In Hand). Methods A three-part process was used to collect data: (1) app analytics; (2) an online user survey and (3) interviews with users. Findings Analytics showed that >50% of user sessions counted as ‘meaningful engagement’. User survey findings (n=108) revealed that In Hand was perceived to be helpful on several dimensions of mental well-being. Interviews (n=8) provided insight into how these self-reported positive effects were understood by users. Conclusions This evaluation demonstrates how different methods can be combined to complete a real world, naturalistic evaluation of a self-help digital tool and provide insights into how and why an app is used and its impact on users’ well-being.

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to explore the effects of 10 GHz microwave radiation on developing mice brain. Two weeks old mice were selected and divided into two groups (i) sham-exposed and (ii) microwave-exposed groups. Animals were exposed for 2 h/day for 15 consecutive days. After the completion of exposure, within an hour, half of the animals were autopsied immediately and others were allowed to attain 6 weeks of age for the follow-up study. Thereafter results were recorded in terms of various biochemical, behavioral, and histopathological parameters. Body weight result showed significant changes immediately after treatment, whereas non-significant changes were observed in mice attaining 6 weeks of age. Several other endpoints like brain weight, lipid peroxidation, glutathione, protein, catalase, and superoxide dismutase were also found significantly (p < 0.05) altered in mice whole brain. These significant differences were found immediately after exposure and also in follow-up on attaining 6 weeks of age in microwave exposure group. Moreover, statistically significant (p < 0.001) effect was investigated in spatial memory of the animals, in learning to locate the position of platform in Morris water maze test. Although in probe trial test, sham-exposed animals spent more time in searching for platform into the target quadrant than in opposite or other quadrants. Significant alteration in histopathological parameters (qualitative and quantitative) was also observed in CA1 region of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and ansiform lobule of cerebellum.

Technological advancement now allows for the detection of minute-to-minute changes while also capturing a longitudinal perspective of an individual’s illness. Traditionally, assessments of mood have been conducted by means of clinical interviews and paper surveys. However, these methods are often inaccurate due to recall bias and compliance issues, and are limited in their capacity to collect and process data over long periods of time. The increased capability, availability and affordability of digital technologies in recent decades has offered a novel, non-invasive alternative to monitoring mood and emotion in daily life. This paper reviews the emerging literature addressing the use of digital mood tracking technologies, primarily focusing on the strengths and inherent limitations of using these new methods including electronic self-report, behavioural data collection and wearable physiological biosensors. This developing field holds great promise in generating novel insights into the mechanistic processes of mood disorders and improving personalised clinical care. However, further research is needed to validate many of these novel approaches to ensure that these devices are indeed achieving their purpose of capturing changes in mood. © 2017, BMJ Publishing Group.

Inevitably, VANETs need to communicate with WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks). Real-time data transmission between vehicles and road-side sensor nodes has many application scenarios. However, due to different characteristics of VANETs and WSNs, real-time traffic data transmission is too complicated and slow when emergencies occurred in many RSUs-sparse (Road Side Units) areas. In this paper, we propose a broadcast authentication protocol, namely Paralleling Broadcast Authentication Protocol (PBAP), aiming at enhancing energy efficiency and providing network security in the direct communication between vehicles and WSNs. The simulation results demonstrate that the protocol can effectively extend lifetime of WSNs by improving the utilization rate of the keys and show nice properties in different channel loss ratio and different degrees of DoS attacks. The protocol can work well even in the area without RSUs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Broadcast authentication protocol; Internet of vehicles; RSUs-sparse; Vehicular ad-hoc network; Wireless sensor network","Ad hoc networks; Authentication; Broadcasting; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Denial-of-service attack; Energy efficiency; Internet; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Network security; Roads and streets; Sensor nodes; Telecommunication networks; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Wireless ad hoc networks; Wireless sensor networks; Application scenario; Broadcast authentication; Direct communications; Protocol cans; Real time data transmission; Real-time traffic datum; RSUs-sparse; Utilization rates; Vehicular ad hoc networks",2-s2.0-84983384029

However, the location information from smartphone GPS is more erroneous. The proposed methodology serves as an alternative to existing positioning methods to improve the vehicle positioning accuracy. The developed enhanced particle filter algorithm takes smartphone GPS positioning data [from multiple passengers in a single transit vehicle (e.g. bus)] as input data. This 'crowdsourced' data can then be utilised to calculate the vehicles' positioning information with better accuracy using the developed enhanced particle filter algorithm. The developed algorithm was tested using data collected on 14 different bus routes in urban and suburban areas of Mumbai, India, and it was identified that the algorithm is effective in reducing the average error up to 21.3% from a regular smartphone GPS and 10% from extended Kalman filter algorithm and was able to curtail positioning error within 8.672 m (average over 14 routes). © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Bus transportation; Crowdsourcing; Kalman filters; Location; Mass transportation; Monte Carlo methods; Position measurement; Smartphones; Vehicles; Automatic vehicle location systems; Extended Kalman filter algorithm; Location information; Particle filter algorithms; Positioning information; Public transport vehicles; Real time positioning; Urban and suburban areas; Global positioning system",2-s2.0-85031929450

Specifically, we analyze the factors that contribute to the gender digital divide in Rwanda. In addition, we assess the importance of equal access to ICTs between genders. Rwanda is a particulary interesting case study, since previous studies on gender differences in the usage and accessibility of ICTs have focused on Western countries, while Africa, and Rwanda in particular, have been less covered. The qualitative method of in-depth interviews was used to collect the data. Interviews were analyzed using a thematic analysis technique. The findings of this study reveal that a gender digital divide still exists in Rwanda, even though the government puts forth much effort to eradicate this phenomenon. Reasons for barriers for women's access to ICTs were found in social, economic and cultural factors, such as feelings of lack of self-worth, self-confidence, and proper educations; heavy domestic responsibilities; and computer anxiety. The findings also indicated that equal access to ICTs would be a shortcut to economic growth in Rwanda. This study concludes that Rwandan women need to be better educated in the use of computer technologies.

We propose a new method for accurately estimating FCC without exposing low-level system details or introducing new hardware or system modules. We further propose and implement a collaborative FCC estimation technique that builds on crowd-sourced battery data. The method finds the reference voltage curve and charging rate of a particular smartphone model from the data and then compares with those of an individual device. After analyzing a large data set towards a crowd-sourced rate versus FCC model, we report that 55 percent of all devices and at least one device in 330 out of 357 unique device models lost some of their FCC. For some old device models, the median capacity loss exceeded 20 percent. The models further enable debugging the performance of smartphone charging.

We examined patient reported acceptance of physical activity monitor technology in an ambulatory urology setting. Methods Patients treated at a single urology department during a 6-month period were identified. A web based survey was conducted evaluating patient characteristics and acceptance of physical activity monitors. Results A total of 1,043 (19%) patients completed the survey, of whom 210 (20%) reported using physical activity monitors for health and wellness. Overall 854 (82%) respondents were willing to use these devices for urological care. Compared to patients who disagreed, those willing to use physical activity monitors for medical care reported greater perceived medical benefit (86% vs 14%), improved communication (85% vs 26%), confidentiality (89% vs 45%), less interference with daily activity (4% vs 55%) and improved health (81% vs 13%, all p <0.0001). Benefits and usefulness among accepting patients included health monitoring convenience (82%), goal related feedback (82%), ease of communication (57%) and monitoring of post-procedure recovery (56%). After controlling for associated patient characteristics, the degree of perceived burden, medical benefit, health improvement and enhancement in communication were modifiable, and independently associated with physical activity monitor acceptance. Conclusions There is a high level of acceptance for wearable technology among urology patients.

In this paper, we present clustering algorithms based on Simulated Annealing (SA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find optimal set of cluster heads in the network. The optimization problem consists of finding optimal configuration of clusters such that the communication distance per cluster is not only minimized but the cluster balance and energy efficiency is also maintained in the network. The SA and PSO toolboxes are developed in C++ and integrated with OMNeT++ simulation environment to implement the proposed clustering algorithms.

In a feasibility trial, web-based Enhanced Relapse Prevention (ERPonline) for bipolar disorder demonstrated high recruitment and retention rates. Relative to participants in the waitlist control group, those who received ERPonline showed increased monitoring for early warning signs of relapse and had developed more positive illness models. Objective To understand users’ motivations and barriers for taking part in an online/telephone-based trial, and for engagement with ERPonline. Methods Participants from the trial who had been allocated to receive ERPonline were purposively sampled to participate in telephone-based, in-depth qualitative interviews about their experiences. Interviews (n=19) were analysed using framework analysis to identify themes relevant to study aims. Findings Participants took part due to the convenient, flexible and rewarding aspects of the trial design, as well as a desire to improve the mental health of themselves and others. Barriers included extensive assessments, practical difficulties and mood. ERPonline was was generally considered to be accessible, relevant and straightforward, but there were individual preferences regarding design, content and who it was for. Several participants reported positive changes, but there was a sense that digital interventions should not replace routine care. Conclusions There are a number of barriers and facilitators to consider when evaluating and implementing digital interventions. Individual preferences and human contact were key factors for both trial design and engagement with an online intervention.

In recent years, novel control schemes, such as the so-called Path Computation Element (PCE) has gained momentum in the network research community turning into real PCE implementations. Indeed, there is a wealth of studies assessing the PCE performance, clearly showing the potential benefits of decoupling routing control tasks from the forwarding nodes. Nevertheless, recognized the need for a control solution in IoT scenarios, there is not much published information analyzing PCE benefits in these IoT scenarios. In this paper, we distill how the PCE may gracefully provide for service composition in an agile manner, handling the specific constraints and requirements found in IoT scenarios.

Service providers exploit these facts for user monitoring and identification, albeit impacting users’ anonymity, based mainly on personal identifiable information or on sensors that generate unique data to provide personalized services. In this paper, we report on the feasibility of user identification using general system features like memory, CPU and network data, as provided by the underlying operating system. We provide a general framework based on supervised machine learning algorithms both for distinguishing users and informing them about their anonymity exposure. We conduct a series of experiments to collect trial datasets for users’ engagement on a shared computing platform. We evaluate various well-known classifiers in terms of their effectiveness in distinguishing users, and we perform a sensitivity analysis of their configuration setup to discover optimal settings under diverse conditions. Furthermore, we examine the bounds of sampling data to eliminate the chances of user identification and thus promote anonymity.

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of results revealed that field independent (FI) users outperformed field dependent users (FD) in graphical authentication, FIs authenticated similarly well on desktop computers as on touch devices, while touch devices negatively affected textual password entry performance of FDs. Users' feedback from a post-study survey further showed that FD users had memorability issues with graphical authentication and perceived the added difficulty when interacting with textual passwords on touch devices, in contrast to FI users that did not have significant usability and memorability issues on both authentication and interaction device types.

Therefore, a new approach for nonuniform illumination face enhancements (NIFE) was proposed by designing an adaptive contrast-stretching (ACS) filter. In a more objective manner of achieving this, an investigation usage of CS function with adjustable factors value to summarise its influence on the NIFE is examined firstly. Secondly, describe a new strategy to cater for CS adaptive factors prediction using training and testing phases. A dispersion versus location (DL) descriptor was examined in the training phase to generate the faces feature vectors. Subsequently, a frame differencing module (FDM) was developed for faces label generations. In the testing phase, the approach was examined to recognise the DL descriptor and predict face label based vocabulary tree model (VTM). Thirdly, the VTM performance was examined by referring to the area under curve (AUC) score from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The face quality measurement was evaluated via blind reference based statistical measures (BR-SM), blind reference based DL-descriptors (BR-DL) and visual interpretation of the resulting images. The BR-SM performed through calculating the EME (Measure of Enhancement), EEME (Measure of Enhancement by Entropy), SDME (Second Derivative like Measure of Enhancement), SHP (Coefficient of Sharpness) and CPP (Contrast per Pixel). In addition, by using DL scatter, the BR-DL handles the specific relationship with regards to the local contrast to local brightness within the resulting face images. Four face image databases, namely Extended Yale B, Mobio, Feret and CMU-PIE were used. The final results attained prove that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed ACS filter implementation is the most excellent choice in terms of contrast and nonuniform illumination adjustment as well as providing images of satisfactory quality.

Conventionally, the annotations comprise the start and end times, and the corresponding labels of gestures in sensor recordings. In this work, we propose a one-time point annotation in which labelers do not have to select the start and end time carefully, but just mark a one-time point within the time a gesture is happening. The technique gives more freedom and reduces significantly the burden for labelers. To make the one-time point annotations applicable, we propose a novel BoundarySearch algorithm to find automatically the correct temporal boundaries of gestures by discovering data patterns around their given one-time point annotations. The corrected annotations are then used to train gesture models. We evaluate the method on three applications from wearable gesture recognition with various gesture classes (10-17 classes) recorded with different sensor modalities. The results show that training on the corrected annotations can achieve performances close to a fully supervised training on clean annotations (lower by just up to 5 percent F1-score on average).

In this paper, we propose a new framework, based on taxi trajectory data, for locating bicycle-sharing stations most efficiently to replace short automobile trips. The proposed framework is applied to Gangnam-gu, a district within the city of Seoul, Korea. Results using two different location-allocation models are demonstrated. As expected, when the p-median model was implemented, the selected stations were more scattered over the whole district, whereas when the MCLP model was implemented, the stations were more concentrated on central areas.

There are numerous telehealth solutions that could be utilized to assist with integration efforts that have the potential to be successfully used alone or in combination. This will require that the developers of such technologies understand the current evidence base for effective integration efforts and apply this knowledge to new solutions. Recent Findings: Evidence-based models of integrated care such as the collaborative care model have a robust evidence base including studies that demonstrate effective delivery from remote locations. Technology solutions that can serve as practice extenders by performing some of the tasks, and can expand the competency of primary care providers to treat mild to moderate mental illness, have an emerging literature in the behavioral health arena that shows promise for integrating care.

Short message service (SMS) technology is an accessible and direct modality to communicate timely, evidence-based recommendations to parents across the perioperative period. This study focused on validating a SMS protocol, Tonsil-Text-To-Me (TTTM), for parents of children undergoing tonsillectomy. Methods This study used a modified Delphi expert consensus method. Participants were an international sample of 27 clinicians/researchers. Participants rated level of agreement with recommendations across seven perioperative domains, derived systematically from scientific and lay literature. A priori consensus analysis was conducted using threshold criterion. A multidisciplinary team of local clinicians were also individually interviewed to consolidate text messages and implement recurrent suggestions. Results In the modified Delphi panel, 30 statements reached threshold agreement (>3.0 of 4.0); recommendations surrounding diet (3.87) and hygiene (3.83) had the highest level of consensus, while recommendations regarding activity (3.42) and non-pharmacologic pain management (3.55) had the lowest consensus. The 30 statements reconfigured into 12 concise text messages. After further interviews with local clinicians, 14 final text messages were included in the SMS protocol to be sent two weeks preoperatively to one week postoperatively.

This review bares the contours of the available literature concluding in a set of manageable and usable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, individuals and organizations intending to assess readiness for any HIT implementation. Objectives Identify studies, analyze readiness factors and offer recommendations. Method Published articles 1995–2016 were searched using Medline/PubMed, Cinahl, Web of Science, PsychInfo, ProQuest. Studies were included if they were assessing IS/T/mHealth readiness in the context of HIT. Articles not written in English were excluded. Themes that emerged in the process of the data synthesis were thematically analysed and interpreted. Results Analyzed themes were found across 63 articles. In accordance with their prevalence of use, they included but not limited to “Technological readiness”, 30 (46%); “Core/Need/Motivational readiness”, 23 (37%); “Acceptance and use readiness”, 19 (29%); “Organizational readiness”, 20 (21%); “IT skills/Training/Learning readiness” (18%), “Engagement readiness”, 16 (24%) and “Societal readiness” (14%).

Mechanical recycling, usually the first step, can achieve maximum metal extraction, however has direct or indirect health effects, higher capital costs, and results in the loss of numerous secondary metal resources. The second most commonly used approach is the chemical method, which is much faster than the biological one, but chemical hydrometallurgy is metal-specific and also causes secondary pollution. The third approach—microbial metal recovery—is an eco-friendly and promising technology for WEEE processing. This comprehensive review evaluates and provides details of recent trends and developments in various technologies, including: physical, chemical and biological methods for the recycling and recovery of secondary resource materials, such as valuable metals. Although no single approach by itself is adequate, and as it cannot achieve ecofriendly high extraction rates of metals from WEEE, it is possible to develop a combined process, such as the initial use of mechanical treatment followed by leaching with either easily biodegradable reagents or organic acids produced by microbes—this would be more ecofriendly and economically feasible.

This paper presents the effect of varying the concentration of cupric sulfate, ammonium sulfate, monoethanolamine and temperature on the silver leaching kinetics. The study was complemented with SEM-EDS, X-ray diffraction characterization techniques and thermodynamic analysis in order to understand the phenomena taking place in this novel leaching system. The results revealed that an increase in the cupric sulfate and ammonium sulfate concentration favors the silver dissolution rate and recovery. However, a massive increase in the concentration of cupric sulfate and ammonium sulfate, e.g., 0.4 M and 1.06 M, respectively, promotes the significant precipitation of Cu(OH)2, which hinders the silver dissolution. On the other hand, when the system is operated with a Cu2 + and NH4 + concentration lower than 0.3 M and 0.8 M, respectively, the silver dissolution is favored. The thermodynamic and SEM-EDS analysis along with the leaching tests revealed that Cu(NH3)4 2 +, Cu(MEA)4 2 + and Cu(OH)2 (partially precipitated on the silver particles) are the oxidizing agents for silver. Oxidized silver can be complexed by the free ammonia produced in the system and monoethanoamine (MEA). Temperature is an important variable to accelerate the silver dissolution kinetics, the results showed that 83% of silver can be leached at 360 min employing 0.3 M Cu2 +, 0.8 M NH4 +, 0.05 M MEA at 45 °C. Finally, the addition of MEA in the system is fundamental to decrease the massive precipitation of Cu(OH)2 species, promoting the silver dissolution rate at 45 °C. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cupric hydroxide; Cupric tetraamine; Cupric tetraMEA; MEA; Silver leaching","Copper; Dissolution; Ethanolamines; Leaching; Sulfur compounds; Thermoanalysis; X ray diffraction; Characterization techniques; Cupric hydroxide; Cupric tetraamine; Cupric tetraMEA; Dissolution kinetics; Leaching technologies; Silver leaching; Thermo dynamic analysis; Silver",2-s2.0-85026630563

Among the several types of alarms to alert the driver of an imminent collision, those most used concerning the auditory and the visual stimulus. However, it is unclear whether is more effective an audio or a visual warning. In addition, no study compared the effects on drivers’ behavior induced by an acoustic and a visual directional warning. The main objective of the present study was to assess, in response to a potential conflict event at the intersections, the effects of directional auditory and visual warnings on driving performance. A driving simulator experiment was carried out to collect drivers’ behavior in response to a vehicle that failed to stop at the intersection. The parameters reaction time and speed reduction time were used for the evaluation of the effects on driving performance. These duration variables were modeled following the survival analysis, by the use of the accelerated failure time duration model with a Weibull distribution. Results showed that when the directional warning system (auditory or visual) was present, the drivers were able to detect earlier the violator vehicle. This effect led to a more comfortable braking maneuver and, thus, less possibilities of an unexpected maneuver for the following vehicle, avoiding the car – following collisions. The effectiveness of ICWSs was more evident for the directional auditory speech message; for this condition, in fact, the lower reaction time and the longer speed reduction time were obtained. The outcomes of the present study provide useful suggestions about the most effective collision warning systems that the automotive industry should develop and equip on vehicles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Driver behavior; Driving simulator; Intersection collision warning system; Survival analysis","Alarm systems; Automobile drivers; Automobile simulators; Automotive industry; Bioinformatics; Vehicles; Weibull distribution; Collision warning system; Driver behavior; Driving performance; Driving simulator; Following vehicle; Intersection collision warning systems; Potential conflict; Survival analysis; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85030787649

The aim of the study is investigating the possible synergistic effect of noise and vibration, increasing the risk of damage to the hearing function due to noise only. Twelve normal-hearing volunteers were randomly exposed to hand arm vibration (HAV) only, noise only, and HAV and noise simultaneously. The exposure consisted of five consecutive sessions interspersed with quiet periods. DPOAEs were recorded during the quiet intervals following each exposure session, and during recovery, and compared to their baseline level, and among different test treatments. An ad hoc acquisition system developed in Labview was used to record high frequency-resolution DPOAE spectra in a suitably short time. Time-frequency filtering, based on the wavelet transform, was used to separate the DPOAE components coming from different generation mechanisms. The three test treatments, N, V, and NV, yielded significantly different results. The condition affecting most significantly all DPOAE component levels was the exposure to vibration only, causing a statistically significant increase of the signal level during all the exposure periods, with a decreasing trend during recovery. Also the exposure to noise only, N, caused a DPOAE level increase, statistically significant for the long latency (LL) DPOAE component. Only when exposure to noise was in combination with vibration, the zero-latency (ZL) component was clearly suppressed during the exposure. The results suggest a synergistic adverse effect of noise and vibration on the cochlear function. Relevance to industry The simultaneous exposure to noise and hand arm vibration is a very common industrial scenario. The risk that exposure to mild noise levels could interfere with the exposure to vibration, enhancing the adverse effect on the hearing function, should be considered to optimize prevention strategies at the workplace. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Distortion product OAEs; Hand-arm vibration; Noise; Otoacoustic emission; Synergistic effects","Acoustic emissions; Audition; Hand tools; Machine vibrations; Otoacoustic emissions; Wavelet transforms; Distortion product; Distortion product otoacoustic emissions; Hand arm vibrations; High frequency resolution; Noise; Prevention strategies; Synergistic effect; Time-frequency filtering; Acoustic noise",2-s2.0-85006172642

Many crosswalk classification, detection and localization systems have been proposed in the literature over the years. These systems use different perspectives to tackle the crosswalk classification problem: satellite imagery, cockpit view (from the top of a car or behind the windshield), and pedestrian perspective. Most of the works in the literature are designed and evaluated using small and local datasets, i.e. datasets that present low diversity. Scaling to large datasets imposes a challenge for the annotation procedure. Moreover, there is still need for cross-database experiments in the literature because it is usually hard to collect the data in the same place and conditions of the final application. In this paper, we present a crosswalk classification system based on deep learning. For that, crowdsourcing platforms, such as OpenStreetMap and Google Street View, are exploited to enable automatic training via automatic acquisition and annotation of a large-scale database. Additionally, this work proposes a comparison study of models trained using fully-automatic data acquisition and annotation against models that were partially annotated. Cross-database experiments were also included in the experimentation to show that the proposed methods enable use with real world applications. Our results show that the model trained on the fully-automatic database achieved high overall accuracy (94.12%), and that a statistically significant improvement (to 96.30%) can be achieved by manually annotating a specific part of the database. Finally, the results of the cross-database experiments show that both models are robust to the many variations of image and scenarios, presenting a consistent behavior. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crosswalk classification; Crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Large-scale database; Zebra-crossing classification","Crosswalks; Crowdsourcing; Data acquisition; Database systems; Deep learning; Satellite imagery; Automatic acquisition; Automatic data acquisition; Automatic training; Classification system; Crowdsourcing platforms; Detection and localization; Large-scale database; Overall accuracies; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85028699273

To enable this, products have to be designed for multiple life cycle (MLC) purposes. Besides that, the presence of technology innovation has led to the generation of multiple products. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the life cycle of products in a wider scope. Currently, an existing method that approximately accommodates this objective is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, the current LCA guidelines and standards are still insufficient to assess the environmental impacts of MLC products due to the limitation of the conventional LCA procedure, which only focuses on a single life cycle. Therefore, it is highly important to extend the current concept of the LCA to a Multi-Life Cycle Assessment (MLCA). It is possible for an MLCA to quantify the environmental impacts of MLC products and to evaluate the flow of materials among the generated products. To date, only two studies have explicitly mentioned the term ‘MLCA’, but both had different perspectives and methodologies. Moreover, previous LCA studies focused on evaluating the environmental performance of MLC products, such as remanufactured and recycled products. Therefore, this paper was aimed at proposing MLCA perspectives for assessing the environmental impacts on the MLC product system. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive and systematic review of previous LCA and MLCA studies that dealt with MLC problems was conducted. From the review, the knowledge gaps in the field of study were identified so as to contribute to an understanding of how the LCA can be extended to the MLCA for environmental sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","A systematic literature review; Design innovation; Multi-Life Cycle Assessment; Technology innovation","Ecodesign; Engineering research; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Innovation; Product design; Sustainable development; Design and technology; Design innovations; End of life treatments; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Systematic literature review; Technology innovation; Life cycle",2-s2.0-85028076329

In the experimental group (N = 124), classroom practice included tablet-based cross-curricular maths activities with post-participation testing to identify the effect on learning outcomes, and observations were conducted to identify the affordance and ergonomic characteristics of tablets for student learning. In the control group (N = 135) maths was taught as a discrete subject with traditional paper and pencil technology using manipulation of concrete objects. Groups were matched with respect to gender, ownership of a tablet computer and previous knowledge and understanding of maths. The instructional design of process-outcome strategies incorporated Bruner's (1966) three stage process with learning outcomes in the cognitive, affective-social and psychomotor domains. The affordance of tablet-based cross-curricular apps was examined with respect to domains of learning and ergonomics. The findings indicate that the tablet supported group had better outcomes, with a small effect size for conceptual knowledge (r = 0.10) and medium effect size for procedural knowledge (r = 0.33) and problem-solving abilities (r = 0.30). The authors therefore argue for the introduction of tablets in schools because their multi-sensory human-computer touch interaction provides interactive manipulatives supporting transition between representations on the concrete, visual and abstract level. The authors concluded that in cross-curricular maths teaching, tablets offers efficient use of resources from different subjects and multiple representations which facilitate learning outcomes in the cognitive, affective-social and psychomotor learning domains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Applications in mathematical education; Elementary education; Ergonomics; Interactive learning environments; Representations","Computer aided instruction; Concretes; Economic and social effects; Ergonomics; Human computer interaction; Students; Teaching; Elementary education; Higher-order learning; Instructional designs; Interactive learning environment; Mathematical educations; Multiple representation; Problem-solving abilities; Representations; Education",2-s2.0-85021074136

A ‘state of humanitarian exception’ emerges as citizens foreground norms of compassion and cooperation while contestatory discourse – the argumentative, blame-seeking and fault-finding forms of speech – are stigmatized as inappropriate interventions in a society seeking to recover from a distressful crisis situation. This article critically unpacks these representations of post-disaster situations empirically and normatively. By analysing the discussions in the public sphere over the first 100 days after Typhoon Haiyan battered Central Philippines, the article examines the moral force behind the ‘discourse of compassion’ and its ‘ethical boundary work’ that places the ‘discourse of contestation’ outside the scope of acceptable conduct. It proposes that the discourse of compassion’s ethical boundary work is only democratically acceptable when one takes a short view of a crisis situation. Drawing on deliberative democracy theory, the article argues for the importance of contestatory discourse in fostering inclusive discourse formation and ensuring that the state of humanitarian exception does not become the rule. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Deliberative democracy; disasters; discourse analysis; public sphere; social media",,2-s2.0-85031085922

This conception is not confirmed by the images produced in advertising. This article presents an analysis of alcohol-related advertisements published in Finnish, Italian, and Swedish women's magazines from the 1960s to the 2000s. The advertisements are approached as performative texts in which gender is made visible ""here and now"" by placing women in particular consumer positions relative to private or public spheres and by associating specific kinds of gender expectations and norms that reflect women's shifting responsibilities and pleasures. The article asks what kind of drinking-related identities have been portrayed as desirable in women's magazine advertisements over the past few decades and how they have changed as we move closer to the present day. The analysis reveals both continuity and variability in alcohol-related consumer identities in advertisements in Finnish, Italian, and Swedish women's magazines. It shows that as Finland, Italy, and Sweden have developed from modern societies to late-modern societies, women's responsibilities and pleasures have expanded from the traditional domain of the private sphere into multiple new areas. The expansion of women's identities has occurred differently in each geographical area. This does not, however, mean that the traditional gender norms have disintegrated and been replaced by equal gender norms.

In addition, we simultaneously compensate the image regions of dynamic objects based on the optimal seamline detection in the graph cuts energy minimization framework and create the mosaic with a relatively clean background. To ensure the high quality of the optimal seamline, the energy functions adopted in graph cuts combine the pixel-level similarities of image characteristics, including intensity and gradient, and the texture complexity. To successfully compensate the image regions covered by dynamic objects for creating a mosaic with a relatively clean background, we initially detect them in overlap regions between images based on pixel-level and region-level similarities, then refine them based on segments, and determine their image source in probability based on contour matching. We finally integrate all of these into the energy minimization framework to detect optimal seamlines.

Methods We conducted a content analysis of Android apps for managing drinking available on Google Play (n = 266), downloaded between November 21, 2014 and June 25, 2015. We recorded app popularity (> 10,000 downloads) and user-rated quality (number of stars) from Google Play, and coded the apps on three domains (basic descriptors, functionality, use of dynamic features). Results In total, the reviewed 266 apps were downloaded at least 2,793,567 times altogether. The most common types of app were BAC calculators (37%), information provision apps (37%), tracking calendars (24%), and motivational tools (21%). Most apps were free (65%) or low in cost (mean = $3.76; SD = $5.80). Many apps provided at least some level of tailored feedback (60%), but the extent of tailoring was limited. Use of other dynamic features (i.e., push notifications, passive data collection) was largely absent. Univariate models predicting app popularity (i.e., > 10,000 downloads vs. not) and user-rated quality (i.e., star rating) indicated that tailoring was positively related to popularity (OR = 2.41 [1.30–4.46]), and the existence of time-based tailoring (e.g., tracking) was related to quality (b = 0.48 [0.19–0.77]). Conclusions These apps have a wide public health reach with > 2.7 million total combined downloads to date.

Music listening is often employed as a countermeasure during driving in order to mitigate the effects of fatigue. Though music listening has been established as a distractor in the sense that it increases cognitive load during driving, it is possible that increased cognitive load is desirable under particular circumstances. For instance, during situations that typically result in cognitive underload, such as driving in a low-traffic monotonous stretch of highway, it may be beneficial for cognitive load to increase, thereby necessitating allocation of greater cognitive resources to the task of driving and attenuating fatigue. In the current study, we employed a song-naming game as a countermeasure to fatigued driving in a simulated monotonous environment. During the first driving session, we established that driving performance deteriorates in the absence of an intervention following 30 min of simulated driving. During the second session, we found that a song-naming game employed at the point of fatigue onset was an effective countermeasure, as reflected by simulated driving performance that met or exceeded fresh driving behavior and was significantly better relative to fatigued performance during the first driving session. © 2017","Attention; Countermeasure; Distraction; Driving; Fatigue; Music","Accidents; Automobile drivers; Fatigue of materials; Attention; Countermeasure; Distraction; Driving; Music; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85029477374

Popular location-based AR games often include elements that are known to predict place attachment: exploration, social relations or the experience of enjoyment in a place. We argue that positive emotions triggered by playing can influence players’ place attachment via the process of gamification. We tested this hypothesis in a correlational study conducted among Pokémon Go players. Our analyses showed that satisfaction from playing and the social relations made during play positively predict place attachment, but the amount of time spent on playing does not. A series of mediation analyses showed that relations among game satisfaction, social relations, and place attachment were mediated by the appraisal of the place as exciting.

Indeed, this loss of control could lead to humiliation, (cyber)bullying, or harassment. The development of new technologies, press coverage, and increase of prevalence rates could also explain the growth of interest in sexting. However, its definition is still a gray area. This review examines the different definitions of sexting used in the literature and its correlates. Several elements of the definition of sexting were assessed: actions (sending, receiving, and forwarding); media types (text, images, and videos); sexual characteristics; and transmission modes. Nine databases were searched for studies on sexting among youths up to 18 years of age. Eighteen studies published between 2012 and 2015 were included. Prevalence rates of sexting ranged between.9% and 60% partly depending on the definition. Most studies assessed sending, but when sending and receiving were measured, prevalence rates were higher for receiving. Some articles found associations with age, gender, race, sexual behavior, romantic relationships, risky behaviors, online activity, psychological difficulties, and social pressure. Finding a consensus regarding the definition is essential to assess accurately the activity and adapt prevention. Adolescents' interpretations of the activity are important as sexting could be used as a sexual behavior between two consenting persons. Prevention strategies should focus on sexting that goes wrong when it is forwarded to a third party and when it occurs in a context of pressure or harassment. © 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Adolescents; Characteristics; Definition; Review; Sexting; Youths",,2-s2.0-85024834225

Of these women, an estimated 38% suffer from stress urinary incontinence (SUI). A European research consortium is investigating an innovative system based on information and communication technology for the conservative treatment of women with SUI. When introducing a new intervention, implementation barriers arise and need to be identified. Therefore, we investigated healthcare providers’ experience with and attitude towards innovative care options. Methods: We performed an online survey to assess (1) the characteristics and practice of healthcare providers, (2) current protocols for SUI, (3) current use of biofeedback, and (4) knowledge about serious gaming. The survey was sent to members of professional societies in Europe (EUGA), UK (BSUG) and The Netherlands (DPFS). Results: Of 341 questionnaires analyzed (response rate between 18% and 30%), 64% of the respondents had access to a protocol for the treatment of SUI, and 31% used biofeedback when treating patients with SUI. However, 92% considered that biofeedback has a clear or probable added value, and 97% of those who did not use biofeedback would change their practice if research evidence supported its use. Finally, 89% of respondents indicated that they had no experience of serious gaming, but 92% considered that it could be useful. Conclusions: Although inexperienced, European urogynecologists and physical therapists welcome innovative treatment options for the conservative treatment of SUI such as portable wireless biofeedback and serious gaming.

Several attempts to secure 802.11 standard ends up with the inadequate security mechanisms that are vulnerable to various attacks and intrusions. Thus, integration of external defense mechanism like intrusion detection system (IDS) is inevitable. An anomaly-based IDS employs machine learning algorithms to detect attacks. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensure the performance of the classifier in terms of speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability. This paper proposes a normalized gain based IDS for MAC Intrusions (NMI) to improve the IDS performance significantly. The proposed NMI includes two primary components OFSNP and DCMI. The first component is optimal feature selection using NG and PSO (OFSNP) and the second component is Detecting and Categorizing MAC 802.11 Intrusions (DCMI) using SVM classifier. The OFSNP ranks the features using an independent measure as normalized gain (NG) and selects the optimal set of features using semi-supervised clustering (SSC). The SSC is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that uses labeled and unlabeled features simultaneously to find a group of optimal features. Using the optimal set of features, the proposed DCMI utilizes a rapid and straightforward support vector machine (SVM) learning that classifies the attacks under the appropriate classes. Thus, the proposed NMI achieves a better trade-off between detection accuracy and learning time.

This method was based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) property of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and interaction between BT and gold nanoparticles. The addition of BT leads to AuNPs aggregation with red-to-blue color shifts. TEM analysis demonstrated aggregation of gold nanoparticles at the presence of BT. The effective parameters in the SPR such as solution pH, concentration of AuNPs, standing time, electrolyte concentration, and coexisting substances were studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, this method exhibited a linear range from 10 to 200 ng mL-1 (R 2 = 0.996), with a detection limit of 1 ng mL-1. Relative standard deviations (RSD) for 40.0 and 140.0 ng mL-1 of BT were 2.5 and 1.5%, respectively. Possible mechanism for the SPR changes of AuNPs in the presence of BT was discussed.

In order to have a proper enhancement of dual microphone system, we require to estimate the time delay of arrival (TDOA) between the two microphone signals which is followed by the application of the proposed speech enhancement algorithm. We have used TDOA algorithm based on phase transform to minimize the effect of reverberation for localization of the sound sources. Coherence based technique has been used for speech enhancement process which requires no background noise estimation. In this way, we can achieve a high localization accuracy and also the capability of dealing with coherent noise. In the proposed system, TDOA and speech enhancement processes are executed concurrently exploiting the parallel logic blocks of FPGA, thus increasing the throughput of the system to a great extent. We have implemented our design on Spartan6 Lx45 FPGA device. The subjective evaluation of the proposed design with normal hearing listeners using comprehensibility listing test has been done and its performance has been compared to the existing state of the art research works.

All studies presented in this paper are crash prediction models with similar specifications. According to the meta-analyses and after correcting for publication bias when it was considered appropriate, the summary estimates of regression coefficients were found to be 0.1703 for duration and 0.862 for length. These effects were significant for length but not for duration. However, the overall estimate of duration was significant before correcting for publication bias. Separate meta-analyses on the studies examining both duration and length was also carried out in order to have rough estimates of the combined effects.

Firstly, the mineralogical properties were analyzed by advanced analysis technologies, and then the triboelectric separation was applied to remove glass fibers from dust to eliminate the effect of agglomeration that was caused by glass fibers in the process of density-segregation. The results demonstrated that the major metal elements were Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn and Mg, and the content of metals accounted for 18.865 wt.% in −0.5 mm size fraction of dust. The metal content increased to 21.852 wt.% after removing glass fibers. The metal recovery rate was up to 78.77%, which demonstrated that the vibrated gas-solid fluidized bed had obvious recovery efficiency for metals from dust.

Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of nature sounds on physiological indicators among patients in the CCU. Materials &amp; methods This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 93 patients hospitalized in the cardiac care units of three teaching hospitals in 2016. The patients were selected using the convenient method with three randomized blocks. The patients were assigned into three groups as nature sounds, silence that received a set of headphones without playing sounds, and control groups. In addition to routine care, the patients in the intervention group listened to nature sounds for 30 min using a set of headphones for two days. The patients in the control group only received routine care. In addition to routine care, the patients in the silence group used a set of headphones for 30 min to block noises and no sound was played for them. Physiological indicators such as heartbeat rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiration rate, and arterial O2 saturation were assessed using monitoring devices. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis via the SPSS software. Findings Nature sounds and silence had no statistically significant effects on physiological indicators. However, a statistically significant difference was reported in the heart rate in the nature sound group before and after the intervention in the first day of the intervention (P = 0.046). In the second day of the intervention, there were statistically significant differences in the diastolic blood pressure in the nature sounds group (P = 0.028), heart rate (P = 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.013) in the silence group, and heart rate (P = 0.014) in the control group before and after the intervention.

This paper proposes an event detection method for social networks based on link prediction, which can also evaluate the volatility of different networks. The main contributions are as follows. (1) The volatility of the network evolution can be effectively reflected on the similarity index corresponding to a good link prediction performance. (2) Inspired by link prediction, a similarity computing algorithm (SimC) is proposed to compute the similarity of networks.

We conducted a narrative review to explore the opportunities and risks of digital technologies in mental healthcare specifically for people with intellectual disability, a sometimes marginalised and socially excluded group. The scope of digital mental health is vast and the promise of cheaper and more effective interventions delivered digitally is attractive. People with intellectual disability experience high rates of mental illness and could benefit from the development of novel therapies, yet seem to have been relatively neglected in the discourse around digital mental health and are often excluded from the development and implementation of new interventions. People with intellectual disability encounter several barriers to fully embracing digital technology, which may be overcome with appropriate support and adaptations. A small, but growing, literature attests to the value of incorporating digital technologies into the lives of people with intellectual disability, not only for promoting health but also for enhancing educational, vocational and leisure opportunities.

Among them, point of interest (POI) recommendation based on user behaviour has enticed a decent attention. Along with quality of recommendations, the utilization of user feedback has grown to be a key part in the POI recommendations. While implementing similarity-based methods in conventional recommender systems, it faces various issues such as trustworthiness, sparsity and cold-start. The commonness and popularity of social network facilitate people to interact with different users and generate massive data such as user relationships, ratings and interactions. Thus, integration of trust relationship of user in location based social network along with their feedback for POI recommendation is the motivation of this work. In this article, we present a POI recommendation method based on trust enhancement in social networks known as social pertinent trust walker (SPTW). Initially, the level of trust between users in social networks is calculated through matrix factorization technique. Then, SPTW with high probability location category algorithm helps to generate POIs as list of recommendations.

Aim To describe if the training level of laymen and medically educated bystanders affect 30-day survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA). Methods This observational study included all witnessed and treated cases of bystander CPR reported to the Swedish Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2010 and 2014. Bystander CPR was divided into two categories: (a) lay-byCPR (non-medically educated) and (b) med-byCPR (off duty medically educated personnel). Results During 2010–2014, 24,643 patients were reported to the OHCA registry, of which 6850 received lay-byCPR and 1444 med-byCPR; 16,349 crew-witnessed and non-witnessed cases and those with missing information were excluded from the analysis. The median interval from collapse to call for emergency medical services was 2 min in both groups (p = 0.97) and 2 min from collapse to start of CPR for lay-byCPR versus 1 min for med-byCPR (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in CPR methods used; 64.3% (lay-byCPR) and 65.7% (med-byCPR) applied compressions and ventilation, respectively (p = 0.33). The 30-day survival was 14.7% for lay-byCPR and 17.2% for the med-byCPR group (p = 0.02). The odds ratio adjusted for potential confounders regarding survival (med-byCPR versus lay-byCPR) was 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.62; p = 0.002). Conclusions In cases of OHCA, medically educated bystanders initiated CPR earlier and an increased 30-day survival was found compared with laymen bystanders.

Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are also employed namely: political governance (consisting of political stability and voice and accountability), economic governance (encompassing government effectiveness and regulation quality); institutional governance (entailing corruption-control and the rule of law), and general governance. The governance indicators are bundled by means of principal component analysis. The empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. Three key findings are established. First, all selected terrorism dynamics negatively affect political governance and its constituents. Second, evidence of a negative relationship is sparingly apparent in economic governance and its components. Third, no proof was confirmed in relation to the impact of terrorism and institutional governance with its elements. Fourth, compared with domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism more negatively and significantly affects political, economic, and general governances.

Drowsiness detection systems can alert drowsy operators and potentially reduce the risk of crashes. In this study, a Google-Glass-based drowsiness detection system was developed and validated. Methods The proximity sensor of Google Glass was used to monitor eye blink frequency. A simulated driving study was carried out to validate the system. Driving performance and eye blinks were compared between the two states of alertness and drowsiness while driving. Results Drowsy drivers increased frequency of eye blinks, produced longer braking response time and increased lane deviation, compared to when they were alert. A threshold algorithm for proximity sensor can reliably detect eye blinks and proved the feasibility of using Google Glass to detect operator drowsiness.

Based on the theoretical development of maritime cluster evolution in the current research literature, components and functions of maritime clusters are observed to have changed over time. However, very few empirical studies have been conducted on maritime cluster evolution that reflect the diverse components and their interactions within a cluster. Particularly, there is insufficient literature that systematically studies the relationship between ports and other maritime sectors, though the port is deemed to play an important role among sectors in maritime cluster development. This paper aims to fill these research gaps by analysing two cases – London and Hong Kong. London is considered as an international maritime service centre, while Hong Kong is en route to be an international maritime service centre, with the latter cluster possesses a supportive port while the former does not. Grounded on the symbiosis theory, this paper examines the evolution of maritime clusters empirically through investigating the interactions between a port and other sectors within a maritime cluster with the Lotka-Volterra model. Empirical results show that advanced maritime services, namely marine insurance and shipbroking, benefit from port development in London. However, these maritime services sectors are in pure competition with the port sector in Hong Kong. The research provides reference for policy makers on the dynamic development path of maritime clusters in practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Lotka-Volterra model; Maritime cluster evolution; Maritime service; Port development; Symbiosis theory","Marine insurance; Lotka-Volterra models; Maritime cluster evolution; Maritime services; Port development; Symbiosis theory; Predator prey systems",2-s2.0-85020769293

Because of the complex bio-mechanical movement of the bowling arm, it is not possible for the on-field umpire to declare a bowling action as legal or illegal. Inertial sensors are currently being used for activity recognition in cricket for the coaching of bowlers and detecting the legality of their moves, since a well trained and legal bowling action is highly significant for the career of a cricket player. After extensive analysis and research, we present a system to detect the legality of the bowling action based on real time multidimensional physiological data obtained from the inertial sensors mounted on the bowlers arm. We propose a method to examine the movement of the bowling arm in the correct rotation order with a precise angle. The system evaluates the bowling action using various action profiles. The action profiles are used so as to simplify the complex bio-mechanical movement of the bowling arm along with minimizing the size of the data provided to the classifier. The events of interest are identified and tagged. Algorithms such as support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, random forest, and artificial neural network are trained over statistical features extracted from the tagged data. To accomplish the reliability of outcome measures, the technical error of measurement was adopted. The proposed method achieves very high accuracy in the correct classification of bowling action. © 2017, The Author(s).","Activity recognition; Chucking; Classification; Cricket; Feature extraction; Inertial sensors; Machine learning","Biomechanics; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Inertial navigation systems; Kinematics; Learning systems; Mechanics; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Activity recognition; Chucking; Cricket; Inertial sensor; K-nearest neighbors; Mechanical movements; Physiological data; Statistical features; Data mining",2-s2.0-85019682191

We used data from the largest all-payer, nationally-representative inpatient database in the US to estimate the prevalence, temporal trends, and risk factors for comorbid depression among adult diabetic inpatients. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis using the 2002–2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample databases. Depression and other comorbidities were identified using ICD-9-CM codes. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between patient characteristics and depression. Results The rate of depression among patients with type 2 diabetes increased from 7.6% in 2002 to 15.4% in 2014, while for type 1 diabetes the rate increased from 8.7% in 2002 to 19.6% in 2014. The highest rates of depression were observed among females, non-Hispanic whites, younger patients, and patients with five or more chronic comorbidities. Conclusions The prevalence of comorbid depression among diabetic inpatients in the US is increasing rapidly. Although some portion of this increase could be explained by the rising prevalence of multimorbidity, increased awareness and likelihood of diagnosis of comorbid depression by physicians and better documentation as a result of the increased adoption of electronic health records likely contributed to this trend. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Depression; Diabetes mellitus; Multimorbidity; Nationwide Inpatient Sample; Trends; United States",,2-s2.0-85028942042

We performed time-series analysis of our process measure. Secondary analyses examined the endorsement and concordance of adherence barriers between patient-caregiver dyads. After three methods of testing, the most reliable delivery system was an EHR-integrated tablet that alerted staff of patient eligibility for assessment. Barriers were endorsed by 35% of caregivers (n=85) and 43% of patients (n=60). The most frequently patient-endorsed barriers were forgetting, poor taste, and side effects. Caregivers endorsed forgetting and side effects. Concordance between patient-caregiver dyads was fair (k=0.299).

The proposed ASR system employs various methods to increase recognition accuracy and noise robustness. Two different multi-channel speech enhancement techniques are used to eliminate interfering sounds in the audio stream. One speech enhancement method aims at separating the target speaker's voice from background sources based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) using variational Bayesian (VB) inference to estimate NMF parameters. The second technique is based on a time-varying minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer that uses spatial information to suppress sound signals not arriving from a desired direction. Prior to speech enhancement, a microphone channel failure detector is applied that is based on cross-comparing channels using a modulation-spectral representation of the speech signal. ASR feature extraction employs the amplitude modulation filter bank (AMFB) that implicates prior information of speech to analyze its temporal dynamics. AMFBs outperform the commonly used frame splicing technique of filter bank features in conjunction with a deep neural network (DNN) based ASR system, which denotes an equivalent data-driven approach to extract modulation-spectral information. In addition, features are speaker adapted, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed for language modeling, and hypotheses of different ASR systems are combined to further enhance the recognition accuracy. The proposed ASR system achieves an absolute word error rate (WER) of 5.67% on the real evaluation test data, which is 0.16% lower compared to the best score reported within the 3rd CHiME challenge. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Amplitude modulation filter bank; CHiME; Feature extraction; Modulation frequency analysis; Non-negative matrix factorization; Speech enhancement","Acoustic noise; Amplitude modulation; Audio acoustics; Audio recordings; Extraction; Face recognition; Factorization; Feature extraction; Filter banks; Matrix algebra; Microphones; Modeling languages; Modulation; Recurrent neural networks; Source separation; Speech; Speech enhancement; Speech processing; Automatic speech recognition; CHiME; Minimum variance distortionless response beamformer; Modulation frequencies; Noise-robust automatic speech recognition; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Speech enhancement methods; Speech recognition",2-s2.0-85009253124

Some important physical features of this system are due to the B-site ordering at long and short range. For microwave applications as filters and resonators, the 1:2 order is more appropriate. Otherwise, the oxygen vacancies and 1:1 order are considered the main factors behind the excellent performance of nonstoichiometric A3B′1+xB″2-xO9-δ-based ceramics as proton conductors. Until now, however, there are no available reports regarding the isolated effects of B-site ordering at long range on the electrical properties of stoichiometric systems.

The electrical properties of the ordered Ba3CaNb2O9 are analyzed in terms of a phenomenological model based on the parallel combination of a resistor, constant phase element, and capacitor. In particular, the conductivity relaxation ascribed to the grains is due to the oxygen vacancies.

In IWSN, unlike other sensor networks, late arrival of packets or delay or disruption to an on-going communication are considered as critical failure. Also, because IWSN is deployed in the overcrowded industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band it is difficult to meet this unique QoS requirements due to stiff competition for bandwidth from other technologies operating in ISM band resulting in scarcity of spectrum for reliable communication and/or disruption of ongoing communication. However, cognitive radio (CR) provides more spectral opportunities through opportunistic-use of unused licensed spectrum while ensuring minimal interference to licensed users. Similarly, spectrum handoff, which is a new type of handoff in cognitive radio, has the potential to offer increase bandwidth, reliable, smooth and interference-free communication for IWSNs through opportunistic-use of spectrum, minimal switching-delays, and efficient target channel selection strategies as well as effective link recovery maintenance. As a result, a new paradigm known as cognitive radio industrial wireless sensor network (CR-IWSN) has become the interest of recent research efforts. In this paper, we highlight and discuss important QoS requirements of IWSN as well as efforts of existing IWSN standards to address the challenges. We discuss the potential and how cognitive radio and spectrum handoff can be useful in the attempt to provide real-time reliable and smooth communication for IWSNs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive radio; Industrial wireless sensor network; Opportunistic use; Quality of service; Spectrum handoff","Bandwidth; Competition; Industrial research; Quality of service; Radio systems; Wireless sensor networks; Critical failures; Delay-sensitive applications; Industrial wireless sensor networks; Opportunistic use; Recent researches; Reliability and availability; Reliable communication; Spectrum handoffs; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85028974532

It consisted of 15 questions regarding transplant providers’ attitudes, clinical practice, and beliefs pertaining to medication adherence among teenage solid-organ transplant recipients. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Responses to open-ended questions were coded and categorized into themes. One hundred ten surveys were completed by providers specializing in pediatric heart, kidney, liver, lung, and/or intestinal transplantation. Commonly cited reasons for poor adherence were forgetting/poor planning (94%), the desire to be normal (86%), lack of support (86%), and poor parental monitoring (79%). Suggestions to improve adherence included increasing peer and family support, providing education, and incorporating technology into adherence regimens.

To date, there is very little evidence on youth responses to the changed packs. Aim To assess attitudes towards, and responses to, tobacco plain packs preimplementation and postimplementation. Methods The Tobacco Promotion Impact Study (TPIS) was a yearly cross-sectional telephone survey of adolescents and young adults (12–24 years) from the states of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland, conducted at three time points preimplementation (June 2010; June 2011; June 2012) and one time point postimplementation (June 2013; total n=8820). Results There were significant increases in support for plain packaging from preimplementation to postimplementation for: never smokers (56% in 2012 vs 63% in 2013; OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.90, p=0.001), experimenters/ex-smokers (55% in 2012 vs 72% in 2013; OR=0.51, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.68, p<0.001) and current smokers (35% in 2012 vs 55% in 2013; OR=0.49, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.75, p=0.001). At postimplementation, 16% of never smokers reported that plain packaging made them less likely to try smoking and 18% of experimenters/ex-smokers reported that plain packaging made them less likely to smoke again. Youth were significantly less likely to have anticipated these responses preimplementation (never smokers: 8% in 2011; OR=0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.65, p<0.00; experimenters/ex-smokers: 11%; OR=0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82, p<0.001). At postimplementation, 34% of smokers reported a quitting-related response to plain packaging (tried to quit or thought about quitting); the proportion who anticipated such a response preimplementation was significantly less (14% in 2011; OR=0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.53, p<0.001). 28% of smokers reported a social denormalisation response at postimplementation (hid their pack from view, used a case to cover their pack, felt embarrassed); the proportion who anticipated such a response preimplementation was significantly less (9% in 2011; OR=0.24, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.42, p<0.001). Conclusions The actual response of youth to plain packaging was greater than anticipated prior to their introduction, and support for plain packaging increased from preimplementation to postimplementation among all groups of youth.

We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effect size of social media-based interventions on weight-related outcome measures. Results: We identified 22 interventions from the keyword and reference search, including 12 randomized controlled trials, 6 pre-post studies and 3 cohort studies conducted in 9 countries during 2010-2016. The majority (N = 17) used Facebook, followed by Twitter (N = 4) and Instagram (N = 1). Intervention durations averaged 17.8 weeks with a mean sample size of 69. The meta- analysis showed that social media-based interventions were associated with a statistically significant, but clinically modest reduction of body weight by 1.01 kg, body mass index by 0.92 kg/m2, and waist circumstance by 2.65 cm, and an increase of daily number of steps taken by 1530. In the meta-regression there was no dose-response effect with respect to intervention duration.

Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials published after January 1990 and until December 2016 reporting daily changes in intakes of SSB or water in volumetric measurements (mL d−1) were included. References were retrieved through searches of electronic databases and quality appraisal followed Cochrane principles. We calculated mean differences (MD) and synthesized data with random-effects models. Forty studies with 16 505 participants were meta-analysed. Interventions significantly decreased consumption of SSB in children by 76 mL d−1 (95% confidence interval [CI] −105 to −46; 23 studies, P &lt; 0.01), and in adolescents (−66 mL d−1, 95% CI −130 to −2; 5 studies, P = 0.04) but not in adults (−13 mL d−1, 95% CI −44 to 18; 12 studies, P = 0.16). Pooled estimates of water intakes were only possible for interventions in children, and results were indicative of increases in water intake (MD +67 mL d−1, 95% CI 6 to 128; 7 studies, P = 0.04). For children, there was evidence to suggest that modelling/demonstrating the behaviour helped to reduce SSB intake and that interventions within the home environment had greater effects than school-based interventions. In conclusion, public health interventions – mainly via nutritional education/counselling – are moderately successful at reducing intakes of SSB and increasing water intakes in children. However, on average, only small reductions in SSBs have been achieved by interventions targeting adolescents and adults.

However, to date, progress in this area has been surprisingly slow. Furthermore, the majority of the attempts at successful commercialization have failed, often in the face of consumer ambivalence over the perceived benefits/utility. In this review, with the focus squarely on the domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), we summarize the state-of-the-art in the area. We highlight the key possibilities and pitfalls as far as stimulating the so-called ‘lower’ senses of taste, smell, and the trigeminal system are concerned. Ultimately, we suggest that mixed reality solutions are currently the most plausible as far as delivering (or rather modulating) flavour experiences digitally is concerned. The key problems with digital fragrance delivery are related to attention and attribution. People often fail to detect fragrances when they are concentrating on something else; And even when they detect that their chemical senses have been stimulated, there is always a danger that they attribute their experience (e.g., pleasure) to one of the other senses – this is what we call ‘the fundamental attribution error’. We conclude with an outlook on digitizing the chemical senses and summarize a set of open-ended questions that the HCI community has to address in future explorations of smell and taste as interaction modalities © 2017","Augmented reality; Chemical senses; Crossmodal; Mixed reality; Smell; Taste; Trigeminal; Virtual reality","Augmented reality; Odors; Virtual reality; Chemical sense; Cross-modal; Mixed reality; Smell; Taste; Trigeminal; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-85021165293

Several factors have been identified which may explain why the rate of blood pressure control remains low. Among them, one can cite medical inertia and a poor adherence to drug therapies. In the absence of new drugs to control blood pressure, drug adherence has become a major issue in the management of hypertensive patients. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the major problem is the lack of persistence followed by a poor day to day execution of the prescribed regimens. Although there are multiple ways of assessing drug adherence, only very few of them are accurate and the most accurate ones are either difficult to implement in clinical practice or too expensive and hence not available outside reference centers. Therefore, physicians have no real capacity to establish a correct diagnosis of non persistence or poor adherence even in high risk patients such as those with resistant hypertension. Today a new approach is becoming increasingly used which consists in measuring urinary drug levels. Nevertheless, there is still an important need for simple and cheap techniques or devices helping physicians in their ability to tackle poor adherence to therapy and thereby improve blood pressure control in the population. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Drug measurements; Initiation; Persistence; Questionnaires; Resistant hypertension",,2-s2.0-85029621556

Background: The nursing workforce experiences rates of ill health above that of other workforces, yet there is little investment in workplace health promotion. Design: The study used a modified Delphi design conducted between September and November 2015. Methods: Eleven of 19 purposively selected expert panellists discussed, rated and provided feedback through two rounds of an electronic questionnaire about the relative importance and feasibility of 46 workplace health promotion interventions and processes for nurses and midwives. Scores for importance and feasibility were calculated and ranked and a composite score of importance multiplied by feasibility. Results: Mental health strategies were prioritized as the most important and feasible of the intervention topics, followed closely by healthy eating and physical activity interventions; smoking cessation ranked lowest. The most highly ranked interventions targeted healthy eating, stress management and resilience training. Highest ranked processes to support development of a healthy work environment included intersectoral collaboration and employee wellness groups.

However, the impact of recovery efforts on a firm’s performance after a public and large service failure—such as a large-scale information breach—has received scant attention. To address this gap, this current research develops a framework and finds support for the impact of service crisis recoveries on a firm’s performance, as measured by firm-idiosyncratic risk. Using a unique dataset of service crisis recoveries, the authors find that firms offering compensation (i.e., tangible redresses) or process improvement (i.e., improvements in organizational processes) show more stable performance (less idiosyncratic risk), from two quarters to two calendar years after the announcement of their recovery plan. In line with the documented dual effect of apologies, firms that offer apology-based recoveries display more volatile performance (higher idiosyncratic risk). Of note, this volatility increases with the number of affected individuals, and it remains unaffected even when the apology is expressed with high intensity. © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science.","Firm risk; Information breach; Marketing–finance interface; Service crisis; Service crisis recovery; Shareholder value",,2-s2.0-85019714691

Using a motion-based driving simulator, drivers encountered different situations in which a partially automated vehicle could no longer safely keep the lateral guidance. Drivers were distracted by a non-driving related task on a touch display or driving without an additional secondary task. While driving in partially automated mode drivers could either take their hands off the steering wheel for only a short period of time (10 s, so-called ‘Hands-on’ variant) or for an extended period of time (120 s, so-called ‘Hands-off’ variant). When the system limit was reached (e.g., when entering a work zone with temporary lines), the lateral vehicle control by the automation was suddenly discontinued and a take-over request was issued to the drivers. Regardless of the hands-off interval and the availability of a secondary task, all drivers managed the transition to manual driving safely. No lane exceedances were observed and the situations were rated as ‘harmless’ by the drivers. The lack of difference between the hands-off intervals can be partly attributed to the fact that most of the drivers kept contact to the steering wheel, even in the hands-off condition. Although all drivers were able to control the system limits, most of them could not explain why exactly the take-over request was issued. The average helpfulness of the take-over request was rated on an intermediate level. Consequently, providing drivers with information about the reason for a system limit can be recommended. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automated driving; Controllability; Lateral scenarios; Partial automation","Automation; Automobile drivers; Control system synthesis; Controllability; Steering; Wheels; Automated driving; Automated vehicles; Driver performance; Driving performance; Driving simulator; Intermediate level; Lateral scenarios; Partial automation; Automobile steering equipment",2-s2.0-85028699543

Traditionally, multi-style training procedures require either collecting or artificially creating data samples (e.g., by noise injection or data combination) and training a deep neural network (DNN) with all of these different conditions. To expand the applicability of deep learning, the present study instead adopts a DAE to augment the original training set. First, a DAE is utilized to synthesize data that captures useful structure in the input distribution. Next, this synthetic data is combined and mixed within the original training set to exploit the powerful capabilities of DNN classifiers to learn the complex decision boundaries in heterogeneous conditions. By assigning a DAE to synthesize additional examples of representative variations, multi-style learning makes class boundaries less sensitive to corruptions by enforcing back-end DNNs to emphasize on the most discriminative patterns. Moreover, this deep learning technique mitigates the cost and time of data collection and is easy to incorporate into the internet of things (IoT).

Yet, the 2015 Paris Agreement has essentially given up on this approach, on which the 1997 Kyoto Protocol was based, and now relies on policies that are adopted unilaterally and voluntarily by individual countries. Since ambitious climate policies are very unlikely to be enacted and effectively implemented without strong public support, research is beginning to explore how strong public support is for unilateral climate policy and what its determinants are. Recent research has developed useful survey instruments to gauge public support for unilateral climate policy. Results from surveys and survey-embedded experiments show that when respondents are confronted with cost implications and free-riding problems associated with unilateral climate policy, public support tends to drop to some extent, but still remains quite high. Current research thus shows that people are—the hitherto strong global public goods framing of climate policy notwithstanding—surprisingly nonreciprocal in their climate policy preferences. Preferences concerning climate policy tend to be driven primarily by a range of personal predispositions and cost considerations, which existing research has already explored quite extensively, rather than by considerations of what other countries do.

One hundred forty-seven SLE patients meeting the revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were enrolled. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) was used to assess disease activity, whereas organ damage was scored using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/ACR Damage Index.

Using communications privacy management and impression management theories we first develop four propositions about possible user strategies that combine differing levels of disclosure, network size, and privacy setting use. One strategy is the most public, whereas two others deviate from this public strategy by either limiting disclosures, or using privacy settings to restrict access. The final strategy is the most private. We then survey two samples of Facebook users (college students and the general population) about their privacy management behaviors, privacy perceptions, technology usage perceptions, and demographics. Using cluster analysis we find some support for all four propositions, and for an additional strategy that beginning users may employ. The findings also reveal intriguing differences among the privacy management strategies in terms of perceptions and demographics like privacy concern, usefulness, enjoyment, and age, gender, and experience.

Compared to many existing classification methods (e.g., hot-spot detection, sequential alignment method), the network method substantiates the social meanings underlying the interconnectedness and similarities of people's activity trajectories and better integrates spatial interaction (colocation or distance-decay) and temporal connections (concurrence or sequence) of daily lives in the measure of similarity. This approach enables us to detect variant community structures, with individuals in the same community interacting relatively more than individuals belonging to different communities, by decomposing the complex trajectories into different meaningful events (e.g., activities, trips, tours, and subsequences). We also demonstrate the practicality and scientific merit of the network analysis approach in a case study of household travel behavior in Charlotte, North Carolina. Results derived from disaggregated survey data establish the effectiveness and flexibility of the network methods to detect cohesive communities of individuals and ATPs by different narratives of everyday-life events. This study also suggests that the network analysis approach has great potential to classify large datasets of other space-time trajectories and to discover policy-sensitive activity, trip, and tour patterns that help us develop policy and planning alternatives for sustainable communities and mobility. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Activity-travel trajectories and patterns; Community detection; Network methods; Space-time visualization; Spatial interaction","Classification (of information); Motor transportation; Pattern recognition; Trajectories; Activity-travel patterns; Charlotte , North Carolina; Community detection; Measure of similarities; Network methods; Space time; Spatial interaction; Sustainable communities; Transportation",2-s2.0-85028569791

This meta-analysis investigated the effect of web-based interventions on different types of physical activity (PA) measurements in general population and potential moderating variables. Study design PubMed, CINAHL, EBSCOhost, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid, and ScienceDirect literature searches were conducted to identify studies investigating the effect of web-based interventions on PA. Methods Randomized controlled trials on PA changes reported in moderate to vigorous intensity, walking, and step count in the intervention group in comparison with the control group were pooled with a fixed-effects model separately. Results A total of 22 studies comprising 16,476 and 14,475 subjects in intervention and control groups respectively were included. Web-based interventions had positive and significant effect on increasing PA. Of 14 trials reporting moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), five showed a significant increase in the MVPA level after the intervention. There was significant heterogeneity between studies (P &lt; 0.001 and I2 = 67.8%). Of six trials that reported the number of steps by using the pedometer, three showed a significant increase for the step counts in intervention groups (P &lt; 0.001 and I2 = 93.3%), of 14 trials assessed PA level by reporting walking minutes per week, four studies showed a significant increase in walking minutes. There was significant heterogeneity between studies (P &lt; 0.001, I2 = 68.1%). Overall, the effect of web-based interventions seemed to be influenced by the characteristics of mean age of participants, trial duration, and study quality (P &lt; 0.05).

Unique behavioral, psychosocial, and cognitive risk factors among this population must be specifically addressed within weight management programs. We review extant treatment approaches, including lessons learned from the nascent literature specifically targeting this population. Lastly, we provide suggestions to inform future work in this area. Recent Findings: The EARLY consortium comprises seven clinical trials targeting weight control in young adults age 18–35. Though these studies encompass a broader age range, two of the trials enrolled large numbers of 18–25-year-olds. Results from these trials and other recent pilot trials provide a foundation for next steps with respect to developing weight management interventions for emerging adults. Summary: The design of targeted weight control approaches for emerging and young adults has contributed to improved outcomes for this high-risk population. However, suboptimal engagement and variability in response pose challenges.

In particular, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were carried out for IRGANOX® 1076 phenolic compound irradiated with neutron beams with different energy spectra at various depths inside a water phantom. The addition of gadolinium increases sensitivity of phenolic ESR (electron spin resonance) dosimeters to neutrons thanks to the high gadolinium cross section for neutron capture and to the large number of secondary particles (mainly Auger and internal conversion electrons) which are able to release energy inside the sensitive material layers. For small depths in water phantom and low energy neutron spectra the increase in dose due to gadolinium is large (more than a factor 50). The enhancement is smaller in case of epithermal neutron beam, whereas the increase in dose for fast neutrons is less than 50%. In order to have a comparison with other ESR dosimeters the energy released per unit mass in phenolic compound was compared with that calculated in alanine pellets. For thermal neutron beams the energy released in phenolic compound with gadolinium is comparable to that released in alanine for small depths in phantom, whereas it is larger than in alanine for large depths. In case of epithermal and fast neutron beams the energy released in phenolic compound is larger than in alanine samples because the elastic scattering with hydrogen nuclei is more probable for high neutron energies and this phenolic compound is characterized by an higher number of 1H nuclei than alanine.

The utilization of metabolomics approaches is revolutionizing the field of dietary assessment by associating metabolic profiles with intake of specific foods or dietary patterns and/or investigating human health status in nutritional trials. Combining dietary biomarkers with conventional dietary assessment methods is considered a potential strategy for tackling the complexity of dietary exposure fingerprinting. Scope and approach We discuss existing approaches among dietary assessment methods and dietary biomarkers. A combined approach taking into consideration data from dietary questionnaires with measurements of dietary biomarkers is emphasized. Key findings and conclusions Trends in novel strategies for improving dietary exposure assessment will be influenced by the discovery and validation of dietary exposure biomarkers. Among different strategies, multi-metabolite biomarker panels enable more reliable estimation of dietary exposure than does the traditional single-biomarker approach. Therefore, a combined approach using data from dietary questionnaires along with measurements of dietary biomarkers is considered an excellent strategy for improving dietary exposure assessment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomarkers; Dietary assessment; Dietary questionnaires; Metabolomics; Multi-metabolite biomarker model; Nutrimetabolomics","Biomarkers; Data fusion; Health risks; Metabolites; Risk assessment; Surveys; Accurate measurement; Dietary assessments; Dietary exposure assessments; Dietary questionnaires; Metabolic profiles; Metabolomics; Novel strategies; Nutrimetabolomics; Nutrition",2-s2.0-85019649377

Substantial geographic variation has been noted in the incidence of osteoporotic fractures worldwide, with Western populations (North America, Europe and Oceania), reporting increases in hip fracture throughout the second half of the 20th century, with a stabilisation or decline in the last two decades. In developing populations however, particularly in Asia, the rates of osteoporotic fracture appears to be increasing. The massive global burden consequent to osteoporosis means that fracture risk assessment should be a high priority among health measures considered by policy makers. The WHO operational definition of osteoporosis, based on a measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), has been used globally since the mid-1990s. However, although this definition identifies those at greatest individual risk of fracture, in the population overall a greater total number of fractures occur in individuals with BMD values above the threshold for osteoporosis diagnosis. A number of web-based tools to enable the inclusion of clinical risk factors, with or without BMD, in fracture prediction algorithms have been developed to improve the identification of individuals at high fracture risk, the most commonly used globally being FRAX®. Access to DXA, osteoporosis risk assessment, case finding and treatment varies worldwide, but despite such advances studies indicate that a minority of men and women at high fracture risk receive treatment. Importantly, research is ongoing to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis case finding and risk assessment strategies worldwide. The huge burden caused by osteoporosis related fractures to individuals, healthcare systems and societies should provide a clear impetus for the progression of such approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Assessment; Epidemiology; Geography; High fracture risk; Osteoporosis","Article; bone density; case finding; disease association; disease course; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; ethnic difference; fracture treatment; fragility fracture; geographic distribution; global disease burden; global health; health care cost; health care policy; high risk patient; human; incidence; musculoskeletal disease assessment; orthopedic software; osteoporosis; primary prevention; public health problem; risk assessment; risk factor; secondary prevention; sex difference; treatment outcome",2-s2.0-85011031806

Individual, dyadic (i.e., parent/child; siblings), and familial factors that are associated with, or moderate associations with childhood obesity will be examined. Phase I includes in-home observations of diverse families (n = 150; 25 each of African American, American Indian, Hispanic/Latino, Hmong, Somali, and White families). In-home observations include: (1) an interactive observational family task; (2) ecological momentary assessment of parent stress, mood, and parenting practices; (3) child and parent accelerometry; (4) three 24-hour child dietary recalls; (5) home food inventory; (6) built environment audit; (7) anthropometry on all family members; (8) an online survey; and (9) a parent interview. Phase I data will be used for analyses and to inform development of a culturally appropriate survey for Phase II. The survey will be administered at two time points to diverse parents (n = 1200) of children ages 5–9.

Selecting apps through keyword search or recommendations from friends or social networks (e.g., Facebook) may not match the real preferences of users, especially when the need is just-in-time and context specific. Although there are many collaborative filtering approaches that are capable of generating time-aware recommendations, most of them work on modeling of the time stamps (the time that events happen) rather than modeling of the sequential patterns (in cases that time stamps are not available) as well as investigating the factors behind those patterns. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for modeling three important factors governing the app installation of smart phone users: (1) short-term context, (2) co-installation pattern, and (3) random choice. Specifically, we use a hidden Markov model equipped with heterogeneous emission distributions to incorporate these factors. Apps being installed are probabilistically categorized into one of these factors, and app recommendations for users are carried out accordingly. This coherent model can be inferred effectively by using Gibbs sampling. The formulation has a significant advantage that the performance is less sensitive to data sparsity and incompleteness. Empirical results show that it has higher performance in recommending mobile apps to smart phone users, measured in terms of precision and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Besides, the proposed model allows the nature of the apps, with respect to the three factors, to be revealed as well as the extent to which each user is affected by the three factors to be inferred, providing additional insights on the users’ behavior. © 2017 Springer-Verlag London Ltd.","App recommendation; Heterogeneous models; Mobile apps; Recommender systems",,2-s2.0-85032374270

However, RCTs commencing before pregnancy have significant participant recruitment and retention challenges. The Calcium And Pre-eclampsia trial (CAP trial) is a World Health Organization multi-country RCT of calcium supplementation commenced before pregnancy to prevent recurrent pre-eclampsia in which non-pregnant participants are recruited and followed up until childbirth. This sub-study explores recruitment methods and preconception retention of participants of the CAP trial to inform future trials. Methods: Recruiters at the study sites in Argentina, South Africa and Zimbabwe completed post-recruitment phase questionnaires on recruitment methods used. Qualitative data from these questionnaires and quantitative data on pre-pregnancy trial visit attendance and pregnancy rates up to September 2016 are reported in this paper. RStudio (Version 0.99.903 https://www.rstudio.org ) statistical software was used for summary statistics. Results: Between July 2011 and 8 September 2016, 1354 women with previous pre-eclampsia were recruited. Recruitment took 2 years longer than expected and was facilitated mainly through medical record/register and maternity ward/clinic-based strategies. Recruiters highlighted difficulties associated with inadequate medical records, redundant patient contact details, and follow-up of temporarily ineligible women as some of the challenges faced. Whilst the attendance rates at pre-pregnancy visits were high (78% or more), visits often occurred later than scheduled. Forty-five percent of participants became pregnant (614/1354), 33.5% (454/1354) within 1 year of randomization. Conclusions: In preconception trials, both retrospective and prospective methods are useful for recruiting eligible women with certain conditions. However, these are time-consuming in low-resource settings with suboptimal medical records and other challenges. Trial planners should ensure that trial budgets cover sufficient on-site researchers with pre-trial training, and should consider using mobile phone and web-based electronic tools to optimize recruitment and retention. This should lead to greater efficiency and shorter trial durations. Trial registration: Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry, Registration Number: PACTR201105000267371.

Within the scope of this study, the position of a mobile user is determined on the basis of lateration. Two new differential approaches are developed and compared to two common models, i.e., the one-slope and multi-wall model, for the conversion of the measured RSS of the Wi-Fi signals into ranges. The two novel methods are termed DWi-Fi as they are derived either from the well-known DGPS or VLBI positioning principles. They make use of a network of reference stations deployed in the area of interest. From continuous RSS observations on these reference stations correction parameters are derived and applied by the user in real-time. This approach leads to a reduced influence of temporal and spatial variations and various propagation effects on the positioning result. In practical use cases conducted in a multi-storey office building with three different smartphones, it is proven that the two DWi-Fi approaches outperform the common models as static positioning yielded to position errors of about 5 m in average under good spatial conditions. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Differential approach; lateration; path loss models; RSS to range conversion; Wi-Fi positioning","Indoor positioning systems; Office buildings; Differential approach; Lateration; Location finger printings; Path loss models; Positioning principles; Received signal strength; Temporal and spatial variation; Wi-Fi Positioning; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)",2-s2.0-85030326995

The first describes the propensity to form connections, while the second defines the propensity to attract them. We derive analytically the epidemic threshold considering the time scale driving the evolution of contacts and the contagion as comparable. The solutions are general and hold for any joint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables. We find that heterogeneous distributions of attractiveness alter the contagion process. In particular, in the case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, heterogeneous attractiveness facilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between activity and attractiveness hamper the spreading.

Detailed security analysis shows that various security threats can be defended.

This paper discusses the ease of use of a classic touch screen user interface (TUI) in contrast to a gesture-based user interface (GBUI) applied to a mobile device. Two basic positions are used for comparison: “normal” when individual is standing and “special” when individual is lying down. The first represents a common position for healthy individuals, while the second is used to represent sick, disabled or comfortable individuals. Two software applications have been developed in order to set an interaction test for TUI and GBUI, which was performed by 25 users. The interaction tests show that GBUI has a very reasonable average accuracy of 88.5% in special position and 89.8% in normal position, while TUI presents an average accuracy of 96.5% in special position and 97.4% in normal position. Therefore, GBUI could be a complementary form of interaction to TUI that can be useful to any user, especially for cases of illness or simple comfort of the user. As study case, we have developed a software solution called SICLLE (emergency call control interactive system) that manages phone calls in a smartphone and applies the concept of gestural control tree to set a gestural navigation through a gestural language from a gestural vocabulary. An architecture for mobile devices supporting GBUI has been proposed and used in the implementation of SICLLE.

This study aimed to explore children’s experiences and perceptions of neighbourhood POS in order to understand POS affordances for children’s independent mobility (CIM). This study utilised go-along (walking) and home interviews with 140 children aged 9–13 years living in nine diverse neighbourhoods across Auckland, New Zealand. Interviews were recorded and transcripts analysed using deductive thematic analysis. Themes explored were: (1) CIM and factors influencing CIM (i.e. parental licence, use of mobile phone technology, safety of POS and geographical relocation) and (2) affordances of POS (including actualising affordances for play). Key findings indicate that POS were preferred local neighbourhood destinations and play was the main affordance experienced in POS. Parental restrictions were the greatest influence on whether a child could make independent trips to the POS. Mobile technologies may be useful for facilitating independence in the neighbourhood.

Data acquired by the hosted sensors are usually processed by machine-learning-based algorithms to classify human activities. The success of those algorithms mostly depends on the availability of training (labeled) data that, if made publicly available, would allow researchers to make objective comparisons between techniques. Nowadays, there are only a few publicly available data sets, which often contain samples from subjects with too similar characteristics, and very often lack specific information so that is not possible to select subsets of samples according to specific criteria. In this article, we present a new dataset of acceleration samples acquired with an Android smartphone designed for human activity recognition and fall detection. The dataset includes 11,771 samples of both human activities and falls performed by 30 subjects of ages ranging from 18 to 60 years. Samples are divided in 17 fine grained classes grouped in two coarse grained classes: one containing samples of 9 types of activities of daily living (ADL) and the other containing samples of 8 types of falls. The dataset has been stored to include all the information useful to select samples according to different criteria, such as the type of ADL performed, the age, the gender, and so on. Finally, the dataset has been benchmarked with four different classifiers and with two different feature vectors. We evaluated four different classification tasks: fall vs. no fall, 9 activities, 8 falls, 17 activities and falls. For each classification task, we performed a 5-fold cross-validation (i.e., including samples from all the subjects in both the training and the test dataset) and a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (i.e., the test data include the samples of a subject only, and the training data, the samples of all the other subjects). Regarding the classification tasks, the major findings can be summarized as follows: (i) it is quite easy to distinguish between falls and ADLs, regardless of the classifier and the feature vector selected. Indeed, these classes of activities present quite different acceleration shapes that simplify the recognition task; (ii) on average, it is more difficult to distinguish between types of falls than between types of activities, regardless of the classifier and the feature vector selected. This is due to the similarity between the acceleration shapes of different kinds of falls. On the contrary, ADLs acceleration shapes present differences except for a small group. Finally, the evaluation shows that the presence of samples of the same subject both in the training and in the test datasets, increases the performance of the classifiers regardless of the feature vector used. This happens because each human subject differs from other subjects in performing activities even if she shares with them the same physical characteristics. © 2017 by the authors.","Activity of daily living recognition; Dataset; Fall detection; Human activity recognition; Smartphone accelerometers",,2-s2.0-85032299017

It proposes a framework for networked learning in agricultural extension and contributes a theoretical and case-based rationale for adopting the networked learning paradigm. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the literature highlights the economic and pedagogical need for adopting a networked learning approach. Two examples are described to instantiate the language for learning networks: a small community of farmers in India and large Twitter community of Australian farmers. Findings: This paper reviews evidence that successful networked learning interventions are already occurring within agricultural extension. It provides a framework for describing these interventions and for helping future designers of learning networks in agricultural extension. Practical implication: Facilitation of learning networks can serve to achieve efficient agricultural extension that connects farmers across distances for constructivist learning. To realize these benefits, designers of learning networks need to consider set design, social design and epistemic design. Theoretical implication: This paper contributes a theoretical framework for designing, implementing and analysing learning networks in agriculture. It does this by integrating existing ideas from networked learning and applying them to the agricultural context through examples.

Many medical applications for smartphones and tablets have already been developed and widely used by both health professionals and patients. Specifically, video recordings of fingertips made using a smartphone camera contain a pulsatile component caused by the cardiac pulse equivalent to that present in a photoplethysmographic signal. By performing peak detection on the pulsatile signal, it is possible to estimate a continuous heart rate and a respiratory rate. To estimate the heart rate and respiratory rate accurately, which pixel regions of the color bands give the most optimal signal quality should be investigated. In this paper, we investigate signal quality to determine the best signal quality by the largest amplitude values for three different smartphones under different conditions. We conducted several experiments to obtain reliable PPG signals and compared the PPG signal strength in the three color bands when the flashlight was both on and off. We also evaluated the intensity changes of PPG signals obtained from the smartphones with motion artifacts and fingertip pressure force. Furthermore, we have compared the PSNR of PPG signals of the full-size images with that of the region of interests (ROIs). © 2017 by the authors.

Little is reported on the quality or potential safety impact of surgical lighting in low-resource settings, where power failures are common and equipment and resources are limited. Methods: Members of the Lifebox Foundation created a novel, non-mandatory, 18-item survey tool using an iterative process. This was distributed to surgical providers practicing in low-resource settings through surgical societies and mailing lists. Results: We received 100 complete responses, representing a range of surgical centres from 39 countries. Poor-quality surgical field lighting was reported by 40% of respondents, with 32% reporting delayed or cancelled operations due to poor lighting and 48% reporting electrical power failures at least once per week. Eighty per cent reported the quality of their surgical lighting presents a patient safety risk with 18% having direct experience of poor-quality lighting leading to negative patient outcomes. When power outages occur, 58% of surgeons rely on a backup generator and 29% operate by mobile phone light. Only 9% of respondents regularly use a surgical headlight, with the most common barriers reported as unaffordability and poor in-country suppliers. Conclusions: In our survey of surgeons working in low-resource settings, a majority report poor surgical lighting as a major risk to patient safety and nearly one-third report delayed or cancelled operations due to poor lighting. Developing and distributing robust, affordable, high-quality surgical headlights could provide an ideal solution to this significant surgical safety issue. © 2017 Société Internationale de Chirurgie",,,2-s2.0-85031774890

To overcome these limitations, the UMineAR mobile tablet application was developed. It enables users to rapidly identify underground mine objects (drifts, entrances, boreholes, hazards) and intuitively visualize them in 3D using a mobile augmented reality (AR) technique. To design UMineAR, South Korean georeferenced standard-mine geographic information system (GIS) databases were employed. A web database system was designed to access via a tablet groundwater-level data measured every hour by sensors installed in boreholes. UMineAR consists of search, AR, map, and database modules. The search module provides data retrieval and visualization options/functions. The AR module provides 3D interactive visualization of mine GIS data and camera imagery on the tablet screen. The map module shows the locations of corresponding borehole data on a 2D map. The database module provides mine GIS database management functions. A case study showed that the proposed application is suitable for onsite visualization of high-volume mine GIS data based on geolocations; no specialized equipment or skills are required to understand the underground mine environment.

The intracellular ROS levels are dependent on the dynamic balance between ROS generation and elimination. In this review, we summarize reported studies about the influences of magnetic fields (MFs) on ROS levels. Although in most cases, MFs increased ROS levels in human, mouse, rat cells, and tissues, there are also studies showing that ROS levels were decreased or not affected by MFs. Multiple factors could cause these discrepancies, including but not limited to MF type/intensity/frequency, exposure time and assay time-point, as well as different biological samples examined. It will be necessary to investigate the influences of different MFs on ROS in various biological samples systematically and mechanistically, which will be helpful for people to get a more complete understanding about MF-induced biological effects. In addition, reviewing the roles of MFs in ROS modulation may open up new scenarios of MF application, which could be further and more widely adopted into clinical applications, particularly in diseases that ROS have documented pathophysiological roles. © 2017 by the authors.

We estimated economic gradients in the distribution of these efforts and of their impacts within and across endemic countries. Methods: Using Demographic and Health Surveys we computed equity metrics to characterize the distribution of malaria interventions in 30 endemic countries proxying economic position with an asset-wealth index. Gradients were summarized in a concentration index, tabulated against level of coverage, and compared among interventions, across countries, and against respective trends over the period 2005-2015. Results: There remain broad differences in coverage of malaria interventions and their distribution by wealth within and across countries. In most, economic gradients are lacking or favor the poorest for vector control; malaria services delivered through the formal healthcare sector are much less equitable. Scale-up of interventions in many countries improved access across the wealth continuum; in some, these efforts consistently prioritized the poorest. Expansions in control programs generally narrowed coverage gaps between economic strata; gradients persist in countries where growth was slower in the poorest quintile or where baseline inequality was large. Despite progress, malaria is consistently concentrated in the poorest, with the degree of inequality in burden far surpassing that expected given gradients in the distribution of interventions. Conclusions: Economic gradients in the distribution of interventions persist over time, limiting progress toward equity in malaria control. We found that, in countries with large baseline inequality in the distribution of interventions, even a small bias in expansion favoring the least poor yielded large gradients in intervention coverage while pro-poor growth failed to close the gap between the poorest and least poor. We demonstrated that dimensions of disadvantage compound for the poor a lack of economic gradients in the distribution of malaria services does not translate to equity in coverage nor can it be interpreted to imply equity in distribution of risk or disease burden. Our analysis testifies to the progress made by countries in narrowing economic gradients in malaria interventions and highlights the scope for continued monitoring of programs with respect to equity. © 2017 The Author(s).","Asset-wealth quintiles; Concentration index; DHS; Equity; Malaria; Malaria intervention coverage",,2-s2.0-85031669123

Due to nowadays manufacturers moving more towards assembly-to-order production throughout a distributed supply chain, the common practice of outsourcing of certain modules entails make-or-buy (MOB) decisions that must be taken into account in PFA. While the PFA and MOB decisions are enacted for different concerns of the manufacturer and the suppliers, it is important to deal with joint optimisation of the PFA and MOB problems. The prevailing decision models for joint optimisation are mainly originated from an ‘all-in-one’ approach that assumes both PFA and MOB decisions can be integrated into one single-level optimisation problem. Such an assumption neglects the complex trade-offs underlying two different decision-making problems and fails to reveal the inherent coupling of PFA and MOB decisions. This paper proposes to formulate joint optimisation of the PFA and MOB problems as a Stackelberg game, in which a bilevel decision mechanism model is deployed to reveal the inherent coupling and hierarchical relationships between PFA and MOB decisions. A nonlinear bilevel optimisation model is developed with the PFA problem acting as the leader and each MOB problem performing as a follower. A nested genetic algorithm is developed to solve the bilevel optimisation model. A case study of power transformer PFA subject to MOB considerations is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of bilevel joint optimisation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bilevel programming; joint optimisation; make-or-buy decisions; outsourcing; product family architecting; Stackelberg game","Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Optimization; Outsourcing; Power transformers; Supply chains; Bi-level programming; Make-or-buy decisions; Optimisations; Product families; Stackelberg Games; Decision making",2-s2.0-85016129043

This research examines the media preferences of mobile phone service consumers in the United States as their source of information regarding competing mobile phone service plans. The study also addresses whether the advertising media preferences of mobile phone service consumers vary across demographic characteristics. The survey data were collected from 471 employees and students of two higher education institutions. Descriptive statistics including medians and quartiles are calculated for media preferences. Frequencies are used to summarize demographic characteristics. Chi-square tests are used to determine if relationships exist between demographic characteristics and advertising media preferences. The results indicate that for mobile phone service buyers in the United States, the most important media they consider as their source of information on competing mobile phone service plans is word of mouth. Moreover, consumers ranked provider's website as second, search engine marketing as third, and social media as the fourth preferred source of information for competing mobile phone service plans.

The neonatal mortality rate in Cambodia is 18 per 1000 live births. In the province of Kampong Chhnang, that rate is the fifth highest among the 24 provinces of Cambodia at 27 per 1000 live births. We piloted a project to determine the feasibility of using a mHealth intervention (the use of mobile devices to improve health outcomes) to increase mothers' awareness about neonatal care and promote the government policy 'Safe Motherhood Protocols for Health Centres' which are in line with WHO recommendations for neonatal care. Methods: Between September and December 2013, we piloted an Interactive Voice Response system that sent pre-recorded messages to mothers of newborns using the theme 'It takes a village to raise a baby'. Four hundred fifty-five mothers were registered onto this program and the intervention involved delivering seven periodic 60 to 90 s voice messages directly to the mobile phones of these mothers from day three of their neonate's life to day 28. An evaluation of the pilot was conducted in December 2013. One hundred twenty-nine mothers were randomly selected from the 455 registered mothers and interviewed using a quantitative questionnaire. We also held two focus group discussions with three mothers and seven health workers. Results: Quantitative and qualitative results of 126 respondents were included for analysis. They indicate that the intervention was well accepted. Seventy-one percent of respondents reported that they would recommend the intervention to other mothers, and 83% reported that they would be willing to pay for the service.

An aggressive preemptive effort by healthcare professionals, geared to ensure adherence to immunosuppressants in KTRs, is significant and imperative. Methods/design: This study was designed as a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and stability of an information and communication technology (ICT)-based centralized monitoring system in boosting medication adherence in KTRs. One hundred fourteen KTRs registered throughout the year 2017 to 2018 are randomized into either the ICT-based centralized home monitoring system or to ambulatory follow-up. The planned follow-up duration is 6 months. The ICT-based centralized home monitoring system described consists of a smart pill box equipped with personal identification system, a home monitoring system, an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) system, and a comprehensive clinical trial management system (CTMS). It alerts both patients and medical staff with texts and pill box alarms if there is a dosage/dosing time error or a missed dose. Medication adherence and transplant outcomes for the follow-up period are compared between the two groups, while patient satisfaction as well as the stability and cost-effectiveness of the ICT-based monitoring system are to be evaluated. Discussion: This on-going study is expected to determine if consistent use of the ICT-based centralized monitoring system described could maximize mediation adherence and subsequently enhance transplant outcomes in KTRs. Further, it would lay the foundation for successful implementation of this ICT-based monitoring system for effective management of medication adherence in KTRs.

This study tested the hypothesis that the maintenance and emergence of malaria in hypoendemic regions such as Amazonia is determined by submicroscopic and asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitaemia carriers. The present study aimed to precisely quantify the rate of very-low parasitaemia carriers in two sites of the Peruvian Amazon in relation to transmission patterns of P. vivax and P. falciparum in this area. Methods: This study was carried out within the Amazonian-ICEMR longitudinal cohort. Blood samples were collected for light microscopy diagnosis and packed red blood cell (PRBC) samples were analysed by qPCR. Plasma samples were tested for total IgG reactivity against recombinant PvMSP-10 and PfMSP-10 antigens by ELISA. Occupation and age 10 years and greater were considered surrogates of occupation-related mobility. Risk factors for P. falciparum and P. vivax infections detected by PRBC-qPCR were assessed by multilevel logistic regression models. Results: Among 450 subjects, the prevalence of P. vivax by PRBC-PCR (25.1%) was sixfold higher than that determined by microscopy (3.6%). The prevalence of P. falciparum infection was 4.9% by PRBC-PCR and 0.2% by microscopy. More than 40% of infections had parasitaemia under 5 parasites/μL. Multivariate analysis for infections detected by PRBC-PCR showed that participants with recent settlement in the study area (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.03:4.2), age ≥ 30 years (AOR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6:6.9) and seropositivity to P. vivax (AOR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0:3.2) had significantly higher likelihood of P. vivax infection, while the odds of P. falciparum infection was higher for participants between 10 and 29 years (AOR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3:91.1) and with a previous P. falciparum infection (AOR 10.4; 95% CI 1.5:71.1). Conclusions: This study confirms the contrasting transmission patterns of P. vivax and P. falciparum in the Peruvian Amazon, with stable local transmission for P. vivax and the source of P. falciparum to the study villages dominated by very low parasitaemia carriers, age 10 years and older, who had travelled away from home for work and brought P. falciparum infection with them. © 2017 The Author(s).","Human mobility; Malaria; Migration; Molecular epidemiology; MSP10; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; Sensitivity; Serology; Specificity; Sub-microscopic",,2-s2.0-85031691328

The significance of distance calculation for sub trajectories is to clearly reveal the differences in moving trajectories and to promote the accuracy of cluster algorithm. Besides, a novel adaptive density trajectory cluster algorithm is proposed, in which cluster radius is computed through using the density of data distribution. In addition, cluster centers and number are selected by a certain strategy automatically, and uncertainty/boundary problem of data set is solved by designed weighted rough c-means.

Tele-rehabilitation could be a viable avenue to address unmet rehabilitation needs in LMICs. Objectives To assess the burden of post-stroke physical deficits, rates of utilization of physiotherapy services, and perceptions of tele-rehabilitation among recent Ghanaian stroke survivors. Methods Using a consecutive sampling strategy, 100 stroke survivors attending an outpatient Neurology clinic in a Ghanaian tertiary medical center were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. After collecting basic demographic data, clinical history on stroke type, severity and level of disability, we administered the validated 20-item Functional Independence Measure questionnaire to evaluate functional status of study participants and an 8-item questionnaire to assess participants' attitudes towards telemedicine administered rehabilitation intervention. Results Mean ± SD age of study participants was 57.2 ± 13.3 years of which 51.0% were males with a mean duration of stroke of 1.3 ± 2.2 years. 53% had Modified Rankin scores of ≥ 3, 57% were fully independent and only 27% reported utilizing any physiotherapy services. Barriers to access to physiotherapy included financial constraints due to cost of physiotherapy services and transportation as well as premature discharge from physiotherapy to avoid overburdening of available physiotherapy services. These factors led to the limited provision of rehabilitative therapy. Participants held positive views of the potential for tele-rehabilitation interventions (80–93%). However, while 85% owned mobile phones, only 35% had smart phones. Conclusion Despite, a high burden of residual disability, only about 1 out of 4 stroke patients in this Ghanaian cohort was exposed to post-stroke physiotherapy services, largely due to relatively high costs and limited health system resources. These Ghanaian stroke patients viewed the potential role of Tele-rehabilitation as positive, but this promising intervention needs to be formally tested for feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Barriers and facilitators; Functional independence; Physical therapy; Stroke survivors; Tele-rehabilitation",,2-s2.0-85028941786

Using a self-diagnosis scale for smartphone addiction (S scale for short) and smartphone usage tracker, we collected S scale scores and smartphone usage patterns from 195 undergraduate participants. The statistical results indicate that 1) smartphone addiction is highly correlated with communication but not entertainment and 2) solely measuring the total usage time is not enough to predict whether a smartphone user is addicted.

Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is highly complex and heterogeneous and one of the fastest growing waste streams in the EU. Its recycling typically consists of pre-treatment, recovery of secondary resources (materials and energy), and disposal. Legal recycling targets, stated by the European Commission, are exceeded by leading pre-treatment operators driven by economic needs. While recycling has been shown in the past to have greenhouse gas benefits, no study could be found that compares WEEE recycling at two different recycling rates using industry data. Therefore, this study investigates: (1) How much secondary material is recovered from WEEE at a certain recycling rate and (2) what is the associated greenhouse gas impact of the WEEE end-of-life system? The results of two end-of-life systems operating at different recycling rates are compared and analysed. A leading Austrian pre-treatment facility provided data and know-how for this case study. One system describes the current practice at the pre-treatment facility (recycling rate: 80.5%) and the other system operates at the same facility close to the legally required minimum target set by the European WEEE directive (62.5% for this specific input material). In terms of secondary material recovery, the study shows that a recycling rate of 80.5% enables recovery of just above halve of the input material, while for recycling close to the legal target the amount of recovered material is around 45%. The differences are due to less recycling of plastics, ferrous materials and copper. Regarding the greenhouse gas impact, recycling at a rate of 80.5%, the Austrian pre-treatment site proves to avoid at least 215 kg of CO2 equivalents per ton WEEE input compared to recycling WEEE at the same facility close to the legal minimum recycling target. In the authors’ view a mandatory recycling rate above 80% would be difficult to fulfil as, according to the pre-treatment facility operator, additional costs of better separation would outweigh any additional revenues from secondary material. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Austria; LCA; Pre-treatment; Recycling; WEEE","Economics; Electronic equipment; Electronic Waste; Greenhouse gases; International law; Life cycle; Oscillators (electronic); Recovery; Secondary recovery; Technology transfer; Austria; Minimum requirements; Pre-Treatment; Recovered materials; Secondary materials; Secondary resources; Waste electrical and electronic equipment; WEEE; Recycling",2-s2.0-85027510410

This information is important for determining the potential for cervical cancer prevention with both current and broader spectrum HPV vaccines. We analysed 847 cervical cancers diagnosed 2005 to 2015 in tertiary centres in the three most populous Australian states with resolution of specimens containing multiple HPV types using laser-capture microdissection. Archived FFPE tissue was reviewed by specialist pathologists, sandwich sectioned, and initially whole-tissue sections genotyped for HPV. Samples were first genotyped using SPF10-LiPA25 (version 1). Negative samples were screened with DNA ELISA kit HPV SPF10, followed by genotyping with SPF+ LiPA if ELISA positive. If still negative, samples were tested on a qPCR assay targeting the E6 region of HPV16, 18, 45 and 33. Of the 847 cancers (65.1% squamous, 28.7% adenocarcinoma, 4.3% adenosquamous, 2.0% other), 92.9% had HPV detected. Of the HPV-positive cancers, 607 of 787 (77.1%) contained HPV16 or 18, 125 of 787 (15.9%) contained HPV31/33/45/52 or 58, and 55 (7.0%) another HPV type. There was a strong correlation between HPV type and age, with younger women most likely to have HPV16/18 detected and least likely HPV negative. Our findings indicate that cervical cancers diagnosed in Australia more frequently contain HPV16/18 than in international series. This could be due to cervical screening in Australia increasing the proportion of adenocarcinomas, in which types 18 and 16 more strongly predominate, due to prevention of squamous cancers. © 2017 UICC","cervical cancer; genotyping; human papillomavirus; laser capture microdissection; vaccine","virus DNA; Wart virus vaccine; virus DNA; Wart virus vaccine; adenosquamous carcinoma; adult; Article; Australia; cancer diagnosis; cancer tissue; controlled study; diagnostic equipment; DNA determination; ELISA kit; female; genotype; human; Human papillomavirus type 16; Human papillomavirus type 18; Human papillomavirus type 31; Human papillomavirus type 33; Human papillomavirus type 45; human tissue; laser capture microdissection; major clinical study; medical specialist; middle aged; nonhuman; papillomavirus infection; pathologist; polymerase chain reaction; preventive medicine; priority journal; tissue fixation; tissue section; uterine cervix adenocarcinoma; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix carcinoma; vaccination; virus detection; young adult; aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; genetics; genotype; Human papillomavirus type 16; Human papillomavirus type 18; isolation and purification; Papillomavirus Infections; pathology; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; very elderly; virology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; DNA, Viral; Female; Genotype; Human papillomavirus 16; Human papillomavirus 18; Humans; Middle Aged; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85023632504

In BLE-based IoT applications, e.g., wearables-oriented service applications, the Bluetooth MAC addresses of devices will be swapped for device pairings. The random address technique is adopted to prevent malicious users from tracking the victim’s devices with stationary Bluetooth MAC addresses and accordingly the device privacy can be preserved. However, there exists a tradeoff between privacy and security in the random address technique. That is, when device pairing is launched and one device cannot actually identify another one with addresses, it provides an opportunity for malicious users to break the system security via impersonation attacks. Hence, using random addresses may lead to higher security risks. In this study, we point out the potential risk of using random address technique and then present critical security requirements for BLE-based IoT applications. To fulfill the claimed requirements, we present a privacy-aware mechanism, which is based on elliptic curve cryptography, for secure communication and access-control among BLE-based IoT objects.

Specifically, without using matching circuits, the proposed antenna can cover the eight frequency bands required for LTE/WWAN within a profile height of 5 mm simply by incorporating a switch element in the structure; hence, the proposed design is highly suitable for application in tablet devices with a narrow border. In addition, this antenna can be closely integrated with its surrounding metal elements and the measured results revealed an antenna efficiency of ≥50%, exceeding the requirement for actual application. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","long-term evolution/wireless wide area network (LTE/WWAN) antennas; loop antennas; monopole antennas; slot antennas; Tablet antennas","Computer networks; Frequency bands; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Loop antennas; Metals; Mobile antennas; Monopole antennas; Slot antennas; Wide area networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Antenna efficiency; Antenna structures; High frequency HF; Matching circuit; Measured results; Profile heights; Reconfigurable antenna; Wireless wide area networks; Antennas",2-s2.0-85025839019

Pursuant to the theory of the National Surveillance State, because of the routinized and administrative nature of government-led surveillance, normalized mass surveillance is viewed as justified under crime and counterterrorism policy rationales. This article contends that the Cybersurveillance State is the successor to the National Surveillance State. The Cybersurveillance State harnesses technologies that fuse biometric and biographic data for risk assessment, embedding bureaucratized biometric cybersurveillance within the Administrative State. In ways that are largely invisible, the Cybersurveillance State constructs digital avatars for administrative governance objectives and targets digital data deemed suspicious. Consequently, constitutional violations stemming from cybersurveillance systems will be increasingly difficult to identify and challenge. Copyright ©2017 by Annual Reviews.

To capture the non-linear interactions between climatic events, the method of event synchronization has found increasing attention recently. The main drawback with the present estimation of event synchronization is its restriction to analysing the time series at one reference timescale only. The study of event synchronization at multiple scales would be of great interest to comprehend the dynamics of the investigated climate processes. In this paper, the wavelet-based multi-scale event synchronization (MSES) method is proposed by combining the wavelet transform and event synchronization. Wavelets are used extensively to comprehend multi-scale processes and the dynamics of processes across various timescales. The proposed method allows the study of spatio-temporal patterns across different timescales. The method is tested on synthetic and real-world time series in order to check its replicability and applicability. The results indicate that MSES is able to capture relationships that exist between processes at different timescales. © 2017 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85031496266

Fire hazard within a mining cavern or tunnel poses concerns on the structural integrity of the surrounding rock. Hence, a fast, non-destructive method for assessing the strength of a rock mass after a fire would be useful in deciding whether to salvage a mining operation or to abandon it. Colorimetry as a technique to estimate the heating temperature of concrete has proven useful. However, the use of colorimetry imposes a need to balance ease of use, such as low cost digital cameras and computer scanners, with accuracy achievable with expensive spectrometers and spectrophotometers. This technical note shall investigate the use of a Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera and MATLAB as a means of performing non-destructive testing on rocks exposed to temperatures of between 200 °C to 500 °C to estimate the degradation of the rocks' tensile strength. The CIE L*a*b* color space is used. The effects of soot and smoke on the rocks are also simulated using high temperature grease to mimic real world conditions. The Brazilian tensile strength and P-wave velocity are two other properties investigated in this technical note. The results suggest that the a* and b* color values have an almost linear relationship with the heating temperature of the rock, whereas the tensile strength of the rock has a quadratic relationship. Additional tests indicate the robustness of the colorimetry process as the simulated smoke and soot damage did not significantly affect the relationship between heating temperature, a* and b* color values, provided the surface of the rock was cleaned after the fire event. The mechanism of the strength degradation may be attributed to generation of microcracks due to thermal loading, while the color change is attributed to either chemical changes within the rock, or scattering of light due to the generated microcracks. A key finding of this study is that the colorimetry process outlined is not only relatively cheap to use, as compared to expensive spectrometers and spectrophotometers, but also fast, as the photo taking process can be completed within 10 min. This makes it easier for multiple teams to be deployed after a fire incident in an underground rock tunnel or cavern, minimising the amount of time that workers need to spend in potentially hazardous environment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Colorimetry; Fire engineering; MATLAB; Non-destructive testing; Thermal damage","Caves; Color; Colorimeters; Damage detection; Fire hazards; Fires; Hazards; MATLAB; Meteorological instruments; Nondestructive examination; Rocks; Soot; Spectrometers; Spectrophotometers; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Wave propagation; Brazilian tensile strengths; Digital single lens reflexes; Fire engineering; Hazardous environment; High-temperature grease; Non destructive testing; Nondestructive methods; Thermal damage; Colorimetry; colorimetry; damage; fire; nondestructive testing; rock mechanics; tensile strength",2-s2.0-85026448265

Integrating a digitized version of paper-based methods of Community Case Management (CCM) could strengthen delivery, increasing urgent referral rates and preventing unnecessary re-consultations and hospital admissions. This trial aims to evaluate the added value of the Supporting LIFE electronic Community Case Management Application (SL eCCM App) compared to paper-based CCM on urgent referral, re-consultation and hospitalization rates, in two districts in Northern Malawi. Methods/design: This is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial assessing the added value of the SL eCCM App on urgent referral, re-consultation and hospitalization rates of children aged 2 months and older to up to 5 years, within 7 days of the index visit. One hundred and two health surveillance assistants (HSAs) were stratified into six clusters based on geographical location, and clusters randomized to the timing of crossover to the intervention using simple, computer-generated randomization. Training workshops were conducted prior to the control (paper-CCM) and intervention (paper-CCM + SL eCCM App) in assigned clusters. Neither participants nor study personnel were blinded to allocation. Outcome measures were determined by abstraction of clinical data from patient records 2 weeks after recruitment. A nested qualitative study explored perceptions of adherence to urgent referral recommendations and a cost evaluation determined the financial and time-related costs to caregivers of subsequent health care utilization. The trial was conducted between July 2016 and February 2017. Discussion: This is the first large-scale trial evaluating the value of adding a mobile application of CCM to the assessment of children aged under 5 years. The trial will generate evidence on the potential use of mobile health for CCM in Malawi, and more widely in other low- and middle-income countries.

Historical records of mobile users (MUs) play an important role in predicting future movements of new visitors of the underlying registration area. Handover (handoff) is one of important quality of service (QoS) parameter that affects the continuity of the call when MUs move from a cell to its neighbors in the same registration area (RA). In this paper, a novel ant based Algorithm, has been introduced, which is called Ant Prediction Algorithm (APA). The main target of APA is to reduce handover impact on the performance of personal communication service (PCS) networks. To accomplish such aim, APA tries to minimize the number of dropped calls by predicting the long-term movement of MUs based on the Sectored Diurnal Mobility Model (SDMM). APA consists of two Parts, namely; (i) the Ant Prediction Engine (APE), which relies on the movement history of the other MUs to predict the future movement of the considered MU, and (ii) the SDMM design, which predicts the exact future sector and cell of the considered MU.

However, they are also the most difficult to adhere. The development of mobile health (mHealth) applications (""apps"") to help patients monitor their adherence is fast growing but with limited evidence on their efficacy. There is no evidence on the content of these apps for patients taking psychotropic medication. The aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the aims and functioning of available apps that are aiming to help and educate patients to adhere to medication that treats mental health conditions. Method: Three platform descriptions (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) were searched between October 2015 and February 2016. Included apps need to focus on adherence to medication that treats mental health conditions and use at least a reinforcement strategy. Descriptive information was extracted and apps evaluated on a number of assessment criteria using content analysis. Results: Sixteen apps were identified. All apps included self-monitoring properties like reminders and psycho-educational properties like mood logs. It was unclear how the latter were used or how adherence was measured. Major barriers to medication adherence like patients' illness and medication beliefs and attitudes were not considered nor where information to patients about mediation side effects. Very few apps were tailored and none was developed based on established theories explaining the processes for successful medication adherence like cognitions and beliefs. Reported information on app development and validation was poor. Discussion: A variety of apps with different properties that tackle both intentional and unintentional non-adherence from a different perspective are identified. An evidence-based approach and co-creation with patients is needed. This will ensure that the apps increase the possibility to impact on non-adherence. Theories like social cognition models can be useful in ensuring that patients' education, motivation, skills, beliefs, and type of adherence are taken into consideration when developing the apps. Findings from this study can help clinicians and patients make informed choices and pursue policy-makers to integrate evidence when developing future apps. Quality-assurance tools are needed to ensure the apps are systematically evaluated. © 2017 Kassianos, Georgiou, Papaconstantinou, Detzortzi and Horne.","Adherence; Compliance; Digital health; Health education; Mental health; MHealth; Psychotropic; Smartphone",,2-s2.0-85031006873

Methods: This paper describes a proof-of-concept design of a configurable, wearable sensing and feedback system for real-time postural balance and gait training targeted for home-based treatments and other portable usage. Sensing and vibrotactile feedback are performed via eight distributed, wireless nodes or ""Dots"" (size: 22.5 × 20.5 × 15.0 mm, weight: 12.0 g) that can each be configured for sensing and/or feedback according to movement training requirements. In the first experiment, four healthy older adults were trained to reduce medial-lateral (M/L) trunk tilt while performing balance exercises. When trunk tilt deviated too far from vertical (estimated via a sensing Dot on the lower spine), vibrotactile feedback (via feedback Dots placed on the left and right sides of the lower torso) cued participants to move away from the vibration and back toward the vertical no feedback zone to correct their posture. A second experiment was conducted with the same wearable system to train six healthy older adults to alter their foot progression angle in real-time by internally or externally rotating their feet while walking. Foot progression angle was estimated via a sensing Dot adhered to the dorsal side of the foot, and vibrotactile feedback was provided via feedback Dots placed on the medial and lateral sides of the mid-shank cued participants to internally or externally rotate their foot away from vibration. Results: In the first experiment, the wearable system enabled participants to significantly reduce trunk tilt and increase the amount of time inside the no feedback zone. In the second experiment, all participants were able to adopt new gait patterns of internal and external foot rotation within two minutes of real-time training with the wearable system. Conclusion: These results suggest that the configurable, wearable sensing and feedback system is portable and effective for different types of real-time human movement training and thus may be suitable for home-based or clinic-based rehabilitation applications. © 2017 The Author(s).","Balance training; Gait retraining; Wearable systems",,2-s2.0-85031037731

We also develop an automated app behavior inspection platform to install and inspect massive samples so as to collect apps' dynamic behavior records. Then these records are exploited to train a string subsequence kernel–based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which can be used to classify benign and malicious behaviors offline. To realize online detection, we further extract apps' runtime features including sensitive permission combination uses, sensitive behavior sequences, and user interactions for behavior classification. The classification results can reach an accuracy of 84.9% in offline phase and 99.0% in online phase. Besides, we verify our scheme for identifying malicious apps, and the results show that 71.8% instances of malware samples are identified by running each app for only 18 minutes.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the prevalence of smartphone addiction and the associated factors in male and female undergraduates. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016 and included 1441 undergraduate students at Wannan Medical College, China. The Smartphone Addiction Scale short version (SAS-SV) was used to assess smartphone addiction among the students, using accepted cut-offs. Participants' demographic, smartphone usage, and psycho-behavioral data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to seek associations between smartphone addiction and independent variables among the males and females, separately. Results: The prevalence of smartphone addiction among participants was 29.8% (30.3% in males and 29.3% in females). Factors associated with smartphone addiction in male students were use of game apps, anxiety, and poor sleep quality. Significant factors for female undergraduates were use of multimedia applications, use of social networking services, depression, anxiety, and poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Smartphone addiction was common among the medical college students investigated. This study identified associations between smartphone usage, psycho-behavioral factors, and smartphone addiction, and the associations differed between males and females. These results suggest the need for interventions to reduce smartphone addiction among undergraduate students. © 2017 The Author(s).","Anxiety; Depression; Problematic smartphone use; Sleep quality; Smartphone addiction",,2-s2.0-85030852331

Restricting the access to shared system resources can effectively prevent the exploitation of known covert channels. However, it inevitably limits the normal usage of those resources. In this paper, we propose a general method that detects covert channel attack at runtime without impacting the accessibility of shared resources in the system. The main idea of the method is to track and audit the use of system resources known as potential covert channel variables and impose interferences on those channels to reduce their capacity once violations are detected. We implement a prototype framework, which is able to audit and interfere covert communication both in the application layer and in the native layer of Android. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce the data rate of user-defined covert channels while the overhead is negligible.

Based on a review of the relevant literature, this paper discusses the limitations of traditional residence-based approaches in examining the association between socioeconomic or racial/ethnic segregation and unequal environmental exposure in environmental justice research. It emphasizes that future research needs to go beyond residential segregation by considering the full spectrum of segregation experienced by people in various geographic and temporal contexts of everyday life. Along with this comprehensive understanding of segregation, the paper also highlights the importance of assessing environmental exposure at a high spatiotemporal resolution in environmental justice research. The successful integration of a comprehensive concept of segregation, high-resolution data and fine-grained spatiotemporal approaches to assessing segregation and environmental exposure would provide more nuanced and robust findings on the associations between segregation and disparities in environmental exposure and their health impacts. Moreover, it would also contribute to significantly expanding the scope of environmental justice research. © 2017 by the authors.

Normal brain activity (cognitive processes, etc.) has been extensively studied using electroencephalography (EEG) since the 1930's, in the form of spontaneous fluctuations in rhythms, and patterns, and in a more experimentally-driven approach in the form of event-related potentials (ERPs) allowing us to relate scalp voltage waveforms to brain states and behavior. The use of EEG recorded during functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) is a more recent development that has become an important tool in clinical neuroscience, for example for the study of epileptic activity. The purpose of this review is to explore the magnetic resonance imaging safety aspects specifically associated with the use of scalp EEG and other brain-implanted electrodes such as intracranial EEG electrodes when they are subjected to the MRI environment. We provide a theoretical overview of the mechanisms at play specifically associated with the presence of EEG equipment connected to the subject in the MR environment, and of the resulting health hazards. This is followed by a survey of the literature on the safety of scalp or invasive EEG-fMRI data acquisitions across field strengths, with emphasis on the practical implications for the safe application of the techniques; in particular, we attempt to summarize the findings in terms of acquisition protocols when possible. © 2017 Hawsawi, Carmichael and Lemieux.","Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Gradient safety; Implanted electrodes; MR safety; Neuroscience; Radiofrequency safety; Thermal injury",,2-s2.0-85032581576

An increasing number of packaged foods and beverages are sold in India. Our objective was to evaluate the healthiness of packaged foods sold by India’s largest manufacturers. Healthiness was assessed using the Australian Health Star Rating (HSR) system and the World Health Organization’s European Regional Office (WHO Euro) Nutrient Profile Model. Sales-value-weighted mean healthiness and the proportions of “healthy” products (using a validated HSR cut-off of _3.5, and products meeting WHO Euro criteria as healthy enough to market to children) were calculated overall, by company and by food category. Nutrient information for 943 products sold by the 11 largest Indian manufacturers was obtained from nutrient labels, company websites or directly from the manufacturer. Healthiness was low overall (mean HSR 1.8 out of 5.0 stars) with a low proportion defined as “healthy” by both HSR (17%) and also by WHO Euro criteria (8%). There were marked differences in the healthiness of similar products within food categories. Substantial variation between companies (minimum sales-value-weighted mean HSR 0.5 for Company G, versus maximum HSR 3.0 for Company F) was a result of differences in the types of products sold and the nutritional composition of individual products. There are clear opportunities for India’s largest food companies to improve both the nutritional quality of individual products and to improve their product mix to include a greater proportion of healthy products. © 2017 by the authors.

Therefore, the ECL detection is available in both low-cost disposable sensors and a portable format, which may be very suitable to be used as a non-invasive monitoring tool for medical diagnostics. As a proof-of-principle, lactate oxidase is immobilized onto the working electrode for the lactate measurement. Under optimized conditions, the lactate levels can be quantified over the range of 0.05-2.5 mM, with a detection limit of 0.035 mM and the relative standard deviations of 4.7%, 5.2% and 5.0% for 0.05, 0.5 and 2.5 mM lactate (n = 5). In addition, the proposed biosensor has an acceptable stability and selectivity. Finally, the ECL biosensor is successfully applied for the determination of lactate in human saliva.

But hacking into mobile devices is increasing rapidly with the increase in mobile device users. As the market share of Android OS increases, hacking of mobile devices has focused on Android devices. Although there are many security solutions for mobile devices, they are fragmentary for mobile threats; that is, they are solutions for only several threats rather than comprehensive solutions. There is hence a limit to protecting user’s and company’s data stored or used on mobile devices from various types of hacking. To address this, we propose a mobile device protection technology based on domain isolation. Virtualization technology has emerged to increase CPU utilization in server-class PCs and to run various OSs in one system. As these virtualization technologies become lightweight, they are beginning to be applied to embedded devices. In this paper, we applied this lightweight embedded virtualization technology to mobile devices to divide mobile devices into two areas. Therefore, users can have hidden area from hacker attack in addition to Android OS area which can use same as existing mobile device. There is a hardware-based mobile security solution using an secure element, but this has to be reflected in the manufacturing process of the mobile device. However, since the domain separation technology using the virtualization, proposed in this paper, is a software solution, it has an advantage that it can be applied to a device that is already in use. In addition, to protect the hidden area, application authentication/authorization and user authentication technology were applied. And we use white-box cryptography to get root of trust of the key which is used for secure storage and data encryption/decryption. We believe this is a fundamental solution for protecting the mobile device users from hacking. We implemented and tested various mobile applications operating on a mobile device that incorporates our proposed structure based on domain isolation. There is some performance degradation caused by the domain separation, but it is negligible. According to https://www.wired.com/insights/2012/11/mobile-supercomputers/, the chips for mobile phones have evolved and mobile phones will soon become supercomputers. In this case, the addition of virtualization to the mobile device will have less impact on the computing power of the mobile device, and data protection stored in mobile devices and secure execution environment of security programs will become more important issues. Therefore, our TeeMo structure is a necessary technology to protect mobile device users. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Domain separation; Mobile security; Secure execution engine; Trust IoT","Android (operating system); Authentication; Cellular telephones; Competition; Cryptography; Digital storage; Internet of things; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal computing; Security of data; Separation; Supercomputers; Telephone sets; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Manufacturing process; Performance degradation; Protection technologies; Secure execution; Separation technologies; Trust IoT; Virtualization technologies; White-box cryptographies; Mobile security",2-s2.0-85030680642

However, interventions using mobile phones to change people's behaviour are often perceived as complex interventions, and the interactions between several components within them may affect the outcome. Therefore, it is important to understand how we can improve the design of mHealth interventions using mobile phones as a medium to deliver services. Methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mHealth interventions to support smoking cessation or uptake of smoking cessation services for smokers will be included in this systematic review. A search will be performed by searching MEDLINE, MEDLINE(R) In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL. A search for new publications will be conducted 3 months prior to submission for publication as mHealth is an emerging area of research. A random-effects meta-analysis model will be used to summarise the effectiveness of mHealth interventions. The risk ratio will be used for the primary outcome, self-reported or verified smoking abstinence, and any binary outcomes for uptake of smoking cessation services. The standardised mean difference using Hedges' g will be reported for continuous data. Heterogeneity will be assessed using I 2 statistics. Where feasible, meta-regression analysis using random-effects multilevel modelling will be conducted to examine the association of pre-specified characteristics (covariates) at the study level with the effectiveness of interventions. Publication bias will be explored using Egger's test for continuous outcomes and Harbord and Peters tests for dichotomous outcomes. The funnel plot will be used to evaluate the presence of publication bias. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used to assess differences in risks of bias.

In addition to agriculture, intrahousehold equity, behavior change, food safety, and access to clean water and sanitation are integral components of the food system. This article provides a detailed review, from an economic perspective, on the multisectoral pathways through which agriculture influences nutrition.

Though end-of-life printed circuit board (PCB) is an integral part of e-waste as secondary resource reservoir, yet no standardized procedure exists for metals liberation and dissolution for its characterization. Thus, the paper aims at assessment of metals liberation upon comminution employing scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) followed by comparative assessment of the existing United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) digestion procedures, viz., USEPA 3050B, USEPA 3051A, and USEPA 3052, in effective dissolution of metals from comminuted particles of waste PCBs of computer, laptop, mobile phone, and television. Effect of comminution and digestion conditions was assessed to have significant role in metal liberation and dissolution from PCBs. The SEM-EDS analysis demonstrated partial release of metals from the silica matrix of PCBs. The USEPA digestion methods showed statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference with greater dissolution of metals complexed to PCB matrix by the USEPA 3052 method owing to use of strong acid like hydrofluoric acid. Base metals like Cu and Zn and toxic metals such as Pb and Cd were present in abundance in PCBs and in general exceeded the total threshold limit concentration (TTLC).

The combination of CIoT and CPS can greatly enhance the quality of people’s life. To this end, this article proposes CIoT-CPS that comprises of two main models: user activity cognitive model and image authentication model.The user activity cognitive model (UACM) is a machine-learning model to have the meaningful data. The image authentication model is to verify the authenticity of images captured by various devices, such as smart phones, digital cameras, and other camera-embedded portable devices. The authenticity of an image is breached when parts of images are assembled to produce a new image (known as a splicing forgery), or a part of an image is copied or pasted into another part of the same image (known as a copy-move forgery). In the proposed verification method, an opposite color local binary pattern (OC-LBP) texture descriptor is applied to a questioned image. The image is first decomposed into an RGB (red, green, blue) and a luminance and chroma color spaces. The OC-LBP measures the interrelation between pixels of different color components. The intensive computation involving six color components and a gray version is performed in the cloud, where a server can be dedicated to doing this job. The histograms of the OC-LBP are concatenated with weights to produce a final feature vector of the image. A support vector machine is applied as a classifier, which classifies the image as authentic or forged. Several experiments were performed to verify the suitability of those models or approaches. The proposed approaches show a good accuracy compared to other competing approaches. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Cloud-based cyber physical system; Image authenticity verification; Image forgery; Opposite color local binary pattern","Color; Cyber Physical System; Digital devices; Embedded systems; Image retrieval; Internet of things; Learning systems; Smartphones; Authenticity verification; Cloud-based; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Embedded portable devices; Image authentication; Image forgery; Local binary patterns; Machine learning models; Authentication",2-s2.0-85030327342

Considering that digital devices are omnipresent in buses and trains, no study has yet investigated if commuting contributes to the development of Internet addiction. Overall, N = 5039 participants (N = 3477 females, age M = 26.79, SD = 10.68) took part in an online survey providing information regarding their commuting behavior, Internet addiction, personality, life satisfaction, and stress perception. Our findings are as follows: Personality seems to be less suitable to differentiate between commuter and non-commuter groups, which is possibly due to commuters often not having a choice but simply must accept offered job opportunities at distant locations. Second, the highest levels of satisfaction were found with income and lodging in the group commuting for business purposes. This might be related to the fact that commuting results in higher salaries (hence also better and more expensive housing style) due to having a job in another city which might exceed job opportunities at one’s own living location. Third, within the business-commuters as well as in the private-commuter groups, females had significantly higher levels of stress than males. This association was not present in the non-commuter group. For females, commuting seems to be a higher burden and more stressful than for males, regardless of whether they commute for business or private reasons. Finally, we observed an association between higher stress perception (more negative attitude towards commuting) and Internet addiction. This finding suggests that some commuters try to compensate their perceived stress with increased Internet use. © 2017 by the authors.

We performed this rapid AST using our ultrafast (~7 min) digital real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (dLAMP) assay [area under the curve (AUC), 0.96] and compared the results to a commercial (~2 hours) digital polymerase chain reaction assay (AUC, 0.98). The rapid dLAMP assay can be used with SlipChip microfluidic devices to determine the phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli directly from clinical urine samples in less than 30 min.

A very common symptom of diabetes is the diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). The early detection of such foot complications can protect diabetic patients from any dangerous stages that develop later and may require foot amputation. This work aims at building a mobile thermal imaging system that can be used as an indicator for possible developing ulcers. Methods: The proposed system consists of a thermal camera connected to a Samsung smart phone, which is used to acquire thermal images. This thermal imaging system has a simulated temperature gradient of more than 2.2°C, which represents the temperature difference (in the literature) than can indicate a possible development of ulcers. The acquired images are processed and segmented using basic image processing techniques. The analysis and interpretation is conducted using two techniques: Otsu thresholding technique and Point-to-Point mean difference technique. Results: The proposed system was implemented under MATLAB Mobile platform and thermal images were analyzed and interpreted. Four testing images (feet images) were used to test this procedure; one image with any temperature variation to the feet, and three images with skin temperature increased to more than 2.2°C introduced at different locations. With the two techniques applied during the analysis and interpretation stage, the system was successful in identifying the location of the temperature increase. Conclusion: This work successfully implemented a mobile thermal imaging system that includes an automated method to identify possible ulcers in diabetic patients. This may give diabetic patients the ability for a frequent self-check of possible ulcers. Although this work was implemented in simulated conditions, it provides the necessary feasibility to be further developed and tested in a clinical environment. © 2017 The Author(s).","Image registration; Mobile thermal camera; Otsu thresholding; Thermal imaging; Ulcer detection","Cameras; Diseases; Image acquisition; Image processing; Image registration; Imaging systems; Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Temperature; Clinical environments; Difference techniques; Image processing technique; Otsu thresholding; Temperature differences; Temperature increase; Temperature variation; Thermal camera; Cellular telephone systems",2-s2.0-85030317221

Many women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, continue to face obstacles in avoiding unintended pregnancy. In the State of Palestine, a survey conducted in 2006 estimated that 38% of pregnancies are unintended. In 2014, unmet need for contraception was highest among young women aged 20-24 years, at 15%. Mobile phones are increasingly being used to deliver health support. Once developed, interventions delivered by mobile phone are often cheaper to deliver than face-to-face support. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Palestinian Family Planning and Protection Association have partnered to develop and evaluate a contraceptive behavioural intervention for young women in Palestine delivered by mobile phone. The intervention was developed guided by behavioural science and consists of short, mobile phone text messages that contain information about contraception and behaviour change methods delivered over 4months. Methods: We will evaluate the intervention by conducting a randomised controlled trial. Five hundred and seventy women aged 18-24 years, who do not report using an effective method of contraception, will be allocated with a 1:1 ratio to receive the intervention text messages or control text messages about trial participation. The primary outcome is self-reported acceptability of at least one method of effective contraception at 4months. Secondary outcomes include the use of effective contraception, acceptability of individual methods, discontinuation, service uptake, unintended pregnancy and abortion. Process outcomes include knowledge, perceived norms, personal agency and intervention dose received. Outcomes at 4months will be compared between arms using logistic regression. Discussion: This trial will determine the effect of the intervention on young women's attitudes towards the most effective methods of contraception. If the intervention is found to be effective, the intervention will be implemented widely across Palestine. The results could also be used to design a larger trial to establish its effect on unintended pregnancy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02905461.

Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are highly effective at reducing unintended pregnancy, but uptake in Bangladesh is low. Providing information on the most effective methods of contraception increases uptake of more effective methods. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial of an intervention delivered by mobile phone designed to support post-MR contraceptive use in Bangladesh. Methods: This is a multi-site single blind individual randomised controlled trial. At least 960 women undergoing MR procedures at selected facilities will be recruited after their procedure by female research assistants. Women will be randomised into the control or intervention group with a 1:1 ratio. All participants will receive usual clinic care, including contraceptive counselling and the telephone number of a non-toll-free call centre which provides counselling on MR and contraception. During the 4 months after their MR procedure, intervention participants will be sent 11 recorded interactive voice messages to their mobile phone about contraception with a focus on their chosen method and LARCs. Each message allows the participant to connect directly to the call centre. The intervention is free to the user. The control group will receive no messages delivered by mobile phone. All participants will be asked to complete an in-person questionnaire at recruitment and follow-up questionnaires by telephone at 2 weeks, 4 months and 12 months after their MR. The primary outcome for the trial will be self-reported LARC use 4 months post-MR. Secondary outcomes include LARC use at 2 weeks and 12 months post-MR, use of any effective modern contraceptive method at 2 weeks, 4 months and 12 months post-MR, and contraceptive discontinuation, contraceptive method switching, pregnancy, subsequent MR and experience of violence during the 12 month study period. Discussion: Mobile phones offer a low-cost mechanism for providing individualised support to women with contraception outside of the clinic setting.

A major source of uncertainty in the population weighted biomarker loads generated is related to estimating the number of people present in a sewer catchment at the time of sample collection. Here, the population quantified from mobile device-based population activity patterns was used to provide dynamic population normalized loads of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals during a known period of high net fluctuation in the catchment population. Mobile device-based population activity patterns have for the first time quantified the high degree of intraday, week, and month variability within a specific sewer catchment. Dynamic population normalization showed that per capita pharmaceutical use remained unchanged during the period when static normalization would have indicated an average reduction of up to 31%. Per capita illicit drug use increased significantly during the monitoring period, an observation that was only possible to measure using dynamic population normalization. The study quantitatively confirms previous assessments that population estimates can account for uncertainties of up to 55% in static normalized data.

How can the signals be found in the collection that is similar, or identical to q, and how can this be done quickly? A solution to this question is the basis of the Shazam smart phone app, where a listener captures a short excerpt of a recorded song with the smart phone's microphone, and in a matter of moments the app reports the name of the song and the artist. Here, the ""needle"" is the excerpt, and the ""haystack"" is a vast corpus of popular music. The Shazam algorithm is powered by Fourier analysis. This paper presents a report on a usability evaluation of Amazon Shazam app. The researchers present the outcome based on a task-based evaluation that involved 15 users of different level of experience who performed 5 tasks using the Shazam mobile app. Post-test questionnaire was used to capture users' perceptions about the app. The results demonstrate that most of the participants were satisfied with services provided by the app. © 2017 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85031308419

However, no augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) mobile app has been developed and evaluated in the Chinese language in Mainland China. Methods: We developed an AAC mobile app, which is the first in Mainland China, to our knowledge, named Yuudee (Chinese name é (xiaoyudi)). Yuudee was developed using the Objective-C and Java programming languages. A five-phase training protocol for making requests using Yuudee was developed based on the Picture Exchange Communication System. We trained ten minimally verbal children with ASD to make requests using Yuudee and evaluated the effectiveness of the training. Results: Yuudee has a built-in library of over 400 pictures with corresponding spoken phrases that are divided into 39 categories ranging from making simple requests to expressing emotions. An additional important feature of Yuudee is its customization functions that allow a parent or trainer to easily select pictures and phrases to display, create new pictures and phrases, and change the layouts and orders of the pictures to fit the personal needs of each child. Yuudee is freely available in an iOS version from the iTunes App Store (https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/xiao-yu-di/id794832934?mt=8) and in an Android version from Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supersuperstar.yuudee.vue) and domestic Chinese Android App stores. Three consecutive unprompted successful responses, which were defined as an initial training success, were achieved in at least three of the five phases for all ten of the evaluated children. The accuracy rate of a given phase was calculated for each child who achieved three consecutive unprompted successful responses in the phase. Seven children achieved at least 50% accuracy in at least two of the five phases. The other three children achieved at least 50% accuracy in only one phase. Two children achieved at least 50% accuracy in all of the phases in which they were trained. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Yuudee is a useful tool for helping minimally verbal children with ASD make requests. © 2017 The Author(s).","App; Augmentative and alternative communication; Development; Mainland China; Training effectiveness",,2-s2.0-85030323450

Method: We conducted a 24-week live user evaluation of push notifications used in a behavior-based mobile app for a meal replacement program to understand the role of push notifications in persuading users to engage with self-monitoring tasks. Results: User perception of the prompts were verified through questionnaires, which in conjunction with the interaction logs show that users were tolerant of multiple daily prompts. The decline in compliance to the tasks set, however, shows that while the participants did not object to receiving prompts, they were less likely to respond to them as the study progressed.

We identify a number of different approaches to racism and antiracism in our inquiry, which lead to particular sets of aims, features and uses: the app as a tool for capturing, reporting and responding to racist acts; as a way of reinforcing a wider sense of community identity and solidarity; to demonstrate racism, especially Islamophobia, and make its forms visible, and as a means for challenging racism through raising awareness and encouraging bystanders to oppose it. We argue that while these apps are well disposed to exposing and manifesting isolated incidents of racism in everyday life, we question their potential for transformative societal outcomes beyond the level of unilateral action in the context of events experienced as unique incidents. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antiracism; Media studies; mobile technology; race; racism; social movements",,2-s2.0-84990240153

Drawing on the surveillance studies literature, this article attempts to theorise the surveillance of teachers. Firstly the article argues that there are three types of teacher surveillance: the vertical perpetuated by Ofsted and senior school leaders such as teaching observations and learning walks, but also students recording their teachers on mobile phones; horizontal surveillance enacted by peers in terms of concertive control, but also parental surveillance via online and offline networks; and, finally, intrapersonal surveillance embracing reflective practice, data reporting and self-policing proximity from children. The article then concludes by arguing that while surveillance in schools embraces the themes of modern surveillance in general, by doggedly retaining the proximal and the interpersonal, it should be considered a hybrid form between traditional and modern forms of surveillance. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","learning walks; post-panopticism; reflective practice; risk in schools; Teacher surveillance; teaching observations",,2-s2.0-84986231560

Such features are robust towards occlusion and clutter and are also invariant against scale and orientation changes. This makes them suitable for classification tasks with little inter-class similarity and large intra-class difference. In this paper, we propose an integrated representation of the Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptors, using late fusion strategy. The proposed representation is used for food recognition from a dataset of food images with complex appearance variations. The Bag of Features (BOF) approach is employed to enhance the discriminative ability of the local features. Firstly, the individual local features are extracted to construct two kinds of visual vocabularies, representing SURF and SIFT. The visual vocabularies are then concatenated and fed into a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the respective food categories. Experimental results demonstrate impressive overall recognition at 82.38% classification accuracy based on the challenging UEC-Food100 dataset. © 2017 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85031310568

The framework is supported by Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the underlying theory of the study. Past literature on individual user intention were thoroughly reviewed and found that TAM is fit appropriate in explaining the phenomenon under study. Based on the reviewed literature, it is expected that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use will influence the intention of users (employees) to use e-collection system in the performance of their job tasks in Nigerian federal hospitals. In other words, users with higher perception on the system's usefulness and its ease of use are more likely to express their interest and willingness to use the system. In addition, the study has extended TAM with facilitating conditions construct and the research is expected to discover the level of its influence on behavioral intention to use e-collection system. © 2017 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85031304977

By weaving together strands of scholarship on political communication and political settlement while engaging with concepts of hybrid governance and leadership more prevalent in the African studies literature, this article takes a different, wider focus. We attempt to knit a framework that challenges normative assumptions on institutional communicative practices and considers the role of power, leadership and communications in both exacerbating and mitigating violent conflict in emerging and consolidating democracies. By bringing together disparate strands of scholarship that are rarely in dialogue, we question a characterisation that contrasts vertical mainstream media with more horizontal and inclusive social media, arguing that a more nuanced view of the political significance of these spaces is required, one that highlights their interplay and blurs the boundaries between online and offline. In doing so, the article places power at the centre of analysis to examine how entrenched relations of patronage can be left unscathed, transformed or even reinforced by networked forms of communication. © 2017 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.","conflict; democratisation; hybrid governance; ICTs; leadership; Media","democratization; governance approach; information and communication technology; leadership; media role; political violence; power relations; social inclusion; social network; Africa",2-s2.0-85026247815

The aim of the study was to identify predictors and outcomes of patients who had delayed plastic biliary stent removal following ERCP. Materials and methods: Consecutive patients who received ERCP with plastic biliary stent placement at Loma Linda University Medical Center (10/2004–6/2013) were identified. Delayed removal was defined as presence of stent >3 months after index ERCP. Multivariable regression analysis to identify baseline characteristics associated with delayed removal was performed. Clinical outcomes of stent obstruction (e.g., cholangitis, hospitalization, intensive care) were also collected for those with delayed removal. Results: Among 374 patients undergoing ERCP with plastic biliary stent, 71 (19%) had delayed stent removal. Patients who had anesthesia assistance (AOR = 3.8, 95%CI 1.2–11.4), non-English primary language (AOR = 3.0, 95%CI 1.5–6.2), and outpatient ERCP (AOR = 2.0, 95%CI 1.1–3.4) had increased while choledocholithiasis (AOR = 0.5, 95%CI 0.3–0.99) had lower odds of delayed stent removal. Among those with delayed removal, 13 (18%) were hospitalized for stent obstruction (5 (7%) had cholangitis, 8 (11%) were hospitalized for more than a week, and 3 (4%) required intensive care). Conclusions: Almost one-fifth of patients who underwent ERCP with plastic biliary stent placement had delayed removal with nearly one-fifth of these patients requiring hospitalization for stent obstruction. Targeting patients at risk by improving communication and ease of scheduling an ERCP may reduce preventable adverse events associated with delayed biliary stent removal. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cholangitis; Delay; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; ERCP; plastic biliary stent","adult; Article; bile duct carcinoma; biliary stent; cholangitis; clinical outcome; common bile duct stone; conscious sedation; deep sedation; device removal; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; female; follow up; hospitalization; human; in-stent restenosis; length of stay; liver cell carcinoma; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; metal stent; middle aged; pancreas cancer; plastic stent; prediction; priority journal; sphincterotomy; Vater papilla carcinoma",2-s2.0-85021432825

Methods: In China, it is quite difficult to obtain traffic crash and conflict data for pedestrians using such crossings, mainly due to the lack of traffic data management and organizational issues. In light of this, the proposed method did not rely on such data, but considered vehicle speed, which is a leading contributing factor of pedestrian safety at mid blocks. To evaluate the speed reduction effects at different locations, the research team utilized the following methods in this study: (1) testing speed differences—on the basis of the collected data, statistical analysis is conducted to test the speed differences between upstream and crosswalk, upstream and downstream, and downstream and crosswalk; and (2) mean distribution deviation—this value is calculated by taking the difference in cumulative speed distributions for the two different samples just mentioned. In order to better understand the variation of speed reduction effects at different distances from speed-control facilities, data were collected from six types of speed-control measures with a visual range of 60 m. Results: The results showed that speed humps, transverse rumble strips, and speed bumps were effective in reducing vehicle speeds. Among them speed humps performed the best, with reductions of 21.1% and 20.0% from upstream location (25.01 km/h) and downstream location (24.66 km/h) to pedestrian crosswalk (19.73 km/h), respectively. By contrast, the speed reduction effects were minimal for stop and yield signs, flashing yellow lights, and crossings without treatment. Conclusions: Consequently, in order to reduce vehicle speeds and improve pedestrian safety at mid blocks, several speed-control measures such as speed humps, speed bumps, and transverse rumble strips are recommended to be deployed in the vicinity of pedestrian crosswalks. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","China; midblock street crossing; Pedestrian; safety; speed-control measure","case report; China; human; information processing; light; pedestrian; safety; statistical analysis; velocity; acceleration; car driving; China; environmental planning; evaluation study; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; Acceleration; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; China; Environment Design; Humans; Pedestrians; Safety",2-s2.0-85021805619

In order to evaluate efficiently and preliminary in situ the presence of WEEE in plastic FCMs, a generic procedure for the evaluation of WEEE presence in plastic FCMs by using defined parameters having each an associated importance level has been proposed. This can be achieved by combining parameters like overall bromine (Br) and antimony (Sb) content; additive and reactive BFR, rare earth element (REE) and WEEE-relevant elemental content and additionally polymer purity. In most of the cases, the WEEE contamination could be confirmed by combining X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry and thermal desorption/pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at first. The Sb and REE content did not give a full confirmation as to the source of contamination, however for Sb the opposite counts: Sb was joined with elevated Br signals. Therefore, Br at first followed by Sb were used as WEEE precursors as both elements are used as synergetic flame-retardant systems. WEEE-specific REEs could be used for small WEEE (sWEEE) confirmation; however, this parameter should be interpreted with care. The polymer purity by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and pyrolysis GC-MS in many cases could not confirm WEEE-specific contamination; however, it can be used for purity measurements and for the suspicion of the usage of recycled fractions (WEEE and non-WEEE) as a third-line confirmation. To the best of our knowledge, the addition of WEEE waste to plastic FCMs is illegal; however, due to lack on screening mechanisms, there is still the breakthrough of such articles onto the market, and, therefore, our generic procedure enables the quick and effective screening of suspicious samples. © 2017 The Author(s).

A second experiment evaluated the influence of task load and informational message type (i.e. single words vs. grouped phrases) on that same collaborative task. In both experiments, the relationship of personal characteristics (attentional control and spatial ability) to performance and workload was also measured. In addition to objective performance and self-report of cognitive load, we evaluated different physiological responses in each experiment. Results showed a performance–workload association for directional cues, message type and task load. EEG measures however, proved generally insensitive to such task load manipulations. Where significant EEG effects were observed, right hemisphere amplitude differences predominated, although unexpectedly these latter relationships were negative. Although EEG measures were partially associated with performance, they appear to possess limited utility as measures of workload in association with tactile displays. Practitioner Summary: As practitioners look to take advantage of innovative tactile displays in complex operational realms like human–robotic interaction, associated performance effects are mediated by cognitive workload. Despite some patterns of association, reliable reflections of operator state can be difficult to discern and employ as the number, complexity and sophistication of these respective measures themselves increase. © 2016, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, tra
