The glucose meter includes a custom-built smartphone case that houses a permanent bare sensor strip, a stylus that is loaded with enzyme-carbon composite pellets, and sensor instrumentation circuits. A custom-designed Android-based software application was developed to enable easy and clear display of measured glucose concentration. A typical test involves the user loading the software, using the stylus to dispense an enzymatic pellet on top of the bare sensor strip affixed to the case, and then introducing the sample. The electronic module then acquires and wirelessly transmits the data to the application software to be displayed on the screen. The deployed pellet is then discarded to regain the fresh bare sensor surface. Such a unique working principle allows the system to overcome challenges faced by previously reported reusable sensors, such as enzyme degradation, leaching, and hysteresis effects. Studies reveal that the enzyme loaded in the pellets are stable for up to 8 months at ambient conditions, and generate reproducible sensor signals. The work illustrates the significance of the pellet-based sensing system towards realizing a reusable, point-of-care sensor that snugly fits around a smartphone and which does not face issues usually common to reusable sensors. The versatility of this system allows it to be easily modified to detect other analytes for application in a wide range of healthcare, environmental and defense domains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Electrochemical biosensors; Glucometer; Glucose; Smartphone","Application programs; Carbon; Carbon carbon composites; Computer software reusability; Enzyme sensors; Enzymes; Glucose; mHealth; Pelletizing; Smartphones; Software testing; Ambient conditions; Carbon composite pellets; Electrochemical biosensor; Electrochemical glucose sensors; Electronic modules; Glucometer; Glucose concentration; Software applications; Glucose sensors; glucose; Article; chemical composition; controlled study; electrochemical analysis; enzyme degradation; equipment design; hysteresis; leaching; mobile application; reproducibility; wireless communication",2-s2.0-85031930766

Specific recognition of mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan on the surface of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been achieved for the development of direct and indirect dot-blot approaches which are designed for simultaneous quantitative analysis of multiple samples and identification of mycobacterial strains, respectively. Compared with traditional acid-fast staining assay used for LTBI screening, our direct dot-blot system has offered a lower limit of quantitation at 104 CFU/mL and higher accuracy. In contrast to traditional bacterial culture approach which takes 3–5 weeks, our assay can be completed within 5 h, which is a remarkable increase in assay efficiency. To maximize the portability and fulfill the needs for LTBI screening in developing countries, an Android application has been developed to carry out colorimetric analysis of images captured by a smartphone camera, followed by generating and sharing of diagnostic reports through internet connectivity. Upon promotion, we believe this low-cost and effective LTBI screening system will control the outspread of tuberculosis and save many lives, particularly in developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Android application; Dot-blot assays; Enzyme linked aptamer assay; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Smartphone","Antibodies; Assays; Colorimetric analysis; Costs; Developing countries; Electronic document exchange; Enzymes; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Tubes (components); Android applications; Aptamer assay; Dot-blot assays; Internet connectivity; Lower limit of quantitations; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis detections; Tuberculosis infection; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85025149531

However, coverage might not be sufficient to avoid chaotic crowd behaviours that could possibly occur when there is lack of accurate sensing data, and of distributed coordination among the main actors. In this paper, we investigate the role that Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) smartphones can play in emergency scenarios. Modern smartphones hide a great potential for emergency monitoring and management: (i) they are truly pervasive, (ii) they can establish peer-to-peer wireless links using short-range communication technologies, thus guaranteeing coverage even when fixed infrastructures are unavailable, and finally (iii) they can sense the environment through several embedded sensors. In order to maximally exploit such capabilities, we propose the SENSE-ME framework, which enables the creation of a spontaneous phone-sensing platform, by providing integrated functionalities of opportunistic networking, mobile sensing, and distributed information processing. Moreover, we introduce a realistic usage scenario (building evacuation), characterized by the presence of Android devices deployed over a two-dimensional space. Through SENSE-ME, each smartphone is able to quantify its level of danger by analysing its sensor data, to share such metrics with the surrounding devices via Wi-Fi Direct links, and finally to detect an emergency event, and compute a safe path, by applying a consensus-based algorithm to the received observations. In this scenario, we present a modular evaluation of the SENSE-ME networking/sensing/information processing components, clearly highlighting the strengths of a multi-layer approach for emergency monitoring and management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Behavioral research; Risk management; Wireless ad hoc networks; Commercial off-the shelves; Distributed coordination; Distributed information processing; Emergency management; Opportunistic networking; Peer-to-peer wireless links; Short-range communication; Two dimensional spaces; Smartphones",2-s2.0-85032438749

To this end, we first devise a range-free approach that computes the most likely circumcenter from a convex polygon representative of radio coverage.

Then the first approach is simplified by allowing for received signal strengths with the notion of estimative regions, namely rectangular areas enclosing an unknown node, to refine the area of interest for localization.

Methods We conducted a content analysis of Android apps for managing drinking available on Google Play (n = 266), downloaded between November 21, 2014 and June 25, 2015. We recorded app popularity (> 10,000 downloads) and user-rated quality (number of stars) from Google Play, and coded the apps on three domains (basic descriptors, functionality, use of dynamic features). Results In total, the reviewed 266 apps were downloaded at least 2,793,567 times altogether. The most common types of app were BAC calculators (37%), information provision apps (37%), tracking calendars (24%), and motivational tools (21%). Most apps were free (65%) or low in cost (mean = $3.76; SD = $5.80). Many apps provided at least some level of tailored feedback (60%), but the extent of tailoring was limited. Use of other dynamic features (i.e., push notifications, passive data collection) was largely absent. Univariate models predicting app popularity (i.e., > 10,000 downloads vs. not) and user-rated quality (i.e., star rating) indicated that tailoring was positively related to popularity (OR = 2.41 [1.30–4.46]), and the existence of time-based tailoring (e.g., tracking) was related to quality (b = 0.48 [0.19–0.77]).

This results in significant throughput (service quality) difference between wireless carriers at some locations. We first analyze the factors that affect the service quality and then validate the existence of service quality difference between different carriers via extensive measurements. To deal with this problem, a mobile device (node) with low service quality can offload its data traffic to nearby nodes with better service quality through Device-to-Device interfaces, such as WiFi direct, to save energy and reduce delay. To achieve this goal, we propose a Quality-Aware Traffic Offloading (QATO) framework to offload network tasks to neighboring nodes with better service quality. QATO can identify neighbors with better service quality and motivate nodes to help each other using incentive schemes. To validate our design, we have implemented QATO on Android platform and have developed a web browser and a photo uploader on top of it. Experimental results show that QATO can significantly reduce energy and delay for both data downloading and uploading. Through trace-driven simulations, we also show that all users can benefit from data offloading in the long run. © 2017 IEEE.","cellular networks; Data offloading; energy saving; smartphone","Energy conservation; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Android platforms; Cellular network; Data offloading; Device interfaces; Incentive schemes; Trace driven simulation; Wireless carriers; Wireless coverage; Quality of service",2-s2.0-85032283577

Accelerometers and inclinometers have been used to estimate sedentary behaviors, however a major limitation is that these devices do not provide enough contextual information in order to recognize the specific sedentary behavior performed, e.g., sitting or lying watching TV, using the PC, sitting at work, driving, etc. Objective Propose and evaluate the precision of a mobile system for objectively measuring six sedentary behaviors using accelerometer and location data. Results The system is implemented as an Android Mobile App, which identifies individual's sedentary behaviors based on accelerometer data taken from the smartphone or a smartwatch, and symbolic location data obtained from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The system infers sedentary behaviors by means of a supervised Machine Learning Classifier. The precision of the classification of five of the six studied sedentary behaviors exceeded 95% using accelerometer data from a smartwatch attached to the wrist and 98% using accelerometer data from a smartphone put into the pocket. Statistically significant improvement in the average precision of the classification due to the use of BLE beacons was found by comparing the precision of the classification using accelerometer data only, and BLE beacons localization technology. Conclusions The proposed system provides contextual information of specific sedentary behaviors by inferring with very high precision the physical location where the sedentary event occurs. Moreover, it was found that, when accelerometers are put in the user's pocket, instead of the wrist and, when symbolic location is inferred using BLE beacons; the precision in the classification is improved. In practice, the proposed system has the potential to contribute to the understanding of the context and determinants of sedentary behaviors, necessary for the implementation and monitoring of personalized noncommunicable diseases prevention programs, for instance, sending sedentary behavior alerts, or providing personalized recommendations on physical activity. The system could be used at work to promote active breaks and healthy habits. © 2017","Accelerometer; BLE beacons; Data mining; Sedentary behaviors classification; Sensor mining","Accelerometers; Data mining; Diseases; Learning systems; Location; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Wearable computers; BLE beacons; Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Cardiovascular disease; Contextual information; Localization technologies; Non-communicable disease; Personalized recommendation; Supervised machine learning; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85021065666

Data acquired by the hosted sensors are usually processed by machine-learning-based algorithms to classify human activities. The success of those algorithms mostly depends on the availability of training (labeled) data that, if made publicly available, would allow researchers to make objective comparisons between techniques. Nowadays, there are only a few publicly available data sets, which often contain samples from subjects with too similar characteristics, and very often lack specific information so that is not possible to select subsets of samples according to specific criteria. In this article, we present a new dataset of acceleration samples acquired with an Android smartphone designed for human activity recognition and fall detection. The dataset includes 11,771 samples of both human activities and falls performed by 30 subjects of ages ranging from 18 to 60 years. Samples are divided in 17 fine grained classes grouped in two coarse grained classes: one containing samples of 9 types of activities of daily living (ADL) and the other containing samples of 8 types of falls. The dataset has been stored to include all the information useful to select samples according to different criteria, such as the type of ADL performed, the age, the gender, and so on. Finally, the dataset has been benchmarked with four different classifiers and with two different feature vectors. We evaluated four different classification tasks: fall vs. no fall, 9 activities, 8 falls, 17 activities and falls. For each classification task, we performed a 5-fold cross-validation (i.e., including samples from all the subjects in both the training and the test dataset) and a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (i.e., the test data include the samples of a subject only, and the training data, the samples of all the other subjects). Regarding the classification tasks, the major findings can be summarized as follows: (i) it is quite easy to distinguish between falls and ADLs, regardless of the classifier and the feature vector selected. Indeed, these classes of activities present quite different acceleration shapes that simplify the recognition task; (ii) on average, it is more difficult to distinguish between types of falls than between types of activities, regardless of the classifier and the feature vector selected. This is due to the similarity between the acceleration shapes of different kinds of falls. On the contrary, ADLs acceleration shapes present differences except for a small group. Finally, the evaluation shows that the presence of samples of the same subject both in the training and in the test datasets, increases the performance of the classifiers regardless of the feature vector used. This happens because each human subject differs from other subjects in performing activities even if she shares with them the same physical characteristics. © 2017 by the authors.","Activity of daily living recognition; Dataset; Fall detection; Human activity recognition; Smartphone accelerometers",,2-s2.0-85032299017

Sixty seven h of driving data from 10 drivers were collected for analysis in this study.

An Android application called Sensoric was developed to collect low-level smartphone data about the users’ activity. The driving style was predicted from the user’s environment and activity data collected before driving. The prediction was tested against the actual driving style, calculated from objective driving data. The prediction has shown encouraging results, with precision values ranging from 0.727 up to 0.909 for aggressive driving recognition rate.

Restricting the access to shared system resources can effectively prevent the exploitation of known covert channels. However, it inevitably limits the normal usage of those resources. In this paper, we propose a general method that detects covert channel attack at runtime without impacting the accessibility of shared resources in the system. The main idea of the method is to track and audit the use of system resources known as potential covert channel variables and impose interferences on those channels to reduce their capacity once violations are detected. We implement a prototype framework, which is able to audit and interfere covert communication both in the application layer and in the native layer of Android. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce the data rate of user-defined covert channels while the overhead is negligible.

Methods: An Android application was developed to record accelerometer data and calculate descriptive features on 5-second time blocks, then classified with nine algorithms. Household activities were: sitting, working at the computer, walking, ironing, sweeping the floor, going down stairs with a shopping bag, walking while carrying a large box, and climbing stairs with a shopping bag. Ten volunteers carried out the activities for three times, each one with a smartphone in a different position (pocket, arm, and wrist). Users were then asked to answer a questionnaire. Results: 1440 time blocks were collected. Three algorithms demonstrated an accuracy greater than 80% for all smartphone positions.

In the second experiment, two additional re-design gestures were tested: multi-long press and slide down. The users’ performances were measured based on their overall time, success time, accuracy, Fitts’ Law values, and a subjective questionnaire. Among the five gestures, drag and multi-long press were categorized as the drag gesture, and pinch, double-touch drag and slide down were categorized as the enlarging gesture. The results show that children and adults outperformed the elderly in gesture operation. With respect to smartphone size, the subjects had faster response times and better Fitts’ Law values on 6-inch phones. When comparing the subjective preference and the objective use measurement values of the two drag gestures and three enlarging gestures among the different age groups, it was found that children and adults were consistent, whereas the elderly were inconsistent.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the program of research that led to the creation of a smoking cessation app for non-daily smokers, so as to stimulate further ideas to create “smart” smartphone apps to support health behavior change. Method: Literature reviews to evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed app, content analyses of existing apps, and smoking cessation sessions with non-daily smokers (n = 38) to inform the design of the app. Results: The literature reviews showed that (1) smoking cessation apps are sought after by smokers, (2) positive affect plays an important role in smoking cessation, (3) short, self-administered exercises consistently bring about enduring positive affect enhancements, and (4) low treatment-seeking rates of non-daily smokers despite high motivation to quit indicate a need for novel smoking cessation support. Directed content analyses of existing apps indicated that tailoring, two-way interactions, and proactive features are under-utilized in existing apps, despite the popularity of such features. Conventional content analyses of audio-recorded session tapes suggested that difficulty in quitting was generally linked to specific, readily identifiable occasions, and that social support was considered important but not consistently sought out. Conclusion: The “Smiling Instead of Smoking” (SIS) app is an Android app that is designed to act as a behavioral, in-the-pocket coach to enhance quitting success in non-daily smokers.

For instance, RNC’s high complexity can be directly translated into high energy consumption and drain fast smartphone batteries, making it unsuitable for mobile environments. In this paper, we optimize the energy consumption of RNC implementations with a given QoS requirement, especially throughput, for smartphone environments. To this end, we propose a duty cycling approach minimizing the energy consumption of RNC with a given throughput constraint. By manipulating the processor clock frequency controlling mechanism (a.k.a. governor) in Android, our approach can indirectly regulate the processor clock frequency and enhance energy efficiency. Real experiments on Android systems with smartphone application processors such as Samsung’s Exynos 5410, show that our method can reduce the energy consumption of RNC by up to 67% compared to a RNC implementation relying on ondemand governor for frequency control. Finally, we argue that our method can be applied to a wide range of applications by implementing it with a fast Fourier transform algorithm. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Android governor; Energy efficiency; Random network coding; Smartphone","Android (operating system); Clocks; Codes (symbols); Complex networks; Energy utilization; Fast Fourier transforms; Governors; Information services; Network coding; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Controlling mechanism; Energy-efficient QoS; Fast Fourier transform algorithm; High energy consumption; Information networks; Random network coding; Smart-phone applications; Throughput constraints; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-85017409356

The motivation behind malware attacks is that users store private and confidential data on the Smartphone and they personalize their Smartphone by installing third party applications. Millions of third party applications are present in online stores and they may contain malicious as well as non-malicious applications. The malware that is hidden inside the third party applications steals the private and sensitive information such as GPS location, contacts from the address book, images etc. The malware may exploit user’s data from remote locations without the user’s consent. There have been many data harvesting incidents, worm attacks and malware attacks such as ikee worm attack, Dutch ransom attack that were reported in the past.

Indeed, noise causes annoyance and fatigue, interferes with communication and sleep, damages hearing and entails cardiovascular problems (WHO, 2011) [1]. From an environmental point of view, noise implies a lessening of both the richness and abundance of the animal species, an alteration of the communication, which can threaten the reproduction and predation, etc. (Newport et al., 2014; Shannon et al., 2014) [2,3]. Consequently, effects related to environmental noise result in a huge cost for society, with 2.2 billion euros in France, for example, for the year 2013 (Bourges and Diel, 2015) [4]. In this context, the reduction of noise in the environment is a burning issue, which requires, firstly, carrying out an evaluation of noise in the environment, and secondly, to establish action plans to reduce noise annoyance.

Firstly, permissions and APIs, not only from Android permissions and SDK APIs but also from the developer-defined permissions and third-party library APIs, are extracted as features from the decompiled source codes. Secondly, feature selection methods, including information gain (IG), regularization and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, are used to analyze and utilize the correlation between the features to eliminate the redundant data, reduce the feature dimension and mine the useful joint features. Furthermore, regularization and PSO are integrated to create a new joint feature mining method. Experiment results show that the joint feature mining method can utilize the advantages of regularization and PSO, and ensure good performance and efficiency for Android malware detection. © 2017 KSII.","Android malware detection; Feature selection; Joint features; Particle swarm optimization; Regularization","Computer crime; Feature extraction; Malware; Mining; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Android malware; Feature dimensions; Feature selection methods; High dimensions; Information gain; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Privacy information; Regularization; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85030870106

The aim of this study is to propose an efficient framework that has a classification component based on traffic analysis of Android Apps. The framework differs from other proposed studies by focusing on identifying Apps traffic from a network perspective without introducing any overhead on subscribers smartphones. Additionally, it involves a technique for pre-processing network flows generated by Apps to acquire a set of features that are used to build an identification model using machine learning algorithms. The classification model is built using classification ensembles. A group of chosen users contribute in training the classification model, which learns the normal behavior of selected Apps. Eventually, the model should be able to detect abnormal behavior of similar Apps across the network. A 93.78% classification accuracy is achieved with a low false positive rate under 0.5%.

Unlike the conventional ones, which use separate programming schemes for different processors of the machine, e.g., OpenMP for the CPU and CUDA for the GPU, the new ones tend to offer a unified programming model to abstract details of heterogeneous computing engines. One such programming model is Halide that is designed for high performance image processing. Halide programmers are allowed to map data and computation to either the CPUs or GPUs through high-level C++ functions, which are converted to various code targets, including x86, ARM, CUDA, and OpenCL, by the Halide compiler. Nevertheless, it becomes complex when the programmers attempt to write a Halide program for cooperative computation on both the CPU and GPU. In this work, we propose the synergistic computing framework that extends Halide to improve program execution performance. Several key issues are tackled, including data coherence, workload partitioning, job dispatching and communication/synchronization, so that the Halide programmers are allowed to take advantage of the heterogeneous computing engines with the two developed C++ classes, one is for static workload partitioning/dispatching and the other is the dynamic counterpart. Furthermore, optimizations are developed to improve performance by generating adequate the CPU code, and eliminating extra memory copies. We characterize and discuss the performance of two image processing programs and our framework on the heterogeneous platforms, i.e., Android Nexus 7 smartphone and x86-based computers.

One viable solution is to offload these tasks to the connected smartphone. Existing Android smartphones allocate CPU resources to a task according to its performance requirement, which is determined by the context of the task. However, due to lack of context information, smartphones cannot properly allocate resources to tasks offloaded from wearable devices. Allocating too few resources to urgent tasks (related to user interaction) may cause high interaction latency on wearable devices, while allocating too many resources to unimportant tasks (unrelated to user interaction) may lead to energy waste on the smartphone. To solve this problem, we propose a context-aware task offloading (CATO) framework, in which offloaded tasks can be properly executed on the smartphone or further offloaded to the cloud based on their context, aiming to achieve a balance between good user experience on wearable devices and energy saving on the smartphone. To validate our design, we have implemented CATO on the Android platform and developed two applications on top of it. Experimental results show that CATO can significantly reduce latency for urgent tasks and save energy for other unimportant tasks. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computer networks; Energy conservation; Smartphones; User interfaces; Wearable computers; Wearable technology; Android platforms; Context information; Performance requirements; Task offloading; User experience; User interaction; Viable solutions; Wearable devices; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85032277692

In this paper, we design and implement the Smartphone-based and DOA-estimation acoustic array system called SDOAs, in which the effective and straightforward RBS-based and Post-Facto Synchronization (RBS-PFS) mechanism with sample-counting technique is proposed to figure out the problem of time asynchronization. The real SDOAs is implemented on a test-bed using several android smartphones. The experiment demonstrates that our acoustic array system SDOAs can achieve high accuracy DOA estimation with Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm and the RMSE is lower than 2.7° when the range of degree is between 0° and 45°. © 2017 Technical Committee on Control Theory, CAA.","DOA estimation; MUSIC; RBS-PFS mechanism; Sample-counting technique; Smartphone",,2-s2.0-85032172679

The present system would make good use of new technology that based on embedded Linux namely Raspberry Pi and Smartphone android application. This system works on GPS/GPRS/GSM SIM900A. GPS finds the current location of the vehicle, GPRS sends the tracking information to the server and the GSM is used for sending alert message to vehicle's owner mobile. This system is placed inside the vehicle whose position is to be determined on the web page and monitored at real time. There is a comparison between the current vehicle path already specified paths into the file system. Inside the raspberry pi's file system taken from vehicle owners through android phone using android application. Means the selection of path from location A to B takes place from vehicle owner's android application which gives more safety and secures traveling to the traveler. Hence the driver drives the vehicle only on the vehicle owner's specified path. The driver drives the vehicle only on the vehicle owner's specified path but if the driver drives in wrong path the message alert will be sent from this system to the vehicle owners mobile and also sent speakers alert to driver through audio jack. If the vehicles speed goes beyond the specified value of the speed, then warning message will be sent to owner mobile.

Hence, reducing display refreshes will reduce the power consumption. However, it is risky to manipulate frame rate drastically as it can deteriorate user satisfaction with the device. In this work, we introduce a screen management system that controls the frame rate on smartphone displays based on a model that detects user dissatisfaction due to display refreshes. This approach is based on understanding when higher frame rates are necessary, and providing lower frame rates-thus, saving power-if the lower rate is predicted not to cause user dissatisfaction. According to the results of our first user survey with 20 participants, individuals show highly varying requirements: while some users require high frame rates for the highest satisfaction, others are equally satisfied with lower frame rates. Based on this observation, we develop a system that predicts user dissatisfaction on the runtime and either increases or decreases the maximum frame rate setting. For user dissatisfaction predictions, we have compared two different approaches: (1) static model, which uses dissatisfaction characteristics of a fixed group of people, and (2) user-specific model, which is learning only from the specific user. Our second set of experiments with 20 participants shows that users report 32% less dissatisfaction and 4% more dissatisfaction than the default Android system with user-specific and static systems, respectively.

Security and privacy are key factors for an Android application to be successful. Android provides a permission mechanism to ensure security and privacy. This permission mechanism requires that developers declare the sensitive resources required by their applications. On installation or during runtime, users are required to agree with the permission request. However, in practice, there are numerous popular permission misuses, despite Android introducing official documents stating how to use these permissions properly. Some data mining techniques (e.g., association rule mining) have been proposed to help better recommend permissions required by an API. In this paper, based on popular techniques used to build recommendation systems, we propose two novel approaches to improve the effectiveness of the prior work. The first approach utilizes a collaborative filtering technique, which is inspired by the intuition that apps that have similar features — inferred from their APIs — usually share similar permissions. The second approach recommends permissions based on a text mining technique that uses a naive Bayes multinomial classification algorithm to build a prediction model by analyzing descriptions of apps. To evaluate these two approaches, we use 936 Android apps from F-Droid, which is a repository of free and open source Android applications. We find that our proposed approaches yield a significant improvement in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and MAP of the top-k results over the baseline approach. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Android; association rule; collaborative filtering; permission recommendation; text mining","Android (operating system); Association rules; Collaborative filtering; Data mining; Text processing; Android; Android applications; Classification algorithm; Collaborative filtering techniques; Naive Bayes Multinomial; permission recommendation; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Mobile security",2-s2.0-85027009703

Android dominates the smartphone market (86.2%) and has become pervasive, running in 'smart' devices such as tablets, TV, watches, etc. Nowadays, instant messaging applications have become popular amongst smartphone users and since 2016 are the main way of messaging communication. Consequently, their inclusion in any forensics analysis is necessary as they constitute a source of valuable data, which might be used as (admissible) evidence. Often, their examination involves the extraction and analysis of the applications' databases that reside in the device's internal or external memory. The downfall of this method is the fact that databases can be tampered or erased, therefore the evidence might be accidentally or maliciously modified. In this paper, a methodology for retrieving instant messaging data from the volatile memory of Android smartphones is proposed, instead of the traditional database retrieval. The methodology is demonstrated with the use of a case study of four experiments, which provide insights regarding the behavior of such data in memory. Our experimental results show that a large amount of data can be retrieved from the memory, even if the device's battery is removed for a short time. In addition, the retrieved data are not only recent messages, but also messages sent a few months before data acquisition. © 2017 IEEE.","Android; Android forensics; Instant messaging apps; Memory forensics","Data acquisition; Database systems; Digital storage; Message passing; Smartphones; Android; Android forensics; Database retrieval; External memory; Forensics analysis; Instant messaging; Memory forensics; Volatile memory; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85030562433

In recent times, hardware-based solutions like ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX Enclave have been introduced to protect code and data from being infected or modified from outside the designated 'secure' zone. While the hardware-based approaches have a distinct advantage, they have disadvantages in realizing Multi-Level Secure (MLS) systems, as they need to communicate via a central agent; further, a software vault would provide a good alternative when a system (like smartphone) is used/owned by a single person.

This realizes an efficient interacting system that is secure and as good as the system using the hardware-based solutions. Our solution is through dynamic labelling using the recent information flow models for decentralized systems. We illustrate the application of our technique for building a runtime monitor for the Android environment, and demonstrate its characteristic properties by realizing a secure banking application. The solution guarantees end-to-end preservation of confidentiality & integrity, and allowing interactions among distributed components but still preserving the hardness of penetration from malware.

The authors explored the use of a simple image-guided endoscopic method for removal of spontaneous supratentorial hematomas. METHODS: Virtual reality technology based on a hospital picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) was used in 3D hematoma visualization and surgical planning. Augmented reality based on an Android smartphone app, Sina neurosurgical assist, allowed a projection of the hematoma to be seen on the patient's scalp to facilitate selection of the best trajectory to the center of the hematoma. A obturator and transparent sheath were used to establish a working channel, and an endoscope and a metal suction apparatus were used to remove the hematoma. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were included in the study, including 18 with putamen hemorrhages and 7 with lobar cerebral hemorrhages. Virtual reality combined with augmented reality helped in achieving the desired position with the obturator and sheath. The median time from the initial surgical incision to completion of closure was 50 minutes (range 40-70 minutes). The actual endoscopic operating time was 30 (range 15-50) minutes. The median blood loss was 80 (range 40-150) ml. No patient experienced postoperative rebleeding. The average hematoma evacuation rate was 97%. The mean (± SD) preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 6.7 ± 3.2; 1 week after hematoma evacuation the mean GCS score had improved to 11.9 ± 3.1 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality using hospital PACS and augmented reality with a smartphone app helped precisely localize hematomas and plan the appropriate endoscopic approach.

A quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test control group design was used to answer the research question. 46 eighth-grade students from two classes at a public junior high school in Taiwan participated in the four-week educational experiment. Student participants received 6 quizzes as a formative evaluation during the experiment. A learning achievement test (summative evaluation) was developed to measure the students' understanding of English vocabulary and grammar. One month after the completion of the summative evaluation, the same achievement test (delayed summative evaluation) with different item numbers was administered to assess the long-term transfer of learning in the students. A self-report questionnaire and an informal interview were used to ascertain the students' learning experiences. The formative evaluation results showed that students in the traditional instruction class outperformed those in the BYOD instruction class because several BYOD students were not familiar with the BYOD approach.

Students in the BYOD instruction class exhibited a steady growth on learning outcomes and subsequently scored higher on the learning retention segment of the study. In addition, the BYOD teaching practice advanced the students’ second language learning experiences, particularly regarding learning motivation and interest. The results of the study suggested that schools and teachers should explore creative ways to integrate traditional and BYOD approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment strategy; Bring your own device; Experimental study; Instructional media evaluation; Language learning; Mobile learning","Education; Smartphones; Surveys; Teaching; Assessment strategies; Bring your own devices; Experimental study; Instructional media; Language learning; Mobile Learning; Students; achievement test; clinical article; control group; controlled study; experimental study; grammar; high school student; human; interview; language development; motivation; pretest posttest design; questionnaire; self report; smartphone; Taiwan; teacher; teaching",2-s2.0-85017526798

To address this problem, we present a framework for synthesis of efficient CNN inference software targeting mobile SoC platforms. We argue that thread granularity can substantially impact the performance and energy dissipation of the synthesized inference software, and demonstrate that launching the maximum number of logical threads, often promoted as a guiding principle by GPGPU practitioners, does not result in an efficient implementation for mobile SoCs. We hypothesize that the runtime of a CNN layer on a particular SoC platform can be accurately estimated as a linear function of its computational complexity, which may seem counter-intuitive, as modern mobile SoCs utilize a plethora of heterogeneous architectural features and dynamic resource management policies. Consequently, we develop a principled approach and a data-driven analytical model to optimize granularity of threads during CNN software synthesis. Experimental results with several modern CNNs mapped to a commodity Android smartphone with a Snapdragon SoC show up to 2.37X speedup in application runtime, and up to 1.9X improvement in its energy dissipation compared to existing approaches. © 2017 ACM.","Convolutional neural networks; Mobile GPUs; Thread coarsening; Thread granularity","Artificial intelligence; Convolution; Embedded systems; Energy dissipation; Internet of things; Neural networks; Program processors; System-on-chip; Architectural features; Computational intensity; Convolutional neural network; Dynamic resource management; Efficient implementation; Machine intelligence; Mobile GPUs; Thread granularity; Constrained optimization",2-s2.0-85030662915

This study addresses the design and implementation of a vision-based ADAS based on an image-based speed-limit sign (SLS) recognition algorithm, which can automatically detect and recognise SLS on the road in real-time. To improve the recognition rate of SLS having different orientations and scales in the image, this study also presents a new sign content description algorithm, which describes the detected road sign using centroid-to-contour (CtC) distances of the extracted sign content. The proposed CtC descriptor is robust to translation, rotation and scale changes of the SLS in the image. This advantage improves the recognition accuracy of a support vector machine classifier trained using a large database of traffic signs. The proposed SLS recognition method had been implemented on two different embedded platforms, each of them equipped with an ARM-based Quad-Core CPU running Android 4.4 operating system. Experimental results validate that the proposed method not only provides a high recognition rate, but also achieves real-time performance up to 30 frames per second for processing 1280 × 720 video streams running on a commercial ARM-based smartphone. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Automobile drivers; Character recognition; Classification (of information); Optical character recognition; Pattern recognition; Roads and streets; Video signal processing; Video streaming; Design and implementations; Embedded implementation; Real time performance; Recognition accuracy; Recognition algorithm; Speed limit sign recognition; Support vector machine classifiers; Traffic sign recognition; Traffic signs",2-s2.0-85029142427

This disorder was recently acknowledged in the DSM-5 as a behavioral addiction. GD is particularly associated with patterns of loss of control relating to time and money spent on gambling activities. Different factors are involved in this pattern of loss of control including arousal, dissociation and immersion during gambling, escaping from aversive affects and thoughts when in gambling sessions and attempts to recover from previous financial losses. In addition, specific cognitive distortions are associated with GD, mainly related to the illusion of control (over-estimation of one's own influence over the uncontrollable outcomes of gambling-related games). Furthermore, several game characteristics increase the loss of control during a game session. For example, near misses activate the brain regions related to wins, increase arousal and, unsurprisingly, increase people's involvement in subsequent game sessions. Although GD is a common disorder with serious psychological and social consequences, there is currently no approved pharmacological treatment. However, patients can be helped by psychotherapy. Studies on motivational interview and cognitive and behavioral therapy of GD have shown favorable outcomes on gambling behaviors, at least in the short term. Most of the studies available to date focus on gambling abstinence. Rather than focusing on abstinence from gambling activities, it seems that gambling in more controlled ways is a viable and attractive goal for numerous gamblers. In particular, it was found that many gamblers tend to change their own goals (abstinence versus control) in a one-year follow-up. Supporting such controlled gambling activities as defined by the gamblers is a promising avenue. Unfortunately, in spite of available treatment, only a very small proportion of people with GD ask for help. Internet delivered treatments provide new opportunities for GD help. A wide range of people with GD can be reached using such tools. In consideration of the wide diffusion of Internet gambling during recent years, it is very important for prevention and help resources to be available online. Some preliminary randomized controlled studies on Internet treatments for GD have shown promise. The rise of electronic lotteries and Internet gambling offer new opportunities to help people to increase gambling control and responsible gambling (e.g. gambling with adequate control of time and money spent on gambling-related activities). It seems easier to track a person's gambling activities and to give specific feedback. Such personalized feedback appears to be promising. In particular, feedback may help people to fix and adhere to their own pre-fixed gambling limits (time and money). It seems possible to offer options in electronic gambling venues. However, most people, particularly those suffering from GD, use different Internet and land-based gambling offers. Based on these observations, smartphone apps could possibly offer attractive opportunities. Apps for smartphones provide an increasing range of possibilities for helping people with mental health and addictive disorders. Different studies already support the feasibility and possible efficacy of such apps. The present paper gives an overview of the rationale and the description of an app specifically designed to help people with GD (“jeu-contrôle”) in fixing and adhering to their own time and money limits. A special emphasis on psychological needs related to the self-determination theory (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) was considered during the app design. In relation to limit-setting, such an app may help people by ecological momentary assessments and interventions to set limits, and personalized feedback in relation to the participant's own goal limits. The app, available in French and German, is associated with an Internet website (allowing access to some additional information and tools) and is available on Google Play (Android) and the App Store (iOS) at no charge.

DCL allows an app developer to load additional code at runtime. DCL raises numerous challenges with regards to security and accountability analysis of apps. While previous studies have investigated DCL on Android, in this paper we formulate and answer three critical questions that are missing from previous studies: (1) Where does the loaded code come from (remotely fetched or locally packaged), and who is the responsible entity to invoke its functionality? (2) In what ways is DCL utilized to harden mobile apps, specifically, application obfuscation? (3) What are the security risks and implications that can be found from DCL in off-the-shelf apps? We design and implement DyDroid, a system which uses both dynamic and static analysis to analyze dynamically loaded code. Dynamic analysis is used to automatically exercise apps, capture DCL behavior, and intercept the loaded code. Static analysis is used to investigate malicious behavior and privacy leakage in that dynamically loaded code. We have used DyDroid to analyze over 46K apps with little manual intervention, allowing us to conduct a large-scale measurement to investigate five aspects of DCL, such as source identification, malware detection, vulnerability analysis, obfuscation analysis, and privacy tracking analysis. We have several interesting findings. (1) 27 apps are found to violate the content policy of Google Play by executing code downloaded from remote servers. (2) We determine the distribution, pros/cons, and implications of several common obfuscation methods, including DEX encryption/loading. (3) DCL's stealthiness enables it to be a channel to deploy malware, and we find 87 apps loading malicious binaries which are not detected by existing antivirus tools. (4) We found 14 apps that are vulnerable to code injection attacks due to dynamically loading code which is writable by other apps. (5) DCL is mainly used by third-party SDKs, meaning that app developers may not know what sort of sensitive functionality is injected into their apps. © 2017 IEEE.","Android; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic Code Loading; Measurement; Mobile security; Smartphone","Android (operating system); Codes (symbols); Computer crime; Cryptography; Dynamic analysis; Dynamic loads; Malware; Measurements; Mobile security; Network security; Static analysis; Android; Code injection attacks; Code-loading; Design and implements; Large-scale measurement; Security implications; Source identification; Vulnerability analysis; Loading",2-s2.0-85031688773

Due to frequent interactions between users and smartphones, the power management of AMOLED displays is crucial. To this end, dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is most effective and a lot of studies on it have been made. However, no work of DVS on smartphones with AMOLED displays can be found in the literature. In this paper, we propose the first practical DVS scheme for AMOLED displays on Android smartphones, aiming both human visual system (HVS)-awareness and high power saving. It combines automated battery-aware DVS with local gamma correction and effective smoothing using a novel metric which can evaluate the balance between power saving and HVS-awareness from a user study. In extensive experiments with an implementation of an Android platform, the proposed scheme saves power consumption by up to 62% and extends battery lifetime by about 15% over a normal mode. Moreover, it achieves better HVS-awareness as well as better power saving than the power-saving mode in a smartphone, which restricts some device functions for much power saving intentionally.

In this study, we propose a new strategy for excellent selective colorimetric detection of S2O3 2-. The nonmorphological transition of AgNPs leading to a color change from yellow to brown is verified by UV-vis, TEM, DLS, SEM, and XPS analyses. The sensor exhibits high sensitivity with detection limits of 1.0 μM by naked-eye determination and 0.2 μM by UV-vis spectroscopy analysis. The linear relationship (R2 = 0.998) between the (A0 - A)/A0 values and S2O3 2- concentrations from 0.2 μM to 2.0 μM indicates that the fabricated AgNPs-based colorimetric sensor can be employed for quantitative assay of S2O3 2-. Colorimetric responses are also monitored using the built-in camera of a smartphone. The sensor shows a linear response to S2O3 2- in 0-20.0 μM solutions under the optimized conditions and is thus more suitable for rapid on-site tests than other detection methods. A smartphone application (app) is downloaded under Android or IOS platforms to measure the RGB (red, green, blue) values of the colorimetric sensor after exposure to the analyte. Following data processing, the RGB values are converted into concentration values by using preloaded calibration curves.

We show that two of the most popular measurement apps-Ookla Speedtest and MobiPerf-have their RTT measurements inflated. We build three test apps that cover three common measurement methods and evaluate them in a testbed. We overcome the main challenge of obtaining a complete trace of packets and their timestamps by using multiple sniffers and frame-based synchronization. Our multi-layer analysis reveals that the delay inflation can be introduced both in the user space and kernel space. The long path of subfunction invocations accounts for the majority of the delay overhead in Android runtime (both Dalvik VM and ART), and the sleeping functions in the drivers are the major source of the delay overhead between the kernel and physical layer. Motivated by the findings, we propose and implement a native app to increase the accuracy of RTT measurement, and its delay inflation in the user space can be kept under 1.5ms for almost all cases.

This paper investigates the reliability and applicability of using motion-sensor behavior for active and continuous smartphone authentication across various operational scenarios, and presents a systematic evaluation of the distinctiveness and permanence properties of the behavior. For each sample of sensor behavior, kinematic information sequences are extracted and analyzed, which are characterized by statistic-, frequency-, and wavelet-domain features, to provide accurate and fine-grained characterization of users&#x2019; touch actions. A Markov-based decision procedure, using one-class learning techniques, is developed and applied to the feature space for performing authentication.

Most Android malware is generated by piggybacking malicious payloads into benign applications (apps), which are called piggybacked apps. In this paper, we propose DAPASA, an approach to detect Android piggybacked apps through sensitive subgraph analysis. Two assumptions are established to reflect the different invocation patterns of sensitive APIs in the injected malicious payloads (rider) of a piggybacked app and in its host app (carrier). With these two assumptions, DAPASA generates a sensitive subgraph (SSG) to profile the most suspicious behavior of an app. Five features are constructed from SSG to depict the invocation patterns. The five features are fed into the machine learning algorithms to detect whether the app is piggybacked or benign. DAPASA is evaluated on a large real-world data set consisting of 2551 piggybacked apps and 44 921 popular benign apps. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits an impressive detection performance compared with that of three baseline approaches even with only five numeric features. Furthermore, the proposed approach can complement permission-based approaches and API-based approaches with the combination of our five features from a new perspective of the invocation structure. © 2017 IEEE.","malware detection; Piggybacked apps; sensitive API; sensitive subgraph; static analysis","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer crime; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Smartphones; Static analysis; Virtual reality; Android malware; Detection performance; Evaluation results; Exponential growth; Malware detection; Popular platform; sensitive API; Subgraphs; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85019191558

Although some innovative solutions have been proposed in the past two decades, how to accurately and efficiently localize users in indoor environments is still a challenging problem. Traditional indoor positioning systems based on Wi-Fi fingerprints or dead reckoning suffer from the variation of Wi-Fi signals and the drift of dead reckoning problems, respectively. Crowdsourcing and ambient sensing stimulate new ways to improve existing localization systems' accuracy. Using human social factors to calibrate the accuracy of localization is practical and awarding. In this paper, we propose WAIPO, a collaborative indoor localization system with the fusion of Wi-Fi and magnetic fingerprints, image-matching, and people co-occurrence. Specifically, we could obtain the most likely top-n locations based on Wi-Fi fingerprints. We utilize the statistics of users' historical locations known by image-matching, for which we propose a photo-room matching algorithm, to reduce estimating areas. In order to further improve the accuracy of localization, we propose a co-occurrence and non-co-occurrence detection algorithm to detect users' spatial-temporal co-occurrence and determine users' locations with magnetic calibration.

Thus, it becomes very important to understand the diversities of applications installed on smartphones and how batteries are consumed across different applications. This paper presents a large-scale battery study on smartphones focusing on diversities in applications and users. Based on application and battery traces collected on over 80 000 Android smartphones for a four-week period, we analyze the battery discharging patterns, the types of mobile applications, and the usage and energy consumption patterns for these applications. During the analysis, we introduce a novel method to calculate the energy consumption rate for each application based on coarse-grained battery data collected with a lightweight monitoring tool. Based on the results, we present some observations and discuss possible improvements on smartphone designs and mobile application development. We also compare our results to some previous studies wherever it is possible. © 2013 IEEE.","battery; energy consumption; Mobile computing; smartphones; user study","Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Green computing; Internet; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Servers; Solar cells; battery; Complex applications; Data collection; Energy consumption rates; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Mobile communications; User study; Smartphones",2-s2.0-85028867614

Especially, VOCs from human exhaled breath can serve as significant biomarkers of some diseases, such as lung cancer and diabetes. In this study, a smartphone-based sensing system was developed for real-time VOCs monitoring using alternative current (AC) impedance measurement. The interdigital electrodes modified with zinc oxide (ZnO), graphene, and nitrocellulose were used as sensors to produce impedance responses to VOCs. The responses could be detected by a hand-held device, sent out to a smartphone by Bluetooth, and reported with concentration on an android program of the smartphone. The smartphone-based system was demonstrated to detect acetone at concentrations as low as 1.56 ppm, while AC impedance spectroscopy was used to distinguish acetone from other VOCs. Finally, measurements of the exhalations from human being were carried out to obtain the concentration of acetone in exhaled breath before and after exercise. The results proved that the smartphone-based system could be applied on the detection of VOCs in real settings for healthcare diagnosis. Thus, the smartphone-based system for VOCs detection provided a convenient, portable and efficient approach to monitor VOCs in exhaled breath and possibly allowed for early diagnosis of some diseases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Graphene; Impedance measurement; Interdigital electrode; Smartphone; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)","Acetone; Diagnosis; Electric impedance measurement; Electrodes; Graphene; Hand held computers; Organic compounds; Signal encoding; Volatile organic compounds; Zinc oxide; Ac impedance spectroscopy; Alternative current; Environment monitoring; Food quality controls; Impedance measurement; Impedance response; Interdigital electrode; Modified electrodes; Smartphones; acetone; graphene; pyroxylin; trinitrotoluene; volatile organic compound; zinc oxide; zinc oxide nanoparticle; biological marker; graphite; volatile organic compound; zinc oxide; Android application program; Article; breath analysis; catalysis; electric resistance; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; electrode; electron transport; environmental monitoring; exhalation; human; impedance; quality control; room temperature; semiconductor; smartphone; software; chemistry; electrode; genetic procedures; isolation and purification; smartphone; Acetone; Biomarkers; Biosensing Techniques; Electrodes; Graphite; Humans; Smartphone; Volatile Organic Compounds; Zinc Oxide",2-s2.0-85000977828

Existing energy modeling methods can account energy drain in a fine-grained manner and provide well designed human-battery interfaces for users to characterize energy usage of every app in smartphones. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that there are still pitfalls in current Android energy modeling approaches, leaving collateral energy consumption unaccounted. The existence of collateral energy consumption becomes a serious energy bug. In particular, those energy bugs could be exploited to launch a new class of energy attacks, which deplete battery life and sidestep the supervision of current energy accounting. To unveil collateral energy bugs, we propose E-Android to accurately profile energy consumption of a smartphone in a comprehensive manner. E-Android monitors collateral energy related events and maintains energy consumption maps for relevant apps. We evaluate the effectiveness of E-Android under six different collateral energy attacks and two normal scenarios, and compare the results with those of Android.

VehicleSense aims at achieving three performance objectives: high accuracy, low latency, and low power consumption at once by exploiting sound characteristics captured from the built-in microphone while being on candidate transportations. To attain high energy efficiency, VehicleSense adopts hierarchical accelerometer-based triggers that minimize the activation of the microphone of smartphones. Further, to attain high accuracy and low latency, VehicleSense makes use of non-linear filters that can best extract the transportation sound samples. Our 186-hour log of sound and accelerometer data collected by seven different Android smartphone models confirms that VehicleSense achieves the recognition accuracy of 98.2% with only 0.5 seconds of sound sampling at the power consumption of 26.1 mW on average for all day monitoring. © 2017 IEEE.",,,2-s2.0-85027533688

The objective is to provide extra support to field teams decisions when plant information systems are not available. However, predicting doses due to atmospheric dispersion of radionuclide generally requires execution of complex and computationally intensive physical models. In order to allow such predictions to be made by using limited computational resources such as mobile phones, it is proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) previously trained (offline) with data generated by precise simulations using the NPP atmospheric dispersion system. Typical situations for each postulated accident and respective source terms, as well as a wide range of meteorological conditions have been considered. As a first step, several ANN architectures have been investigated in order to evaluate their ability for dose prediction in hypothetical scenarios in the vicinity of CNAAA Brazilian NPP, in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. As a result, good generalization and a correlation coefficient of 0.99 was achieved for a validation data set (untrained patterns). Then, selected ANNs have been coded in Java programming language to run as an Android application aimed to plot the spatial dose distribution into a map.

The speed of the toy car is found by determining the distance between the light-emitting toy car and the smartphone, and the time taken to travel these distances. To ensure that the average speed of the toy car calculated with the help of the AndroSensor was correct, the average speed was also calculated by analyzing video-recordings of the toy car.

Many of these place a paramount importance on accurate user heading estimation. Such applications include dead-reckoning-based localization and many crowd-sensing applications where the user typically carry her phone in arbitrary positions and orientations relative to her body and her transportation mode. However, there is no general solution available to estimate the user’s heading as current state-of-the-art focus on improving the phone orientation estimation, require the phone to be placed in a particular position, require a fixed transportation mode, require user intervention, and/or do not work accurately indoors. In this paper we present Humaine, a novel ubiquitous system that reliably and accurately estimates the user orientation relative to the Earth coordinate system. Humaine works accurately whether the user is riding a vehicle or walking indoors/outdoors for arbitrary cell phone positions and orientations relative to the user body. Moreover, it requires no prior-configuration nor user intervention. The system intelligently fuses the different inertial sensors widely available in off-the-shelf smartphones and employs statistical analysis techniques to their measurements to estimate the user orientation. Implementation of the system on different Android devices with 300 experiments performed at different indoor and outdoor testbeds shows that Humaine significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in diverse scenarios, achieving a median accuracy of 14∘ and 16∘ for indoor and outdoor pedestrian users and 20∘ for in-vehicle users over a wide variety of phone positions. This is better than the-state-of-the-art by 523% and 594% for indoor and outdoor pedestrian users and 750% for in-vehicle users.

In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of open port usage on mobile platform and their security implications. To achieve this goal, we design and implement OPAnalyzer, a static analysis tool which can effectively identify and characterize vulnerable open port usage in Android applications. Using OPAnalyzer, we perform extensive usage and vulnerability analysis on a dataset with over 100K Android applications. OPAnalyzer successfully classifies 99% of the mobile usage of open ports into 5 distinct families, and from the output, we are able to identify several mobile-specific usage scenarios such as data sharing in physical proximity.

A computer equipped with an LCD screen acts as a data transmitter whereas the smartphones with cameras perform the task of receivers. The multilevel modulation of light intensities allows each visual symbol or dot to carry more number of bits, thus increasing the data rate. However, varying characteristic of smartphone cameras especially from the auto exposure function and the auto white balance function significantly interfere the symbol detection of smartphones. With the aid of pilot symbol insertion, the appropriate decision levels for the symbol detection can be effectively evaluated at the receiver without disabling the auto exposure function or the auto white balance function of cameras. To avoid the effects of saturation and nonlinearity in the detection, the brightness of the LCD should be kept between 20% and 80%. Besides, the lowest intensity level of the grey-scale coding should be higher than a threshold otherwise the receiver cannot effectively sense the present of the data transmission from the LCD screen. © 2017 IEEE.","barcode; camera; data transfer; smartphone; visible light communication","Bar codes; Cameras; Codes (symbols); Data communication systems; Data transfer; Embedded systems; Integrated circuits; Light; Liquid crystal displays; Signal detection; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Visible light communication; Android smartphone; Auto white balance; Data transmitter; Decision levels; Intensity levels; Multilevel modulation; Smart-phone cameras; Symbol detection; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85025645130

Most applications are now based on consistent user interfaces, such as games and instant messaging, and it is therefore crucial to efficiently manage the power consumption of the AMOLED display. To this end, an accurate power model for this type of display is needed. The prior work available in the literature did not consider the dependencies between the red, green, and blue (RGB) channels, or only accounted for limited dependencies between the channels. In this paper, we develop a novel accurate power model for AMOLED displays that considers all possible dependencies between the three channels. We applied this model to four panels from the Galaxy S1, Galaxy S3, and Galaxy S5 from SAMSUNG, and a CHIMEI panel with different customizations. Using four well-known image datasets, the proposed model shows that the smallest error rate is on average 1.13% for the Galaxy S5 panel, while both the simple model and the existing dependency models represent average error rates of 9.69% and 5.53%, respectively. As a result, the proposed model is shown to be correct and generally usable. In these tests, this model was implemented using the vector floating point support of the Cortex-A9 on an Android smartphone at the operating system level. The computation time required for each test image that had a resolution of 720 x 1280 was 3 seconds. © 2017 ACM.","Accuracy; AMOLED Display; Channel; Dependency; Power Model","Computer aided design; Display devices; Galaxies; Light emitting diodes; Smartphones; User interfaces; Accuracy; AM-OLED; Channel; Dependency; Power model; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED)",2-s2.0-85023632070

Meanwhile, Mobile devices have evolved far beyond the stereotypical personal devices and been employed in various traditional real-time embedded domains. Of the currently available mobile systems, Android has seen the most widespread deployment outside of the consumer electronics market. Its open source nature has prompted its ubiquitous adoption in sensing, medical, robotics, and autopilot applications. However, it is not surprising that Android does not provide any real-time guarantee since it is designed as a mobile system and optimised for mobility, user experience, and energy efficiency. Although there has been much interest [1, 2, 3] in adopting Android in real-time contexts, surprisingly little work has been done to examine the suitability of Android for real-time systems. Existing work only provides solutions to traditional problems, including real-time garbage collection at the virtual machine layer, real-time OS scheduling and resource management. While it is critical to address these issues, it is by no means sufficient. After all, Android is a vast system that is more than a Java virtual machine and a kernel. Our work [4, 6, 7] examines the internals of Android, the Android programming model, libraries and core systems services. We discuss the implications and challenges of adapting Android constructs and core system services for real-time and present a solution for each, name RTDroid, as a whole system. It is unique in that it redesigns Android's internal components, replaces Android's Dalvik/ART with a real-time Java virtual machine, FijiVM, and leverages off-the-shelf real-time OSes. RTDroid also provides an event-driven programming model [5] for the development of real-time applications. To retain a familiar style of Android application, we make a number of changes to the Android abstractions and how they interact with the underlying system as well as each other. We aim to leave legacy Android code unaffected and expose real-time features to components which have timeliness requirements. More specifically, Our programming model consist of four parts: 1) real-time constructs for real-time expressiveness, 2) a real-time extension to Android's application manifest for the real-time configuration, 3) real-time communication channels that enable construct interactions with real-time semantics, 4) pause-less memory management with scoped memory. To validate the predictability of RTDroid's implementation, we firstly report a number of micro benchmark results with RTDroid basic constructs. Then, we demonstrate three real-world applications implemented in RTDroid and provide statistic results. Our results illustrate that, at least in these use-cases, the modified platform delivers significantly better time predictability than stock Android and reduces the code complexity as compared to the traditional real-time programming paradigm, RTSJ. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,"Android (operating system); Computer programming; Energy efficiency; Java programming language; Machine components; mHealth; Network security; Occupational risks; Open source software; Scheduling; Semantics; Virtual machine; Consumer electronics markets; Event-driven programming model; Java virtual machines; Real time programming; Real-time application; Real-time communication; Real-time garbage collection; Time predictabilities; Real time systems",2-s2.0-85026263593

As a platform-level solution, M+ enables unmodified Android applications to utilize not only application functionalities but also system functionalities across devices, as if they were to utilize them inside the same device. In addition to secure connection setup, M+ also allows performing of permission checks for remote applications in the same way as for local.

World Driven Access Control (WDAC) [1], which triggered by environment signs rather than user operations, provides a privacy access control mechanism for photographed objects (including people and other objects containing sensitive information). WDAC supports several policy label forms which either have impact on the normal appearance of objects or rely on sensors other than camera to sense policy labels. This paper proposes an approach of labelling with a Near Infrared (NIR) label which relies only on camera and has no influence on normal appearance of objects. When an object wears a NIR label, surrounding people are unaware of the existence of the labels.

The proposed drift-reduction method in UTMLS addresses the cumulating error issue in the indoor tracking with the consumer grade motion sensor. The proposed hypothesis test method in UTMLS improves the tracking sensor fusion precision by detecting distorted GPS reports and intelligently switching between GPS and inertial sensor based schemes. The proposed scheme is instantiated and implemented on an Android smartphone platform. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate and validate the accuracy. Experimental results show that 1) the proposed drift-reduction method effectively suppresses the non-GPS tracking error accumulation due to the integration of acceleration noise with time 2) UTMLS realizes robust indoor/outdoor seamless tracking, preventing GPS fault estimates introduced tracking error in the conventional Kalman filtering process. © 2017 IEEE.","Android; GPS; IMU; Kalman Filter; Localization; Sensors; Smartphone","Android (operating system); Errors; Kalman filters; Motion analysis; Sensors; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Testing; Android; Android smartphone; Hypothesis tests; Inertial sensor; Kalman-filtering; Localization; Localization and tracking; Location sensors; Global positioning system",2-s2.0-85023180126

To search for system inefficiencies and to explore innovative storage solutions, it is important to have a comprehensive view of how the storage device interacts with the OS, System-on-Chip CPU, and SW layers.

However, the uptake of the technology is quite low in the industry, with little research on key constraint factors and the priority needs of the construction workforce. This study aimed to achieve three key objectives: 1) to identify the smartphone operating systems used by construction workers, 2) to identify barriers to greater uptake of mobile app technology in New Zealand Construction Industry, and 3) to determine the popularity of construction apps and their key features. Through interview-based exploratory survey method, feedback received from members of the Registered Master Builders Association of New Zealand was analyzed using content analysis and descriptive statistics methods. Results showed that 70% of the smart phones used by construction workers were based on iPhone's iOS, while 28% were based on Android platform, with other platforms having a small market share. Six factors were found to constrain the uptake of mobile apps in the industry, the most influential being cost of software and licensing. Findings in relation to the popular apps and their key features showed that PlanGrid - a cloud-based project collaboration and management system - was the most popular with a rating of 5/5. Others included JobFlex - an estimating and tendering software, Procore - used for project management, and SmartBidNet - used for bid management.

The present study aimed to evaluate diabetes apps for content, functions and behaviour change techniques (BCTs). Methods: Diabetes self-management apps for Android smartphones were searched for on the Google Play Store. Ten apps each from the following search terms were included; ‘diabetes’, ‘diabetes type 1’, ‘diabetes type 2’, ‘gestational diabetes’. Apps were evaluated by being scored according to their number of functions and BCTs, price, and user rating. Results: The mean (SD) number of functions was 8.9 (5.9) out of a possible maximum of 27. Furthermore, the mean (SD) number of BCTs was 4.4 (2.6) out of a possible maximum of 26. Apps with optimum BCT had significantly more functions [13.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.9–15.9] than apps that did not (4.7; 95% CI = 3.2–6.2; P < 0.01) and significantly more BCTs (5.8; 95% CI = 4.8–7.0) than apps without (3.1; 95% CI = 2.2–4.1; P < 0.01). Additionally, apps with optimum BCT also cost more than other apps. In the adjusted models, highly rated apps had an average of 4.8 (95% CI = 0.9–8.7; P = 0.02) more functions than lower rated apps. Conclusions: ‘Diabetes apps’ include few functions or BCTs compared to the maximum score possible. Apps with optimum BCTs could indicate higher quality. App developers should consider including both specific functions and BCTs in ‘diabetes apps’ to make them more helpful.

The flip side of the functionality these apps offer is their potential for privacy invasion. Apps can, if granted permission, gather a vast amount of very personal and sensitive information. App developers might exploit the combination of human propensities and the design of the Android permission-granting interface to gain permission to access more information than they really need. This compromises personal privacy. The fact that the Android is the globally dominant phone means widespread privacy invasion is a real concern. We, and other researchers, have proposed alternatives to the Android permission-granting interface. The aim of these alternatives is to highlight privacy considerations more effectively during app installation: to ensure that privacy becomes part of the decision-making process. We report here on a study with 344 participants that compared the impact of a number of permission-granting interface proposals, including our own (called the COPING interface — COmprehensive PermIssioN Granting) and two Android interfaces. To conduct the comparison we carried out an online study with a mixed-model design. Our main finding is that the focus in these interfaces ought to be on improving the quality of the provided information rather than merely simplifying the interface. The intuitive approach is to reduce and simplify information, but we discovered that this actually impairs the quality of the decision. Our recommendation is that further investigation is required in order to find the “sweet spot” where understandability and comprehensiveness are maximised. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Android permission-granting interface; Heuristics; Interface comprehensiveness; Privacy-related behaviour","Decision making; Decision making process; Heuristics; Mixed modeling; Online studies; Personal privacy; Privacy invasions; Sensitive informations; Understandability; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85007071991

In 2 experiments using an instrumented vehicle on suburban roadways, we measured the cognitive workload of drivers when they used the voice-based features of each smartphone to place a call, select music, or send text messages. Cognitive workload was derived from primary task performance through video analysis, secondary-task performance using the Detection Response Task (DRT), and subjective mental workload. We found that workload was significantly higher than that measured in the single-task drive. There were also systematic differences between the smartphones: The Google system placed lower cognitive demands on the driver than the Apple and Microsoft systems, which did not differ. Video analysis revealed that the difference in mental workload between the smartphones was associated with the number of system errors, the time to complete an action, and the complexity and intuitiveness of the devices. Finally, surprisingly high levels of cognitive workload were observed when drivers were interacting with the devices: ""on-task"" workload measures did not systematically differ from that associated with a mentally demanding Operation Span (OSPAN) task. The analysis also found residual costs associated using each of the smartphones that took a significant time to dissipate.

The mishap happens because of no sign boards indicating the speed breaker, poor visibility at night and road works that are often carried out with no proper signs of road deviations and also the negligence of the driver. All these factors put the life of the persons in vain causing damage to the vehicle as well as life. Bumpy roads have become a problem for cars with less ground clearance. The focus of the paper is on designing an early warning system detecting both speed breakers and bad road conditions. The approach used in this paper is a real-time solution and is developed as an android service that runs in the background and relies on Google Maps application in the smartphone. This service will throw an alert giving early warning if the user is approaching the speed breaker or a bumpy road. Apart from just giving an early alert to the user, it also provides the user with an alternative and a better route. The solution proposed in this work is a form of crowdsourcing where users share and get data, therefore making the system cost effective. © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.","Accelerometer; Android application; Bad roads; Speed breakers; SVM",,2-s2.0-85021115872

In addition, most studies treat independent variables as separate from each other even if their combinations might have importance above the independent contribution of each. Our study aimed to conduct an exploratory latent profile analysis of EMA data to demonstrate an empirical method of identifying invalid responses, and to provide a preliminary investigation of mood profiles. We recruited 20 adolescents between the ages of 13–18 to complete 4 surveys about their internal states each day for 20 days. Participants provided responses on study smartphones using an Android app developed by the study team. Our profile analysis revealed 9 independent profiles. We determined that 3 of these profiles consisted of invalid responses because the integers provided by the participant were nearly invariant. The invalid responses comprised 24.9% of the sample. We also identified 6 valid profiles that were labeled: fatigued (8.7%), good mood/energetic (19.9%), angry/depressed (2.3%), good mood (37.1%), angry (5.7%), and depressed (1.4%). One important implication of the current study is that researchers and clinicians should screen electronic diary data, especially for invariant responding. In addition, it is important for clinicians to note that more than one internal state may drive the mood of an adolescent patient. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adolescent; Ecological momentary assessment (EMA); Latent profile analysis; Mood states","adolescent; clinical article; ecological momentary assessment; exploratory research; human; mood; scientist; screening; smartphone; statistical model",2-s2.0-85014769253

The problem is identifying such apps is hard due to the fact that there exist hundreds of thousands of apps and their impact on the battery is not well understood. We show via extensive measurement studies that the impact of an app on battery consumption depends on both environmental (wireless) factors and usage patterns. Based on this, we argue that there exists a critical need for a tool that allows a user to: 1) identify apps that are energy hungry and 2) understand why an app is consuming energy, on her phone. Toward addressing this need, we present TIDE, a tool to detect high energy apps on any particular smartphone. TIDE's key characteristic is that it accounts for usage-centric information while identifying energy hungry apps from among a multitude of apps that run simultaneously on a user's phone. Our evaluation of TIDE on a test bed of Android-based smartphones, using week-long smartphone usage traces from 17 real users, shows that TIDE correctly identifies over 94% of energy-hungry apps and has a false positive rate of < 6%. © 2017 IEEE.","Energy management; Smartphones; User-centric","Electric batteries; Signal encoding; Telephone sets; Battery consumption; False positive rates; Key characteristics; Measurement study; Usage patterns; User-centric; Smartphones",2-s2.0-85011272326

Amongst the several pollutant that have to be faced on a daily basis, urban noise represent one of the most widely known for its already ascertained health-related issues. However, no systematic noise management and control activities are performed in the majority of European cities due to a series of limiting factors (e.g., expensive monitoring equipment, few available technician, scarce awareness of the problem in city managers). The recent advances in the Smart City model, which is being progressively adopted in many cities, nowadays offer multiple possibilities to improve the effectiveness in this area. The Mobile Crowd Sensing paradigm allows collecting data streams from smartphone built-in sensors on large geographical scales at no cost and without involving expert data captors, provided that an adequate IT infrastructure has been implemented to manage properly the gathered measurements. In this paper, we present an improved version of a MCS-based platform, named City Soundscape, which allows exploiting any Android-based device as a portable acoustic monitoring station and that offers city managers an effective and straightforward tool for planning Noise Reduction Interventions (NRIs) within their cities.

To avoid any access by impostor (unauthorized parties), the use of authentication system is a must. Android provides basic authentication system based on screen-lock using PIN, password, or pattern. However all those ways have several vulnerabilities, i.e: 1) leak or transfered key access, 2) only supports full binary authentication, and 3) no re-authentication nor revocation. This research aims at developing continuous behavioral authentication as a solution for those vulnerabilities. Our solution uses authentication score, not just a binary authentication. The score is constructed using fusion approach combining two modalities i.e. keystroke dynamics (typing behavior) and touch gesture (tap, swipe, and pinch behavior). Each of those authentication model is built using two-class machine learning classification. This authentication system is designed to run continuously on Android background, so it is possible to change authorization or make a revocation anytime needed. This proposed solution has been implemented as a prototype on a testing application. There are some tests have been held, first is modality experiment to find the best classifier each modality, second is continuous fusion authentication test, third is performance test. The result shows that our proposed fusion authentication get more accurate than if the modalities work respectively.

Out of numerous Web Service specifications there is a subset (Profile) to implement Web Services on resource constrained devices, called Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS). The resulting service oriented architecture enables the user to discover new devices, e.g., in the local smart home network. The open standards for Web Services further define a metadata format for service description. Besides the simple invocation of service operations, an eventing mechanism is specified. A client which subscribes to an event will receive notifications. Those features and the inherent Plug&Play capability provided by Web Services are suitable to connect smart home devices in a user-friendly manner. However, DPWS specifies no standard procedure to combine multiple devices with each other to build more complex applications. Therefore, new concepts for embedded Web Service orchestration are needed. Some commercial solutions use a central hub, which represents a Single Point of Failure (SPoF). Hence, a failure would lead to a breakdown of all smart Internet of Things (IoT) applications and decrease the user acceptance. We propose a concept where no central broker is needed by defining a Configuration Service that runs on multiple devices.

The pattern of care for people with moderate to very severe COPD often involves regular lengthy hospital admissions, which result in high healthcare costs and an undesirable effect on quality of life. Research over the past decade has focused on innovative methods for developing enabling and assistive technologies that facilitate patient self-management. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions delivered by computer and by mobile technology versus face-to-face or hard copy/digital documentary-delivered interventions, or both, in facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self-management among people with COPD. Search methods: In November 2016, we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), which contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and we handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials that measured effects of remote and Web 2.0-based interventions defined as technologies including personal computers (PCs) and applications (apps) for mobile technology, such as iPad, Android tablets, smart phones, and Skype, on behavioural change towards self-management of COPD. Comparator interventions included face-to-face and/or hard copy/digital documentary educational/self-management support. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors (CMcC and MMcC) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text study reports for inclusion. Two review authors (CMcC and AMB) independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We expressed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for studies using different outcome measurement scales. Main results: We included in our review three studies (Moy 2015; Tabak 2013; Voncken-Brewster 2015) with a total of 1580 randomised participants. From Voncken-Brewster 2015, we included the subgroup of individuals with a diagnosis of COPD (284 participants) and excluded those at risk of COPD who had not received a diagnosis (1023 participants). As a result, the total population available for analysis included 557 participants; 319 received smart technology to support self-management and 238 received face-to-face verbal/written or digital information and education about self-management. The average age of participants was 64 years. We included more men than women because the sample from one of the studies consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. These studies measured five of our nine defined outcomes. None of these studies included outcomes such as self-efficacy, cost-effectiveness, functional capacity, lung function, or anxiety and depression. All three studies included our primary outcome - health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) or St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). One study reported our other primary outcomes - hospital admissions and acute exacerbations. Two studies included our secondary outcome of physical activity as measured by daily step counts. One study addressed smoking by providing a narrative analysis. Only one study reported adverse events and noted significant differences between groups, with 43 events noted in the intervention group and eight events in the control group (P = 0.001). For studies that measured outcomes at week four, month four, and month six, the effect of smart technology on self-management and subsequent HRQoL in terms of symptoms and health status was significantly better than when participants received face-to-face/digital and/or written support for self-management of COPD (SMD -0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.40 to -0.03; P = 0.02). The single study that reported HRQoL at 12 months described no significant between-group differences (MD 1.1, 95% CI -2.2 to 4.5; P = 0.50). Also, hospitalisations (logistic regression odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.2; P = 0.19) and exacerbations (logistic regression OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.8; P = 0.33) did not differ between groups in the single study that reported these outcomes at 12 months. The activity level of people with COPD at week four, month four, and month six was significantly higher when smart technology was used than when face-to-face/digital and/or written support was provided (MD 864.06 daily steps between groups, 95% CI 369.66 to 1358.46; P = 0.0006). The only study that measured activity levels at 12 months reported no significant differences between groups (mean -108, 95% CI -720 to 505; P = 0.73). Participant engagement in this study was not sustained between four and 12 months. The only study that included smoking cessation found no significant treatment effect (OR 1.06, 95%CI 0.43 to 2.66; P = 0.895). Meta-analyses showed no significant heterogeneity between studies (Chi2 = 0.39, P = 0.82; I2 = 0% and Chi2 = 0.01, P = 0.91; I2 = 0%, respectively). Authors' conclusions: Although our review suggests that interventions aimed at facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self-managment in people with COPD and delivered via smart technology significantly improved HRQoL and levels of activity up to six months compared with interventions given through face-to-face/digital and/or written support, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This improvement may not be sustained over a long duration. The only included study that measured outcomes up to 12 months highlighted the need to ensure sustained engagement with the technology over time. Limited evidence suggests that using computer and mobile technology for self-management for people with COPD is not harmful and may be more beneficial for some people than for others, for example, those with an interest in using technology may derive greater benefit. The evidence, provided by three studies at high risk of bias, is of poor quality and is insufficient for advising healthcare professionals, service providers, and members of the public with COPD about the health benefits of using smart technology as an effective means of supporting, encouraging, and sustaining self-management. Further research that focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD is needed. Researchers should provide clear information on how self-management is assessed and should include longitudinal measures that allow comment on behavioural change. © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The processing steps for each image were as follows: image acquisition, image segmentation, image filtering, angle error correction and leaf area measurement. The correction of angle error was the key part of this study, in this section, the error model was established and the correction formula was proposed.

More often, it requires large and expensive laboratory instruments, which makes it difficult to conduct when the tests must be performed quickly at the point-of-care (POC). To increase portability and ease of use, we propose a portable diagnostic system based on a Raspberry Pi imaging sensor for the rapid detection of progesterone in milk samples. We designed, assembled, and tested a standalone portable diagnostic reader and validated it for progesterone detection against a standard ELISA assay using a commercial plate reader. The portable POC device yielded consistent results, regardless of differences in the cameras and flashlights between various smartphone devices. An Android application was built to provide front-end access to users, control the diagnostic reader, and display and store the progesterone measurement on the smartphone. The diagnostic reader takes images of the samples, reads the pixel values, processes the results, and presents the results on the handheld device. The proposed POC reader can perform to superior levels of performance as a plate reader, while adding the desirable qualities of portability and ease of use. © 2017 by the authors.

We developed a smartphone application system for mechanical QA. The system consists of two smartphones: one attached to a gantry for obtaining real-time information on the mechanical parameters of the medical linear accelerator, and another displaying real-time information via a Bluetooth connection with the former. Motion sensors embedded in the smartphone were used to measure gantry and collimator rotations. Images taken by the smartphone's high-resolution camera were processed to evaluate accuracies of jaw-positioning, crosshair centering and source-to-surface distance (SSD). The application was developed using Android software development kit and OpenCV library. The accuracy and precision of the system was validated against an optical rotation stage and digital calipers, prior to routine QA measurements of five medical linear accelerators. The system accuracy and precision in measuring angles and lengths were determined to be 0.05 ± 0.05° and 0.25 ± 0.14 mm, respectively. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) in QA measurements of gantry and collimator rotation were 0.05 ± 0.04° and 0.05 ± 0.04°, respectively. The MAE in QA measurements of light field was 0.39 ± 0.36 mm. The MAEs in QA measurements of crosshair centering and SSD were 0.40 ± 0.35 mm and 0.41 ± 0.32 mm, respectively. In conclusion, most routine mechanical QA procedures could be performed using the smartphone application system with improved precision and within a shorter time-frame, while eliminating potential human errors. © 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","mechanical QA; medical linear accelerator; precision; smartphone","Acceleration; Application programs; Errors; Linear accelerators; mHealth; Optical collimators; Quality assurance; Smartphones; Software design; Accuracy and precision; Bluetooth connections; High resolution camera; Mechanical parameters; mechanical QA; precision; Real-time information; Smart-phone applications; Medical information systems",2-s2.0-85019994793

We propose machine learning approach for the estimation and use support vector regression (SVR) method. Our feature space for SVR includes network parameters such as available bandwidth and round trip time (RTT), received signal strength index (RSSI) as channel parameter, CPU load, Available Battery and file size as system parameters. Based on these features we estimate the time needed to upload the multimedia content. We evaluate our solution for accuracy using cross validation and our findings reveal, 84% of estimates are in 80% confidence interval for LTE and 80% in case of 3G. This estimate can help the user/system to make decision to schedule delay tolerant uploads in more favorable environment to maximize the Quality of Experience (QoE).

The ""Aachen Fall Prevention App"" (AFPA) represents the first mobile Health (mHealth) application (app) empowering older patients (persons 50+ years) to self-assess and monitor their individual fall risk. Self-assessment is based on the ""Aachen Fall Prevention Scale,"" which consists of three steps. First, patients answer ten standardized yes-no questions (positive criterion≥5 ""Yes"" responses). Second, a ten-second test of free standing without compensatory movement is performed (positive criterion: compensatory movement). Finally, during the third step, patients rate their subjective fall risk on a 10-point Likert scale, based on the results of steps one and two. The purpose of this app is (1) to offer a low-threshold service through which individuals can independently monitor their individual fall risk and (2) to collect data about how a patient-centered mHealth app for fall risk assessment is used in the field. Results: The results represent the first year of an ongoing field study. From December 2015 to December 2016, 197 persons downloaded the AFPA (iOS™ and Android™; free of charge). N=111 of these persons voluntarily shared their data and thereby participated in the field study. Data from a final number of n=79 persons were analyzed due to exclusion criteria (age, missing objective fall risk, missing self-assessment). The objective fall risk and the self-assessed subjective risk measured by the AFPA showed a significant positive relationship. Conclusions: The ""Aachen Fall Prevention App"" (AFPA) is an mHealth app released for iOS and Android. This field study revealed the AFPA as a promising tool to raise older adults' awareness of their individual fall risk by means of a low-threshold patient-driven fall risk assessment tool. © 2017 The Author(s).","Balance assessment; Co-managed care; Fall prevention; Fracture in the elderly; Geriatric trauma center; MHealth; Orthogeriatrics","adult; aged; Article; awareness; controlled study; elderly care; fall risk assessment; falling; female; field study; human; male; mobile application; patient monitoring; population risk; risk assessment; self evaluation",2-s2.0-85018377655

On current Android devices, power management relies heavily on OS modules known as governors. These modules are created for various hardware components, including the CPU, to support DVFS. They implement algorithms that attempt to balance performance and power consumption. In this paper we make the observation that the existing governors are (1) general-purpose by nature (2) focused on power reduction and (3) are not energy-optimal for many applications. We thus establish the need for an application-specific approach that could overcome these drawbacks and provide higher energy efficiency for suitable applications. We also show that existing methods manage power and performance in an independent and isolated fashion and that co-ordinated control of multiple components can save more energy. In addition, we note that on mobile devices, energy savings cannot be achieved at the expense of performance. Consequently, we propose a solution that minimizes energy consumption of specific applications while maintaining a user-specified performance target. Our solution consists of two stages: (1) offline profiling and (2) online controlling. Utilizing the offline profiling data of the target application, our control theory based online controller dynamically selects the optimal system configuration (in this paper, combination of CPU frequency and memory bandwidth) for the application, while it is running. Our energy management solution is tested on a Nexus 6 smartphone with 6 real-world applications.

To answer these questions, the authors first analysed two platform entrepreneurial ecosystems in the smartphone app store industry (Google Play’s Android market and Apple’s App Store) and two ecosystems in the hotel-booking industry (Hotels.com and Booking.com). Second, we analysed the effects of platforms as entrepreneurial ecosystems on the regional development of Daegu Metropolitan City. We used in-depth interview methods with a semi-structured questionnaire, system dynamics (SD) simulation, a literature review, and a statistical analysis as research methods. The results of these analyses yielded the following findings. First, platform business models as economic ecosystems motivate a change of regional development from focused areas to multiple areas, from a hierarchical structure of firms to a network of diverse firms, and from scope and scale economy-based firms leading regional development to creative economy-based firms leading regional development. Second, we identified three category factors that were important in a platform ecosystem, and built up and simulated causal and SD models of these factors. Third, we found that the dynamics of platform ecosystems differ from platform to platform because the openness of platforms produces different effects on firms according to the industry to which they belong. © 2017 The Author(s).

The structural feature, which we refer to as ecosystem complexity, is a function of the number of unique components or subsystems that interact with the complementor's product.We incorporate the evolutionary features by considering the role of generational transitions initiated by platform firms over time as well as the role of complementors' ecosystem-specific experience. Evidence from Apple's iOS and Google's Android smartphone ecosystems supports our arguments that higher ecosystem complexity helps app developers sustain their superior performance, and that this effect is stronger for more experienced firms. In contrast, platform transitions initiated by Apple and Google make it more difficult for app developers to sustain their performance superiority, and that this effect is exacerbated by the extent of ecosystem complexity. The study offers a novel account of how the performance of complementor firms in platform-based business ecosystems may be shaped by their ecosystem-level interdependencies. © 2017 INFORMS.","Business ecosystem; Complementors; Platform; Smartphone ecosystem; Technology transition",,2-s2.0-85020549357

In recent years, it has become a common practice for scientists to design apps that run only on a single operating system, thereby excluding large numbers of users who use a different operating system. However, empirical evidence investigating any selection biases that might result thereof is scarce. Henceforth, we conducted two studies drawing from a large multi-national (Study 1; N = 1,081) and a German-speaking sample (Study 2; N = 2,438). As such Study 1 compared iOS and Android users across an array of key personality traits (i.e., well-being, self-esteem, willingness to take risks, optimism, pessimism, Dark Triad, and the Big Five). Focusing on Big Five personality traits in a broader scope, in addition to smartphone users, Study 2 also examined users of the main computer operating systems (i.e., Mac OS, Windows). In both studies, very few significant differences were found, all of which were of small or even tiny effect size mostly disappearing after sociodemographics had been controlled for. Taken together, minor differences in personality seem to exist, but they are of small to negligible effect size (ranging from OR = 0.919 to 1.344 (Study 1), np 2 = .005 to .036 (Study 2), respectively) and may reflect differences in sociodemographic composition, rather than operating system of smartphone users. © 2017 Goetz et al.

Materials and Methods: An image acquisition Android App was created to facilitate the acquisition and transmission of dental images to a store-and-forward based telemedicine server. One hundred participants who were attending routine checkups at dental clinics were enrolled in 2014. Following a face-to-face oral screening by a screener (dentist), images of patients' teeth were obtained using a smartphone camera. These images, along with patient information, were then transmitted from the Android App to the server through the Internet for later independent assessment by two charters (off-site dentists). The assessments of these charters were then compared to the benchmark face-to-face caries assessment. Results: Sensitivity values for the photographic method when compared to the benchmark face-to-face caries assessment were moderate, and ranged from 60% to 63%. Weighted kappa (K) as a measure of intragrader agreement for the photographic assessment was estimated as almost perfect (K = 0.84). The intergrader agreement for the photographic method compared to the face-to-face caries assessment ranged from moderate to substantial (K = 0.54-0.66). Conclusions: Despite some limitations, the mobile teledentistry approach has shown the potential to detect occlusal caries from photographs taken by a smartphone camera with an acceptable diagnostic performance compared to traditional face-to-face screening.

Recently, we implemented an optical monitoring approach that tracks chest wall movements directly on a smartphone. In this paper, we explore the use of such noncontact optical monitoring to obtain a volumetric surrogate signal, via analysis of intensity changes in the video channels caused by the chest wall movements during breathing, in order to provide not only average RR but also information about VT and to track RR at each time instant (IRR). The algorithm, implemented on an Android smartphone, is used to analyze the video information from the smartphone's camera and provide in real time the chest movement signal from N = 15 healthy volunteers, each breathing at VT ranging from 300 mL to 3 L. These measurements are performed separately for each volunteer. Simultaneous recording of volume signals from a spirometer is regarded as reference. A highly linear relationship between peak-to-peak amplitude of the smartphone-acquired chest movement signal and spirometer VT is found (r2 = 0.951 ± 0.042$, mean ± SD). After calibration on a subject-by-subject basis, no statistically significant bias is found in terms of VT estimation; the 95% limits of agreement are-0.348 to 0.376 L, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.182 ± 0.107 L. In terms of IRR estimation, a highly linear relation between smartphone estimates and the spirometer reference was found (r2 = 0.999 ± 0.002). The bias, 95% limits of agreement, and RMSE are-0.024 breaths-per-minute (bpm),-0.850 to 0.802 bpm, and 0.414 ± 0.178 bpm, respectively.

The cellphone owner is given an audio-visual alert at the very instant of the lost event, and the cellphone deduces the fact that it is away from its owner and executes the safety measures. This is realized by equipping the cellphone with a low-power RFID Reader and tagging the owner with a passive RFID token to determine a private space around him, which spans within 2-10 feet. We prototype an RFID Reader from discrete components under $60 which can transmit 30 dBm with $-$ 78 dBm sensitivity, and can also serve as an educational tool for academic learning. Our system works on automatic, timed, or accelerometer based thresholds. We interface our system with Samsung Galaxy Note2 and develop an Android User Interface. We carry out extensive indoor and outdoor experiments under static and dynamic scenarios to ascertain the Frontal and Angular ranges, energy and power consumption, and memory and computational overheads. Our salient contribution is a twofold probing scheme - a duty cycle approach that economizes battery overhead, mitigates false alarms and scans the tag for multiple times by leveraging the interrogation time and power. We argue that though our design is costly in power budget, it is highly economical on battery energy because of short interrogation cycles. We show that for 17 tag interrogations from 20-24 dBm, our scheme consumes 72.1 to 52.4 percent lower energy than a single Bluetooth device scan.

Considering that the raw data are intrinsically prone to noise and error, those data are preprocessed by weighted smoothing. Then, 6 time-domain features are elaborated to determine the discriminative features for characterizing falling, and two features, maximum and vertical velocity are selected. Then, 4 different classification algorithms are investigated, and SVM is selected. The prototype of SmartFDS is implemented on Android phones, and can detect falling in real time accurately. © 2016 IEEE.","Classification; Falling detection; Feature selection; Smartphone","Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Green computing; Internet of things; Smartphones; Accelerometer sensor; Classification algorithm; Design and implementations; Discriminative features; Off-line training; Online activities; Time domain features; Vertical velocity; Data mining",2-s2.0-85020195911

In order to enhance the navigation/positioning capabilities offered by traditional GPS-based approaches, which are often unreliably in urban environments, a building/landmark recognition approach is also proposed. Finally, for the specific case of indoor applications, the system has the possibility to learn a set of user-defined objects of interest. Here, multi-object identification and tracking is applied in order to guide the user to localize such objects of interest. The feedback is presented to user by audio warnings/alerts/indications.

Because most GPUs for embedded systems are non-preemptive by nature, it is important to schedule GPU resources efficiently across multiple GPU tasks. We present a novel spatial resource sharing (SRS) technique for GPU tasks, called a budget-reservation spatial resource sharing (BR-SRS) scheduling, which limits the number of GPU processing cores for a job based on the priority of the job. Such a priority-driven resource assignment can prevent a high-priority foreground GPU task from being delayed by background GPU tasks. The BR-SRS scheduler is invoked only twice at the arrival and completion of jobs, and thus, the scheduling overhead is minimized as well. We evaluated the performance of our scheduling scheme in an Android-based smartphone, and found that the proposed technique significantly improved the performance of high-priority tasks in comparison to the previous temporal budget-based multi-task scheduling. © 2017","Embedded GPU; GPU job scheduling; Resource reservation; Spatial resource sharing","Budget control; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Embedded systems; Program processors; Scheduling; Smartphones; Vision; Job scheduling; Personal devices; Priority tasks; Resource assignment; Resource reservations; Scheduling schemes; Spatial resources; User experience; Graphics processing unit",2-s2.0-85018350378

To optimize the app graphics energy, however, developers face the challenge of highly complex graphics rendering process, which involves multiple system layers including the app, the framework, the GPU, and the asynchronous interactions among them. Current diagnostic tools can profile the resource usage from certain layers, but fall short in stitching together profiling information across all the layers which is needed to provide developers with the visual effect-energy tradeoff at the app source-code level. In this paper, we design and implement a holistic graphics energy diagnosis tool, GfxDoctor1, that helps developers to systematically diagnose energy inefficiencies in app graphics at the app source-code level, by precisely quantifying (1) the visual effect of each UI update, and (2) the aggregate energy drain spent in traversing the entire frame rendering stack due to each UI update. GfxDoctor overcomes three challenges faced in deriving per-UI-update visual effect and energy accounting, asynchrony across system layers, UI update batching, and ""black-box"" GPU, with two key techniques - lightweight view-frame-ID-based information flow tracking, and OpenGL record-and-replay plus frame diffing. We show the effectiveness of GfxDoctor by profiling a randomly sampled set of 30 popular Android apps which reveals three types of graphics energy bugs happening in 8 out of the 30 apps.

In this work we introduce Wrist Sensors, a novel Android Wear app for presenting the available sensors of compatible smartwatches and recording measurements from any user-specified subset of them. The recordings are persistently stored and made available in the communicating Android smartphone. The app, which has been made freely available via the Google Play distribution service, can serve as a valuable data acquisition tool to facilitate the development of efficient P4 medicine interventions. In fact, the app has already been used by a published study for acquiring the input dataset for developing a novel real-time bite detection algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Android (operating system); Data acquisition; Health; mHealth; Smartphones; Wearable computers; Wearable technology; Android smartphone; Detection algorithm; Distribution services; Environmental data; Health-care system; Primary objective; Sensor technologies; Sustainable solution; Wearable sensors",2-s2.0-85018379600

AMI is a serious heart condition where a blood vessel of the heart is fully or partially blocked e.g. by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque, the arrival of oxygen to the heart muscle is disturbed, and part of the heart muscle tissue dies (irreversible injury) due to insufficient oxygen supply. When a person feels obscure acute chest pain (angina pectoris), it may be caused, for instance, by heartburn or it may be a symptom of AMI. The goal of this paper is to develop a solution, which could either be integrated into an emergency App for the use of telemedicine by trained medical personnel or as a standalone solution to smartphone users in order to help recognizing this life-threatening condition earlier. The developed solution extracts the heart signal of a patient who lies in supine position by utilizing the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope within a smart device (e.g. a smartphone), which is placed on the chest of the patient. The solution does not require any external sensors for the smartphone to operate, but in the future it could be supplemented with ECG, for instance, to improve its performance. We have collected data with smartphone running Google Android from 17 AMI patients before and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in addition, control recordings were performed in 23 healthy individuals (CG) and in 12 patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) before elective PCI. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Blood vessels; Cardiology; Disease control; Diseases; Health; Heart; Muscle; Oxygen supply; Patient treatment; Smartphones; Acute myocardial infarction; Atherosclerotic plaque; Coronary artery disease; External sensors; Healthy individuals; Life threatening conditions; Medical personnel; Percutaneous coronary intervention; mHealth",2-s2.0-85018451124

The proposed system includes a helmet molded with stereo cameras in the front, android-based smartphone, web application and cloud computing platform. The cloud computing platform is the core of the system, integrates object detection and recognition, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), speech processing, vision-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and path planning, which are all based on deep learning algorithm. The blind people interact with the system in voice. The cloud platform communicates with the smartphone through Wi-Fi or 4G mobile communication technology. For testing the system performance, two groups of tests have been conducted. One is perception and the other is navigation.

Their processing capacity, instrumentation, connectivity, low cost, and accessibility allow farmers (among other users in rural areas) to operate them easily with applications adjusted to their specific needs. In this investigation, the integration of inertial sensors, a GPS, and a camera are presented for the monitoring of a coffee crop. An Android-based application was developed with two operating modes: (i) Navigation: for georeferencing trees, which can be as close as 0.5 m from each other; and (ii) Acquisition: control of video acquisition, based on the movement of the mobile device over a branch, and measurement of image quality, using clarity indexes to select the most appropriate frames for application in future processes. The integration of inertial sensors in navigation mode, shows a mean relative error of ±0.15 m, and total error ±5.15 m. In acquisition mode, the system correctly identifies the beginning and end of mobile phone movement in 99% of cases, and image quality is determined by means of a sharpness factor which measures blurriness.

Therefore finding available parking spots is becoming more challenging on daily life. This paper proposes a novel solution by providing motorists with real-time information about the availability of spots in parking spaces through a smartphone application. Ultrasonic sensors and raspberry pi were used at the gates of parking zones to detect cars and calculate the number of available parking spots. Client web server was used to accommodate multiple users in an android platform. Drivers can see available parking spots in real time on a map, they also can get navigate to nearest available parking spots using the mobile application. The parking system is designed for different types of parking zone (such as open space car parking and multilevel car parking); the cost of deploying the system is inexpensive due to the low demand for Raspberry pi single board computer as a local server and ultrasonic sensors for each entrance and exit gates compared to those that require a sensor for each parking spot. © 2016 IEEE.","client server; raspberry pi; smart parking system; urban","Automobile drivers; Control systems; Garages (parking); Parking; Ultrasonic sensors; Android platforms; Client server; Mobile applications; Real-time information; Single board computers; Smart parking systems; Smart-phone applications; urban; Ultrasonic applications",2-s2.0-85018974126

This paper proposed a low cost platform for vision based manipulator control that consists of used smartphone, hobbyist servo motors, custom robot links, and android operating systems. Designed as a 4-axis manipulator equipped with a smartphone, the platform is able to track an object in front of the robot.

In each mode, a user can install a different set of apps. However, in most of the cases, the user has to select the mode manually. If we can sense the smartphone's security context accurately, then it is possible to switch between different security modes automatically. Also, smartphone operating systems are becoming ubiquitous. As a result, mobile apps need to behave differently based on the security context (e.g., not sending the data if the network is insecure). There exist other research work that may detect the physical context of a smartphone. However, we focus on sensing different security parameters (e.g., location, is-network-encrypted) and calculating the security context from the parameters. In this paper, we propose Flamingo, a security context management framework that maintains a cache of security contexts and parameters to be used by the operating system and third-party applications. As detecting contexts requires the use of power-hungry smartphone sensors, a comprehensive framework for sharing security parameters among various applications can be beneficial in terms of energy and other resource expenses. The implementation of Flamingo as a part of the Android operating system shows that it is effective in managing security contexts and parameters.

As a result, a mechanism that can make these decisions on the user's behalf can significantly improve a smartphone's battery life.

Of particular note is the use of an electronic compass/inclinometer built into tablets and smartphones for obtaining orientation data where an important question is the reliability of these digital devices relative to conventional, analogue compass/inclinometers. This paper deals with this question through detailed tests of two android devices: an Honor 3C smartphone and a Lenovo B8080-F tablet. In order to evaluate potential electronic noise effects the devices were tested in two modes, standard and airplane. Over 14,000 readings from the sensors were collected to evaluate the stability of the sensor's readings and showed that the magnetic sensor in the tablet was unacceptably unstable. Seven geological compass applications were installed on the Honor 3C smartphone and tested against the analogue Freiberg geological compass in a field experiment. During the experiment 25 fractures varying in azimuth and dip were measured using both devices. A high level of disagreement was observed with discrepancies as high as 80° with azimuthal errors dominant. Analysis of the time series in the data suggest the source of the problem was instability in the magnetic sensor for the smartphone, despite the fact the device passed the initial stability test.

Well-designed campaigns are raising awareness to the problem and an increasing number of smokers seeks medical assistance to quit their habit. In this context, there is the need to develop mHealth Apps that assist and manage large smoke quitting programs in efficient and economic ways. Objectives Our main objective is to develop an efficient and free mHealth app that facilitates the management of, and assistance to, people who want to quit smoking. As secondary objectives, our research also aims at estimating the economic effect of deploying that App in the public health system. Methods Using JAVA and XML we develop and deploy a new free mHealth App for Android, called TControl (Tobacco-quitting Control). We deploy the App at the Tobacco Unit of the Santa Maria Hospital in Lleida and determine its stability by following the crashes of the App. We also use a survey to test usability of the app and differences in aptitude for using the App in a sample of 31 patients. Finally, we use mathematical models to estimate the economic effect of deploying TControl in the Catalan public health system. Results TControl keeps track of the smoke-quitting users, tracking their status, interpreting it, and offering advice and psychological support messages. The App also provides a bidirectional communication channel between patients and clinicians via mobile text messages. Additionally, registered patients have the option to interchange experiences with each other by chat. The App was found to be stable and to have high performances during startup and message sending. Our results suggest that age and gender have no statistically significant effect on patient aptitude for using TControl. Finally, we estimate that TControl could reduce costs for the Catalan public health system (CPHS) by up to € 400M in 10 years. Conclusions TControl is a stable and well behaved App, typically operating near optimal performance. It can be used independent of age and gender, and its wide implementation could decrease costs for the public health system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Healthcare; mHealth; Mobile app; Smoke-free","Cost benefit analysis; Estimation; Health; Health care; mHealth; Public health; Smoke; Tobacco; Bi-directional communication; Message sending; Mobile app; Near-optimal performance; Passive smokers; Public health systems; Risk factors; Tobacco smoking; Economic and social effects; access to information; adult; aged; aptitude; Article; clinical article; e-mail; female; follow up; health care cost; human; male; mathematical model; mobile application; psychological aspect; public health systems research; smartphone; smoking cessation; Spain; text messaging; adverse effects; health promotion; middle aged; mobile phone; odds ratio; procedures; questionnaire; reminder system; reproducibility; smoking; smoking cessation; telemedicine; theoretical model; tobacco; Adult; Aged; Cell Phones; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Models, Theoretical; Odds Ratio; Reminder Systems; Reproducibility of Results; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Text Messaging; Tobacco",2-s2.0-85013846676

Smartphone-based systems may facilitate this procedure. Based on Android and digital image processing, a smartphone-based system for cucumber leaf disease severity quantifying was designed and implemented. Leaf images can be obtained by using the smartphone back camera in field, and also can be loaded from local storage of the smartphone. Severity quantifying was done to the image in several steps. Firstly, image pre-processing and non-interested background removal were directly done to the leaf color image. Secondly, the diseased region was discriminated from the leaf region. Finally, disease severity was calculated by the ratio of disease area to leaf area as percentage, and disease grade was also calculated from the disease severity following a national standard. Numerical severity quantifying results were displayed in the interface, and the identified diseased region of the leaf image was marked in red and displayed in the interface as a synthesis image simultaneously. Two background removal algorithm were implemented in the system. One was used for simple background removal, namely super-G, which was used for background removal when the leaf region within a simple artificial background, such as a white A4 sheet. The other one was grabcut, which was a user-interactive background removal method chosen for complex natural background removal.

Cyberbullying can be described as a form of bullying where a perpetrator uses electronic means to cause harm to a victim. With the proliferation of smartphone technology in present times, there has been a steady shift in the usage of OSNs from traditional computers to mobile devices. However, existing systems that defend against cyberbullying are largely applicable only to traditional computing platforms and cannot be directly applied to detect cyberbullying in mobile platforms. To address such a critical issue, we investigate an innovative mobile cyberbullying defense system called MCDefender that can effectively detect and prevent cyberbullying in mobile OSNs. We first analyze the key challenges that differentiate cyberbullying conditions in traditional and mobile platforms. We then investigate a two-level detection mechanism for comprehensive cyberbullying detection in mobile OSNs where cyberbullying can be quickly detected before a cyberbullying message is sent through a mobile device and hidden cyberbullying attacks can be also detected through a more fine-grained and context-aware analysis. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implement and evaluate an Android application based on MCDefender. Our evaluation results show that our mobile application can detect cyberbullying with a high accuracy of 98.9% for OSNs. © 2017 ACM.","Cyberbullying defense; Deep learning; Pronunciation; Social networks","Computer crime; Deep learning; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Network security; Android applications; Cyber bullying; Mobile applications; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSNs); Pronunciation; Traditional computers; Traditional computing; Social networking (online)",2-s2.0-85018266567

It creates motivation for developers of malicious applications to put more effort on discovering ways to identify and exploit the vulnerabilities of utility applications and grab the sensitive information of the users. Android applications, being more open in nature and popular among armature individual developers, fall victim to the malwares quite frequently. Recently, the Govt. of Bangladesh has taken initiative to encourage and patronize young developers to develop utility apps for free public use in the context of Bangladesh (app source: EATL1). While the motivation is great, i.e., benefiting common people, the way these are developed and released have reasons to suspect that recent vulnerabilities may exist due. This may harm the users and ruin the good initiative. In this paper, we have carried out an empirical study on a selected set of these apps to detect eight common vulnerabilities. We have carefully chosen three quality tools that cover testing of all these vulnerabilities. We reported the detected results showing vulnerabilities in the tested apps, presented statistics of the vulnerabilities and discussed countermeasures.

It is often that fire fighters cannot access the source of fire due to the damage of building and very high temperature, or even due to the presence of explosive materials. With such constraints and high risk in the handling of the fire, a technological breakthrough that can help fighting the fire is necessary. Our paper proposed the use of robots to extinguish the fire that can be controlled from a specified distance in order to reduce the risk. A fire extinguisher robot was assembled with the intention to extinguish the fire by using a water pump as actuators. The robot movement was controlled using Android smartphones via Wi-fi networks utilizing Wi-fi module contained in the robot. User commands were sent to the microcontroller on the robot and then translated into robotic movement. We used ATMega8 as main microcontroller in the robot. The robot was equipped with cameras and ultrasonic sensors. The camera played role in giving feedback to user and in finding the source of fire. Ultrasonic sensors were used to avoid collisions during movement. Feedback provided by camera on the robot displayed on a screen of smartphone. In lab, testing environment the robot can move following the user command such as turn right, turn left, forward and backward. The ultrasonic sensors worked well that the robot can be stopped at a distance of less than 15 cm.

It is an alarming issue and is one of the major causes to prolong human wounds. Wounds examination process involves an expertise and constant follow ups to check and recommend wound details. This is a costly process and troublesome in case of bed ridden patients. Various systems like MEdical Digital PHOtogrammetric System (MEDPHOS), Measurement of Area and Volume Instrument System (MAVIS) have been developed for wound assessment. The systems suffer from high cost and maintenance. Moreover, these also need an expertise to perform assessment. As smart phones have become the part and parcel of our lives, this project attempts to make use of Smart phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analyzing images of chronic foot ulcers. In this paper, we have developed an android based smartphone based solution involving the patients or hospital nurses actively. Additionally, we have also developed an online 'Experts review' system which would send the image analysis notifications to the user. The proposed system consist of an android-based PC application. The user captures the image and uploads the image to the database. The image is then processed against the K-shift algorithm. The inferences like the wound status are then sent to the user and the image is also sent for expert review.

It takes the advantage of video sharing platforms like YouTube to provide live streaming to the end users free of cost. Any user can create live events via this application anywhere on the fly. This system is mainly an Android based application that can harness 3G/HSPA or 4G/LTE cellular networks and create a live streaming event on the user's personal YouTube channel. The real-time video can then be viewed from a web browser or the user can share it in other social networks. This solution, named as Drishti, builds on open source and network protocols to implement a surveillance system that successfully streams live video. Another unique feature of this system is the on-demand video surveillance, where users just need to place a smartphone in their home. With just an SMS sent to the remote smartphone, it will start live video streaming of the environment where the smartphone has been deployed. This feature enables Drishti to be efficient in unnecessary resource consumption like battery charge or Internet data usage. This on-demand video surveillance system feature has put it a level above other systems available in the online app stores. Experimental evaluations show practical resource consumption and a good quality of the streamed video.

This is largely due to the open nature of the Android framework that facilitates the incorporation of third-party applications running on top of any Android device. Inter-process communication is one of the most notable features of the Android framework as it allows the reuse of components across process boundaries. This mechanism is used as gateway to access different sensitive services in the Android framework. In the Android platform, this communication system is usually driven by a late runtime binding messaging object known as Intent. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of Android Intents (explicit and implicit) as a distinguishing feature for identifying malicious applications. We show that Intents are semantically rich features that are able to encode the intentions of malware when compared to other well-studied features such as permissions. We also argue that this type of feature is not the ultimate solution. It should be used in conjunction with other known features. We conducted experiments using a dataset containing 7406 applications that comprise 1846 clean and 5560 infected applications.

To provide users additional information about applications, this study proposes a blockchainbased reputation service for Android applications. The proposed reputation service provides a scheme to integrate reputation information about an application, such as comments, reviews, security analysis results and so on, around the world with tree structures. Therefore, people can send requests to perform query and update operations provided by the reputation service on the so called reputation information trees. Moreover, the proposed service adopts the blockchain technology used in the Bitcoin. Therefore, the service can be provided based on resources of application users and other volunteers. Consequently, we can prevent reputation information provided by the service from being controlled by a single party. Moreover, this study proposes a flexible means for application developers or marketplace providers to embed reputation information into applications to reduce the costs of obtaining the basic reputation information from the reputation service. Users can obtain reputation of applications from the application files directly and query advanced information from the reputation service on demand.

Purpose: To validate the threshold version (hearTest) of the validated hearScreen™ smartphone-based application using inexpensive smartphones (Android operating system) and calibrated supra-aural headphones. Research Design: A repeated measures within-participant study design was employed to compare airconduction thresholds (0.5-8 kHz) obtained through automated smartphone audiometry to thresholds obtained through conventional audiometry. Study Sample: A total of 95 participants were included in the study. Of these, 30 were adults, who had known bilateral hearing losses of varying degrees (mean age = 59 yr, standard deviation [SD] = 21.8; 56.7% female), and 65 were adolescents (mean age=16.5 yr, SD=1.2; 70.8% female), of which 61 had normal hearing and the remaining 4 had mild hearing losses. Data Analysis: Threshold comparisons were made between the two test procedures. The Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was used for comparison of threshold correspondence between manual and smartphone thresholds and the paired samples t test was used to compare test time. Results: Within the adult sample, 94.4% of thresholds obtained through smartphone and conventional audiometry corresponded within 10 dB or less. There was no significant difference between smartphone (6.75-min average, SD = 1.5) and conventional audiometry test duration (6.65-min average, SD = 2.5).

Second, we show different SDR protocols on the smartphone can concurrently run through a shared RF to serve multi-Tasked applications on it as might happen in diversified IoT environments. For proof-of-concept, we implement a prototype architecture that has all the SDR logic and supporting middleware on an Android smartphone which uses a USRP as the simple RF-end. Finally, we demonstrate that IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.15.4 SDRs on a smartphone, respectively, communicate with a ZigBee sensor mote, a ZigBee smart lightbulb, and a commercial Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) device, concurrently. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","IEEE 802.11p; IEEE 802.15.4; implementation; Internet-of-Things (IoT); smartphone; software-defined radio (SDR)","Analog circuits; Middleware; Radio; Radio receivers; Sensor nodes; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software radio; Standards; Zigbee; IEEE 802.11p; IEEE 802.15.4; implementation; Internet of Things (IOT); Software-defined radios; Internet of things",2-s2.0-85012255073

To this aim, information hiding is becoming one of the preferred approaches, especially to ex Itrate data. However, for the case of smartphones, covert communications are primarily used to bypass the security framework of the device. The most relevant case is when two colluding applications"" cooperate to elude the security policies enforced by the underlying OS. Unfortunately, detecting this type of malware is a challenging task as well as a poorly generalizable process. In this paper, we propose a method for the detection of malware exploiting colluding applications. In more details, we analyze the correlation of processes to spot the unknown pair covertly exchanging information.

However, in addition to the role that technology plays in the development of the infrastructure in our cities, it is also being used ‘as a means of control’. This view of technology as a disciplinary tool that restructures space, time and the relations among activities has been promoted by scholars who have shown that technology is also a means of saturating and sustaining contemporary capitalist societies and deepening inequalities. However, the situation is far more complex than that. Technology is not only used top-down but also bottom-up, with individuals using technological devices to share and enhance their visibility in space. This bidirectional paradigm – of vertical surveillance and horizontal sharing – contributes to a sense of ‘being exposed’ in public space that normalises practices of sharing personal data by individuals and thus results in diminished privacy. This argument is supported by an experiment conducted on smartphone users that includes personal interviews and the use of a smartphone Android application that combines online tracking with experience sampling. The findings show a convergence between the online and offline worlds (a ‘public’ situation in the offline world is also considered as such in the online world), which is a condition that contributes to the normalisation of ‘asymmetrical visibility’. Based on these results, the paper ends with a discussion of the contemporary meaning of public space. © 2016, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.","control; ICTs; public space; smartphone; visibility","asymmetry; control system; information and communication technology; infrastructural development; mobile phone; public space; questionnaire survey; software; technological development; urban area; visibility; World Wide Web",2-s2.0-85012024044

EMA studies, particularly those of longer duration, are complex and require an infrastructure to support the data flow and monitoring of EMA completion. Objective: Our objective is to provide a practical guide to developing and implementing an EMA study, with a focus on the methods and logistics of conducting such a study. Methods: The EMPOWER study was a 12-month study that used EMA to examine the triggers of lapses and relapse following intentional weight loss. We report on several studies that informed the implementation of the EMPOWER study: (1) a series of pilot studies, (2) the EMPOWER study's infrastructure, (3) training of study participants in use of smartphones and the EMA protocol and, (4) strategies used to enhance adherence to completing EMA surveys. Results: The study enrolled 151 adults and had 87.4% (132/151) retention rate at 12 months. Our learning experiences in the development of the infrastructure to support EMA assessments for the 12-month study spanned several topic areas. Included were the optimal frequency of EMA prompts to maximize data collection without overburdening participants; the timing and scheduling of EMA prompts; technological lessons to support a longitudinal study, such as proper communication between the Android smartphone, the Web server, and the database server; and use of a phone that provided access to the system's functionality for EMA data collection to avoid loss of data and minimize the impact of loss of network connectivity. These were especially important in a 1-year study with participants who might travel. It also protected the data collection from any server-side failure. Regular monitoring of participants' response to EMA prompts was critical, so we built in incentives to enhance completion of EMA surveys. During the first 6 months of the 12-month study interval, adherence to completing EMA surveys was high, with 88.3% (66,978/75,888) completion of random assessments and around 90% (23,411/25,929 and 23,343/26,010) completion of time-contingent assessments, despite the duration of EMA data collection and challenges with implementation. Conclusions: This work informed us of the necessary preliminary steps to plan and prepare a longitudinal study using smartphone technology and the critical elements to ensure participant engagement in the potentially burdensome protocol, which spanned 12 months. While this was a technology-supported and -programmed study, it required close oversight to ensure all elements were functioning correctly, particularly once human participants became involved.","Adherence; Eating behavior; Ecological momentary assessment; Obesity; Relapse; Smartphone","adult; behavioral research; ecological momentary assessment; female; human; male; procedures; smartphone; weight loss program; Adult; Behavioral Research; Ecological Momentary Assessment; Female; Humans; Male; Smartphone; Weight Reduction Programs",2-s2.0-85016393081

One consequence of this popularity is that the app markets are also becoming populated with spam apps. These spam apps reduce the users' quality of experience and increase the workload of app market operators to identify these apps and remove them. Spam apps can come in many forms such as apps not having a specific functionality, those having unrelated app descriptions or unrelated keywords, or similar apps being made available several times and across diverse categories. Market operators maintain antispam policies and apps are removed through continuous monitoring. Through a systematic crawl of a popular app market and by identifying apps that were removed over a period of time, we propose a method to detect spam apps solely using app metadata available at the time of publication. We first propose a methodology to manually label a sample of removed apps, according to a set of checkpoint heuristics that reveal the reasons behind removal. This analysis suggests that approximately 35% ofthe apps being removed are very likely tobe spam apps. We then map the identified heuristics to several quantifiable features and show how distinguishing these features are for spam apps. We build an Adaptive Boost classifier for early identification of spam apps using only the metadata of the apps. Our classifier achieves an accuracy of over 95% with precision varying between 85% and 95% and recall varying between 38% and 98%. We further show that a limited number of features, in the range of 10-30, generated from app metadata is sufficient to achieve a satisfactory level of performance. On a set of 180,627 apps that were present at the app market during our crawl, our classifier predicts 2.7% of the apps as potential spam. Finally, we perform additional manual verification and show that human reviewers agree with 82% of our classifier predictions. © 2017 ACM.","Android; Mobile apps; Spam; Spam apps","Heuristic methods; Metadata; Quality of service; Smartphones; Android; Anti-spam; Continuous monitoring; Market operators; Mobile apps; Quality of experience (QoE); Spam; Commerce",2-s2.0-85017168765

This manuscript reports on the use of an Android-based smartphone application (AccWalker app) to capture changes in neuromotor functioning after blast exposure. Active duty U.S. Navy personnel (N = 59) performed a stepping-in-place task before repetitive LLB exposure (heavy weapons training), and again immediately after, 24 hours after, and 72 to 96 hours after the completion of the training. The AccWalker app revealed that there are changes in neuromotor functioning after LLB exposure (slower self-selected movement pace and increased stride time variability) in participants who experienced neurocognitive decline.

Specifically, by leveraging recent advances in graphlet sampling, the proposed method fully captures the invocator-invocatee relationship at local neighborhoods in an FCG without exponentially inflating the state space. Using real benign app and malware samples, we demonstrate that our method, ACTS (App topologiCal signature through graphleT Sampling), can detect malware and identify malware families robustly and efficiently. More importantly, we demonstrate that, without augmenting the FCG with any semantic features such as bytecode-based vertex typing, local topological information captured by ACTS alone can achieve a high malware detection accuracy. Since ACTS only uses structural features, which are orthogonal to semantic features, it is expected that combining them would give a greater improvement in malware detection accuracy than combining non-orthogonal semantic features. © 2016 IEEE.","Android; graphlet sampling; mobile applications; mobile malware; smartphone","Computer crime; Feature extraction; Malware; Network security; Semantics; Smartphones; Topology; Android; Distributed environments; Distributed systems; Function-call graphs; Local neighborhoods; Mobile applications; Mobile malware; Topological information; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85016041976

Only a reduced electronics with very low power consumption is required for the reading of the optical responses and data transmission to a remote user. An application for the Android operating system has been developed for the power supplying and data reception from the tag. The responses of the sensors have been calibrated and fitted to simple functions, allowing a fast prediction of the gases concentration.

To measure water salinity level using the smartphone, two different approaches have been proposed and their sensing performances have been compared. The first approach is based on Beer-Lambert principle where collimated light beam from an optical source while passing through the medium gets attenuated due to absorption by the medium which can be detected and analyzed by the smartphone. The second approach is based on evanescent field absorption from an uncladed U-bent sensing region of an optical fiber. Variation in salinity level of the surrounding medium of the fiber sensing region affects the absorption of evanescent field and this can be monitored by the smartphone. Two freely available android applications have been used for detection and analysis of salinity level. The designed smartphone sensor has an ability to measure salinity level variation as low as 0.1 parts per thousand (ppt) with high accuracy and repeatability.

Two smartphone applications (apps) professing to avoid the supine position (SP) are available: for Android the “Apnea Sleep Position Trainer” and for iOS the “SomnoPose—Sleep Position Monitor”. The smartphone needs to be attached to the chest to recognize SP, which then triggers a vibration alarm. This is intended to encourage the patient to change position and the vibration stops as soon as SP is left. These apps, however, have not yet undergone a systematic evaluation. Methods: Adult patients with polysomnographically diagnosed POSA were invited to participate in the study. POSA was defined as an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) in SP >10, with AHI in a lateral position <10 and doubling of the AHI in SP. After 1 month, a control polysomnography (PSG) was performed and compliance (at least 4 h/night on 5 of 7 days) was evaluated after 6 months by phone. A sufficient therapy was defined as reduction in SP to <10% of the total sleep time and to an overall AHI <10. Results: Although 57 patients entered the study, 24 did not appear to the PSG control; therefore, 33 patients finished the study, of whom 25 were treated successfully. The overall AHI in 33 patients was reduced from 14.5 ± 9.0 to 9.5 ± 12.6 and the time in SP decreased significantly from 71.1 ± 50.5 to 25.4 ± 65.0 min.

However, this method needs to perform a sampling process in order to collect the received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) of the APs from the places of interest to build the building’s WiFi radio fingerprint database in advance. It also needs to resample frequently in order to keep the fingerprint database updated and accurate. Both tasks are time-consuming, therefore we propose a quick radio fingerprint collection (QRFC) algorithm for collecting the sampling information. The Android smartphone and its built-in motion sensors were used to help the collection process. QRFC makes the sampling process simpler, and the time needed for the sampling is close to the time of walking slowly through the path. We also propose a heuristic AP RSSI shaping algorithm to compensate for the signal attenuation caused by multi-path, shadowing, and mask effects. Several field tests were performed to compare the QRFC method to the traditional method. Experiments show that there is no significant difference in their accuracy, but QRFC takes much less time to complete. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Indoor Positioning System (IPS); Radio fingerprint; Smartphone; WiFi","Indoor positioning systems; Mobile computing; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Wi-Fi; Android smartphone; Fingerprint database; Positioning accuracy; Radio fingerprints; Received signal strength indicators; Sampling information; Signal attenuation; Wi-fi access points; Wireless local area networks (WLAN)",2-s2.0-85013500979

However, the answers to many such secret questions can be easily guessed by an acquaintance or exposed to a stranger that has access to public online tools (e.g., online social networks); moreover, a user may forget her/his answers long after creating the secret questions. Today's prevalence of smartphones has granted us new opportunities to observe and understand how the personal data collected by smartphone sensors and apps can help create personalized secret questions without violating the users' privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a Secret-Question based Authentication system, called 'Secret-QA', that creates a set of secret questions on basic of people's smartphone usage.

In this paper, we present an Energy-Aware Download Method (EDM) based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to optimize the data download energy for mobile applications. Unlike the previous download schemes in literature that focus on the energy efficiency by simply delaying the download requests, which often leads to a poor user experience, our MDP model learns off-line from a set of training download workloads for different user patterns. The model is then integrated into the mobile application to deal the download request at runtime, taking into account the current battery level, LTE reference signal receiving power (RSRP), reference signal signal to noise radio (RSSNR) and task size as input of the decision process, and maximizes the reward which refers to the expected battery life and user experience. We evaluate how the EDM can be used in the context of a real file downloading application over the LTE network. We obtain, on average, 20.3%, 15% and 45% improvement respectively for energy consumption, latency, and performance of energy-delay trade off, when compared to the Android default download policy (Minimum Delay). © 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","Download method; Energy-Aware; LTE; Mdp; Mobile devices","Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Markov processes; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless telecommunication systems; Battery lifetime; Download method; Energy aware; Energy-delay trade-off; File downloading; Markov Decision Processes; Mobile applications; Reference signals; Power management",2-s2.0-85011994040

Methods: Following Creighton University IRB approval, a voluntary and anonymous paper-based, 15-question survey was distributed to third-year medical students. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Results: Of 112 medical students available, 76.7% (86) participated in the survey. All participants owned a smartphone or tablet with 84.9% using Apple iOS, followed by 12.8% using Android platform. Students reported using the fewest number of apps during surgery, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology clerkships. The largest number of apps were used during the internal medicine rotation (70.3%). The three most popular apps were Epocrates, UpToDate, and UWorld. The most common uses for these apps were as references during the clerkship, followed by improving knowledge, and test taking. Perceived major benefits included accessibility (96% of student respondents) and interactivity (39.5%). Common apps used during the psychiatry clerkship included UpToDate (71%), Epocrates (51%), and Medscape (43%). Despite less frequent app use during their psychiatry clerkship, 90% felt there was a utility for educational apps in psychiatric education. Conclusions: Consistent with the previous literature on medical students preferring educational apps, students suggest developers focus on question bank-type apps, followed by clinical support-focused and self-directed case-based learning apps for psychiatry clerkship learning. Educators should factor these modes of educational delivery into future educational app development. This survey shows a high degree of smartphone and tablet use among medical students, and they attest to mobile phone app utility in psychiatric education. © 2016 Academic Psychiatry.","Applications; Apps; Education; Innovation; Mobile phone; Psychiatry","apple; gynecology; human; internal medicine; learning; major clinical study; medical student; nonhuman; obstetrics; psychiatry; rotation; smartphone; surgery; tablet; university; education; medical education; medical student; mobile application; psychiatry; psychology; questionnaire; smartphone; utilization; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Internal Medicine; Mobile Applications; Psychiatry; Smartphone; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85009949362

However, I was still surprised to hear a familiar scratching sound emanating from behind my desk late last year. This was because 12 months previously my unusually diligent landlord and I searched for every mouse-size gap in my newly renovated apartment and blocked them all with either metal plates or steel wool.. I put down poison and traps, but they were ignored. I started an increasingly frustrated search for the mouse's entry point, until my suspicions fell on the gap between the bottom of our apartment's front door and the sill. It looked just large enough for a small mouse to squeeze under, but I wasn't sure. So, naturally, I set about building my own indoor wildlife camera system to catch the pest in the act of entering.. I could have tried hooking up our Nest Wi-Fienabled security camera, and set it for night vision and motion detection, but the Nest is really designed for monitoring rooms, not small areas like my doorsill. I also wondered if I could achieve my goals without sending a stream of live video from my home to some unknown data center.. Fortunately, I'd spotted what promised to be the ideal solution during the 2016 World Maker Faire in New York City last October.

Fortunately, most capabilities of a discarded smartphone remain unharmed even after considerable damages, which make them ideal for reuse. In this study we demonstrate the reusability of these capabilities on micro aerial vehicles. Quadcopter is a micro aerial vehicle which has requirements such as sensor inputs, processing power, communication infrastructure and camera capabilities which the today's smartphone can accomplish independently. We focused on evaluating the possibility of reusing discarded smartphones to meet the requirements of quadcopters. Compared to traditional approaches of building quadcopters, reusing discarded devices has many advantages; low price, better performance, connectivity options and programming interfaces, etc. A statistical comparison was conducted to evaluate whether the remaining capabilities of a discarded smartphone are sufficient enough to meet the requirements of a quadcopter. The outcomes depicted that 87.5% of the features in smartphones correspond to those of quadcopters.

With these sensory data, it is desired to provide various kinds of applications to serve the user. In this research, we aim at developing an indoor navigation system on smartphone using solely smartphone sensory data. There are many researches on indoor localization and navigation in the literature. Nevertheless, environmental sensors and/or wearable sensors are usually needed. This can be costly and inconvenient. In this paper, we propose a smartphone indoor localization system using only accelerometer and gyroscope data from the smartphone. The Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) approach is used to build this system. The PDR approach is simple and efficient though seems traditional. The major weakness of the PDR is that the estimation error would accumulate over time. Thus we propose to add so-called calibration marks which look like short arrows and are placed on both the floor plan and the ground. To use the system, the user first finds a calibration mark on the ground, stands on it and faces the right direction. He/she then moves the android icon (representing the user) on top of the calibration mark on the floor plan on the smartphone. When the user starts to move, the android icon also moves on the floor plan following the real-time estimation of step length and moving direction change for each step from accelerometer and gyroscope data. This is a prototype of an indoor navigation system that can become fully functional after an optimal path planning module is included. Experimental results of estimated walking trace tests show high accuracy. The system is promising and useful as long as a floor plan and calibration marks are built in advance. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Ambient intelligence; Indoor localization; Pedestrian dead reckoning; Smartphone applications",,2-s2.0-85009818560

One report stated that the most important issue of smartphones was its power consumption. Android has a function with which an application can be invoked in screen-off state without user's operation. Some applications frequently work in screen-off state, heavily and consume battery. For saving power consumption in the state, accurate estimation of power consumption of each application is important. However, estimating power consumption cannot be easily achieved because of its dependency on device. That is, application's power consumption varies on installed application and type of hardware module in the device, which can be called software and hardware dependency, respectively. In this paper, we discuss estimation of power consumption in screen-off state considering software dependency. First, we explain software dependency of power consumption. Second, we propose a method, which takes account of software dependency, for estimating power consumption due to GPS. The proposed method monitors GPS utilization individually. Third, we evaluate our method with a benchmark and practical applications using GPS.

Such popularity has come hand-in-hand with an equivalent increase in malware targeting Android. Since mobile devices allow easy-to-use, touch-sensitive, and anywhere-anytime access to its resources, the mobile-specific applications like SMS, MMS, Bluetooth, e-mail, and other services may pose serious threats and lead to financial losses and privacy leakages. In recent time, high attention is drawn by the researchers for detecting Android malware; very fewer community have considered network traffic analysis in their detection models. The majority of these models have considered the detection primarily on traffic features that distinguish malware traffic from normal traffic. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm to prioritize network traffic features with an aim to minimize the number of features to be analyzed to give high detection accuracy along with reduced training and testing time. To this extent, we have used statistical tests to rank the features. Results demonstrate that using prioritized features for detection not only reduces the training and testing time, but also gives slightly higher detection accuracy than using all the features together by measuring Fmeasure, a widely used measure for detection accuracy. The training time of 300 applications is reduced from 11.7 seconds to 5.8 seconds and testing time of 230 applications is reduced from 25.1 seconds to 17.3 seconds, hence reduction of around 50% and 31% in training time and testing time respectively.

Pollutants such as fluoride in groundwater may be present in much higher concentration than the permissible limit. Fluoride does not give any visible coloration to water, and hence, no effort is made to remove or reduce the concentration of this chemical present in drinking water. This may lead to a serious health hazard for those people taking groundwater as their primary source of drinking water. Sophisticated laboratory grade tools such as ion selective electrodes (ISE) and portable spectrophotometers are commercially available for in-field detection of fluoride level in drinking water. However, such tools are generally expensive and require expertise to handle. In this paper, we demonstrate the working of a low cost, robust, and field portable smartphone platform fluoride sensor that can detect and analyze fluoride concentration level in drinking water. For development of the proposed sensor, we utilize the ambient light sensor (ALS) of the smartphone as light intensity detector and its LED flash light as an optical source. An android application ""FSense"" has been developed which can detect and analyze the fluoride concentration level in water samples. The custom developed application can be used for sharing of in-field sensing data from any remote location to the central water quality monitoring station.

Smartphone apps often use phone sensors to probe their users’ physical environmental conditions to provide services. However, sensing operations can be energy-consumptive, and thus the obtained sensory data should be effectively utilized by apps for their users’ benefits. Existing studies disclosed that many real-world smartphone apps have poor utilization of sensory data, and this causes serious energy waste. To diagnose such energy bugs, a recent technique GreenDroid automatically generates sensory data, tracks their propagation and analyzes their utilization in an app. However, we observe that GreenDroid’s sensory data generation is random and this can negatively affect its stability and effectiveness. Our study reported that GreenDroid might miss energy bugs that require specific sensory data to manifest. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to systematically generating multi-dimensional sensory data. For effective diagnosis, we also propose to consider app state changes at a finer granularity. We implemented our approach as a prototype tool CyanDroid, and evaluated it using four real-world Android apps and hundreds of their mutants. Our results confirmed that CyanDroid is more stable and effective in energy inefficiency diagnosis for sensory data underutilization issues. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","dynamic tainting; energy inefficiency; sensory data utilization; smartphone; white-box sampling","Signal encoding; Smartphones; Dynamic tainting; Effective energy; energy inefficiency; Environmental conditions; Multi dimensional; Sensory data; Smartphone apps; White box; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84996508775

To manage the application’s compatibility with one or more platform versions, Android allows apps to declare the supported platform SDK versions in their manifest files. In this paper, we make a first effort to study this modern software mechanism. Our objective is to measure the current practice of the declared SDK versions (which we term as DSDK versions afterwards) in real apps, and the consistency between the DSDK versions and their app API calls. To this end, we perform a three-dimensional analysis. First, we parse Android documents to obtain a mapping between each API and their corresponding platform versions. We then analyze the DSDK-API consistency for over 24K apps, among which we pre-exclude 1.3K apps that provide different app binaries for different Android versions through Google Play analysis. Besides shedding light on the current DSDK practice, our study quantitatively measures the two side effects of inappropriate DSDK versions: (i) around 1.8K apps have API calls that do not exist in some declared SDK versions, which causes runtime crash bugs on those platform versions; (ii) over 400 apps, due to claiming the outdated targeted DSDK versions, are potentially exploitable by remote code execution. These results indicate the importance and difficulty of declaring correct DSDK, and our work can help developers fulfill this goal. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Android app security; Android bug detection","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Android app security; Android apps; Bug detection; Current practices; Multiple platforms; Shedding light; Software mechanisms; Three-dimensional analysis; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85026371964

This outcome is partly attributable to late diagnosis. To implement a screening program for early diagnosis, selection of high-risk individuals is essential. Our aim was to construct a personalized lung cancer risk assessment tool using geographic localization to lead the high-risk individuals to the local health care provider. METHODS: A smartphone application was created for Android and iOS mobile platforms using a risk assessment questionnaire. The software provides immediate classification into low, moderate and high-risk groups. The high-risk group is directed to the nearest screening centre based on GPS location. The complete test data set is recorded on a collection server database for further analysis. RESULTS: The application was downloaded 13 890 times and completed by 89 500 persons over a period of 20 months. The mean age of the tested users was 36.91 years (9-93 years); the majority were men living in an urban area (62.3%). The test was completed by 38 850 active smokers and 26 710 persons who reported having already quit smoking, resulting in 30 072 moderate and 10 740 high-risk users. CONCLUSIONS: This free application is an active communication tool for most smartphone owners. It helps those who might need further medical attention.

Fuzzing is a popularly used methodology to find software vulnerabilities although symbolic execution and advanced techniques are obviously promising. Unfortunately, fuzzing itself is not effective in such format-strict environments as media services. Thus, we study file format-aware fuzzing as a technical blend for finding new vulnerabilities. We present our black-box mutational fuzzing on the latest smartphone systems, Android and iOS, respectively, with manipulation of the MPEG-4 Part 14 file format and show results that affect a wide range of related systems. In our approach, we automate a seed file selection process to crawl a crowd-sourcing public website and validate arbitrary m4a/mp4 audio files according to the FOURCC atom list we gained through white-box analysis in Android. We acquired eight seed files covering all effective atoms in 2,600 s. We then performed size field mutation in a little amount and generated 1,102 test cases common to both systems. During six CPU hours of fuzzing, we identified three crash atoms in iOS 9.3.5 and 15 in Android 6.0.1, respectively. Due to formatawareness, we were able to easily locate crash points through a mutation table. It was discovered that the new crash atoms found in iOS allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by memory corruption in iOS and also OS X, tvOS and watchOS. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.","Format awareness; Media server; Mutational fuzzing","Android (operating system); Atoms; Denial-of-service attack; iOS (operating system); Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Smartphones; Denial of Service; Format awareness; Media servers; Memory corruption; Mutational fuzzing; Related systems; Software vulnerabilities; Symbolic execution; Mobile security",2-s2.0-85019683365

Methods: A store-and-forward telemedicine platform “Remote-I” was developed to assist in the screening of oral diseases using an image acquisition Android app operated by 17 teledental assistants. A total of 485 images (five images per case) were directly transmitted from the Android app to the server. A panel of five dental practitioners (graders) assessed the images and reported their diagnosis. A user acceptance survey was sent to the graders and smartphone users following completion of the screening program. Results: Of the 22 surveys sent out, 20 (91%) were completed. Generally, users showed optimism towards the use of the teledentistry system, and strongly positively assessed items on content and service quality. The majority of graders took less than 15 min to read the images while phone users took 5–10 min to complete the dental photography using the Android app. This study identified a number of factors that are essential for improving the current system, such as optimization of smartphone camera features, the format of the server, and the orientation of images and using oral retractors during photography.

In this paper, we present a cost-effective driver nighttime assistance system (DNAS), which runs on Android smartphones. In DNAS, smartphones are placed on the rear windshield, for periodically capturing road condition by the camera sensor, and warning the drivers of dangerous speeding or tailgating event. To achieve this function, firstly, DNAS uses the bright vehicle headlights and their dimension to determine the following vehicles from the captured images. Then, it analyses their temporal and spatial characteristics in the successive frames. Finally it works out the safetycritical events to send out warning sounds.We evaluate the effectiveness of DNAS based on two different real driving routes. The results show that DNAS, on average, is able to detect speeding and tailgating with an accuracy of 87.7% and 83.3% recall, respectively.

The mobility of BCI systems involves two aspects: making the electroencephalography (EEG) recording devices portable, and developing software applications with low computational complexity to be able to run on low computational-power devices such as tablets and smartphones. This paper addresses the development of MindEdit; a P300-based text editor for Android-based devices. Given the limited resources of mobile devices and their limited computational power, a novel ensemble classifier is utilized that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features to identify P300 evoked potentials from EEG recordings. PCA computations in the proposed method are channel-based as opposed to concatenating all channels as in traditional feature extraction methods; thus, this method has less computational complexity compared to traditional P300 detection methods. The performance of the method is demonstrated on data recorded from MindEdit on an Android tablet using the Emotiv wireless neuroheadset. Results demonstrate the capability of the introduced PCA ensemble classifier to classify P300 data with maximum average accuracy of 78.37±16.09% for cross-validation data and 77.5±19.69% for online test data using only 10 trials per symbol and a 33-character training dataset. Our analysis indicates that the introduced method outperforms traditional feature extraction methods. For a faster operation of MindEdit, a variable number of trials scheme is introduced that resulted in an online average accuracy of 64.17±19.6% and a maximum bitrate of 6.25 bit/min.

The mass production of the smartphones makes the price cheaper, and the using of smartphones is popular. Not only the young people, but also the elderly have begun to use the smart phones and the Cellular network. The office workers use the smartphones and the internet to finish their work, and the elderly use the phones and the internet for convenient life and the connection of their friends and family. More and more elderly want to learn how to use their smartphones and internet. The course in smartphones using becomes more popular in the senior citizens academy. In this study, we found that the elderly use the smartphones more easily than use the computer. On one hand, the computer using is in home, when the elderly find some problems, they cannot get help immediately. When they have some questions in using smartphones, they will get help easily because they carry the phones with them and they can get help from somebody around them. On the other, the operation of phones is easy than the computer. The using of the smartphones is by fingers, the operating of the computer is by the mouse. To be familiar with the use of the mouse is difficult for the elderly. We also found that the key point of teaching elderly to use the smartphones is how to use, not how to set their phones. For example, it is important to teach them to use the Facebook by their phones, and it is not very important to teach them how to download the Facebook APP from the Google Play. It is different between teaching the computer using and the smartphone using. When the elderly come to the academy, the teacher tells them how to read the web, to listen the music, to watch the video by the computer step by step. There are some standard operation processes in using the computer. Now we have to tell them how to use their phone, there are twenty to thirty elderly in one class and they use different brands of the smartphones. The teacher needs to be more patient and teach them one by one. There are two analysis conclusions in this case study. First, the key point of teaching the smartphones using is the using of the phone or APP, not the phone setting. The phone using is easier than the computer using, but it is still difficult for the elderly to set the user mode or the APP setting on their phones. We suggest that the family or the teacher set up the phone for them to avoid the low learning motivation cause by the difficult setting learning. Second, we use more individual instruction to replace the group teaching. Our teach content is the using of the Android cellphone. But each participant owns the different brand of the phone. There are slightly differences of the operation between their phones. The group teaching is not the most suitable teaching method. For example, we would teach them how to use the Facebook on their phones by the group teaching, when we teach them how to set their cellphone to take pictures, the individual instruction is more suitable. We also found an interesting phenomenon in the teaching. When the elderly people are familiar with the phones using and they often use the instant messaging software on the phone. They used to share a lot of messages on the instant messaging software just as health, philosophy of life, etc. But they don’t used to check that the information is true or false. They often share the wrong message on their Facebook or LINE (an instant message software, it is like What’s APP) because they don’t know the message is wrong. The teacher has to tell them how to distinguish between true and false messages. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Cellphone; Elderly; Elderly learning; Smartphone","Application programs; Computer software; E-learning; Education; Human computer interaction; Mammals; Message passing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Office buildings; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Telephone sets; Wireless networks; Cell phone; Cellular network; Elderly; Elderly learning; Elderly populations; Instant messaging; Learning motivation; Operation process; Teaching",2-s2.0-85025144700

Traditionally a memory notebook has been recommended as a compensatory memory aid. Electronic devices have the advantage of providing a cue at the appropriate time to remind participants to refer to the memory aid and complete tasks. Research suggests these have potential benefit in neurorehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a memory notebook and specifically a smartphone as a compensatory memory aid. METHODS: A single case series design was used to assess seven participants. A no-intervention baseline was followed by training and intervention with either the smartphone alone, or a memory notebook and later the smartphone. Memory was assessed with weekly assigned memory tasks. RESULTS: Participants using a smartphone showed improvements in their ability to complete assigned memory tasks accurately and within the assigned time periods. Use of a smartphone provided additional benefits over and above those already seen for those who received a memory notebook first.

This process of integrating apps among multiple platforms essentially removes the gap between them. Current, state of the art, mobile phone-based two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanisms, however, heavily rely on the existence of such separation. They are used in a variety of segments (such as consumer online banking services or enterprise secure remote access) to protect against malware. For example, with 2FA in place, attackers should no longer be able to use their PC-based malware to instantiate fraudulent banking transactions. In this paper, we analyze the security implications of diminishing gaps between platforms and show that the ongoing integration and desire for increased usability results in violation of key principles for mobile phone 2FA. As a result, we identify a new class of vulnerabilities dubbed 2FA synchronization vulnerabilities. To support our findings, we present practical attacks against Android and iOS that illustrate how a Man-in-the-Browser attack can be elevated to intercept One-Time Passwords sent to the mobile phone and thus bypass the chain of 2FA mechanisms as used by many financial services. © International Financial Cryptography Association 2017.","Anywhere computing; Financial trojans; Smartphone security; Synchronization; Two-factor authentication","Authentication; Cellular telephones; Computer crime; Cryptography; Finance; Malware; Mobile phones; Mobile security; Smartphones; Synchronization; Telephone sets; Anywhere computing; Multiple platforms; Secure remote access; Security implications; Smartphone securities; Synchronization vulnerabilities; Trojans; Two factor authentication; Cellular telephone systems",2-s2.0-85019710372

Data acquisition can be costly, difficult to acquire, and the data often notoriously unreliable. An interesting option for the collection of individual health (or indicators of individual health) data is the personal smartphone. Smartphones are ubiquitous, and the required infrastructure is well-developed across Canada, including many remote areas. Researchers and health professionals are asking themselves how they might exploit increasing smartphone uptake for the purposes of data collection, hopefully leading to improved individual and public health. A novel smartphone-based epidemiological data collection and analysis system has been developed by faculty and students from the CEPHIL (Computational Epidemiology and Public Health Informatics) Lab in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan. A pilot feasibility study was then designed to examine possible relationships between smartphone sensor data, surveys and individual clinical data within a population of pregnant women. The study focused on the development of Gestational Diabetes (GDM), a transient condition during pregnancy, but with serious potential post-birth complications for both mother and child. The researchers questioned whether real-time smartphone data could improve the clinical management and outcomes of women at risk for developing GDM, enabling earlier treatment. The initial results from this small study did not show improved prediction of GDM, but did demonstrate that real-time individual health and sensor data may be readily collected and analyzed efficiently while maintaining confidentiality.

This work’s objective is the development of a mobile application with real-time processing to topographical survey that helps the coffee producer and other farmers register the geographical location and calculate the area and perimeter of a region delimited on the terrain. The application, called Calc-Geo, was developed for the Android platform and interfaces the smartphone’s GNSS receivers. The information quality generated by Calc-Geo was tested in two experiments. First, the Calc-Geo was used to capture geographic coordinates of a geodesic landmark in the Espírito Santo state in order to determine the GNSS receivers positional accuracy. Later, the Calc-Geo was employed in the altimetry-plane survey of a coffee crop field. The area and the perimeter of this crop were compared with a total station surveying results. The discrepancies analysis showed that, on average, there is a positional deviation of 1.17 m and a difference smaller than 1% in the crop perimeter and area values. This application is an attractive alternative technology, because the farmer would not need to acquire specific GPS receivers for data collecting and then perform the processing. Among other features, the Calc-Geo allows field registering, determines distance between two geographical points and sends collected data by mobile phone with intent of integration with other technologies. © 2017, Editora UFLA.

A variety of mobile applications have appeared for different purposes. Nowadays mobile phone users have available several mobile applications to request help during a robbery, most are triggered by buttons, also known as panic buttons. These applications are effective if they are launched in a timely manner, but criminals often surprise victims. In crisis moments is almost impossible for victims to press a panic button, since most of the times, smartphones are blocked with a password, wasting vital time in unblocking it to ask for help, in addition to the fact that the thief can see this action. This paper presents a mobile solution to send emergency messages when a passerby is being assaulted. Our proposed solution was implemented on an Android application, which is designed to activate and send a message when a person in a dangerous situation, slightly shakes the smartphone. The algorithm recognize the shaking as an assault signal and sends an emergency message to contacts and friends. This message contains geolocation data. The application was tested many times and messages were received in the users’ smartphones.

As a matter of fact, these devices store a plethora of information related to our every-day life, from the contact list, the received email, and also our position during the day (using not only the GPS chipset that can be disabled but only the Wi-Fi/mobile connection it is possible to discover the device geolocalization). This is the reason why mobile attackers are producing a large number of malicious applications targeting Android (that is the most diffused mobile operating system), often by modifying existing applications, which results in malware being organized in families, where each application belonging to the same family exhibit the same malicious behaviour. These behaviours are typically information gathering related, for instance a very widespread malicious behaviour in mobile is represented by sending personal information (as examples: the contact list, the received and send SMSs, the browser history) to a remote server managed by the attackers. In this paper, we investigate whether deep learning algorithms are able to discriminate between malicious and legitimate Android samples. To this end, we designed a method based on convolutional neural network applied to syscalls occurrences through dynamic analysis.

Study and Design: After a review of existing apps was conducted to determine whether an app of clinical recommendations for family planning existed, a team of clinicians, training specialists, and app developers created a resource app by fi rst drafting a comprehensive content map. A prototype of the app was then pilot tested using smart tablets by a volunteer convenience sample of women's healthcare professionals. Outcomes measured included usability, acceptability, download analytics, and satisfaction by clinicians as reported through an investigator developed tool. Results: Sixty-nine professionals tested a prototype of the app, and completed a user satisfaction tool. Overall, user feedback was positive, and a zoom function was added to the fi nal version as a result of the pilot test. Within 3 months of being publicly available, the app was downloaded 677 times, with 97% of downloads occurring on smart phones, 76% downloads occurring on iOS devices, and 24% on Android devices. This trend persisted throughout the following 3 months. Clinical Implications: Clinicians with an interest in developing an app should consider a team approach to development, pilot test the app prior to wider distribution, and develop a web-based version of the app to be used by clinicians who are unable to access smart devices in their practice setting. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The necessary inconvenient body training movements, the return trips to the hospital and repetitive boring training using functional electrical stimulation (FES) often results in the patient suspending their training. The patient's drop foot rehabilitation will not progress if training is suspended. OBJECTIVE: A fast spread, highly portable drop foot rehabilitation training device based on the smart phone is presented. This device is combined with a self-made football APP and feedback controlled FES. The drop foot patient can easily engage in long term rehabilitation training that is more convenient and interesting. METHODS: An interactive game is established on the smart phone with the Android system using the originally built-in wireless communications. The ankle angle information is detected by an external portable device as the game input signal. The electrical stimulation command to the external device is supplemented with FES stimulation for inadequate ankle efforts. RESULTS: After six-weeks training using six cases, the results indicated that this training device showed significant performance improvement (p < 0.05) in the patient's ankle dorsiflexion strength, ankle dorsiflexion angle, control timing and Timed Up and Go. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show that this training device provides significant positive help to drop foot patients. Moreover, this device is based on existing and universally popular mobile processing, which can be rapidly promoted. The responses of clinical cases also show this system is easy to operate, convenient and entertaining.

The quality control in some steps is made manually that supposes a high level of subjectivity, controlling the quality and its evolution using automatic systems can suppose a reduction of the losses. Testing some automatic image analysis techniques in the case of tomatoes and zucchini is the main objective of this paper. Two steps in the supply chain are considered, the feeding of the raw products into the handling chain (because low quality generates a reduction of the chain productivity) and the cool storage of the processed products (as the value at the market is reduced). It was proposed to analyze the incoming products at the head the processing line using CCD cameras to detect low quality and/or dirty products (corresponding to specific farmers/suppliers, it should be asked to improve to maintain the productivity of the line). The second stage is analyzing the evolution of the products along the cool chain (storage and transport), the use of an App developed to be use under Android was proposed to substitute the “visual” evaluation used in practice. The algorithms used, including stages of pre-treatment, segmentation, analysis and presentation of the results take account of the short time available and the limited capacity of the batteries. High performance techniques were applied to the homography stage to discard some of the images, resulting in better performance. Also threads and renderscript kernels were created to parallelize the methods used on the resulting images being able to inspect faster the products. The proposed method achieves success rates comparable to, and improving, the expert inspection. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Due to availability of many materials and techniques, clinician’s clinical decision-making regarding appropriate selection of prosthesis requires critical thinking abilities and is demanding. Especially during graduate training years, learners do not receive the exposure to a variety of cases, thus their clinical reasoning skills are not developed optimally. Therefore, using the trend of incorporating technology in education, we developed a mobile learning app for this purpose. The aim of this study was to evaluate learners’ perceptions of this app’s utility and impact on their clinical decision-making skills. Methods: After taking informed consent, interns of the Department of Prosthodontics of VSPM Dental College, Nagpur, India, during the academic year May 2015–May 2016 were sent the link for the app to be installed in their Android smartphones. Their perceptions were recorded on a feedback questionnaire using 5-point Likert scale. The script concordance test (SCT) was used to check for changes in clinical reasoning abilities. Results: Out of 120 students who were sent the link, 102 downloaded the link and 92 completed the feedback questionnaire and appeared for the SCT (response rate: 76%). The overall response to the app was positive for more than two-thirds of interns, who reported a greater confidence in their clinical decision-making around prostheses through this app and 94% of the students felt that this app should be regularly used along with conventional teaching techniques. Mean SCT scores were pretest 41.5 (±1.7) and posttest 63 (±2.4) (P < 0.005). Discussion: Clinical decision-making in prosthodontics, a mobile learning app, is an effective way to improve clinical reasoning skills for planning prosthodontic rehabilitation.

To study the efficiency of various debridement methods of the surface of trophic ulcers in the 1st phase of wound healing process. Methods. The regional treatment results of patients (n=53) with trophic ulcers (medium size) of the lower limbs against of varicose disease were analyzed. For excavation of the wound from necrotic masses, fibrin plaque, biofilm, pathological tissue and for stimulating the regeneration the surgical, autolytic, chemical and physical (cryodestruction) methods of treatments were used; the patients were divided into 4 groups according to those methods. The effectiveness of regional treatment was evaluated in 7th, 14th and 30th days taking into account the speed of wound cleaning, clinical manifestations of the ulcer regeneration process, subjective feelings of patients, the results of laboratory research methods (bacteriological, cytological analyses). For dynamic registration of the planimetric parameters of the wound defect, the mobile app+WoundDesk based on the usage of the smartphone camera (Android) were used. Results. Within surgical treatment and cryodestruction in 75% of patients already after 7 days the wounds were completely cleansed from necrotic tissues, bacterial elimination was achieved 2 fold faster in comparison with hydrogels and 1,5 fold faster - enzymes. According to clinical data the stimulation of regeneration processes and the reduction of the wound surface area most effectively took place after cryosurgery and surgical treatment. The data of cytological studies confirm a more rapid transition to the regenerative cytograms during surgical treatment, the use of hydrogels and cryotherapy. Evaluating the wound healing after 30 days the greatest reduction of the defect wound area has been achieved during surgical treatment and after cryotherapy, 19 and 21%, respectively. Conclusion. Debridement the wound from necrotic tissue, bacterial elimination, relief of local inflammatory reaction and the transition of the wound into the 2nd phase of wound process maximally quickly and effectively have occured during surgical treatment and cryodestruction.","Cryodestruction; Inflammatory reaction; Local treatment; Methods of wound cleaning; Necrotic tissue; Surgical treatment; Venous trophic ulcers",,2-s2.0-85019696225

Users can protect their sensitive data through encryption and locking screen. A pattern lock is one of the ways to lock a screen. This method is used by most users because of its ease of use and memorization. However, a pattern lock with low security level is inadequate to protect the sensitive data of the user when it encounters a brute force or other physical attack (e.g., smudge attack). Furthermore, it bypasses all of the protection measures of mobile device when users are coerced into disclosing their passwords. Steganographic techniques and deniable encryption are designed to protect the sensitive data of the user as well as secure communications and can hide sensitive data on a disk or during communication with other devices. To overcome these deficiencies that mobile devices present, we present a novel, practical safe framework called MobiMimosa that is based on plausible deniable encryption. MobiMimosa enables multiple hidden encryption volumes and dynamic mounting of hidden volumes, which facilitates the transfer of sensitive data from a normal volume to a hidden volume. Simultaneously, to meet the personalized needs of the security of the mobile device, MobiMimosa enables a strategy to be set that can trigger the uninstalling of a sensitive app and the destruction of sensitive data. MobiMimosa also greatly alleviates corruption of the cross-volume boundary that is present in previous smartphone PDE schemes.

There are so many women to use. About the user’s age, the over 40’s (21.9%) is the most. Next was the result of early 30s (20.2%) and late 20s (19.2%). The population of Japan in 2015 is 59.00% in the over 40s. On the other hand, 5.99% in the early 30s and 5.40% in the latter half of the 20s. It is thought that users increase if the population number is large. Therefore, the main target is not over 40’s, it is considered to be in the early 30’s and the latter half of 20’s. About the time when it is selling. The month with the highest sales is January which accounts for 13.4% of the total. The month with second sales is 11.1% in February, the third is 9.2% in December. Conversely, the month with the lowest sales is May and September, 5.8% of the total. The second is 6.2%, which is April. From this fact, it would be considered sell well are those in the winter season. About customer information. By prefecture, the largest number of Tokyo is 17.5%. It is about 50% of the total in the top six prefectures including that Tokyo. (Kanagawa prefecture 8.4%, Osaka prefecture 7.9%, Saitama prefecture 5.5%, Aichi prefecture 5.5%, Chiba prefecture 4.9%). This is the same ranking as the population ranking by prefecture in Japan. The largest number of registrants to the population is Tokyo. Besides, Kanagawa, Osaka and Kyoto prefectures were more than other prefectures. These four prefectures are the center of the west and east city.

For WBAN technology improvisation, researchers are mainly concentrating on technical parameters of health monitoring to make it interactive and real time based. A WBAN is an integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to connect various Biomedical Wireless Sensors (BWSs) located inside and outside of the human body to collect and transmit vital signals. The collected biomedical data is send to the hospitals and medical centres for therapeutic, diagnostic analysis and treatment. An electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive mechanism, is widely used to establish medical diagnosis of heart diseases in health care systems. This paper presents a microcontroller ARM7 based health monitoring system intended to monitor and to early detect situations when heart rate and blood oxygen level are out of their safe ranges. The main objective of this proposal is to prevent emergency situations by informing the patient to take actions before patient's health condition get worse leading to emergency medical care. This system employs a programmable ARM7 for confab the bio-signal to determine the condition of heart. If any abnormalities are discovered from patient's heart parameters, the system sends alarm to the doctor. The system ensures wireless transmission of ECG signal to the Medical Server (doctor's PC) through Bluetooth and Android platform. This endows doctor to have visual description of patient's ECG on Medical Server and if critical condition exists, system will send alert messages to the doctor on his mobile phone even if doctor is away from Medical server.

It becomes a popular sport since it does not require much space and its equipment is affordable. For beginners, they may not have a chance to get some helpful advice to learn how to control a table tennis ball. Thus, we decided to analyze user's motion data and build a model to develop an application called SwingPong detecting basic table-tennis strokes in order to provide helpful suggestion to players. SwingPong is an android application on a smartphone analyzing user's forehand and backhand strokes and providing suggestion back to the user in order to improve his or her swing. There are two main modules in the application: Module #1: storing angular acceleration and angular velocity of strokes. When a table tennis ball is hit on the racket, the angular acceleration and angular velocity of user's swing are collected using accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in smartphones. We collected the training data set from table tennis national players, Thai youth national team table tennis athletes and coaches. J48 Decision Tree was used in order to build a model of hitting classification. Module #2: providing suggestions. We applied the model from Module#1 to evaluate user's basic strokes and provide alert sound when a ball is hit. After a user hits the ball in a given time, the application analyzes the user's strokes and shows suggestions. The experimental results show that SwingPong is able to recognize strokes whether the ball is good (or in), out, or hits the net. The accuracy of classification of forehand strokes is 77.21% and the accuracy of classification of backhand strokes is 69.63%. In addition, SwingPong can provide helpful suggestions so that users can use the feedbacks to improve their swings. © 2016 ACM.","Accelerometer; Decision tree; Feedback; Gyroscope; Mobile sensors; Motion analysis; Table tennis strokes","Accelerometers; Angular velocity; Decision trees; Feedback; Gyroscopes; Motion analysis; Smartphones; Sporting goods; Sports; Trees (mathematics); Accuracy of classifications; Analysis and suggestions; Android applications; Angular acceleration; Gyroscope sensors; Mobile sensors; Table-tennis; Training data sets; Decision tables",2-s2.0-85015625018

Then, we carry out mathematical modeling of aging and predictive analysis with Markov chains.

Since Android is the most widespread smartphone platform, reliable and versatile means for Android application analysis are of great importance. Most of the existing code instrumentation approaches for Android suffer from two important shortcomings: the need for root access and limited support for the new Android Runtime (ART). We aim to fill this gap by proposing ARTIST, the Android Runtime Instrumentation Toolkit1. ARTIST is a framework that allows analysts to easily monitor the execution of Java and native code using native instrumentation techniques. ARTIST, to the best of our knowledge, is the first tool allowing monitoring of both native and Java code with the same instrumentation technique. ARTIST provides two methods to locate instrumentation targets. First, it can parse OAT executable files in memory to find classes and methods of interest. This allows monitoring a specific set of Java methods. Second, ARTIST can locate internal structures of the Android Runtime in memory. Monitoring function pointers found in these allows the user to track specific interactions of Java code with the Android Runtime. We evaluate the applicability of native instrumentation for Java code using a set of the most popular Android apps. The results show that over 80% of the tested Java methods are targetable using this approach. The performance impact, estimated with the CaffeineMark benchmark suite, does not exceed 20% and therefore can be considered generally acceptable. © 2016 IEEE.","Android runtime; Dynamic analysis; Native code instrumentation","Benchmarking; Codes (symbols); Dynamic analysis; Java programming language; Smartphones; Android applications; Code instrumentation; Instrumentation techniques; Monitoring functions; Native code; Runtimes; Sensitive informations; Specific interaction; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85015340439

The most efficient way to ensure data protection is through encryption; however, it comes with great impact on these small gadgets, which suffer from limited resources. Majority of recent mobile devices are equipped with increasingly powerful multi-core processors that researchers can leverage in order to enhance data protection while maintaining proper device performance. In this paper, we introduce a parallel implementation for data encryption inside the storage of Android-based mobile devices. This work implements a multi-core design of different encryption ciphers, making use of the commodity multi-core CPUs available currently in new smart gadget devices, in order to enhance the performance inside these resource-limited devices. Ciphers XTS-AES, XTS-Twofish, and XTS-RC6 are used during the experiments; however, the main focus is given to XTS-AES because it is developed specifically for storage encryption. Parallel encryption experiments are conducted on a mobile device, and performance comparisons are presented. The parallel XTS-AES has shown a maximum performance speedup of 1.71, with 86% efficiency, faster than the serial counterpart, with higher encryption throughput in the device up to 8290 and 11 380 KB/s when using XTS-AES and XTS-RC6 ciphers, respectively.

In comparison to Android users, we found that iPhone owners are more likely to be female, younger, and increasingly concerned about their smartphone being viewed as a status object. Key differences in personality were also observed with iPhone users displaying lower levels of Honesty-Humility and higher levels of emotionality. Following this analysis, we were also able to build and test a model that predicted smartphone ownership at above chance level based on these individual differences. In line with extended self-theory, the type of smartphone owned provides some valuable information about its owner.

We evaluated the system in a single arm, prospective study of adherence to a dietary supplement. Healthy volunteers were recruited through an online portal. Entry criteria included age ≥21 and owning an iOS or Android-based device. Participants took a dietary supplement pill once, twice or three-times a day for 2 months. We instructed them to video each pill taking episode using the system. Outcome: Adherence as measured by the smartphone system and by pill count. Results: 42 eligible participants were recruited (median age 24; 86% students). Videos were classified as received - confirmed pill intake (3475, 82.7% of the 4200 videos expected), received - uncertain pill intake (16, <1%), received - fake pill intake (31, <1%), not received - technical issues (223, 5.3%) or not received - assumed non-adherence (455, 10.8%). Overall median estimated participant adherence by MIST was 90.0%, similar to that obtained by pill count (93.8%). There was a good relationship between participant adherence as measured by MIST and by pill count (Spearmans r s 0.66, p<0.001). Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability and accuracy of a smartphone-based adherence support and monitoring system. The system has the potential to supplement and support the provision of DOT for TB and also to improve adherence in other conditions such as HIV and hepatitis C. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","adherence; Directly Observed Therapy; Smartphone","multivitamin; resveratrol; adult; Article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dietary supplement; directly observed therapy; drug monitoring; female; health care personnel; human; human experiment; ingestion; intervention study; male; medical information system; medication compliance; mobile application; mobile interactive supervised therapy; normal human; patient compliance; patient preference; pill; pilot study; prospective study; remote sensing; smartphone; student; teletherapy; videorecording; young adult",2-s2.0-85007039822

However, perceptions of young children in the myriad circumstances that they live in have not yet been properly investigated. Subsequently, this study tested the feasibility and appropriateness of experience sampling method (ESM), an ecological momentary assessment, on typically developing children aged between five and seven years. Methods: Ten children (five boys and five girls) carried an Android© device with a pre-installed ESM survey exploring their everyday life and their perceived internal experiences. Children were asked to respond to the survey eight times daily, at random times generated by the device, for seven days. Results: An acceptable signal response rate (47.6 ± 18.9%) and short average time required for survey completion (83 ± 49 seconds) supported the feasibility of the ESM for use in research with children aged between five and seven years. Children reported the questions were straightforward and survey completion interfered very little with everyday activities, supporting appropriateness of the method.

Gaming workloads exhibit highly variable and user-interactive behavior, which makes it hard to predict the workload. Modern MPSoC (multiprocessor system-on-chip) platforms are equipped with heterogeneous multi-processing (HMP) processors comprising performance-oriented and energy-efficiency cores in order to better exploit power-performance trade-offs among different types of applications. To minimize the energy consumption of games on HMP platforms, it is essential to precisely predict the gaming workload and perform joint thread-to-core allocation as well as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). In this paper, we propose a frame- and thread-based MPSoC power management strategy for games. We focus on the fact that gaming workload has high temporal correlation among frames and evaluate selected workload predictors on a per-frame basis. Moreover, we find that there are two categories of thread workloads, periodic and aperiodic, and hence, propose to use a hybrid workload predictor. Based on the per-thread predictions, the power manager allocates the threads among the heterogeneous cores in an evenly distributed fashion in order to minimize the operating frequency while keeping the frames-per-second (FPS) constraint. We implement the game power manager as an Android governor on a state-of-the-art platform based on the Exynos5422 SoC, which is also incorporated in the Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone. Our measurement results show that we save on average 41.9% of energy compared to the Android default governor. Further, we have performed a user study to evaluate the user perception of our governor. The gaming experience was rated between good and very good for all games. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Android (operating system); Behavioral research; Dynamic frequency scaling; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Governors; Managers; Multiprocessing systems; Programmable logic controllers; Smartphones; System-on-chip; Voltage scaling; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Heterogeneous cores; Interactive behavior; Multiprocessor system on chips; Performance-oriented; Power management strategies; Power-performance trade-offs; Temporal correlations; Power management",2-s2.0-85006745143

For mitigating the miserable conditions of infant mortality, we are proposing a methodology that could help the pregnant women to check her vital medical status and for her fetus on her own without having much effort. To do so we believe that with help of advances in networking and computing, and android mobile application which is built as a support, we would be able to match the detected heart rate of user with database which we create from readings obtained from the maternity centers. The database would include the normal and abnormal fetus heart rate in maternal period ranging from 5th week to last week of pregnancy. A pattern matching is performed with the data between user and database, if a match is detected then suitable message is generated. If any pattern other than normal pattern is received, an alert is generated along with the sending of obtained packets to the doctor for further diagnosis. To compute the abnormality of fetus heart rate during maternal period in user's handheld devices like Smartphone there is no need for separate infrastructure for monitoring mother and fetus. We use a Bluetooth module in order to transfer the vital parameters like pulse rate, fetal heart rate and blood pressure to the user's handheld devices. Thus, detection of abnormality in early stage will make sure that healthcare is reached in time and the newborn would not be affected. This user friendly arrangement drastically reduces the stress for the mother as a portable health check up is available to her. © 2016 IEEE.","Blood Pressure; Client-Server model; Fetal Growth; Heart rate","Blood pressure; Database systems; Diagnosis; Hand held computers; Internet of things; Pattern matching; Abnormality detection; Blue-tooth module; Client-server models; Engineering perspective; Fetal growth; Growth measurement; Heart rates; Mobile applications; Heart",2-s2.0-85006802399

The result of this shift in paradigm is now known as mobile VR (mVR). Although mVR offers numerous advantages over conventional immersive VR methods, one of the biggest limitations is related with the interaction pathways available for the mVR experiences. Using physiological computing principles, we created the PhysioVR framework, an Open-Source software tool developed to facilitate the integration of physiological signals measured through wearable devices in mVR applications. PhysioVR includes heart rate (HR) signals from Android wearables, electroencephalography (EEG) signals from a low-cost brain computer interface and electromyography (EMG) signals from a wireless armband. The physiological sensors are connected with a smartphone via Bluetooth and the PhysioVR facilitates the streaming of the data using UDP communication protocol, thus allowing a multicast transmission for a third party application such as the Unity3D game engine. Furthermore, the framework provides a bidirectional communication with the VR content allowing an external event triggering using a real-time control as well as data recording options. We developed a demo game project called EmoCat Rescue which encourage players to modulate HR levels in order to successfully complete the in-game mission. EmoCat Rescue is included in the PhysioVR project which can be freely downloaded.

The use of smartphone applications (apps) related to health (mHealth) is increasing and, while there is potential for apps to be used as a self-managed balance intervention, many healthcare providers are concerned about the content and credibility of mHealth apps overall. Purpose: This study evaluates the quality of balance promoting apps and identifies strengths and areas of concern to assist healthcare providers in recommending these resources. Materials and methods: Balance apps for the general public, offered on the iPhone Operating System (iOS) and Android platforms, were evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Results: Five iOS apps met the inclusion criteria. The mean scores for each of the domains in MARS were: Engagement (3.32), Information (3.7), Functionality (3.8), and Esthetics (3.8). Overall, one app (UStabilize) received a rating of 4.43 in MARS five-point scale, which was considered “good”. Other apps in the review demonstrated acceptable quality. Conclusions: The reviewed balance apps targeted to improve or maintain physical balance were of acceptable quality. Apps address many current issues older adults have to accessing rehabilitation services and, as such, may be particularly useful for this group. Future research should focus on assessing and comparing app efficacy. Development of balance apps for the Android platform is also necessary.Implications for RehabilitationGiven the availability and accessibility of various mHealth apps and the increasing mobile device usage among older adults, mobile apps are a promising avenue for delivering rehabilitation interventions, such as balance training, to older adults.Smartphone apps exist for balance training but overall confidence in health apps within the healthcare community is low and rigorous evaluation is required.A range of apps exist that demonstrate acceptable to good quality and stakeholders should work towards having these apps listed in credible mHealth clearinghouses. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","app; applications; balance; mHealth; older adult; rehabilitation; smartphone",,2-s2.0-84996497485

The proposal includes a centralized system to forecast available indoor parking spaces, and a low-cost mobile application to obtain data of actual and predicted parking occupancy. The described scheme uses data from both sources bidirectionally so that the centralized forecast system is fed with data obtained with the distributed system based on smartphones, and vice versa. The mobile application uses different wireless technologies to provide the forecast system with actual parking data and receive from the system useful recommendations about where to park. Thus, the proposal can be used by any driver to easily find available parking spaces in indoor facilities. The client software developed for smartphones is a lightweight Android application that supplies precise indoor positioning systems based on Quick Response codes or Near Field Communication tags, and semi-precise indoor positioning systems based on Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated by conducting computer simulations and real experimentation with a preliminary implementation. The results have shown the strengths of the proposal in the reduction of the time and energy costs to find available parking spaces. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Cellular automata; Indoor parking; Intelligent transport system; Location-based service; Smartphone application","Application programs; Automobile drivers; Cellular automata; Forecasting; Indoor positioning systems; Intelligent systems; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Near field communication; Smartphones; Telecommunication services; Wireless telecommunication systems; Android applications; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Distributed systems; Intelligent transport systems; Quick response code; Recommendation mechanism; Smart-phone applications; Wireless technologies; Location based services",2-s2.0-84995741104

These indoor environments are characterized by a reduced number of AP, narrow spaces and very important radio signal attenuation. Existing indoor techniques seems to be not totally suitable for these scenarios; this paper proposes an add-on for helping these techniques by the use of wearable ultrasound sensors (distance measurements). One important step for indoor techniques using RF signals is the off-line phase and the generation of Radio Maps. In order to considerably reduce the time needed for the off-line phase, this paper uses an existing tool for generating maps automatically. Therefore, a considerable gain of time is obtained. On the other hand, the combination of WiFi and range techniques allows us to do coarse and fine location. An IT artifact named UTOPIA (UlTrasOund Positioning Indoor App) has been developed to track all data needed for computing indoor position like RSSI, distances to walls, number of steps, heading and more. The project uses two maps for positioning: a WiFi map automatically generated; and an ultrasound map, that takes into account what should be the ultrasound value at every single point of the building and for several directions of the sensor. To get position, the values obtained by smartphone are compared with WiFi map. A particle filter technique is used to propagate position and ultrasound values are used to get the weight in the particle filter. Results obtained show that the methodology is coherent with real scenario and can be used for helping existing indoor position techniques in these specific scenarios (In-home environments). The main contributions of this paper are: 1) offering an alternative system suitable for in-home features that allows to calculate positioning by using WiFi and ultrasound; 2) avoiding the off-line mapping phase of WiFi fingerprinting by comparing with an automatically calculated WiFi map; and 3) using the map for improving positioning by generating an ultrasound reference map with the value of ultrasound signal at every single point of the building, and for several directions. © 2016 IEEE.","Android; Arduino; Indoor Positioning; Inertial Sensors; Mobile device; Ultrasound Distance Sensors","Mobile devices; Monte Carlo methods; Sailing vessels; Wearable sensors; Wearable technology; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Android; Arduino; Distance sensors; Indoor positioning; Inertial sensor; Ultrasonic applications",2-s2.0-85004091900

Power-saving modes prolong battery life by saving energy, but application performance is limited as a result. We investigate performance-energy trade-ofs of smartphone applications by investigating three strategies: first, we propose an M/M/1 discriminatory processor sharing queue to act as a smartphone server and measure delays of Android applications; secondly, we form a performance-energy trade-of that takes into account cellular radio transfers using an objective cost function incorporating mean delay and power consumption; and thirdly, we build an online HMM to act as a power consumption model that predicts battery life given recent data transfers. For all three strategies we obtain logged smartphone activity of over 750 users via an open-source smartphone data-collection application. Hence, we obtain three hypotheses from our strategies: first, delay of applications is approximated well using the beta prime distribution; secondly, power consumption increases as mean delay decreases with battery life prolonged if adjustments are made to cellular radio usage; and thirdly, burstiness is captured by HMMs in both data transfers and rates of power consumption. © 2016 ACM.",,"Commerce; Cost functions; Data transfer; Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Signal encoding; Android applications; Application performance; Cellular radios; Data collection; Discriminatory processor-sharing; Power consumption model; Power saving modes; Smart-phone applications; Smartphones",2-s2.0-85007005517

A smartphone is a useful evidence to find related criminals because smartphones store their contacts information. However, simply using smartphone data can prove difficult to grasp the relationship between the user and connected people. In addition, due to the increase in smartphone data, a modern approach is needed for the investigation. If an investigator can use the recorded data on the smartphone and look at the contact data as a number, they therefore, can grasp the relationship between the user and the contact which will be a more efficient way of finding people of interest. I.e. a high number means they are close to one another. A close relationship is an indication of a high possibility that they may be criminally related.

Android-based smartphones have opened real-world venues for mobile cloud applications mainly because of the open source nature of Android. Computational offloading mechanism enables the augmentation of smartphone capabilities. The problem is majority of existing computational offloading solutions for Android-based smartphones heavily depends on Dalvik VM (an application-level VM). Apart from being a discontinued product, Dalvik VM consumes extra time and energy because of the just-in-time (JIT) compilation of bytecode into machine instructions. With regard to this problem, Google has introduced Android Runtime (ART) featuring ahead-of-time (AHOT) compilation to native instructions in place of Dalvik VM. However, current state-of-the-art offloading solutions do not consider AHOT compilations to native binaries in the ART environment. To address the issue in offloading ART-based mobile applications, we propose a computational offloading framework.

Many companies, including official and third parties, have released their push services. In order to reduce resource cost, some third-party push services share push channels among applications running on the same device and using the same push service, which means that the background push component of one application acts as the push data distribution center for other applications. Due to the lack of considering security attributes such as confidentiality and integrity, the distribution part faces a variety of attacks. In this work we analyze the security issues in the data distribution part of third-party push services on Android. We design a corresponding attack model and implement attacks including eavesdropping, data tampering, forgery and replay attacks. During our experiments, it shows that most of the third-party Android push services using shared channels are subject to these attacks. It may cause some security hazards such as user privacy leakage and phishing attack. To mitigate the above threats, we propose SecPush which is a security enhancement scheme for Android push service.

To this purpose, we propose the utilization of embedded sensor data (accelerometer/gyroscope) with a novel meta-classifier based on a cascading technique, and we show that our combined approach can provide similar performance than a GPS-based classifier, but introducing also the possibility to control the computational load based on requested confidence. We describe the implementation of the proposed system into an Android framework that can be leveraged by third-part mobile applications to access context-aware information in a transparent way.

The applications downloaded from unofficial sources pose a security threat as they lack mechanisms for validation of the applications. The malware infected applications may lead to several threats such as leaking user's private information, enforcing malicious deductions for sending premium SMS, getting root privilege of the android system and so on. Existing anti-viruses depend on signature databases that need to be updated from time to time and are unable to detect zero-day malware. The Android Operating system allows inter-application communication through the use of component reuse by using intents. Unfortunately, message passing is also an application attack surface. A hybrid method for android malware detection by analysing the permissions and intent-filters of the manifest files of the applications is presented. A malware detection framework is developed based on machine learning algorithms and on the basis of the decision tree obtained from ID3 and J48 classifiers available in WEKA. Both algorithms gave same results with an error percentage of 6 per cent.

In particular, smartphones allow researchers to connect with respondents more frequently than standard household surveys, opening a new window into important short-term variability in key measures of household and community wellbeing. In this paper, we present early results from a pilot study in rural Bangladesh using a 'microtasks for micropayments' model to collect a range of community and household living standards data using Android smartphones. We find that more frequent task repetition with shorter recall periods leads to more inclusive reporting, improved capture of intra-seasonal variability, and earlier signals of events such as illness. Payments in the form of mobile talk time and data provide a positive development externality in the form of expanded access to mobile internet and social networks. Taken to scale, programs such as this have potential to transform data collection in rural areas, providing near-real-time windows into the development of markets, the spread of illnesses, or the diffusion of ideas and innovations. © 2016 Bell et al.

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin used a smartphone antenna to feed GNSS signals into a software-defined receiver built at their facility. While carrier phases were affected by significant time-correlated errors such as multipath, centimeter-level differential positioning could still be achieved. Microsoft Mobile also produced custom firmware for the Nokia Lumia 1520 'phablet' smartphone, allowing access to raw GNSS measurements from the phone's internal Qualcomm integrated receiver. This data, analyzed by members of the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, identified pseudorange measurement noise on the order of tens of meters and carrier-phase observations contaminated by several outliers. The GNSS raw measurements are contained in the GnssClock and GnssMeasurement software classes, which are described in the android.location APIs. The app logs the decoded ephemeris data in decimal representations of the bytes defined by the respective constellation interface control documents (ICDs). The GNSS antenna contained within the smartphone uses linear polarization, making it especially susceptible to multipath effects resulting from GNSS signals bouncing off the ground or nearby surfaces before reaching the antenna. To turn the smartphone into a high-precision positioning tool, it is imperative to make use of carrier-phase measurements, which are at least 100 times more precise than pseudorange measurements.",,"correlation; error analysis; GNSS; GPS; measurement method; mobile phone; precision; spatial data; Austin [Texas]; Texas; United States; Apis",2-s2.0-85017652574

Although several approaches have been proposed to address this issue, they have limitations of either inefficient memory usage or long latency for switching the reserved memory space between a device and general-purpose uses. Our scheme, on the other hand, utilizes reserved memory as an eviction-based file cache. It guarantees contiguous memory allocation to devices while providing idle device memory as an additional file cache called eCache for general-purpose usage. Because eCache stores only evicted data from the in-kernel page cache, the memory efficiency is preserved and the allocation time for devices is minimized. Cost-based region selection also minimizes additional read I/O operations by carefully discarding cached data from eCache. The additional indexing cost incurred by adding eCache is minimized by integrating its index structure with the kernel page cache. The prototype is implemented on the Nexus S smartphone and is evaluated using popular Android applications. The evaluation results show that our scheme outperforms previous approaches in terms of the application launch performance. The device memory reallocation time is also limited to a few milliseconds, which is sufficiently small to make our scheme transparent. © 2015 IEEE.","Contiguous memory allocation; File eviction; Memory management; Memory reservation","Embedded systems; Memory architecture; Storage allocation (computer); Android applications; Application performance; Evaluation results; File eviction; Index structure; Memory efficiency; Memory management; Region selections; Cache memory",2-s2.0-84991712894

However, many barriers to vaccination compliance exist, including a lack of awareness regarding the importance of vaccines, missing due dates, and fear of complications from vaccinations. The aim of this study is to review the existing tools and publications regarding vaccination adherence, and to propose a design for a vaccination adherence application (app) for smartphones. Methods Android and iOS apps designed for vaccination reminders have been reviewed to examine six elements: educational factor; customizing features; reminder tools; peer education facilitations; feedback, and the language of apps’ interface and content. The literature from PubMed has been reviewed for studies addressing reminder systems or tools including apps. Results The study has revealed insufficient (n = 6) technology-based interventions for increasing childhood vaccination rates by reminding parents in comparison to the fast growth in technology, out of which are two publications discussed mobile apps. Ten apps have been found in apps stores; only one out of them was designed for the Saudi vaccination schedule in Arabic language with some weaknesses. The study proposed a design for a vaccination reminder app that includes a number of features in order to overcome the limitations discussed in the studied reminders, apps, and systems. The design supports the Arabic language and the Saudi vaccination schedule; parental education including peer education; a variety of reminder methods, and the capability to track vaccinations and refer to the app as a personal health record. Conclusion The study discussed a design for a vaccination reminder app that satisfies the specific requirements for better compliance to children's immunization schedules based on reviewing the existing apps and publications. The proposed design includes element to educate parents and answer their concerns about vaccines. It involves their peers and can encourage the exchange of experiences and overcome vaccine fears. In addition, it could form a convenient child personal health record. © 2016","Adherence; Application; Child; Design; Reminder; Vaccine","Arabic (language); Article; electronic patient record; health education; human; mobile application; parent counseling; parental attitude; priority journal; publication; reminder system; smartphone; systematic review; vaccination; Communicable Diseases; disease transmission; medication compliance; mobile application; prevention and control; reminder system; smartphone; utilization; vaccination; Communicable Diseases; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Humans; Medication Adherence; Mobile Applications; Reminder Systems; Smartphone; Vaccination",2-s2.0-84994807294

The classification module is based on a neural network using Deep Learning methodology. Firstly, the architecture design of the convolutional neural network is presented and analyzed in the context of the four selected architectures (two of them recent successful types) and two custom modifications specifically made for the problem at hand. The results are carefully evaluated, and the best one is selected to be used within the proposed system.

This application allows blind users to input characters based on braille patterns. To assess SingleTapBraille, this study compares its performance with that of the commonly used QWERTY keyboard. We conducted an evaluation study with 7 blind participants to examine the performance of both keyboards on Android platforms. Overall, participants were able to quickly adjust to SingleTapBraille and type on touchscreen devices using their knowledge of Braille patterns within fifteen to twenty minutes of introduction to the system. The SingleTapBraille keyboard was better than the QWERTY keyboard in terms of both speed and accuracy, indicating that SingleTapBraille represents an improvement over existing alternatives in making touchscreen keyboards more accessible for blind users. Based on the evaluation results and the feedback of our participants, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of previous keyboards that have been used by participants, as well as those of SingleTapBraille. In doing so, we consider possible design improvements for the future development of accessible keyboards for blind users.","Accessibility; Blindness; Braille patterns; Gestures; Single-Touch interaction; Smartphone devices; Tapping; Text entry; Touchscreens","Smartphones; Tapping (threads); Transportation; Accessibility; Blindness; Braille patterns; Gestures; Text entry; Touch interaction; Touch screens",2-s2.0-85006713564

With the enhanced and advanced functionalities, smartphones carry a large amount of user's private and confidential data. There are numerous risks, threats, and the rise in powerfulness and effectiveness of malware attacks make smartphones more prone and vulnerable. Due to the rapid increase in Android smartphones users, demands based on new and advanced features as well as the usage ease have been lavished on developers. The Android application developers are working hard to develop innovative applications for millions of Android users around the world. In this struggle of advancement, they are seeking permissions to critical system resources, not directly offered by Android. One of the most projecting way is through ADB (Android Debug Bridge) that has been granted permissions to use critical system resources. There are many applications on Google Play Store that utilize ADB proxy to provide users with unconventional and smart features on smartphones.

Due to the nature of the smartphone platform, an app can be paused, sent into background, or killed at any time. If the instance data is not saved and restored between runs, in addition to data loss, partially-saved or corrupted data can crash the app upon resume or restart. While smartphone platforms offer API support for data-saving and data-retrieving operations, the use of this API is ad-hoc: left to the programmer, rather than enforced by the compiler. We have observed that several categories of bugs-including data loss, failure to resume/restart or resuming/restarting in the wrong state-are due to incorrect handling of instance data and are easily triggered by just pressing the 'Home' or 'Back' buttons. To help address this problem, we have constructed a tool chain for Android (the KRE finder static analysis and the KREreproducer input generator) that helps find and reproduce such incorrect handling. We have evaluated our approach by running the static analysis on 324 apps, of which 49 were further analyzed manually. Results indicate that our approach is (i) effective, as it has discovered 49 bugs, including in popular Android apps, and (ii) efficient, completing on average in 61 seconds per app. More generally, our approach helps determine whether an app saves too much or too little state. © 2016 ACM.","App testing; Data loss; Google android; Mobile applications; Software restart; Static analysis","Application programs; Computer systems programming; Data handling; Object oriented programming; Program compilers; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software testing; Static analysis; Android applications; Android apps; Corrupted data; Data loss; Google android; Mobile applications; Navigation routes; Smartphone apps; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84995543469

Users are required to provide passwords, introducing several vulnerabilities: since strong passwords are hard to memorize, users often use weak passwords that are easy to break, and passwords can be intercepted by malware and stolen. In this paper we propose a novel architecture, named BioALeg, to support secure biometric authentication on legacy websites. Our approach leverages the potential of a Secured Personal Device (SPD), a hardware add-on for mobile phones that is being developed in the context of the PCAS European project. The device offers biometric authentication and secure storage services. BioALeg uses this infrastructure, and a companion web site plugin, to support biometric authentication in legacy web sites that currently use username/password authentication. In order to perform authentication, the smartphone requests a One Time Password (OTP) to the service provider when the user tries to access the service using the SPD. Due to the architecture and implementation of the SPD, the OTP transfer only occurs after the owner of the phone and SPD is correctly authenticated using biometrics. The PCAS infrastructure guarantees that, after the biometric authentication, the user identity is valid and accepted by all components.

Many of these investigations include analyzing data stored through cloud storage apps which contributes to importance of cloud apps forensics on mobile devices. In this paper, various cloud Android applications are analyzed using the forensics tool XRY and a forensics taxonomy for investigation of these apps is suggested. The proposed taxonomy reflects residual artifacts retrievable from 31 different cloud applications. It is expected that the proposed taxonomy and the forensic findings in this paper will assist future forensic investigations involving cloud based storage applications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This might lead to several privacy issues, such as revealing user contacts, private messages, or personal photos. Therefore, having an up-to-date forensic understanding of these apps is necessary.This chapter presents analysis of forensically valuable remnants of three popular Mobile VoIP (mVoIP) apps on Google Play store, namely: Viber, Skype, and WhatsApp Messenger, in order to figure out to what extent these apps reveal forensically valuable information about the users activities. We performed a thorough investigative study of these three mVoIP apps on smartphone devices.

We address the problem of face spoof detection against the print (photo) and replay (photo or video) attacks based on the analysis of image distortion (e.g., surface reflection, moiré pattern, color distortion, and shape deformation) in spoof face images (or video frames). The application domain of interest is smartphone unlock, given that the growing number of smartphones have the face unlock and mobile payment capabilities. We build an unconstrained smartphone spoof attack database (MSU USSA) containing more than 1000 subjects. Both the print and replay attacks are captured using the front and rear cameras of a Nexus 5 smartphone. We analyze the image distortion of the print and replay attacks using different: 1) intensity channels (R, G, B, and grayscale); 2) image regions (entire image, detected face, and facial component between nose and chin); and 3) feature descriptors. We develop an efficient face spoof detection system on an Android smartphone.

Combining hearing aids with a smartphone introduces additional computing power, memory, and a graphical user interface that may enable greater setting personalization. To explore the benefits of self-training with a smartphone-based hearing system, a parameter space was chosen with four possible combinations of microphone mode (omnidirectional and directional) and noise reduction state (active and off). The baseline for comparison was the ""untrained system,"" that is, the manufacturer's algorithm for automatically selecting microphone mode and noise reduction state based on acoustic environment. The ""trained system"" first learned each individual's preferences, self-entered via a smartphone in real-world situations, to build a trained model. The system then predicted the optimal setting (among available choices) using an inference engine, which considered the trained model and current context (e.g., sound environment, location, and time). Purpose: To develop a smartphone-based prototype hearing system that can be trained to learn preferred user settings. Determine whether user study participants showed a preference for trained over untrained system settings. Research Design: An experimental within-participants study. Participants used a prototype hearing system - comprising two hearing aids, Android smartphone, and body-worn gateway device - for ~6 weeks. Study Sample: Sixteen adults with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss (HL) (ten males, six females; mean age = 55.5 yr). Fifteen had ≥ 6 mo of experience wearing hearing aids, and 14 had previous experience using smartphones. Intervention: Participants were fitted and instructed to perform daily comparisons of settings (""listening evaluations"") through a smartphone-based software application called Hearing Aid Learning and Inference Controller (HALIC). In the four-week-long training phase, HALIC recorded individual listening preferences along with sensor data from the smartphone - including environmental sound classification, sound level, and location - to build trained models. In the subsequent two-week-long validation phase, participants performed blinded listening evaluations comparing settings predicted by the trained system (""trained settings"") to those suggested by the hearing aids' untrained system (""untrained settings""). Data Collection and Analysis: We analyzed data collected on the smartphone and hearing aids during the study. We also obtained audiometric and demographic information. Results: Overall, the 15 participants with valid data significantly preferred trained settings to untrained settings (paired-samples t test). Seven participants had a significant preference for trained settings, while one had a significant preference for untrained settings (binomial test). The remaining seven participants had nonsignificant preferences. Pooling data across participants, the proportion of times that each setting was chosen in a given environmental sound class was on average very similar. However, breaking down the data by participant revealed strong and idiosyncratic individual preferences. Fourteen participants reported positive feelings of clarity, competence, and mastery when training via HALIC. Conclusions: The obtained data, as well as subjective participant feedback, indicate that smartphones could become viable tools to train hearing aids. Individuals who are tech savvy and have milder HL seem well suited to take advantages of the benefits offered by training with a smartphone.","Environment classification; Hearing AIDS; Smartphone; Trainable","adult; aged; audio recording; audiometry; bone anchored hearing aid; classifier; comprehension; Conference Paper; evaluation study; female; frequency; hearing aid; human; learning algorithm; male; microphone; mobile phone; noise reduction; normal human; perception deafness; priority journal; smartphone; sound intensity; speech intelligibility",2-s2.0-84991489122

This study aims to integrate QR (Quick Response) code with quality data and mobile intelligent technology to develop a convenient query terminal for tracing quality in the whole industrial chain of TCM (traditional Chinese medicine). Three herbal medicines were randomly selected and their chemical two-dimensional barcode (2D) barcodes fingerprints were constructed. Smartphone application (APP) based on Android system was developed to read initial data of 2D chemical barcodes, and compared multiple fingerprints from different batches of same species or different species. It was demonstrated that there were no significant differences between original and scanned TCM chemical fingerprints. Meanwhile, different TCM chemical fingerprint QR codes could be rendered in the same coordinate and showed the differences very intuitively. To be able to distinguish the variations of chemical fingerprint more directly, linear interpolation angle cosine similarity algorithm (LIACSA) was proposed to get similarity ratio. This study showed that QR codes can be used as an effective information carrier to transfer quality data.

Recognizing a traveler's transportation mode is not only critical to personal context awareness in related applications but also essential to urban traffic operations, transportation planning, and facility design. While most current practice often leverages infrastructure-based fixed sensors or a Global Positioning System (GPS) for traffic mode recognition, the emergence of the smartphone provides an alternative promising way with its ever-growing computing, networking, and sensing power. In this paper, we propose a GPS-and-network-free method to detect a traveler's travel mode using mobile phone sensors. Our application is built on the latest Android platform with multimodality sensors. By developing a hierarchical classification method with an online learning model, we achieve almost 100% accuracy in a binary classification of wheeled/unwheeled travel modes and an average of 97.1% accuracy with all six travel modes (buses, subways, cars, bicycling, walking, and jogging). Our system (a) could adapt to each traveler's pattern by using the online learning model, and it performs significantly faster in computation than the offline model, and (b) works with a low sampling frequency for sensing so that it saves the smartphone battery. © 2016 IEEE.","Mobile mining; online learning; Traffic mode identification; vehicle classification","Electric batteries; Global positioning system; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Transportation; Urban transportation; Android platforms; Binary classification; Context- awareness; Hierarchical classification; Mobile phone sensors; Sampling frequencies; Transportation mode; Transportation planning; E-learning",2-s2.0-84962524703

HASITE simplifies the deployment of a home automation system by using wireless networks and both self-configuration and self-registration protocols. Thanks to the application of these three elements, HASITE is able to add new transducers by just powering them up. According to the tests performed in different realistic scenarios, a transducer is ready to be used in less than 13 s. Moreover, all HASITE functionalities can be accessed through an API, which also allows for the integration of third-party systems. As an example, an Android application based on the API is presented.

In this paper, we present MedSen, a portable, inexpensive and secure smartphone-based biomarker1 detection sensor to provide users with easy-to-use real-time disease diagnostic capabilities without the need for in-person clinical visits. To minimize the deployment cost and size without sacrificing the diagnostic accuracy, security and time requirement, MedSen operates as a dongle to the user's smartphone and leverages the smartphone's computational capabilities for its real-time data processing. From the security viewpoint, MedSen introduces a new hardware-level trusted sensing framework, built in the sensor, to encrypt measured analog signals related to cell counting in the patient's blood sample, at the data acquisition point. To protect the user privacy, MedSen's in-sensor encryption scheme conceals the user's private information before sending them out for cloud-based medical diagnostics analysis. The analysis outcomes are sent back to Med-Sen for decryption and user notifications. Additionally, MedSen introduces cyto-coded passwords to authenticate the user to the cloud server without the need for explicit screen password entry. Each user's password constitutes a predetermined number of synthetic beads with different dielectric characteristics. MedSen mixes the password beads with the user's blood before submitting the data for diagnostics analysis. The cloud server authenticates the user based on the statistics and characteristics of the beads with the blood sample, and links the user's identity to the encrypted analysis outcomes. We have implemented a real-world working prototype of MedSen through bio-sensor fabrication and smartphone app (Android) implementations. Our results show that MedSen can reliably classify different users based on their cyto-coded passwords with high accuracy. MedSen's built-in analog signal encryption guarantees the user's privacy by considering the smartphone and cloud server possibly untrusted (curious but honest).

It is common, but difficult to diagnose, and often involves sensor usage. GreenDroid provides a novel approach to systematically diagnose energy inefficiency problems in smartphone apps running on Android platforms. It derives an application execution model (AEM) from Android framework and leverages it to realistically simulate an application's runtime behaviors. It also automatically analyzes an application's sensory data utilization, monitors sensor listener and wake lock usage, and reports actionable information to developers. However, GreenDroid has several limitations. First, other than Android 2.3, it does not support other newer versions of Android. Second, GreenDroid doesn't provide an actionable and reusable state machine based on AEM. Third, its implementation and report generation need optimization. This work focuses on extending GreenDroid's functionality of diagnosing energy inefficiency problems in Android apps. We re-implement GreenDroid on the newest version of Java Pathfinder(JPF), update and optimize the execution simulation process as well as library modeling. Besides, this work adds support to new Android features such as Fragment, and abstracts a separate and reusable state machine out of AEM. With our evaluation, we demonstrate that the extended GreenDroid (E-GreenDroid) can analyze those apps with new Android features while being the same effective as the original version. © 2016 ACM.","Energy inefficiency; Sensory data utilization; Smartphone application","Computer software; Computer software reusability; Java programming language; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android applications; Android platforms; Application execution; Energy inefficiency; Runtime behaviors; Sensory data; Simulation process; Smart-phone applications; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84995527299

In existing inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) systems, sensor axes are fixed regardless of user motion, because the IMU is mounted on the shoes or helmet. On the other hand, the sensor axes of a smartphone are changed according to the walking motion of the user, because the smartphone is usually carried by hand or kept in the pocket. Therefore, the conventional PDR method cannot apply to the smartphone-based PDR system. To overcome this limitation, the walking status is detected using a motion recognition algorithm with sensor measurements from the smartphone. Then, different PDR algorithms are applied according to the recognized pattern of the pedestrian motion. The height information of the pedestrian is also estimated using the on-board barometric pressure sensor of the smartphone. The 3D position, which consists of the 2D position calculated by the PDR and the height information, is provided to the pedestrian. The proposed system has several advantages in terms of cost and accessibility. It requires no additional peripheral devices except for the smartphone, because smartphones are equipped with all the necessary sensors, such as an accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, and barometric pressure sensor. This paper implements the proposed system as an android-based application.

The objective is to get a near zero leakage current drawn by the functional units that are not currently being used. This substantially minimizes the power consumed by the units when they are in idle state which contributes to more than 60% of the average power consumed in mobile devices. In addition to this novel approach on the hardware architecture, a stochastic dynamic power control and on-demand power and clock gating is implemented. A number of possible cases are evaluated and, under given states of the system, one of them is taken to be optimal for a specific module of the device using the energy delay product (EDP). The developed prototype is compared with three standard Android Smartphones based on performance and power consumption on similar tests and usage scenarios.

This can be solved by restricting the mobile applications to certain level by restricting their access to system resources. To work on this few modifications to be done in the android operating system according to the user strategies to be considered dynamically. The existing system is not good enough to restrict the applications and it is not possible to restrict the applications dynamically based on the users location,these are done in context based access optimizing system.

The model which drives the Cotton SmartIrrigation App (Cotton App) is an interactive ET-based soil water balance model. The Cotton App uses meteorological data from weather station networks, soil parameters, crop phenology, crop coefficients, and irrigation applications to estimate root zone soil water deficits (RZSWD) in terms of percent as well as of inches of water. The Cotton App sends notifications to the user when the RZSWD exceeds 40%, when phenological changes occur, and when rain is recorded at the nearest weather station. It operates on both iOS and Android operating systems and was released during March 2014. The soil water balance model was calibrated and validated during 2012 and 2013 using data from replicated plot experiments and commercial fields. The Cotton App was evaluated in field trials for three years and performed well when compared to other irrigation scheduling tools. Its geographical footprint is currently limited to the states of Georgia and Florida, United States, because it is enabled to use meteorological data only from weather station networks in these states.

This study aimed to evaluate a cloud-based telemedicine application for screening for oral diseases. Methods: A telemedicine system, based on a store-and-forward method, was developed to work as a platform for data storage. An Android application was developed to facilitate entering demographic details and capturing oral photos. As a proof-of-concept, six volunteers were enrolled in a trial to obtain oral images using smartphone cameras. Following an onsite oral examination, images of participants’ teeth were obtained by a trained dental assistant. Oral images were directly uploaded from the smartphone to a cloud-based server via broadband network. The assessments of oral images by offsite dentists were compared with those carried out via face-to-face oral examinations. Results: A complete set of 30 oral images was obtained from all six participants. Out of 192 teeth reviewed, the proportion of ungradable teeth was 8%. Sensitivity and specificity of teledental screening were 57% and 100% respectively. The inter-grader agreement estimated for two examination modalities and between two teledental graders was 70% and 62% respectively. Findings indicate that the proposed system for screening of oral diseases can be implemented to provide a valid and reliable alternative to traditional oral screening. Conclusion: This study provided evidence that a robust system for store-and-forward screening for dental problems can be developed, and leads to the need for further testing of its robustness to confirm the accuracy and reliability of the teledentistry system. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","caries; cloud; dental; digital imaging; remote; smartphone; teledentistry; Telemedicine","adult; cloud computing; dental assistant; dental caries; dental facility; dentist; female; human; Internet; male; middle aged; Mouth Diseases; photography; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; smartphone; software; telemedicine; Western Australia; young adult; Adult; Cloud Computing; Dental Assistants; Dental Caries; Dental Offices; Dentists; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Diseases; Photography; Sensitivity and Specificity; Smartphone; Software; Telemedicine; Western Australia; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84983049797

Zero-reporting from high-risk districts is a key strategy for surveillance. Our objective was to implement a pilot investigation to assess the feasibility of using short message service (SMS) texting for daily reporting of Ebola cases under investigation (CUI) in Guinea-Bissau in the context of an ongoing emergency-response training program known as Surveillance Training for Ebola Preparedness (STEP). Study design Prospective cohort (pilot investigation) Methods The reporting period for the SMS pilot was January 24–March 24, 2015. STEP was conducted for two sequential groups during January 19–March 27, 2015 in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Training on SMS daily reporting occurred over one hour during the first week of didactic training of each group. Fourteen participants (nine from the first group and five from the second), including one surveillance officer from each of the 13 regions in Guinea-Bissau and one from the national laboratory, were selected as reporters, receiving a simple cell phone for sending SMS indicating the number of CUI for Ebola. The WHO suspect Ebola case definition was used initially and then modified on day 32 of the pilot. The text message was sent to the WiFi-connected smartphone at the Instituto Nacional Saúde Pública (INASA). The smartphone utilised an SMS-gateway application (Ushahidi SMSsync Android App) to upload the data to the Magpi cloud application. Results The average daily reporting from the first group was 7.7 of 9 (86%) and for the second group was 4.1 of 5 (82%). For the two groups combined, the reporting rate was 85%. Among the 14 reporters the median reporting rate was 85% (range 36%–100%). No cases meeting the definition for an Ebola CUI were reported during the 60 days. Conclusions Real-time, SMS-based, daily zero-reporting can be implemented in a rapid, simple way in a low resource country. We believe that the high compliance rates were due to the simplicity and familiarity of SMS and heightened sensitivity that resulted from STEP to the importance of zero-reporting in the midst of an Ebola epidemic in neighbouring countries. This model could be useful for rapid scale-up and implementation of alert systems in other outbreaks and public health emergencies. © 2016","Ebola; SMS; Surveillance","Ebola virus disease; epidemic; mobile phone; risk factor; training; Article; cases under investigation; cohort analysis; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; emergency health service; feasibility study; Guinea-Bissau; health care concepts; health program; human; information processing; mass communication; pilot study; prospective study; short message service; smartphone; health survey; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; procedures; text messaging; Guinea-Bissau; Feasibility Studies; Guinea-Bissau; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Pilot Projects; Population Surveillance; Prospective Studies; Text Messaging",2-s2.0-84963959620

The review of freely available mobile apps for self-management of diabetes was conducted based on the criteria for promoting diabetes self-management as defined by Goyal and Cafazzo (monitoring blood glucose level and medication, nutrition, physical exercise and body weight). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was followed. Three independent experts in the field of healthcare-related mobile apps were included in the assessment for eligibility and testing phase. We tested and evaluated 65 apps (21 from Google Play Store, 31 from App Store and 13 from Windows Phone Store). Fifty-six of these apps did not meet even minimal requirements or did not work properly. While a wide selection of mobile applications is available for self-management of diabetes, current results show that there are only nine (5 from Google Play Store, 3 from App Store and 1 from Windows Phone Store) out of 65 reviewed mobile apps that can be versatile and useful for successful self-management of diabetes based on selection criteria. The levels of inclusion of features based on selection criteria in selected mobile apps can be very different. The results of the study can be used as a basis to prvide app developers with certain recommendations. There is a need for mobile apps for self-management of diabetes with more features in order to increase the number of long-term users and thus influence better self-management of the disease. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Health; Mobile apps; Self-management of diabetes","glucose; insulin; Article; blood glucose monitoring; body weight maintenance; diabetes control; diabetic patient; exercise; fitness; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; mobile application; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutrition; physical activity; self care; smartphone; systematic review; diabetes mellitus; mobile application; mobile phone; Cell Phones; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Mobile Applications; Self Care",2-s2.0-84982283708

The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, it confirms that personality traits have significant impact on the adoption of different types of mobile apps. Second, a machine-learning model is developed to automatically determine a user's personality based on her installed apps. The predictive model is implemented in a prototype app and shows a 65% higher precision than a random guess.

Today, there is a large variety of hardware and software to choose from that is easy to set up and use. Even though there is an increasing number of real-world applications that employ large deployments of IoT devices, the wireless nature of communication in combination with the low-end capabilities of the devices raises security and privacy issues that have not been properly addressed. Considering also that sensor node brands are very different in their capabilities, providing a single solution is very challenging. In this paper we adopt Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as an attractive alternative to conventional public key cryptography, such as RSA. ECC is an ideal candidate for implementation on constrained devices where the major computational resources, i.e., speed, memory are limited and low-power wireless communication protocols are employed. That is because it attains the same security levels with traditional cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. We provide a generic implementation of ECC that runs on different host operating systems, such as Contiki, TinyOS, iSenseOS, ScatterWeb and Arduino. Furthermore, it runs on smartphone platforms such as Android and iPhone and also any linux based systems (e.g., raspberryPi). Our implementation does not contain any platform-specific specializations, allowing a single implementation to run natively on heterogeneous networks. We look into the Smart Parking application domain and provide a solution that protects the privacy of the users by totally avoiding the exchange of confidential information. We also show how to protect a user's privacy by adapting the tool of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) with our ECC implementation. We study the performance of our system in an real-world outdoor IoT testbed and analyze the execution time and network overhead for each available hardware platform. Our code is available as open source software and can be used from developers who wish to achieve certain levels of security and privacy in their applications. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Both sources-the Ministry of Health-Vital Registration system and the Chinese Disease Surveillance Point system-present their own challenges. A new approach to cause of death assignment is a smartphone-based shortened version of a verbal autopsy survey. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of this new method conducted by township health care providers (THP) and village doctors (VD) in rural China, where a large proportion of deaths occur in homes and cause of death data are inaccurate or lacking. Methods: The Population Health Metrics Research Consortium mobile phone-based shortened verbal autopsy questionnaire was made available on an Android system-based application, and cause of death was derived using the Tariff method (Tariff 2.0); we called this set of tools ""msVA."" msVA was administered to relatives of the deceased by six THPs and six VDs in 24 villages located in six townships of Luquan County, Hebei Province, China. Subsequently, interviews were conducted among 12 interviewers, 12 randomly selected respondents, and five study staff to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using msVA for mortality data collection. Results: Between July 2013 and August 2013, 268 deaths took place in the study villages. Among the 268 deaths, 227 VAs were completed (nine refusals, 31 migrations and one loss of data due to breakdown of the smartphone). The average time for a VA interview was 21.5 ± 3.4 min (20.1 ± 3.5 min for THP and 23.2 ± 4.1 min for VD). Both THPs and VDs could be successful interviewers; the latter needed more training but had more willingness to implement msVA in the future. The interviews revealed that both interviewers and relatives of the deceased found msVA to be feasible, acceptable, and more desirable than traditional methods. The cost of conducting a new VA was $8.87 per death. Conclusions: Conduction of msVA by VDs in their own villages was feasible and acceptable in rural northern China. Broader implementation of msVA across rural China could potentially improve the coverage and quality of cause of death data, allowing for better national health evaluation and program planning. © 2016 The Author(s).","Cause of death; Feasibility study; MsVA; Smartphone-based; Township health care provider; Verbal autopsy; Village doctor","cause of death; electronic equipment; feasibility study; health care; health survey; health worker; public health; questionnaire survey; research method; training; village; adult; Article; cause of death; China; controlled study; feasibility study; female; health care personnel; human; interview; male; methodology; priority journal; program development; rural area; smartphone; verbal autopsy; autopsy; death; evaluation study; family; mobile application; questionnaire; rural population; China; Hebei; Luquan; Yunnan; Autopsy; Cause of Death; China; Death; Family; Feasibility Studies; Health Personnel; Humans; Mobile Applications; Rural Population; Smartphone; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84982279487

Such platforms can offer improvements for both patients and healthcare systems. For patients, advantages include improved health management as well as satisfaction, enabling them to better understand their medical condition and improve their compliance with medication regimes. For healthcare systems, advantages include more effective patient management and increased pay-for-performance reimbursements, enabling real time tracking of critical patient specific data to provide comprehensive, effective medical condition management.

To evaluate the fundamental hardness of a location estimator, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) has been used by many researchers. The CRB is computed by inverting the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which measures the amount of information carried by given distance measurements. The measurements are commonly expressed as actual distances plus white noise. However, the measurements do include extra noise types caused by time synchronization, acoustic sensing latency, and signal-tonoise ratio. Such noise can significantly affect the performance and depend highly on the sensing platforms such as Android smartphones. In this paper, we first remodel the acousticbased distance measurements considering such additive errors. Then, we derive a new FIM with the new statistical ranging error models. As a result, we obtain new CRBs for both noncooperative and cooperative localization schemes that provide better insight into the causality of the uncertainties. Theoretical analysis also proves that the proposed CRBs for localization become the old CRBs when the additional errors are ignored, which gives a robust check for the new CRBs. Thus, the new CRBs can serve as a benchmark for localization estimators with both new and old measurement models. The new CRBs also indicate that there is room to improve current localization schemes; however, it is a daunting challenge. © 2016 IEEE.","Cramer-Rao bound; Noise diversity; Smartphone diversity; Sound localization; Time difference of arrivals; Time of arrivals","Acoustic noise; Codes (symbols); Cramer-Rao bounds; Direction of arrival; Distributed computer systems; Error analysis; Errors; Fisher information matrix; Smartphones; Time difference of arrival; Time of arrival; Amount of information; Cooperative localization; Cramer-rao bound (CRB); Noise diversity; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Sound localization; Time difference of arrival measurements; Time synchronization; White noise",2-s2.0-84985995044

Though password managers can ameliorate password fatigue, the vast majority of password managers require the user to choose and maintain a strong master password while offering little to no recourse in the event that the master password is compromised. The wide-application of cloud-based password managers congregate passwords in an encrypted database, which becomes an attractive target for attackers and also represents a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose Amnesia, a bilateral generative password manager that requires both the knowledge of the master password and the possession of the user's smartphone to generate website passwords for the user. Our generative password manager is not vulnerable to the password database leakage, since it generates the requested password on demand using both the master password and the secret information on the smartphone. An attacker wishing to steal the user's website passwords has to compromise both the user's smartphone and the master password. Amnesia also has strong recovery capability when either the master password is compromised or the smartphone is lost/stolen. By using an Amnesia server, a user can have the access to the password manager on multiple computers without installing any software on those computers. We implemented an Amnesia system prototype using Android and Cherrypy web framework and evaluated it in terms of security, usability, and overhead. A user study of 31 testers shows that Amnesia increases password security while maintaining reasonable user convenience. © 2016 IEEE.","bilateral; generative; password manager","Distributed computer systems; Managers; Mobile security; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Websites; bilateral; Encrypted database; generative; Multiple computers; Password managers; Password security; Recovery capabilities; Secret information; Authentication",2-s2.0-84985911633

This type of system must be inexpensive, accurate and low power consuming for daily use. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface should be provided on the device.

Current smartphone devices embody miniaturized Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and other sensors capable of providing user position, velocity and attitude. However, it is hard to characterize their actual positioning and navigation performance capabilities due to the disparate sensor and software technologies adopted among manufacturers and the high influence of environmental conditions, and therefore, a unified certification process is missing. This paper presents the analysis results obtained from the assessment of two modern smartphones regarding their positioning accuracy (i.e., precision and trueness) capabilities (i.e., potential and limitations) based on a practical but rigorous methodological approach. Our investigation relies on the results of several vehicle tracking (i.e., cruising and maneuvering) tests realized through comparing smartphone obtained trajectories and kinematic parameters to those derived using a high-end GNSS/IMU system and advanced filtering techniques. Performance testing is undertaken for the HTC One S (Android) and iPhone 5s (iOS). Our findings indicate that the deviation of the smartphone locations from ground truth (trueness) deteriorates by a factor of two in obscured environments compared to those derived in open sky conditions. Moreover, it appears that iPhone 5s produces relatively smaller and less dispersed error values compared to those computed for HTC One S. Also, the navigation solution of the HTC One S appears to adapt faster to changes in environmental conditions, suggesting a somewhat different data filtering approach for the iPhone 5s. Testing the accuracy of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors for a number of maneuvering (speeding, turning, etc.,) events reveals high consistency between smartphones, whereas the small deviations from ground truth verify their high potential even for critical ITS safety applications. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","GNSS; Intelligent transportation system; MEMS IMU; Precision; Smartphone; Trueness","Air navigation; Automobile manufacture; Collision avoidance; Environmental technology; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Maneuverability; Navigation; Safety testing; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Tracking (position); Transportation; Units of measurement; GNSS; Intelligent transportation systems; Mems-imu; Precision; Trueness; Global positioning system",2-s2.0-84982833328

The lack of regulatory body assessing the content of existing apps means that their quality is often unknown. This review aims to assess the quality of smartphone apps that claim to provide information and treatment for pain conditions. It assesses the degree to which apps adhere to evidence-based practices in psychological research for pain management and which stand the best chance of being effective for consumers. Another aim is to identify potential apps health-care professionals may wish to recommend to clients. Pain management apps on the official iPhone and Android stores were searched in January 2014. Those containing a psychological component in the app description were downloaded and rated for quality using a checklist devised by two researchers. The checklist was based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) guidelines since the latter is the most effective intervention for computerized programs. A total of 195 apps met inclusion criteria. Although CBT is a promising alternative to traditional psychological interventions, only six apps endorsed theoretical reference to CBT principles. Existing apps are often constructed by lay people or software developers, with little input from health-care professionals. Pain apps sometimes promise a solution to pain without a consideration of app content. The development of evidence-based apps and rigorous evaluation of any long-term outcomes are important in enhancing understanding of the potential of these apps. © 2016, © The British Pain Society 2016.","applications; computerized cognitive behavioural therapy; pain management; psychological; Smartphones","analgesia; arthritis; Article; backache; cognitive therapy; evidence based practice; fibromyalgia; Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; headache; health care personnel; human; migraine; mobile application; pain; pain measurement; priority journal; rating scale; smartphone; telemedicine; visual analog scale",2-s2.0-85006217640

In this paper, we did a comprehensive study on the security vulnerabilities caused by mobile phishing attacks, including web page phishing attacks, application phishing attacks, and account registry phishing attacks. Existing schemes designed for web phishing attacks on personal computers (PCs) cannot effectively address the various phishing attacks on mobile devices. Hence, we propose MobiFish, which is a novel automated lightweight antiphishing scheme for mobile platforms. MobiFish verifies the validity of web pages, applications, and persistent accounts by comparing the actual identity to the claimed identity. MobiFish has been implemented on a Nexus 4 smartphone running the Android 4.2 operating system. We experimentally evaluate the performance of MobiFish with 100 phishing URLs and corresponding legitimate URLs, as well as phishing apps. The results show that MobiFish is very effective in detecting phishing attacks on mobile phones. © 2015 IEEE.","Mobile computing; phishing attacks; security and protection","Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personal computers; Websites; Anti-phishing; Mobile phishing; Mobile platform; Mobile users; Phishing; Phishing attacks; Security and protection; Security vulnerabilities; Computer crime",2-s2.0-84982313499

Yet, it is usually ignored by medical practitioners due to limitations with available measurements techniques that are either performed through visual counting by trained personnel or using invasive and/or devices limited to medical facilities. We present Zephyr, a ubiquitous low-cost smartphone-based robust respiratory rate estimator. Our analysis shows that accelerometer and gyroscope measurements from a standard smartphone held on a person's chest is affected by her respiration cycle. Zephyr employs a series of signal processing modules to extract the breathing signal from the noisy inertial sensor measurements and handle noisy user movements. Furthermore, as part of Zephyr design, we propose a novel respiratory rate signal quality estimate that we leverage through a probabilistic framework to fuse the estimates from the different sensors, leading to a robust respiratory rate estimate. Implementation of the system on different off-the-shelf Android devices using more than 150 experiments with seven participants of different ages and genders under different typical settings with a side-by-side comparison to a commercial device shows that Zephyr can estimate the user's respiratory rate accurately with a median absolute error of 0.04 breaths per minute in realtime. In addition, Zephyr's quality-based probabilistic framework improves the respiratory rate estimation by more than 51% as compared to using any of the individual sensor measurements. This remarkable accuracy is achieved within 30 seconds of measurements, highlighting the viability of Zephyr as a ubiquitous low-cost respiratory rate estimator. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Medical problems; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Smartphones; Breathing signals; Commercial Devices; Medical practitioner; Multi-sensor fusion; Probabilistic framework; Respiration cycle; Respiratory rate estimations; Sensor measurements; Cost estimating",2-s2.0-84983287951

Traditional software-based security mechanisms have failed to provide strong security against these attacks. Similar threats on the PC have been countered using the concepts of Trusted Computing—a highly flexible trust mechanism with strong security properties. However, smartphone platforms have yet to see any Trusted Computing applications—primarily because of the difficulty in adopting this relatively new paradigm of security. In this paper, we present the design of a high-level application programming interface (API) that allows Android-based smartphone application developers to adopt Trusted Computing and use it in their applications without having to learn the intricate details of how Trusted Computing works. The API abstracts away the complexity in using Trusted Computing constructs by offering easy-to-use interfaces for complex tasks. The API has enhanced the usability of Trusted Computing development by significantly reducing the number of lines and complexity of code required to perform these diverse tasks.

Besides, these features were manually extracted according to the experience of the researchers.

In order to improve the overall situation without having the user feel encumbered, our Crowd Assisted Navigation app is designed for smartphones (including both iPhones and Android phones), which are by far the most commonly used mobile devices among those with low vision. Many individuals would rather forget their wallets at home than their phones. A smartphone is easily accessible and its use does not attract undue attention towards the user's need of aid for his/her disability. The app's primary objective is to assist a visually impaired or blind user in navigating from point A to point B through reliable directions given from an online community. The phone is able to stream live video to a crowd of sighted users through our website. The crowd is then able to give directions from the website with the push of one of the four arrow keys, indicating either left, right, forward, or stop. The aggregation of these directions will be relayed back to the user by audio. © 2015 IEEE.","Assistive technology; Crowd sourcing; Mobile; Navigation; Visually impaired","Big data; Internet; Mobile devices; Navigation; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Trusted computing; Websites; Assisted navigations; Assistive technology; Mobile; On-line communities; Primary objective; User's needs; Visually impaired; World Health Organization; Ubiquitous computing",2-s2.0-84983382028

In this scenario, devices collaborate with each other using short wireless links to create ad-hoc P2P networks for distributed task execution. Experiments on human movement, a non-negligible factor in the D2D context, have shown that people move in group or meet frequently, which suggests that D2D is possible. In this work, we examine the case of parallel compression of smartphone recorded videos with the help of nearby devices. First, we present a mathematical formulation of the problem that optimizes the compression time on the number of nearby helping devices, and show that the problem can be mapped as a water-filling problem. Then, we present real results of the compression time and energy when the compression is performed on one device and when it is parallelized among collaborating devices.

Software was installed in an Android smartphone for measuring red, green, and blue light intensities. The blue color was suitable for creating a calibration relationship for iron. The optimum distance from the smartphone camera to the sample holder was 5Â cm. The brightness was controlled by a table lamp with a 7Â W light emitting diode located at 25Â cm above the sample holder. Under these conditions, there was no influence from ambient light. A calibration equation was created from 0–1.2% (w/w) iron and stored in the program for analysis. The results agreed well with flame atomic absorption spectrophotometric measurements with a sample throughput exceeding 40Â h−1. The relative standard deviation and the relative error were less than 1%. This method was convenient, rapid, simple, inexpensive, and easy with little chemical waste produced.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of two cohort studies (a North Carolina-based study and the Early Pregnancy Study [EPS]) and a prospective multicentre trial (World Health Organization [WHO] study). The North Carolina study consisted of 68 sexually active women with either an intrauterine device or tubal ligation. The EPS comprised 221 women who planned to become pregnant and had no known fertility problems. The WHO study consisted of 706 women from five geographically and culturally diverse settings. Bayesian statistical methods were used to design our proposed method, Dynamic Optimal Timing (DOT). Simulation studies were used to estimate the cumulative pregnancy risk. Results: For the proposed method, simulation analyses indicated a 4.4% cumulative probability of pregnancy over 13 cycles with correct use. After a calibration window, this method flagged between 11 and 13 days when unprotected intercourse should be avoided per cycle. Eligible women should have cycle lengths between 20 and 40 days with a variability range less than or equal to 9 days. Conclusions: DOT can easily be implemented by computer or smartphone applications, allowing for women to make more informed decisions about their fertility. This approach is already incorporated into a patent-pending system and is available for free download on iPhones and Androids. © 2016 The European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health.","Fertility awareness; health; personalised medicine","adult; Article; awareness; dynamic optimal timing; female; female fertility; fertile period; human; menstruation; ovulation; personalized medicine; pregnancy; priority journal; retrospective study; smartphone; statistical analysis; unprotected sex; Bayes theorem; clinical trial; family planning; fertility; menstrual cycle; mobile application; physiology; procedures; Bayes Theorem; Female; Fertility; Humans; Menstrual Cycle; Mobile Applications; Natural Family Planning Methods; Smartphone",2-s2.0-84974808348

A smartphone application was created to utilize 120 digit-triplets in noise as test material. An adaptive test procedure determined the speech reception threshold (SRT). Experiments were performed to determine headphones effects on the SRT and to establish normative data. Study sample: Participants consisted of 40 normal-hearing subjects with thresholds ≤15 dB across the frequency spectrum (250–8000 Hz) and 186 subjects with normal-hearing in both ears, or normal-hearing in the better ear. Results: The results show steep speech recognition functions with a slope of 20%/dB for digit-triplets presented in noise using the smartphone application.

Android has been ranked as the top smartphone platform nowadays. Studies show that Android malware have increased dramatically and that personal privacy theft has become a major form of attack in recent years. These critical security circumstances have generated a strong interest in developing systems that automatically detect malicious behaviour in Android applications (apps). However, most methods of detecting sensitive data leakage have certain shortcomings, including computational expensiveness and false positives. Objective. This study proposes an Android malware detecting system that provides highly accurate classification and efficient sensitive data transmission analysis. Method. The study adopts a machine learning approach that leverages the use of dataflow application program interfaces (APIs) as classification features to detect Android malware. We conduct a thorough analysis to extract dataflow-related API-level features and improve the k-nearest neighbour classification model. The dataflow-related API list is further optimized through machine learning, which enables us to improve considerably the efficiency of sensitive data transmission analysis, whereas analytical accuracy is approximated to that of the experiment using a full dataflow-related API list. Results. The proposed scheme is evaluated using 1160 benign and 1050 malicious samples. Results show that the system can achieve an accuracy rate of as high as 97.66% in detecting unknown Android malware. Our experiment of static dataflow analysis shows that more than 85% of sensitive data transmission paths can be determined using the refined API subset, whereas time of analysis decreases by nearly 40%. Conclusion. The usage of dataflow-related APIs is a valid feature for identifying Android malware. The proposed scheme provides an efficient approach to detecting Android malware and investigating privacy violations in malicious apps. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Android security; Malware detection; Privacy leakage","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Data communication systems; Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Learning systems; Malware; Nearest neighbor search; Android securities; Application program interfaces; Classification features; Classification models; Machine learning approaches; Malware detection; Privacy leakages; Static data-flow analysis; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84961588444

This article presents the design and implementation of Samba-an aquatic surveillance robot that integrates an off-the-shelf Android smartphone and a robotic fish to monitor harmful aquatic processes such as oil spills and harmful algal blooms. Using the built-in camera of the smartphone, Samba can detect spatially dispersed aquatic processes in dynamic and complex environment. To reduce the excessive false alarms caused by the nonwater area (e.g., trees on the shore), Samba segments the captured images and performs target detection in the identified water area only. However, a major challenge in the design of Samba is the high energy consumption resulted from continuous image segmentation. We propose a novel approach that leverages the power-efficient inertial sensors on smartphones to assist image processing. In particular, based on the learned mapping models between inertial and visual features, Samba uses real-time inertial sensor readings to estimate the visual features that guide image segmentation, significantly reducing the energy consumption and computation overhead. Samba also features a set of lightweight and robust computer vision algorithms, which detect harmful aquatic processes based on their distinctive color features. Last, Samba employs a feedback-based rotation control algorithm to adapt to spatiotemporal development of the target aquatic process. We have implemented a Samba prototype and evaluated it through extensive field experiments, lab experiments, and trace-driven simulations. The results show that Samba can achieve a 94% detection rate, a 5% false alarm rate, and a lifetime up to nearly 2 months. © 2016 ACM 1550-4859/2016/07-ART25 $15.00.","Computer vision; Inertial sensing; Object detection; Robotic sensor; Smartphone","Algorithms; Computer vision; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Errors; Image processing; Image segmentation; Inertial navigation systems; Machine design; Object detection; Object recognition; Oil spills; Robotics; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Complex environments; Computation overheads; Computer vision algorithms; Design and implementations; High energy consumption; Inertial sensing; Robotic sensor; Trace driven simulation; Aquatic ecosystems",2-s2.0-84979915841

An experiment with 12 participants is performed to evaluate the impact of UI displacements on the homescreen. To make the distribution of apps in the experiment task less contrived, naturally generated data from a pilot study is used.

However, little is known about the personal technology use of military service members and the behavioral health care providers that treat them. This study reports the technology use of 1,101 active duty service members and 45 behavioral health care providers at a large military installation. Participants reported Internet usage; ownership of smartphones, tablets, and e-readers; usage of mobile applications (apps); and basic demographic information. Compared with providers, service members reported higher rates of smartphone ownership, were more likely to own Android smartphones than iPhones, and spent more time gaming. Both groups spent a comparable amount of time using social media. With the exception of gaming, however, differences between service members and providers were not statistically significant when demographics were matched and controlled. Among service members, younger respondents (18–34) were statistically more likely than older respondents (35–58) to own smartphones, spend time gaming, and engage in social media. Our findings can help inform provider’s technology-based education and intervention of their patients and guide the development of new technologies to support the psychological health of service members. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.",,"army; education; health care personnel; human; human experiment; Internet; mobile application; psychological well being; smartphone; social media; tablet",2-s2.0-84978254147

Better asthma control may be achieved if patients are involved in regular self-monitoring of symptoms and self-management according to a written asthma action plan. Telehealth applications to optimize asthma management and outcomes in pregnant women have not yet been evaluated. This study evaluated the efficacy of a telehealth programme supported by a handheld respiratory device in improving asthma control during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women with asthma (n = 72) from two antenatal clinics in Melbourne, Australia, were randomized to one of two groups: (i) intervention—involving a telehealth programme (management of asthma with supportive telehealth of respiratory function in pregnancy (MASTERY©)) supported by a handheld respiratory device and an Android smart phone application (Breathe-easy©) and written asthma action plan or (ii) control—usual care. The primary outcome was change in asthma control at 3 and 6 months (prenatal). Secondary outcomes included changes in quality of life and lung function, and perinatal/neonatal outcomes. Results: At baseline, participants' mean (± standard deviation) age was 31.4 ± 4.5 years and gestational age 16.7 ± 3.1 weeks. At 6 months, the MASTERY group had better asthma control (P = 0.02) and asthma-related quality of life (P = 0.002) compared with usual care. There were no significant differences between groups in lung function, unscheduled health-care visits, days off work/study, oral corticosteroid use, or perinatal outcomes. Differences between groups were not significant at 3 months.

Due to its significant impact on the energy budget of battery equipped devices, energy preserving solutions have been investigated for a long time, often introducing duty cycling. Ultimately, these solutions settle for trade-offs between energy and performance, leaving the final decision on how much energy to allocate to neighbor discovery in the hands of application developers or system engineers. In other words, someone must decide if an improvement in the quality of the discovery (e.g. better discovery latency) is worth an increase in energy consumption. In this paper, we devise a different approach in order to answer the following basic question: how many contacts can a smartphone discover using its battery energy budget? The answer clearly depends on the adopted discovery algorithm, on the mobility conditions, and on the stochastic characteristics of the encounters. However, we demonstrate that there is a natural optimum duty cycle that maximizes the number of discovered contacts in almost every real application scenario. This optimum is natural in the sense that it does not depend on any system level parameter or performance requirements. It depends uniquely on the stochastic characteristics of the meeting process between the nodes. We present an analytic analysis and devise a practical algorithm that dynamically adapts the duty cycle length to the time-varying context, without the need to make assumptions on (or predict) the distribution of the contact duration. The findings presented in the paper are validated against data coming from real human mobility traces and implemented on a mobile application. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","android; duty cycle; energy saving; loose synchronization; mobile network; Neighbor discovery; opportunistic networks","Economic and social effects; Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Secondary batteries; Stochastic systems; Wireless networks; android; Duty-cycle; Loose synchronizations; Neighbor discovery; Opportunistic networks; Budget control",2-s2.0-84976571780

Therefore, number of malwares focused on smartphones goes up while capabilities of smartphones increase. It is well-known fact that Android is the leader of smartphone market. This unluckily leads attackers to the Android platform. Furthermore, attackers use motion sensors as a side-channel information to obtain user's private data. There are several studies in the literature which show how motion sensors can be used as a side-channel. In this study, the main object is to determine user's age interval by using accelerometer sensor as a side-channel.

Considering the structure of current smartphones, it is impossible to apply the ordinary range-domain Differential GNSS (DGNSS) method. Therefore, this paper describes and applies a DGNSS-correction projection method to a commercial smartphone. First, the local line-of-sight unit vector is calculated using the elevation and azimuth angle provided in the position-related output of Android’s LocationManager, and this is transformed to Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinates for use. To achieve position-domain correction for satellite systems other than GPS, such as GLONASS and BeiDou, the relevant line-of-sight unit vectors are used to construct an observation matrix suitable for multiple constellations. The results of static and dynamic tests show that the standalone GNSS accuracy is improved by about 30%–60%, thereby reducing the existing error of 3–4 m to just 1 m. The proposed algorithm enables the position error to be directly corrected via software, without the need to alter the hardware and infrastructure of the smartphone. This method of implementation and the subsequent improvement in performance are expected to be highly effective to portability and cost saving. © 2016 by the authors.","Android; Differential GNSS; Global navigation satellite system; Location-based system; Smartphone","Algorithms; Android (operating system); Communication satellites; Location; Location based services; Radio navigation; Satellites; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software testing; Telecommunication services; Tracking (position); Android; Differential GNSS; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Location-based systems; Multiple constellations; Observation matrix; Projection method; Static and dynamic tests; Global positioning system",2-s2.0-84975166478

This rapid growth has given access for certain parties to make it as a crime target through malware spreading. Various efforts are needed to be taken to minimize the number of Android users, which are victimized by these malware activities. The encountered problem is that there is increasing the ability of malware that causes difficulties in the malware detection process. In general, the usual solution taken to handle this issue is by doing the malware detection using a signature-based method. However, this method can be easily avoided by polymorphic-Ability kind of malware. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a dynamic behavioral-based malware detection through observing the use of System Call. Considering the large number of malware that have to be detected and the system call that should be observed, the help of machine learning is needed for the classification process purpose, one of which is Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. This study shows that the observation towards system call with its classification using SVM yields 90% accuracy for polynomial kernel and 86% for the RBF kernel. This proves that the system call can be used to make polymorphic malware detection. In this research, however, the use of the system call is not able to distinctly distinguish between malware and nonmalware. This has something to do with the use of the same accustomed data with the experimental data. The classification result could reach a quite high level of accuracy because the experimental data used are the observation result from the same application with the accustomed data. This is considered a weakness since this method is unable to identify new applications in which its system call frequency has never been observed and trained with SVM. © 2015 IEEE.","Cybercrime; Malware Detection; Support Vector Machine; System Call","Android (operating system); Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Electronic crime countermeasures; Learning systems; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Android smartphone; Classification process; Classification results; Cybercrime; Malware detection; Polymorphic malware; Polynomial kernels; System calls; Malware",2-s2.0-84979234627

However, there is a need for more effective tools and technologies to facilitate structured lifestyle interventions and to ensure a better compliance, sustainability, and health benefits of exercise training in patients with T2D. The InterWalk initiative and its innovative application (app) for smartphones described in this study were developed by the Danish Centre for Strategic Research in T2D aiming at implementing, testing, and validating interval walking in patients with T2D in Denmark. The interval walking training approach consists of repetitive 3-minute cycles of slow and fast walking with simultaneous intensity guiding, based on the exercise capacity of the user. The individual intensity during slow and fast walking is determined by a short initial self-conducted and audio-guided fitness test, which combined with automated audio instructions strives to motivate the individual to adjust the intensity to the predetermined individualized walking intensities. The InterWalk app data are collected prospectively from all users and will be linked to the unique Danish nationwide databases and administrative registries, allowing extensive epidemiological studies of exercise in patients with T2D, such as the level of adherence to InterWalk training and long-term effectiveness surveys of important health outcomes, including cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Hence, we proposed MORPh, a cross-layer optimization system for OLED. We first analyze three fundamental parameters extracted from the smartphone camera and their impact on OLED power consumption and visual quality. We then define corresponding metrics to assess power optimization potentials, and propose a set of algorithms that optimize camera recording to be more OLED friendly.

A photochromic Ormosil (Organically Modified Silicates) coating doped by the spirooxazine dye (SO-G) was prepared. The coating, with the broad absorption at 450-650 nm, exhibited as a grey tone on its appearance under ultraviolet irradiation. The spectrokinetics of the SO-G doped Ormosil coating was investigated by monitoring the changes of absorption values at 495 nm with time. During its photochromic process, the equilibrium time for both photostationary states were less than 20 s. Tests of photochromic reversibility showed the reproducibility of at least 90 cycles. The UVI indication card was fabricated using the photochromic Ormosil coating and a printed standard depth scale was used for the UVI sensing strip to evaluate the instantaneous ultraviolet index. The relationship between the relative grayscales (Gy∗) and the ultraviolet index was studied, and the linearity was obtained. The colorimetric analysis system including acquisition and processing of the image for colorimetric analysis was then built on the smartphone. By applying the UVI indication card as well as the Android application developed which brought the user experiences of visualization, convenience and participation, users can monitor fluctuating of the ultraviolet indexes all day long. This method is advantageous for application in smartphones used by nonprofessional consumers and is valuable to be investigated in-depth for the commercial importance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

SOAR features real-time debris detection and coverage-based rotation scheduling algorithms. The image processing algorithms for debris detection are specifically designed to address the unique challenges in aquatic environments. The rotation scheduling algorithm provides effective coverage for sporadic debris arrivals despite camera's limited angular view. Moreover, SOAR is able to dynamically offload compute-intensive processing tasks to the cloud for battery power conservation.

For example, government agents and malicious merchants can invade the privacy of phone users through this kind of attacks. In this paper, we describe a vulnerability of smartphone charging and introduce juice filming attacks that can steal sensitive information by recording screen activities during charging. We show that the display of smartphones can be leaked through a standard micro-USB connector using the Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) standard or the iPhones' lightning connector, making our attack feasible in both Android OS and iOS.

In this type of setting, a huge and expensive manipulandum is frequently used, requiring a large budget and wide open space. Subjects also need to travel to the laboratory, which is a burden for them. This burden is particularly severe for patients with neurological disorders. Here, we describe the development of a novel application based on Unity3D and smart devices, e.g., smartphones or tablet devices, that can be used to conduct motor learning experiments at any time and in any place, without requiring a large budget and wide open space and without the burden of travel on subjects. We refer to our application as POrtable Motor learning LABoratory, or PoMLab. PoMLab is a multiplatform application that is available and sharable for free. We investigated whether PoMLab could be an alternative to the laboratory setting using a visuomotor rotation paradigm that causes sensory prediction error, enabling the investigation of how subjects minimize the error. In the first experiment, subjects could adapt to a constant visuomotor rotation that was abruptly applied at a specific trial. The learning curve for the first experiment could be modeled well using a state space model, a mathematical model that describes the motor leaning process. In the second experiment, subjects could adapt to a visuomotor rotation that gradually increased each trial. The subjects adapted to the gradually increasing visuomotor rotation without being aware of the visuomotor rotation. These experimental results have been reported for conventional experiments conducted in a laboratory setting, and our PoMLab application could reproduce these results. PoMLab can thus be considered an alternative to the laboratory setting. We also conducted follow-up experiments in university physical education classes. A state space model that was fit to the data obtained in the laboratory experiments could predict the learning curves obtained in the follow-up experiments. Further, we investigated the influence of vibration function, weight, and screen size on learning curves. Finally, we compared the learning curves obtained in the PoMLab experiments to those obtained in the conventional reaching experiments. The results of the in-class experiments show that PoMLab can be used to conduct motor learning experiments at any time and place. © 2016 Takiyama, Shinya.

For many, the use of wheelchairs is paramount to provide mobility and social inclusion. Nevertheless, they still face a number of challenges to properly function in our society. Among the many difficulties, one in particular stands out: navigating in complex internal environments (indoors). The main objective of this work is to propose an architecture based on Mobile Augmented Reality to support the development of indoor navigation systems dedicated to wheelchair users, that is also capable of recording CAD drawings of the buildings and dealing with accessibility issues for that population. Methods: Overall, five main functional requirements are proposed: the ability to allow for indoor navigation by means of Mobile Augmented Reality techniques; the capacity to register and configure building CAD drawings and the position of fiducial markers, points of interest and obstacles to be avoided by the wheelchair user; the capacity to find the best route for wheelchair indoor navigation, taking stairs and other obstacles into account; allow for the visualization of virtual directional arrows in the smartphone displays; and incorporate touch or voice commands to interact with the application. The architecture is proposed as a combination of four layers: User interface; Control; Service; and Infrastructure. A proof-of-concept application was developed and tests were performed with disable volunteers operating manual and electric wheelchairs. Results: The application was implemented in Java for the Android operational system. A local database was used to store the test building CAD drawings and the position of fiducial markers and points of interest. The Android Augmented Reality library was used to implement Augmented Reality and the Blender open source library handled the basis for implementing directional navigation arrows. OpenGL ES provided support for various graphics and mathematical transformations for embedded systems, such as smartphones. Experiments were performed in an academic building with various labs, classrooms and male and female bathrooms. Two disable volunteers using wheelchairs showed no difficulties to interact with the application, either by entering touch or voice commands, and to navigate within the testing environment with the help of the navigational arrows implemented by the augmented reality modules. Conclusion: The novel features implemented in the proposed architecture, with special emphasis on the use of Mobile Augmented Reality and the ability to identify the best routes free of potential hazards for wheelchair users, were capable of providing significant benefits for wheelchair indoor navigation when compared to current techniques described in the literature. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Biomedica.

Device pairing is critical for bootstrapping secure communication between two previously unassociated devices over the wireless channel. Using auxiliary out-of-band channels involving visual, acoustic, tactile, or vibrational sensors has been proposed as a feasible option to facilitate device pairing. However, these methods usually require users to perform additional tasks, such as copying, comparing, and shaking. It is preferable to have a natural and intuitive pairing method with minimal user tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new method, called MagPairing, for pairing smartphones in close proximity by exploiting correlated magnetometer readings. In MagPairing, users only need to naturally tap the smartphones together for a few seconds without performing any additional operations in authentication and key establishment. Our method exploits the fact that smartphones are equipped with tiny magnets. Highly correlated magnetic field patterns are produced when two smartphones are close to each other. We design MagPairing protocol and implement it on Android smartphones. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate MagPairing. Experiments verify that the captured sensor data on which MagPairing is based has high entropy and sufficient length, and is nondisclosure to attackers more than few centimeters away. Usability tests on various kinds of smartphones by totally untrained users show that the whole pairing process needs only 4.5 s on average with more than 90% success rate. © 2015 IEEE.","authentication; Device pairing; magnetometer; smartphone; usability","Authentication; Magnetometers; Secure communication; Smartphones; Device pairing; Extensive simulations; Highly-correlated; Key establishments; Real world experiment; usability; Wireless channel; Wireless devices; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84963799351

The implementation of these systems in diseases which are a frequent cause of visit to the doctor like ophthalmologic pathologies are, which affect directly to our quality of life, takes more importance. This paper aims to develop OphthalDSS, a totally new mobile DSS for red eye diseases diagnosis. The main utilities that OphthalDSS offers will be a study guide for medical students and a clinical decision support system for primary care professionals. Other important goal of this paper is to show the user experience results after OphthalDSS being used by medical students of the University of Valladolid.

It is not too infrequent, especially in the emerging economies, to have unmarked bumps that can be perilous for the passengers. Fortuitously, the roadways and mobile phone networks have grown simultaneously in emerging economies. This paper demonstrates the capability of smartphones placed inside the vehicles in characterisation of road bumps. The smart mobile phones have accelerometers and position sensors that can be useful for autonomous monitoring roads. This can empower the user community in monitoring of roads. However, the capability of the smartphone in discerning different types of speed bumps while travelling in heterogeneous vehicle types needs to be examined. Methods A range of road vehicles is mathematically modelled as mass, spring, and damper systems. The mathematical model of the vehicle is excited with parameters analogous to some common speed bumps and its acceleration response is calculated. The accelerometer of a smartphone is validated by comparing it with high precision accelerometers. The acceleration response of the phone while passing over the corresponding road bumps, which was used in the model earlier, is recorded using an Android based application. The experiment is repeated for different classes of vehicles. Filters have been used to reduce noise in the signals. A time averaging technique has been employed to compress the collected data. Results and conclusions The acceleration signals have been digitally processed to capture road bumps. The importance of using a mathematical model to understand the acceleration response of a vehicle has been established. Also, the use of pass filters to extract the signal of concern from the noisy data has been exhibited. The ability of the technique to discern different types of speed bumps while travelling in a variety of vehicle types has been demonstrated. This investigation demonstrates the potential to automatically monitor the condition of roadways obviating costly manual inspections. As smartphones are ubiquitous, the methodology has the potential to empower the user community in the maintenance of infrastructure. © 2016 The Author(s).","Accelerometers; Dynamic response; Feature recognition; Pass filters; Road bumps; Smartphones","Accelerometers; Cellular telephones; Data compression; Dynamic response; Mobile phones; Roads and streets; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Smartphones; Speed; Telephone circuits; Telephone sets; Vehicles; Acceleration response; Acceleration signals; Autonomous monitoring; Controlling vehicles; Feature recognition; Heterogeneous vehicles; Mobile phone networks; Road bumps; Transportation",2-s2.0-84976417279

A large part of the energy consumed goes to wireless communication. In this article, we first study the energy efficiency of different video content delivery strategies used by service providers and identify a number of sources of energy inefficiency. Specifically, we find a fundamental tradeoff in energy waste between prefetching small and large chunks of video content: small chunks are bad because each download causes a fixed tail energy to be spent regardless of the amount of content downloaded, whereas large chunks increase the risk of downloading data that user will never view because of abandoning the video. Hence, the key to optimal strategy lies in the ability to predict when the user might abandon viewing prematurely. We then propose an algorithm called eSchedule that uses viewing statistics to predict viewer behavior and computes an energy optimal download strategy for a given mobile client. The algorithm also includes a mechanism for explicit control of traffic overhead, i.e., unnecessary download of content that the user will never watch. Our evaluation results suggest that the algorithm can cut the energy waste down to less than half compared to other strategies. We also present and experiment with an Android prototype that integrates eSchedule into a YouTube downloader. © 2015 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; mobile communication; video","Algorithms; Communication channels (information theory); Energy efficiency; Video recording; Wireless telecommunication systems; Evaluation results; Mobile video streaming; Number of sources; Optimal strategies; Service provider; Traffic overhead; Video content delivery; Wireless communications; Video streaming",2-s2.0-84928974966

Today, even low-power devices such as smartwatches use GPUs for rendering and composition. However, the computer architecture community has largely ignored these developments when evaluating new architecture proposals. A common approach when evaluating CPU designs for the mobile space has been to use software rendering instead of a GPU model. However, due to the ubiquity of GPUs in mobile devices, they are used in both 3D applications and 2D applications. For example, when running a 2D application such as the web browser in Android with a software renderer instead of a GPU, the CPU ends up executing twice as many instructions. Both the CPU characteristics and the memory system characteristics differ significantly between the browser and the software renderer. The software renderer typically executes tight loops of vector instructions, while the browser predominantly consists of integer instructions and complex control flow with hard-to-predict branches. Including software rendering results in unrepresentative benchmark performance. In this paper, we use gem5 to quantify the effects of software rendering on a set of common mobile workloads. We also introduce the NoMali stub GPU model that can be used as a drop-in replacement for a real Mali GPU model. This model behaves like a normal GPU, but does not render anything. Using this stub GPU, we demonstrate how most of the problems associated with software rendering can be avoided, while at the same time simulating a representative graphics stack. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Application programs; Benchmarking; Computer architecture; Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Mobile devices; Program processors; 3D application; Architecture community; Complex control flow; CPU design; Low-power devices; Memory systems; Software rendering; Rendering (computer graphics)",2-s2.0-84978719102

This puts the user's privacy at risk of being violated by overly curious apps or libraries (like advertisements). Central app markets conceptually represent a first line of defense against such invasions of the user's privacy, but unfortunately we are still lacking full support for automatic analysis of apps' internal data flows and supporting analysts in statically assessing apps' behavior. In this paper we present a novel slice-optimization approach to leverage static analysis of Android applications. Building on top of precise application lifecycle models, we employ a slicing-based analysis to generate data-dependent statements for arbitrary points of interest in an application. As a result of our optimization, the produced slices are, on average, 49% smaller than standard slices, thus facilitating code understanding and result validation by security analysts. Moreover, by re-targeting strings, our approach enables automatic assessments for a larger number of use-cases than prior work.

Seamless outdoors-indoors navigation, and especially for accurate indoors localization, is the main demand of LBS users. Onboard WiFi, Bluetooth (BT) or inertial-sensors technologies have been proven to somewhat provide alternative solutions in GNSS-signal-denied areas (i.e. indoors) to define SPs location. However, limited coverage of WiFi access-points (WAPs), pre-installed BT-anchors, constrained of WAPs/BT-anchors physical positions within a building, and limitations of existing localization techniques (in a standalone mode) on SPs are some of the main challenges to designing a spontaneous autonomous positioning solution with reliable accuracy at reasonable cost. This paper proposes an unconstrained indoors localization scheme (UNILS) based on cooperative SPs networking to tackle these challenges. The aim of this new scheme is to fuse multi-technologies measurements on SPs. The scheme uses relative-pseudoranging (based on time-of-arrival 'TOA' technique) approach between the connected SPs that are GNSS enabled, especially when the majority of the SPs are outdoors. Then the scheme combines this pseudoranges with uncertainty calculations from onboard dead-reckoning (DR) measurements using Kalman Filter, that can provide seamless and improve location accuracy significantly, especially when deep indoors. This means, in deep indoors, UNILS can utilize only available devices/sensors on SPs, when communication with WAPs or BT-anchors is considered unreliable or unavailable, to offer reasonable cost & good localization performance. Results obtained from actual trials & simulations (using OPNET) of this scheme (based on Android-SPs network implementations for various indoors scenarios) show that around 3-meters accuracy can be achieved when locating SPs at various deep indoors situations. © 2016 IEEE.","Bluetooth; DR; Fusing localization technologies; GNSS; Indoors-Smartphone localization; inertial sensor; TOA","Anchors; Bluetooth; Global positioning system; Indoor positioning systems; Inertial navigation systems; Location; Mobile devices; Navigation; Smartphones; Telecommunication services; Time of arrival; Uncertainty analysis; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Alternative solutions; GNSS; Inertial sensor; Localization performance; Localization schemes; Localization technique; Localization technologies; Uncertainty calculations; Location based services",2-s2.0-84978524664

Most works are focused on the cases when smartphones are actively used. However, one major issue with smartphones is that the standby time has become much shorter compared with traditional feature phones. Many users have to recharge their phones everyday even though they are not using the phones very often. In order to understand what happens with smartphone battery while the phone is not in use, we combine current measurements with user trace analysis to reveal how smartphones consume energy in the standby mode. We have identified several factors that cause energy wastes in the standby mode. Then we propose a series of optimization methods to demonstrate the potential of energy reduction on smartphone standby energy. Results based on user traces show that we can extend the standby time by as much as 87% with the proposed optimizations. © 2016 IEEE.","Android; energy consumption; energy optimization; Smartphones; standby energy","Cloud computing; Energy utilization; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Trace analysis; Android; Energy analysis; Energy optimization; Energy reduction; Energy wastes; Feature phones; Optimization method; standby energy; Mobile cloud computing",2-s2.0-84974573484

However, refusal rates of 24%–75% have been reported in telemedicine studies. We aimed to report the challenges faced when recruiting patients to use Android and iOS smartphone applications aimed at improving medication management and communication between patients and healthcare professionals. Methods: The patients invited to participate had heart failure and/or hypertension and/or dyslipidemia. After reaching the number of participants required for inclusion, the recruitment process was analyzed, and the study team determined the reasons for refusal. Results: Of the 448 potential participants who were invited to participate, 210 responded. Of these, 37.1% did not use a smartphone, 2.9% owned a mobile phone that was neither iOS nor Android, and 28.6% were smartphone users who refused to participate. In this case, the most common motive was that patients considered their routine healthcare sufficient and had no trouble remembering to take their medicines (81.7%). The final study sample comprised 48 patients. The mean age of the patients enrolled was significantly lower than that of participants who were not included (59.9 ± 10.6 vs. 66.8 ± 11.4 years, respectively; p=0.00). Conclusion: We found age to be an important barrier to smartphone use in healthcare. Among smartphone users, good adherence and sufficient routine healthcare were the most common reasons for refusal to participate. Thus, this type of intervention could enhance participation for poor adherers or caregivers. Implementing educational initiatives could play a key role in improving patient perceptions of technology. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","chronic patients; Medication adherence; mHealth; mobile application; mobile phone; recruitment process","adult; aged; Article; chronic patient; doctor patient relation; dyslipidemia; electronic prescribing; female; health care personnel; heart failure; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; medication therapy management; mobile application; refusal to participate; smartphone; teleconsultation; telehealth; age; chronic disease; devices; Dyslipidemias; habit; heart failure; hypertension; medication compliance; middle aged; mobile application; patient attitude; patient selection; procedures; psychology; self care; smartphone; Age Factors; Aged; Chronic Disease; Dyslipidemias; Female; Habits; Heart Failure; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Selection; Self Care; Smartphone",2-s2.0-84978370304

Hence the ability to construct test inputs, and send these inputs to the app is essential for testing. Leveraging our prior results in recording and replaying sensor inputs in Android apps we have constructed a new approach that helps automate smartphone app testing by capturing the input log (sensor stream) and using this log in two ways. First, we fuzz (alter) the log in a semantically-meaningful way: by applying principled transformations (e.g., changing GPS coordinates or navigation speed), a new input log is constructed, which represents a new test case. Second, we use the log captured in app A to test an app B which offers similar functionality, e.g., GPS navigation or image recognition. We have applied our approach to several widely-used Android apps and found that the approach is effective: it has revealed new bugs in four popular apps; has produced new test cases that increase coverage; and has produced test cases from logs originating in other apps. © 2016 ACM.","App testing; Google Android; Mobile applications; Physical sensors; Record-and-replay","Ability testing; Global positioning system; Image recognition; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software testing; Google Android; GPS Coordinates; Mobile applications; Navigation speed; New approaches; Physical sensors; Record-and-replay; Smartphone apps; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84974574051

Automated taint analyses address this problem by allowing users to detect and investigate how applications access and handle this data. A current problem with virtually all those analysis approaches is, though, that they rely on explicit models of the Android runtime library. In most cases, the existence of those models is taken for granted, despite the fact that the models are hard to come by: Given the size and evolution speed of a modern smartphone operating system it is prohibitively expensive to derive models manually from code or documentation. In this work, we therefore present StubDroid, the first fully automated approach for inferring precise and effcient library models for taint-analysis problems. StubDroid automatically constructs these summaries from a binary distribution of the library. In our experiments, we use Stub-Droid-inferred models to prevent the static taint analysis FlowDroid from having to re-analyze the Android runtime library over and over again for each analyzed app. As the results show, the models make it possible to analyze apps in seconds whereas most complete re-analyses would time out after 30 minutes. Yet, StubDroid yields comparable precision. In comparison to manually crafted summaries, StubDroid's cause the analysis to be more precise and to use less time and memory. © 2016 ACM.","Framework model; Library; Model inference; Static analysis; Summary","Libraries; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software engineering; Static analysis; Analysis approach; Analysis problems; Automatic inference; Binary distribution; Current problems; Framework models; Model inference; Summary; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84971389478

It allows us to identify the individual SQLite transactions from the raw IO trace, which is essentially an interleaved mixture of IO requests from con-currently running smartphone applications. Among the various observations obtained from the study, we can summarize the key findings as follows. We carefully believe that these deserve special attention. First, SQLite transaction is under extreme inefficiency. In an SQLite transaction, the IO's for SQLite journaling and EXT4 filesystem journaling account for over 75% of the entire IO volume in a transaction. Second, the suspend and the wakeup feature of the smartphone can leave the SQLite transaction to an extreme delay, a few minutes. Third, in fair number of occasions, the SQLite transactions are being used in inconsiderate manner. We find that a single SQLite transaction inserts 17.5 MByte of data to the database. It turns out to be the operation of initializing the map database. We hope that the findings obtained in this study are bifurcated to various e orts to makes the SQLite related IO more efficient and effective. © 2016 ACM.","Android; EXT4; IO Stack; Measurement; Real-time IO Characteristics; SQLite","Algorithms; Android (operating system); Image matching; Maps; Measurements; Pattern matching; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android; EXT4; IO Stack; Real time; SQLite; Software engineering",2-s2.0-84983516304

In fact, the list of apps installed on a device can be used to identify vulnerable apps for an attacker to exploit, uncover a victim's use of sensitive apps, assist network planning, and aid marketing. However, app fingerprinting is complicated by the vast number of apps available for download, the wide range of devices they may be installed on, and the use of payload encryption protocols such as HTTPS/TLS. In this paper, we present a novel methodology and a framework implementing it, called AppScanner, for the automatic fingerprinting and real-time identification of Android apps from their encrypted network traffic. To build app fingerprints, we run apps automatically on a physical device to collect their network traces. We apply various processing strategies to these network traces before extracting the features that are used to train our supervised learning algorithms. Our fingerprint generation methodology is highly scalable and does not rely on inspecting packet payloads, thus our framework works even when HTTPS/TLS is employed.

Tailoring was positively related to app popularity and user-rated quality: apps that used two-way interactions (odds ratio [OR] = 5.56 [2.45-12.62]), proactive alerts (OR = 3.80 [1.54-9.38]), responsiveness to quit status (OR = 5.28 [2.18-12.79]), addressed more of the 5As (OR = 1.53 [1.10-2.14]), used tailoring for more As (OR = 1.67 [1.21-2.30]), and/or used more ways of tailoring 5As content (OR = 1.35 [1.13-1.62]) were more likely to be frequently downloaded. Higher star ratings were associated with a higher number of 5As addressed (b = 0.16 [0.03-0.30]), a higher number of 5As with any level of tailoring (b = 0.14 [0.01-0.27]), and a higher number of ways of tailoring 5As content (b = 0.08 [0.002-0.15]).

However, the clinical reliability of the medical app sector remains questionable. We reviewed available apps themed specifically towards spinal surgery and related conditions and assessed the level of medical professional involvement in their design and content. Method: The most popular smartphone app stores (Android, Apple, Blackberry, Windows, Samsung, Nokia) were searched for spinal surgery-themed apps, using the disease terms Spinal Surgery, Back Surgery, Spine, Disc Prolapse, Sciatica, Radiculopathy, Spinal Stenosis, Scoliosis, Spinal Fracture and Spondylolisthesis. Results: A total of 78 individual spinal surgery themed apps were identified, of which there were six duplicates (N = 72). According to app store classifications, there were 57 (79 %) medical themed apps, 11 (15 %) health and fitness themed apps, 1 (1 %) business and 3 (4 %) education themed apps. Forty-five (63 %) apps were available for download free of charge. For those that charged access, the prices ranged from £0.62 to £47.99. Only 44 % of spinal surgery apps had customer satisfaction ratings and 56 % had named medical professional involvement in their development or content. Conclusions: This is the first study to specifically address the characteristics of apps related to spinal surgery. We found that nearly half of spinal surgery apps had no named medical professional involvement, raising concerns over app content and evidence base for their use. We recommend increased regulation of spinal surgical apps to improve the accountability of app content. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Apps; Smartphone; Spinal surgery",,2-s2.0-84964483745

Consequently, memory demandinmobile devices has soared. Device manufacturers have fulfilled the demand by equipping devices with more RAM. However, such a hardware approach is only a temporary solution and does not scale well in the resource-constrained mobile environment. Meanwhile, mobile systems adopt a new app life cycle and a memory reclamation scheme tailored for the life cycle. When a user leaves an app, the app is not terminated but cached in memory as long as there is enough free memory. If the free memory gets low, a victim app is terminated and the associated memory to the app is reclaimed. This process-level approach has worked well in the mobile environment. However, user experience can be impaired severely because the victim selection policy does not consider the user experience. In this article, we propose a novel memory reclamation scheme called SmartLMK. SmartLMK minimizes the impact of the process-level reclamation on user experience. The worthiness to keep an app in memory is modeled by means of user-perceived app launch time and app usage statistics. The memory footprint and impending memory demand are estimated from the history of the memory usage. Using these values and memory models, SmartLMK picks up the least valuable apps and terminates them at once. Our evaluation on a real Android-based smartphone shows that SmartLMK efficiently distinguishes the valuable apps among cached apps and keeps those valuable apps in memory. As a result, the user-perceived app launch time can be improved by up to 13.2%. © 2016 ACM.","Android; Memory management; Mobile device; Smartphone","Life cycle; Mobile devices; Random access storage; Reclamation; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android; Associated memory; Memory management; Mobile computing environment; Mobile environments; Reclamation scheme; Selection policies; Usage statistics; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84969962196

The target lightness of frames is determined, in the LAB color space, from average intensities of the original frames; and these average values are in turn obtained by adaptive sampling, so as to reduce the computational overhead.

Broadband white noise was utilized to test the ability of smartphones to measure noise at background, 50, 70 and 90 dB(A) and these measurements were compared with true noise levels acquired via a calibrated sound level meter. Tests were conducted on phones using the Android and iOS platforms. For each smartphone, tests were completed separately for leading noise monitoring apps culminating in 1472 tests. The results suggest that apps written for the iOS platform are superior to those running on the Android platform. They show that one of the apps tested - SLA Lite - is within ±1 dB of true noise levels across four different reference conditions.

Due to the limitations of communication bandwidth, storage, and processing capability, it is a challenge to transfer the huge amount of crowdsourced photos. To address this problem, we propose a framework, called SmartPhoto, to quantify the quality (utility) of crowdsourced photos based on the accessible geographical and geometrical information (called metadata ) including the smartphone's orientation, position, and all related parameters of the built-in camera. From the metadata, we can infer where and how the photo is taken, and then only transmit the most useful photos. Four optimization problems regarding the tradeoffs between photo utility and resource constraints, namely Max-Utility, online Max-Utility, Min-Selection, and Min-Selection with k -coverage, are studied. Efficient algorithms are proposed and their performance bounds are theoretically proved. We have implemented SmartPhoto in a testbed using Android based smartphones, and proposed techniques to improve the accuracy of the collected metadata by reducing sensor reading errors and solving object occlusion issues.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that about one-third of Americans over the age of 65 fall every year. And according to the American Foundation for the Blind, 25 million Americans suffer from total or partial vision loss, which are twice as likely to fall as their sighted counterparts. This creates a need for preventative systems that would allow for the detection of objects that may constitute a tripping hazard. This paper relates to the implementation of a component that will be part of a much larger system that will allow elderly and visually impaired people navigate safely in indoors environments using off-the-shelf smartphones. The component refers to a floor detection module that will identify the floor ahead of the walking person in structured and unstructured environments in real time. A structured environment is an area with a well defined shape such as hallway, and an unstructured environment is an area without a known shape (not all rooms are the same). Floor detection is a challenging task considering the real time nature of the system, and the use of resource-constrained devices such as smartphones. The evaluation of the system showed that it can work in real time with a run time of 1s. The accuracy of the floor detection module in unstructured environments was measured at 87.6% and 93% in structured environment. © 2016 IEEE.","Android; Fall prevention; Navigation system; Segmentation; SLIC; Super-pixels","Accident prevention; Disease control; Floors; Image segmentation; Navigation systems; Object detection; Ubiquitous computing; Vision aids; Android; Center for disease control and preventions; Fall prevention; Resourceconstrained devices; SLIC; Super pixels; Unstructured environments; Visually impaired people; Smartphones",2-s2.0-84966550449

In this paper, we investigate the potential of exploiting sensors embedded in smartphones to detect and prevent such unhealthy habit by measuring the ambient light intensity and detecting the smartphone motion. We implement our system through an Android APP, called PreventDark. We show the feasibility and accuracy of our developed system by experiments on different android smartphones.

As the Internet of Things (IoT) comes of age, people increasingly want to use various devices in the surrounding environment in conjunction with their smartphones. The cost of developing services that cooperate with the devices is high because various kinds of devices exist and multiple OSs for smartphones need to be supported. To mitigate the issue, we propose a dynamic device connection method that can connect services (e.g. Web applications) with devices located close to users by installing the device drivers and/or protocol adapters dynamically. Developers can create new Web applications easily because the device drivers absorb the differences of the devices and provide a common Web interface for them. The protocol adapters provide access capability to OS application programming interfaces (APIs) for Web technology.

In such applications, detected sound sources are meaningless without location information. However, it is challenging to localize sound sources accurately in a crowd using only microphones integrated in smartphones without existing infrastructures, such as dedicated microphone sensor systems. The main reason is that a smartphone is a nondeterministic platform that produces large and unpredictable variance in data measurements. Most existing localization methods are deterministic algorithms that are ill suited or cannot be applied to sound source localization using only smartphones. In this paper, we propose a distributed localization scheme using nondeterministic algorithms. We use the multiple possible outcomes of nondeterministic algorithms to weed out the effect of outliers in data measurements and improve the accuracy of sound localization. We then proposed to optimize the cost function using least absolute deviations rather than ordinary least squares to lessen the influence of the outliers. To evaluate our proposal, we conduct a testbed experiment with a set of 16 Android devices and 9 sound sources. The experiment results show that our nondeterministic localization algorithm achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.19 m, which is close to the Cramer-Rao bound (0.8 m).

To find an empty parking spot, a driver must look up for a parking lot that has been allowed for parking, it is quite difficult to find a parking spot because the space available for parking is very limited and the amount of vehicles that need parking is very high. It needs a relatively long time for a driver to get a parking spot and can cause a traffic jam in the parking lot because many drivers are trying to find an empty spot for their vehicles.

The films are prepared by radical polymerization of 4-vinylaniline, as a furfural-sensitive indicator monomer, 2-hydroxymethyl methacrylate as a comonomer, and ethylene dimethyl methacrylate (EDMA) as a cross-linker. The sensing mechanism is based on the Stenhouse reaction in which aniline and furfural react in acidic media with the generation of a deep red cyanine derivative, absorbing at 537 nm, which is visible to the naked eye. The colorimetric response has been monitored using either a portable fiber-optic spectrophotometer or the built-in camera of a smartphone. Under the optimized conditions, a linear response to furfural in beer was obtained in the 39 to 500 μg L-1 range, with a detection limit of 12 μg L-1, thus improving the performance of other well-established colorimetric or chromatographic methods. The novel films are highly selective to furfural, and no cross-reactivity has been observed from other volatile compounds generated during beer aging. A smartphone application (app), developed for Android platforms, measures the RGB color coordinates of the sensing membranes after exposure to the analyte. Following data processing, the signals are converted into concentration values by preloaded calibration curves. The method has been applied to determination of furfural in pale lager beers with different storage times at room temperature. A linear correlation (r &gt; 0.995) between the storage time and the furfural concentration in the samples has been confirmed; our results have been validated by HPLC with diode-array detection.

We proposed a mobile-cloud (MC) system, which incorporated the emerging mobile and cloud computing technologies. The MC system employed smartphone sensors to collect wheelchair maneuvering data and transmit them to the cloud for storage and analysis. A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) machine-learning algorithm was developed to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and recognize wheelchair maneuvering patterns. We conducted 30 trials in an indoor setting, where each trial contained 10 bouts (i.e., periods of continuous wheelchair movement). We also verified our approach in a different building. Different from existing approaches that require sensors to be attached to wheelchairs’ wheels, we placed the smartphone into a smartphone holder attached to the wheelchair. Experimental results illustrate that our approach correctly identified all 300 bouts. Compared to existing approaches, our approach was easier to use while achieving similar accuracy in analyzing the accumulated movement time and maximum period of continuous movement (p > 0.8).

Accurate control is important because heart rate can be used for prescription of exercise intensity for development and maintenance of cardiorespiratory fitness. An Android smartphone was employed together with wearable, wireless sensors for heart rate and running speed. A simple feedback design algorithm appropriate for embedded mobile applications was developed. Controller synthesis uses a low-order, physiologically-validated plant model and requires a single bandwidth-related tuning parameter. Twenty real time controller tests demonstrated highly accurate tracking of target heart rate with a mean root-mean-square tracking error (RMSE) of less than 2 beats per minute (bpm); a sufficient level of robustness was demonstrated within the range of conditions tested. Adjustment of the tuning parameter towards lower closed-loop bandwidth gave markedly lower control signal power (0.0008 vs. 0.0030 m2/s2, p &lt; 0.0001, low vs. high bandwidth), but at the cost of a significantly lower heart rate tracking accuracy (RMSE 1.99 vs. 1.67 bpm, p &lt; 0.01).

The aim of this study was to analyse the reliability and safety of an Android application to evaluate its characteristics and its usefulness as a clinical goniometer to measure joint angles. Previous studies have assessed the utility of the clinometer and compass applications of the iPhone to evaluate cervical and lumbar mobility. Material and method The same goniometer and smartphone Clinometer application were used to measure passive bilateral flexion and rotation of shoulder and elbow flexion in 32 participants who tolerated the supine position. Results Inter- and intra-observer reliability were obtained using the intraclass correlation coefficient, which ranged from 0.87 to 0.99. The minimal detectable change was between 2° and 5°. Validity was concurrent between the goniometer and the application. With an ICC = 0.88 and 95% agreement, a difference of up to 8° was observed when the two devices were used interchangeably. Discussion The use of information technologies has revolutionised both our daily work and leisure activities. The results obtained in this study show that these devices provide an additional resource to evaluate range of motion.

Bestpractice for suicide prevention was based upon a World Health Organization report and supplemented by other reviews of the literature. Results One hundred and twenty-three apps referring to suicide were identified and downloaded for full review, 49 of which were found to contain at least one interactive suicide prevention feature. Most apps focused on obtaining support from friends and family (n = 27) and safety planning (n = 14). Of the different suicide prevention strategies contained within the apps, the strongest evidence in the literature was found for facilitating access to crisis support (n = 13). All reviewed apps contained at least one strategy that was broadly consistent with the evidence base or best-practice guidelines. Apps tended to focus on a single suicide prevention strategy (mean = 1.1), although safety plan apps provided the opportunity to provide a greater number of techniques (mean = 3.9). Potentially harmful content, such as listing lethal access to means or encouraging risky behaviour in a crisis, was also identified. Discussion Many suicide prevention apps are available, some of which provide elements of best practice, but none that provide comprehensive evidence-based support. Apps with potentially harmful content were also identified. Despite the number of apps available, and their varied purposes, there is a clear need to develop useful, pragmatic, and multifaceted mobile resources for this population. Clinicians should be wary in recommending apps, especially as potentially harmful content can be presented as helpful. Currently safety plan apps are the most comprehensive and evidence-informed, for example, ""Safety Net"" and ""Mood- Tools-Depression Aid"". © 2016 Larsen et al.

The potentiostat consists of a square wave potential pulse generation circuit for applying the potential pulse to the electrochemical sensor, a reduction/oxidation (or redox) current measurement circuit, and Bluetooth for wireless data transmission to an Android-based smartphone. The measured data are then processed to show the output graph on the smart phone screen in real time. This data transformation into a graph is carried out by developing and installing a simple transformation application software in the Android-based smartphone. This application software also enables the user to set and change the measurement parameters such as the applied voltage range and measured current range at user's convenience. The square voltammetry output data measured with the developed portable potentiostat were almost same as the data of the commercial potentiostat. The measured oxidation peak current with the commercial potentiostat was 11.35 μA at 0.26 V and the measured oxidation peak current with the developed system was 12.38 μA at 0.25 V.

Maintaining a bladder diary is a recommended part of evaluating the effect of interventions for patients suffering from enuresis. Traditional pen-and-paper bladder diaries have poor completion rates, inconsistent patterns in data entry, and are deficient in validation. Electronic bladder diaries have been proposed to overcome these obstacles. With increasing numbers of smartphone apps available to the general public, it is important to distinguish well-designed apps for childhood enuresis. Purpose To identify, evaluate, and rank all available mobile-phone apps for the management of childhood enuresis. Methods On August 21, 2014, a search was conducted on iTunes, Android Play Store, and BlackBerry World for smartphone apps using the following search terms: bladder, bedwetting, bladder diary, enuresis, incontinence, and wetting. Apps that did not have a bladder diary function and that were unrelated to the investigation, follow-up, and treatment of childhood enuresis were excluded. Apps were rated by a paediatric urology consultant, fellow, registrar, and resident medical officer using standardised criteria including: design; ease of use; languages; quality of instructions; security; accordance with ICCS definition of enuresis; and ability to store histories; record bowel habits; transfer data to other devices; and print data. Results Across all three search platforms, a total of 1041 apps were identified. Only 24 were included and reviewed based on exclusion criteria. Average ratings for apps ranged from 10 to 30.75 out of 50 based on standardised criteria. Discussion Smartphone apps are playing an increasingly significant role in the management of enuresis in place of pen-and-paper bladder diaries. Apps available to the general public vary in quality and it can be difficult for patients to identify one appropriate for use. We found apps with higher ratings consistently had engaging interfaces, were easy to use, and defined the primary purpose clearly. Lower ratings and performance often was caused by poor quality of experience through ""freezing""/""crashing."" Conclusion Bladder diary apps can eliminate disadvantages of pen-and-paper diaries in the management of enuresis. Currently, apps available vary in quality. The three best-rated apps currently available are My Dryness Tracker, Bedwetting Tracker, and HapPee Time. There is room for medical associations to collaborate with developers for further app development. Summary of results.

Each is indexed by subject area and disease, identified by short title and thumbnail and accompanied by a description and Wikipedia URL. The app design allows users to scroll down through subject areas such as cardiology and gastroenterology, then across to access several hundred edited cases. For users withWindows, Google or Android rather than iOS devices, a similar experience is delivered through a webbased version. The almost complete market penetration of smart phones and computers allows educational database material to be distributed very economically. An opportunity to partially recoup design and coding costs and cover ongoing expenses of upgrades, server charges and annual developer fees is afforded by app store sales. Distributed worldwide via the app store, ‘Clinically Speaking’ constitutes a versatile vehicle for addition of further cases and provides experience of conditions that are infrequently seen in practice. Apps and mobile devices capture the current zeitgeist and constitute potentially powerful new vehicles for delivering reference material and clinical medical education. The development process, described herein, is slow, expensive and complex. The market is saturated and the rationale for adding further apps needs careful consideration. © 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

Unfortunately, 2011 also showed us that the new technologies and the privacy-related data on smartphones are also increasingly interesting for attackers. Especially, the Android platform has been the favorite target for malware, mainly because of the openness of the platform, the ability to install applications from other sources than the Android Market, and the significant gains in market share. Although the processes of detecting and analyzing malware are well known from the PC world, where the arms race between attackers and defenders has continued for the past 15years, they cannot be directly applied to smartphone platforms because of differences in the hardware and software architectures. In this paper, we first give an overview of the current malware situation on smartphone platforms with a special focus on Android and explain relevant malware detection and analysis methods. It turns out that most of the current malware relies on the installation by the user, who represents the last line of defense in malware detection. With these conclusions, we then present a new malware detection method that focuses on the information that the user is able to see prior to the installation of an application-the metadata within the platform's software market. Depending on the platform, this includes the application's description, its permissions, the ratings, or information about the developer. To analyze these data, we use sophisticated knowledge discovery processes and lean statistical methods. By presenting a wide range of examples based on real application metadata extracted from the Android Market, we show the possibilities of the new method. With the possibilities, we argue that it should be an essential part of a complete malware analysis/detection chain that includes other well-known methods such as network traffic analysis, or static, or dynamic code inspection. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Android; IT security; Knowledge discovery; Malware detection and analysis","Application programs; Commerce; Competition; Computer crime; Data mining; Malware; Metadata; Security of data; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android; Android platforms; Hardware and software architectures; IT security; Knowledge discovery process; Malware detection; Network traffic analysis; Real applications; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84956625176

The incorporation of a number of powerful sensors in the smartphones lately have enhanced their applicability besides their customary use for communications. Sensors in smartphones can be used to detect users activities and localization. But use of all sensors put a lot of burden on smartphone battery. Battery drainage is a big problem and most commuters do not prefer to use power hungry sensors such as GPS. In this paper, we explored the possibility to use the low power smartphone sensors to detect the initial movement of users such as bus boarding movement which can act as a trigger to collect data from other sensors. The proposed approach is implemented as an android app and consists of two modules. First module is based on accelerometer sensors to detect initial staircase pattern movement of user and triggers the second module. Second module detects linear acceleration of user in one direction and movement of bus using accelerometer and GSM sensors. Various experiments are conducted to find the appropriate features to characterize the bus boarding event. Based on these features a scaled training model is generated. This model is deployed along with the Android application to perform event detection on the smartphone itself. We conducted experiments using five different phones and found promising results of detecting the event. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Accelerometers; Buses; Electric batteries; Global system for mobile communications; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Accelerometer sensor; Android applications; Battery drainage; Event detection; Linear accelerations; Pattern movement; Rapid growth; Training model; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84966553248

We found a Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 14.998% ± 5.171% (mean + SD) when the smartphone measures were calibrated using spirometer data. However, the availability of a spirometer device for calibration is not realistic outside clinical or research environments. In order to be used by the general population on a daily basis, a simple calibration procedure not relying on specialized devices is required. In this study, we propose taking advantage of the linear correlation between smartphone measurements and Vt to obtain a calibration model using information computed while the subject breathes through a commercially-available incentive spirometer (IS). Experiments were performed on twelve (N = 12) healthy subjects. In addition to corroborating findings from our previous study using a spirometer for calibration, we found that the calibration procedure using an IS resulted in a fixed bias of —0.051 L and a RMSE of 0.189 ± 0.074 L corresponding to 18.559% ± 6.579% when normalized. Although it has a small underestimation and slightly increased error, the proposed calibration procedure using an IS has the advantages of being simple, fast, and affordable. This study supports the feasibility of developing a portable smartphone-based breathing status monitor that provides information about breathing depth, in addition to the more commonly estimated respiratory rate, on a daily basis. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Breathing monitor; Calibration; Incentive spirometer; Smartphone camera; Tidal volume","Calibration; Cameras; Mean square error; Signal encoding; Android applications; Calibration procedure; Incentive spirometer; Peak to peak amplitudes; Research environment; Root mean squared errors; Smart-phone cameras; Tidal volume; Smartphones; adult; breathing; breathing rate; calibration; devices; female; human; male; physiologic monitoring; physiology; procedures; smartphone; spirometry; tidal volume; Adult; Calibration; Female; Humans; Male; Monitoring, Physiologic; Respiration; Respiratory Rate; Smartphone; Spirometry; Tidal Volume",2-s2.0-84962488455

Android permission-based security model are used to restrict the ability of applications to access device resources, but it failed to provide an adequate control for users and a visibility of how third party applications using personal data of users. The permission warnings when installing applications do not help most users in taking right security decisions. This research aims at developing a risk assessment method to determine security posture, at Android smartphone The method can help users to increase the security level of a device, especially against sensitive data leakage. The design of risk assessment uses two approaches, security configuration level assessment and sensitive data risk assessment. Security configuration level assessment is based on built-in Android smartphone configurations, while sensitive data risk assessment is based on combination of permissions from all applications installed on the device. Design of risk assessment implemented on Android smartphone called Smartphone Risk Assessment (SRA). The evaluation has been done by a usability testing using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire. The result shows that the SRA is rated as ""Good"" by respondents based on SUS score.

However, recent studies show that the permission-based mechanism is vulnerable to application colluding attacks because two apps, which appear to be harmless individually, can establish a covert channel and use it to leak confidential information. In general, existing known covert channels usually work in a way that one app can modify the status of a system component, while the other can read the status. Even though several covert channel detection schemes have been proposed recently to fight against this type of covert channels, we point out that such designed covert channel detection schemes are not sufficient. In this paper, we demonstrate the possibility of establishing novel covert channels that work in quite different ways, in which one app (e.g., a game) can be designed deliberately such that the user will be induced to voluntarily modify the status of a system component (e.g., a motion sensor), while the other app can read the status of the system component. To validate our design, we implement three covert channels on Android. Our experiments show that these channels can bypass existing detection schemes. Moreover, we also measure the achievable throughput, error rate, and energy consumption in devices. The results demonstrate that our covert channels can achieve a transmission with high accuracy and low energy consumption. Our work sets a new alarm for the security issue of using smartphones. © 2015 IEEE.","Application colluding attack; Covert channel; Motion sensor; Smartphone security","Android (operating system); Behavioral research; Cellular telephone systems; Energy utilization; Network protocols; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Achievable throughputs; Colluding attack; Confidential information; Covert channels; Low energy consumption; Motion sensors; Private information; Smartphone securities; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84969766634

Therefore, a higher security level is needed for smartphones and tablet terminals than conventional mobile phones. From this kind of background, Takahashi and Uchida proposed an image-based user authentication method for touch screen devices by using the latest image shot by the user as the pass-image. The proposed authentication method is resistant to smudge attacks, one of the most serious threats for touch screen devices. However, the security strength of the method is low. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SWIPASS, an image-based user authentication method for touch screen devices that has higher security strength, by improving on the method proposed by Takahashi and Uchida. This improves the security strength without any change in either the resistance to smudge attacks or the users’ burden of memorizing.

Data collection and implementation of such systems is often costly, and few countries have support for such systems in their transportation budgets. In places where maintaining currency and accuracy of information is difficult, many problems arise. For instance, in Chennai, India, real time bus transit data is not maintained, there is no proper communication about the bus schedules, bus stops are not regularly updated and inconsistent information about bus stops is observed in the transport authority's website. We are interested in developing models for identifying bus stops from trajectories for situations where accurate and current information is not available and traffic conditions are challenging, such as Chennai, India.

Through findings from a user-based experiment, we demonstrate that when visuals diagrams about application activities are presented to users, they became more aware and sensitive to the privacy-intrusiveness of certain applications. This awareness and sensitivity stems from the fact that some of these applications were accessing a significant number of resources and sensitive information, and transferring data out of the devices, even when they arguably had little reason to do so. © 2016, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

Despite this, smartphones rarely use them simultaneously because most of their data traffic is controlled by TCP, which can only use one interface at a time. Multipath TCP is a recently standardized TCP extension that solves this problem. Smartphone vendors have started to deploy Multipath TCP, but its performance with real smartphone applications has not been studied in detail yet. To fill this gap, we port Multipath TCP on Android smartphones, and propose a framework to analyze the interactions between real network-heavy applications and this new protocol.

Methods: The original and modified CaCo index were evaluated using a data set of 234 hemispherical photographs taken in 78 plots in coniferous, mixed and broad-leaved deciduous forests. The results of the CaCo analysis of these photographs were compared with expert field visual estimation of canopy cover of these plots. For each hemispherical photograph, several CaCo values were calculated based on the photograph being restricted to different degrees by artificial horizon masking. The CaCo index was also tested with respect to precision of canopy cover estimation and sensitivity to different photographic equipment, using a different set of 93 canopy photographs taken in mixed and coniferous forests. Calculation of the CaCo index was done with the newly developed GLAMA - Gap Light Analysis Mobile Application software. Results: Linear regression showed a close relationship between the CaCo index and visually observed canopy cover data. A proposed calculation modification improved the stability of the CaCo index in cases in which no horizon masking was applied. The best fit, zero-intercept and a regression slope close to1 were found in cases in which an artificial horizon mask that extended higher than 45° restricted the bottom part of the sky hemisphere. Low sensitivity of the CaCo index to type of photographic equipment used was shown. Conclusions: The CaCo index is robust and can be used for precise canopy cover estimation, comparable to visual canopy cover estimation and unaffected by observer bias. Not only can it be used on already-captured photographs, but the index can also be employed on smartphones to rapidly capture hemispherical photographs and immediately calculate their index values. This application is freely available on the Internet and can serve as a powerful research and educational tool that can not only calculate CaCo values, but also standardize forest canopy visual estimates. © 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Canopy closure; Canopy cover; Field research; Forest ecology; Gap light analysis; Smartphone application","canopy architecture; electronic equipment; field method; forest canopy; forest cover; Internet; mobile communication; photograph; photography; software; vegetation index",2-s2.0-84958120640

However, ITS setup and installation requires a huge budget. Therefore, only large metropolitan areas are covered by ITS services. This paper proposes a smartphone-based bus information system (BIS) that does not require any special devices designed for bus detection, and the installation cost is next to nothing. The BIS can be seen as a bus-oriented version of an ITS, and the BIS is adequate for small- and mid-sized cities, because the bus is their only form of public transportation. In the proposed BIS system, somebody (the driver, for example) in a bus sends information about his/her current location to the BIS server using his/her smartphone. Therefore, the usefulness of the proposed BIS depends on the accuracy of the global positioning system (GPS) receiver installed in the smartphone. We performed experiments by collecting GPS data and analyzing the collected data in order to prove that GPS receivers installed in smartphones are accurate enough to determine the location of the bus, and that the proposed smartphone-based BIS is consequently valid. In order to perform these experiments efficiently, we developed a mobile app that allowed us to concurrently collect GPS values from many smartphones. © Research India Publications.","Android app; Bus information system; GPS; Intelligent transportation system",,2-s2.0-84959508761

Smartphones can capture a broad range of users’ experiences as compared to a traditional desktop computer which is evident from the numerous smartphone apps available in app markets for the purpose. These applications capture context of a user by utilizing full resources of the smartphone, especially the sensors. However, limited battery power of smartphones has proven to be the most significant bottleneck.

However, we believe that dynamic analysis methods give good results when they really monitor the malware execution.

We especially target malware that have triggering protections, for example branching conditions that wait for an event or expect a specific value for a variable before triggering malicious execution. In these cases, solely executing the malware is far from being sufficient. We propose to force the triggering of the malicious code by combining two contributions. First, we define an algorithm that automatically identifies potentially malicious code. Second, we propose an enhanced monkey called GroddDroid, that stimulates the GUI of an application and forces the execution of some branching conditions if needed. The forcing is used by GroddDroid to push the execution flow towards the previously identified malicious parts of the malware and execute it.

The power consumption of a GPS unit is much more than any other sensors in a smart phone. Worse, the GPS unit cannot be switched off even if the smart phone is in sleep mode. GPS, in addition, is not effective in indoor locations because suitable number of satellites cannot be obtained for acceptable communication. To overcome these problems, in this work, we have proposed a low power and low cost fast location tracking system for a smart phone device that is effective in tracking continuous locations of a moving device with very good accuracy. The inbuilt sensors of a smart phone like the accelerometer, the magnetometer and the gyroscope have been utilized, instead of the costly GPS unit, to track the continuous locations of a mobile device. Distance covered between any two time instants is calculated using the accelerometer readings, while the magnetometer readings give the direction of movement of the mobile device. These sensors are used to get an initial estimate of the number of foot counts and the average foot length of the person that carries the smart phone. Basically, a pattern has been framed using the change of acceleration due to gravity when a footstep is taken. These values are then used to continuously find the location of a mobile person carrying the device. The system based on these sensor measures has been implemented on Android based smart phone devices. Implementation results have generated an accuracy level of as low as 2 meters distance. The system has been tested on both indoor as well as outdoor locations without any observable differences in performance measures. Huge savings in terms of battery power consumption, as high as 20 percent for a run of 3 hours, have been found, with savings increasing rapidly with the increase in time of run of our system. Our results strongly suggest the use of our proposed system as a good alternative for the costly GPS system of location tracking. © 2015 IEEE.","Accelerometer; GPS; Location Tracking; Low power; Magnetometer; Sensors; Smartphone","Accelerometers; Communication satellites; Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Global positioning system; Location; Magnetometers; Mobile devices; Sensors; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Tracking (position); Transfer cases (vehicles); Acceleration due to gravity; Battery power consumption; Continuous locations; Indoor locations; Location tracking systems; Low Power; Performance measure; Two Time Instants; Cellular telephone systems",2-s2.0-84964880804

Yet, current outdoor localization techniques fail to provide the required accuracy for estimating the car's lane. In this paper, we present LaneQuest: an accurate and energy-efficient smartphone-based lane detection system. LaneQuest leverages hints from the ubiquitous and low-power inertial sensors available in commodity off-the-shelf smartphones about the car's motion and its surrounding environment to provide an accurate estimate of the car's current lane position. For example, a car making a u-turn, most probably, will be in the left-most lane; a car passing by a pothole will be in the pothole's lane; and the car angular velocity when driving through a curve reflects its lane. Our investigation shows that there are amble opportunities in the environment, i.e. lane ""anchors"", that provide cues about the car lane. To handle the ambiguous location, sensors noise, and fuzzy lane anchors; LaneQuest employs a novel probabilistic lane estimation algorithm. Furthermore, it uses an unsupervised crowd-sourcing approach to learn the position and lane span distribution of the different lane-level anchors. Our evaluation results from implementation on different Android devices and driving traces in different cities covering 260 km shows that LaneQuest can detect the different lane-level landmarks with an average precision and recall of more than 91%. This leads to an accurate detection of the exact car lane position 84% of the time, increasing to 92% of the time to within one lane. This comes with a low-energy footprint, allowing LaneQuest to be implemented on the energy-constrained mobile devices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The system would be more realistic if the database created is based on real time events where auto syncing is available directly to computer instead of backing up manually on SD card and transfer via wireless. Moreover the graphical user interface of the software prototype can be improved to make it more professional. © Research India Publications.","Android smartphone; Barcode; Database; Incoming and outgoing items; RFID; SD card; Warehouse management system",,2-s2.0-84959373905

This article aims to provide an overview of the apps available for traumatic dental injuries using smartphones. These apps may serve as a gateway for raising awareness of traumatic dental injuries. Materials and method: Three smartphone devices were used to access their respective app stores (Nokia Lumia 635 with Windows Phone OS 8.1; iPhone 5 with iOS 8.1; Samsung Galaxy Ace II with Android OS v2.3.6 Gingerbread). Nine phrases were searched: broken tooth/teeth; chipped tooth/teeth; dental emergency; dental injury; dental trauma; fractured tooth/teeth; knocked-out tooth/teeth; tooth/teeth injury; and tooth/teeth trauma. Results: Seven apps for the Android and one app for the Apple operating system were relevant. The only Apple iOS app retrieved (Dental Trauma) was also found for the Android OS (Dental Trauma First Aid) and had the endorsement of the International Association of Dental Traumatology. AcciDent was the only app dedicated to traumatic dental injuries targeted solely towards dental professionals. Five other apps (Chipped Tooth Solution, Dental Crown Repair, Fixing Cracked Tooth, Repairing the Front Tooth and Solution to Broken Tooth) appeared to come from the same source (KBES). No traumatic dental injury apps were found for the Windows Phone OS. Conclusion: There are apps available for both patients and dentists that range in quality and on the whole lack real-life photographs. Future apps should continue to provide good quality, evidence-based and validated material. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This is largely due to the extremely low barrier to adoption-almost every camera-enabled smartphone can scan 2D barcodes. As an alternative to NFC technology, 2D barcodes have been increasingly used for security-sensitive mobile applications including mobile payments and personal identification. However, the security of barcode-based communication in mobile applications has not been systematically studied. Due to the visual nature, 2D barcodes are subject to eavesdropping when they are displayed on the smartphone screens. On the other hand, the fundamental design principles of 2D barcodes make it difficult to add security features. In this paper, we propose SBVLC-a secure system for barcode-based visible light communication (VLC) between smartphones. We formally analyze the security of SBVLC based on geometric models and propose physical security enhancement mechanisms for barcode communication by manipulating screen view angles and leveraging user-induced motions. We then develop three secure data exchange schemes that encode information in barcode streams. These schemes are useful in many security-sensitive mobile applications including private information sharing, secure device pairing, and contactless payment. SBVLC is evaluated through extensive experiments on both Android and iOS smartphones. © 2015 IEEE.","2D barcode streaming; Key exchange; QR codes; Secure VLC; Short-range smartphone communication","Bar codes; Electronic data interchange; Electronic money; Light; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Security systems; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Visible light communication; 2d barcode; Key exchange; Personal identification; Private information; QR codes; Secure Device Pairing; Secure VLC; Visible light communications (VLC); Mobile security",2-s2.0-84978209292

However, smartphone based upconversional paper sensors have been restricted by the lack of effective methods to acquire luminescence signals on test paper. Herein, by the virtue of 3D printing technology, we exploited an auxiliary reusable device, which orderly assembled a 980nm mini-laser, optical filter and mini-cavity together, for digitally imaging the luminescence variations on test paper and quantitative analyzing pesticide thiram by smartphone. In detail, copper ions decorated NaYF4:Yb/Tm upconversion nanoparticles were fixed onto filter paper to form test paper, and the blue luminescence on it would be quenched after additions of thiram through luminescence resonance energy transfer mechanism. These variations could be monitored by the smartphone camera, and then the blue channel intensities of obtained colored images were calculated to quantify amounts of thiram through a self-written Android program installed on the smartphone, offering a reliable and accurate detection limit of 0.1μM for the system.

Current mobile terminals support several access technologies, enabling users to gain connectivity in a plethora of scenarios and favoring their mobility. However, the management of network connectivity using multiple interfaces is still starting to be deployed. The lack of smart connectivity management in multi-interface devices forces applications to be explicitly aware of the variations in the connectivity state (changes in active interface, simultaneous access from several interfaces, etc.). In this paper, we analyze the present state of the connection management and handover capabilities in the three major mobile operating systems (OSes): Android, iOS and Windows. To this aim, we conduct a thorough experimental study on the connectivity management of each operating system, including several versions of the OS on different mobile terminals, analyzing the differences and similarities between them. Moreover, in order to assess how mobility is handled and how this can affect the final user, we perform an exhaustive experimental analysis on application behavior in intra- and inter-technology handover. Based on this experience, we identify open issues in the smartphone connectivity management policies and implementations, highlighting easy to deploy yet unimplemented improvements, as well as potential integration of mobility protocols. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Android; Connection manager; Handover; iOS; Mobility; Smartphone; Windows phone","Carrier mobility; Computer terminals; Interface states; iOS (operating system); Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android; Connection managers; Handover; iOS; Windows phones; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84954121517

Unfortunately, it is generally difficult for ordinary people to access real-time noise level information because of limited noise information stations and increased burden of carrying professional noise level meters. Being equipped with a high-quality microphone, a smartphone can potentially serve as a handy noise level meter. However, the straightforward use of sound measurements from smartphones leads to large measurement errors. As a result, it is essential to calibrate a smartphone before it can be used for noise level measurements. Little work has been done on automatic smartphone calibration for noise measurement purposes. In this paper we design a system called iCaZ for calibrating smartphones for accurate noise level measurements. The system consists of two key components: node-based calibration and crowdsourcing-based calibration. The node-based calibration enables an individual smartphone to do offline calibration, but suffers a slow-start issue. Complementing the node-based calibration, the crowdsourcing-based calibration leverages the power of crowdsourcing to maintain a lookup table, which a smartphone user can consult to find an approximate offset specific to its smartphone model. Thus, the slow-start issue can be effectively mitigated. The salient feature of iCal is human intervention free. We have implemented iCal on the android platform and experimental results show that the calibration error is as low as 3 dbA. © 2015 IEEE.","Calibration; Crowdsensing; Noise; Smartphone","Acoustic noise measurement; Architectural acoustics; Calibration; Crowdsourcing; Level measurement; Signal encoding; Table lookup; Android platforms; Calibration error; Crowdsensing; Human intervention; Noise; Noise information; Noise measurements; Offline calibrations; Smartphones",2-s2.0-84964681206

Smartphones are equipped with various hardware and software resources such as Bluetooth, camera and gravity sensors. If these resources are not managed appropriately, it may cause severe problems such as battery drains and system crashes. However, the specifications of resource management are usually implicit. In this paper, we investigate the problem of mining resource management specifications from off-the-shelf apps. Our key insight is that if a set of operations to a resource are frequently performed in a specific order, it must contain the specifications of how to manage the resource. We design a tool named Automatic Resource Specification Miner (ARSM), to automatically extract resource management specifications in smartphones. In our experiments, ARSM can mine tens of rules from 100 top rated Android apps within six hours. Our work is orthogonal to existing studies on diagnosing smartphone apps.

This architecture can communicate with the car dashboard, emergency services, vehicles belonging to the VANET and road or street facilities. This architecture seeks on the one hand to improve the car driving experience of the driver and on the other hand to extend security mechanisms for the surrounding individuals; and (3) as a proof of concept, an Android real-time attention low level detection application that runs in a next-generation smartphone is developed.

SIG-Droid leverages two automatically extracted models: Interface Model and Behavior Model. The Interface Model is used to find values that an app can receive through its interfaces. Those values are then exchanged with symbolic values to deal with constraints with the help of a symbolic execution engine. The Behavior Model is used to drive the apps for symbolic execution and generate sequences of events.

Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smart-phones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analysing images of chronic ulcers is an attractive option. We propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smart-phone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smart-phone with the assistance of an android App. After that, the smart-phone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the affected body parts is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method.

The traffic jams are often exacerbated by drivers habitually following the same routes. A real-time, optimum vehicle routing system that takes traffic density into account can be a possible solution to this problem. This paper presents RouteFinder, a system of providing real-time traffic density mapping on the driver's smartphone using an in-vehicle module built using inexpensive components that communicates with the existing mobile telephone network, to enable the driver to choose the least congested route to a desired destination. The hardware module contains the essential elements of a cellular handset such as a SIM card. The location of the vehicle is determined through a standard triangulation algorithm performed using signals from the three nearest cellular base stations, and the location information is constantly updated at relevant Home Location Registers (HLRs) / Visitor Location Register (VLRs) at the telecom service provider using an intermediate MySQL database. An Android application developed for the driver's smartphone shows the present locations of all vehicles in all routes from the origin to the selected destination, with colour codes distinguishing between moving and stationary vehicles. We have implemented our device in 10 vehicles in Dhaka city. Our sample calculations have shown significant savings not only in terms of time, but also in fuel consumption. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Location; Mobile phones; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Street traffic control; Telecommunication traffic; Telephone circuits; Telephone sets; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Android applications; Cellular base stations; Home location register; Location information; Mobile phone networks; Mobile telephone networks; Telecom service providers; Triangulation algorithms; Cellular telephone systems",2-s2.0-84962136678

Despite the fact that Android provides several async constructs that developers can use, developers can still miss opportunities to encapsulate long-running operations in async constructs. On the other hand, they can use the inappropriate async constructs, which result in memory leaks, lost results, and wasted energy. Fortunately, refactoring tools can eliminate these problems by retrofitting asynchrony to sequential code and transforming async code to use the appropriate constructs. This demo presents two refactoring tools for Android apps: (i) ASYNCHRONIZER, a refactoring tool that enables developers to extract long-running operations into Android AsyncTask.

We conducted a quasi-experimental pre-post study of a 12-month mobile phone intervention to improve vaccination among 0-11 months old children in rural hard-to-reach and urban street dweller areas. Software named ""mTika"" was employed within the existing public health system to electronically register each child's birth and remind mothers about upcoming vaccination dates with text messages. Android smart phones with mTika were provided to all health assistants/vaccinators and supervisors in intervention areas, while mothers used plain cell phones already owned by themselves or their families. Pre and post-intervention vaccination coverage was surveyed in intervention and control areas. Among children over 298 days old, full vaccination coverage actually decreased in control areas - rural baseline 65.9% to endline 55.2% and urban baseline 44.5% to endline 33.9% - while increasing in intervention areas from rural baseline 58.9% to endline 76*8%, difference +18.8% (95% CI 5.7-31.9) and urban baseline 40.7% to endline 57.1%, difference +16.5% (95% CI 3.9-29.0). Difference-in-difference (DID) estimates were +29.5% for rural intervention versus control areas and +27.1% for urban areas for full vaccination in children over 298 days old, and logistic regression adjusting for maternal education, mobile phone ownership, and sex of child showed intervention effect odds ratio (OR) of 3.8 (95% CI 1.5-9.2) in rural areas and 3.0 (95% CI 1.4-6.4) in urban areas. Among all age groups, intervention effects on age-appropriate vaccination coverage were positive: DIDs +13.1-30.5% and ORs 2.5-4.6 (p < 0.001 in all comparisons).

Unprotected APIs provide a way of accessing resources without any permissions. We then exploit selected unprotected APIs and launch a number of attacks on Android phones. We discover that without requesting for any permissions, an attacker can access to device ID, phone service state, SIM card state, Wi-Fi and network information, as well as user setting information, such as airplane, location, NFC, USB and power modes of mobile devices. An attacker can also disturb Bluetooth discovery services, and block the incoming emails, calendar events, and Google documents.

Malwares are spreading around the world and infecting not only for end users but also for large organizations and service providers. Malware classification is a vital component and works together with malware identification to prepare the right and effective malware antidote. Not only malware classification but also malware characterization is also important to inform the user and install the malware application, because user are not aware to install the several application of their device. Android application requires several permissions to work. An essential step to install an Android application into a mobile device is to allow all permissions requested by the application. An application is being installed; the system prompts a list of permissions requested by the application and asks the user to confirm the installation. Although Google announced that a security check mechanism is applied to each application uploaded to their market, the open design of the Android operating system still allows a user to install any application downloaded from an unsafe source. Nevertheless, the permission list is still the minimal defense for a user to detect whether an application could be harmful. Therefore in my research work, characterization is still needed to be completed. Malware characterization will also be performed to identify different features from the manifest file. The proposed system can be used to improve the efficiency of Android permission system for informing the user about the risks of Android permissions and applications. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Android security; Malware; Smartphone","Android (operating system); Characterization; Computer crime; Malware; Mobile devices; Android applications; Android securities; Large organizations; Malicious activities; Malware classifications; Malware detection; Private information; Service provider; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84945892204

As today's generation and kids also addicted to smart phones I have created the MB Puzzle for them that they can play the puzzle game anytime and anywhere. Solving a puzzle is like solving a research problem. Both require the right cleverness to see the problem from the right angle, and then the careful execution of that idea until you find a solution. (The main difference is that the puzzle usually guarantees that the puzzle is solvable.) Puzzles also lead to re-search problems which form a sort of puzzle: To analyze a family of puzzles and their solutions algorithmically. Solutions to these puzzles in turn influence puzzle design, often leading to interesting puzzles that can be appreciated without mathematics.","Android; JDK (key-words); Random shuffle; Valid moves","brain; family; mathematics; smartphone",2-s2.0-84994181879

Mobile phishing is dangerous because of hardware limitations of the device and the user attitude while using services on the device. Phishing is widely investigated in desktop environment but there is very little research on techniques to detect phishing on Android Device. The proposed system is a mechanism for detection of phishing on Android mobile devices. It is a hybrid solution to defend against zero-day phishing attacks.

This situation requires robust security mechanisms for protecting sensitive applications and data on mobile devices. Android, as one the most popular smartphone operating systems, provides two core security mechanisms, application sandboxing and a permission system. However, recent studies show that these mechanisms are vulnerable to be passed by a variety of attacks. In this paper, we argue for the need of designing and implementing more comprehensive security mechanisms for Android. We realize that mediating Inter-Process Communication (IPC) channels used by Android applications can mitigate prominent attacks effectively and efficiently. Based on this observation, we propose a practical multi-layer security framework called TripleMon to support policy-based mediation on Android IPC. We also discuss and evaluate a proof-of-concept prototype of TripleMon along with the experimental results derived from real malware samples and synthetic attacks. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Recent works have been proposed to launch powerful sensor-based attacks such as location tracing and sound eavesdropping. The use of sensors does not require any permission in Android apps, so these attacks are very difficult to be noticed by the app users. Furthermore, the combination of various kinds of sensors generates numerous types of attacks which are hard to be systematically studied. To better address the attacks, we have developed a taxonomy on sensor-based attacks from five aspects. In this work, we propose a sensor API hooking and information filtering framework, Sensor Security Guard (SSG). Unlike any rough hooking framework, this system provides finegrained processing for different security levels set by the users, or by default. The sensor data is blocked, forged or processed under different mode strategies and then returned to the apps. In addition, according to the taxonomy, SSG develops fine-grained corresponding countermeasures. We evaluate the usability of SSG on 30 popular apps chosen from Google Market. SSG does not cause any crash of either the Android system or the apps while working. The result indicated that SSG could significantly preserve the users’ privacy with acceptable energy lost. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2016.","Android; Hook; Security; Sensor API","Android (operating system); Hooks; Information filtering; Smartphones; Taxonomies; Android; Android systems; Gravity-sensing; Security; Security level; Sensor API; Sensor securities; User experience; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84958051028

Furthermore, we discover several defects in Android's device drivers associated with doze mode. By exploiting the defects, we implement various proof-of-concept attacks that could drain battery without acquiring any permissions by subverting doze mode. The proposed attacks are silent (hardly discerned by normal users), because they keep hidden when the smartphone is in use, while letting benign applications do battery-intensive work when the smartphone is unused rather than consuming excessive power by the attacks themselves.

Understanding the way people use smartphones can be beneficial for implementing an early detection of social anxiety and loneliness. This paper examines different types of smartphone usage and their relationships with people with different individual levels of social anxiety or loneliness. Methods: A total of 127 Android smartphone volunteers participated in this study, all of which have agreed to install an application (MobileSens) on their smartphones, which can record user's smartphone usage behaviors and upload the data into the server. They were instructed to complete an online survey, including the Interaction Anxiousness Scale (IAS) and the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS). We then separated participants into three groups (high, middle and low) based on their scores of IAS and UCLA-LS, respectively. Finally, we acquired digital records of smartphone usage from MobileSens and examined the differences in 105 types of smartphone usage behaviors between high-score and lowscore group of IAS/UCLA-LS. Results: Individuals with different scores on social anxiety or loneliness might use smartphones in different ways. For social anxiety, compared with users in low-score group, users in high-score group had less number of phone calls (incoming and outgoing) (Mann-Whitney U = 282.50~409.00, p < 0.05), sent and received less number of text messages in the afternoon (Mann-Whitney U = 391.50~411.50, p < 0.05), used health & fitness apps more frequently (Mann-Whitney U = 493.00, p < 0.05) and used camera apps less frequently (Mann-Whitney U = 472.00, p < 0.05). For loneliness, users in low-score group, users in high-score group had less number of phone calls (incoming and outgoing) (Mann-Whitney U = 305.00~407.50, p < 0.05) and used following appsmore frequently: Health & fitness (Mann-Whitney U = 510.00, p < 0.05), system (Mann-Whitney U = 314.00, p < 0.01), phone beautify (Mann- Whitney U = 385.00, p < 0.05), web browser (Mann-Whitney U = 416.00, p < 0.05) and social media (RenRen) (Mann-Whitney > U = 388.50, p < 0.01). Discussion: The results show that individuals with social anxiety or loneliness receive less incoming calls and use healthy applications more frequently, but they do not show differences in outgoing-call-related features. Individuals with higher levels of social anxiety also receive less SMSs and use camera apps less frequently, while lonely individuals tend to use system, beautify, browser and social media (RenRen) apps more frequently. Conclusion: This paper finds that there exists certain correlation among smartphone usage and social anxiety and loneliness. The result may be useful to improve social interaction for those who lack social interaction in daily lives and may be insightful for recognizing individual levels of social anxiety and loneliness through smartphone usage behaviors. © 2016 Gao et al.","Loneliness; Smartphone usage; Social anxiety","anxiety; California; controlled study; group dynamics; human; loneliness; major clinical study; smartphone; social interaction; social media; university; volunteer; web browser",2-s2.0-84981487885

The innovation not only in the hardware but software has brought disruptive changes in the lives of customers. People are increasingly becoming dependent on mobiles not only for communication but shopping, banking and entertainment as well. Many companies focus only on the Smartphone hardware features whereas Operating system has become a major platform for choosing the Smartphone's by the customers these days because of the increasing awareness on technological developments. Hence companies can use this study to know various parameters of the Operating Systems which can lead to satisfaction of the user. Research Design/Methodology: This paper is based on various literatures and articles published in journals and magazines. Along with this a quantitative approach is also used in which a sample of 300 respondents using Smartphone's has been drawn and the data collected has been analyzed with the help of various statistical techniques. Findings: By applying the Factor analysis, there are six factors which have been extracted that form the basis of choosing an Operating system i.e. 1. Basic usage 2. Reliability 3. Brand name 4. Techno-savvy needs 5. Ease of usage 6. Security. Further analysis using Chi-square, cross tabulation and descriptive analysis, it is found that Android and iOS are the most satisfying operating systems for the users and Symbian is the least. The study also found that Value for money, Ease in e-mailing and Reliability of the operating systems are the most satisfying factors for the users. Practical Implications: This study can be used by managers and developers to know various aspects of customer's satisfaction specific to Operating System and hence can work on these factors to develop better operating systems for increased customer satisfaction.","Consumer satisfaction; Smartphone; Smartphone Operating Systems",,2-s2.0-84986203602

Traditional mobile malware detection approaches that can be roughly classified to signaturebased and heuristic-based have essential drawbacks. The former rely on existing malware signatures and therefore cannot detect zero-day malware and the latter are prone to false positive detections. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-based approach that quantifies the uncertainty involved in each malware detection. In particular, our approach is based on a novel machine learning framework, called Conformal Prediction, for providing valid measures of confidence for each individual prediction, combined with a Multilayer Perceptron.

Android applications are published through Google Play Store which is an official marketplace for Android. If we have to define the current security policy implemented by Google Play Store for publishing Android applications in one sentence then we can write it as “all are suspect but innocent until proven guilty.” It means an application does not have to go through rigorous security review to be accepted for publication. It is assumed that all the applications are benign which does not mean it will remain so in future. If any application is found doing suspicious activities then the application will be categorized as malicious and it will be removed from the Play Store. Though filtering of malicious applications is performed at Play Store, some malicious applications escape the filtering process. Thus, it becomes necessary to take strong security measures at other levels. Security in Android can be enforced at system and application levels. At system level Android uses sandboxing technique while at application level it uses permission.

The working of the designed sensor is based on a Mie-scattering principle where suspended micro (μ-) particles in water medium scatter a strong light signal along the normal direction of the incoming light signal, which can be detected by an infra-red (IR) proximity sensor embedded in the smartphone. Two freely available android applications were used to measure the irradiance of the scattered flux and analyse the turbidity of the medium. With the designed sensor, water turbidity variation as low as 0.1 NTU can be measured accurately in the turbidity value ranging from 0 to 400 NTU. The sensor responses for these ranges of turbid media are found to be linear. A high repeatability in the sensor characteristics is also been observed. The optics design involved for the development of the proposed smartphone turbidimeter is simple and is robust in operation.

New electronic devices may help in this regard. Objective: The objective of the present work was to develop an accurate and reliable smartphone application to analyze subjective appetite variables. Methods: Subjective appetite sensations were evaluated in 15 healthy volunteers by two different methods: paper and pen (P-P) and a new Android and iOS application. Appetite scores were completed every 30 minutes for 4 hours in two conditions: high-carbohydrate (HC) or high-fat (HF) breakfast. Secondly, subjects completed the new application every 30 minutes in free-living conditions. Results: Our repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant differences regarding method (P-P or new application) or meal (HC or HF) (p > 0.05 in all cases) for hunger, desire to eat or fullness scores. Correlation coefficients showed a high agreement between both methods (R2 from 0.94-0.98). In addition, Bland-Altman test also revealed a high concordance between both methods. The application was also able to measure daily variation of subjective sensations under free-living conditions. Conclusion: The smartphone application was able to accurately determine subjective appetite scores in both laboratory and free-living conditions.

However, audiovisual processing shares many cognitive resources used for attention-dependent tasks such as communication, spatial orientation, and balance. Conversely, tactile cues (TC) may be processed faster, with minimal attentional demand, and may be more efficient means for modulating motor-cognitive performance. In this study we aimed to investigate the efficacy and limitations of TC for modulating simple (heel tapping) and more complex (walking) motor tasks (1) over a range of cueing intervals, (2) with/without a secondary motor task (holding tray with cups of water). Methods: Ten PD patients (71 ± 9 years) and 10 healthy controls (69 ± 7 years) participated in the study. TCs was delivered through a smart phone attached to subjects' dominant arm and were controlled by a custom-developed Android application. Results: PD patients and healthy controls were able to use TC to modulate heel tapping (F(3.8,1866.1) = 1008.1, p &lt; 0.001), and partially modulate walking (F(3.5,1448.7) = 187.5, p &lt; 0.001) tasks. In the walking task, PD patients modulated performance over a narrower range of cueing intervals (R2 = 0.56) than healthy controls (R2 = 0.84; group difference F(3.5,1448.7) = 8.6, p &lt; 0.001). TC diminished synchronization error associated with performance of secondary motor task during walking in PD patients and healthy controls (main effect of Task (F(1,494) = 0.4; p = 0.527), Task X Group interaction (F(1,494) = 0.5; p = 0.493)).

As the number of on-board active sensors increases, complications arise due to inter-sensor interactions. The energy-cost of the Smartphones is primarily due to wireless communications (in various modes, such as, cellular radio, GPS, Wi-Fi direct, and Bluetooth) and environmental sensing using its embedded sensors in a wireless personal area network setting. The existing popular on-device-online energy-cost profilers for Android Smartphones, namely, Amobisense and PowerTutor, are energy-hungry. In this paper, we report an efficient on-demand-online profiler, called pProf, that learns from offline-precomputed model parameters to reduce the online profiling cost. We have tested our proposed technique in a customized test-bed setup comprising of the Android Smart-phones with embedded sensors that also communicate with the neighborhood sensors on smart-wearables and Sensorcon's Sensordrone platform.

Harmful usage of alcohol has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality arising from common alcohol related disorders, such as liver disease, hypertension and violent deaths. Looking at the current literature, there have been previous peer reviewed publications about how technology has helped alcohol users. Of significance, a previous content analysis showed that the vast majority of the applications catered for alcohol use disorder which are currently available on the stores are not only not supported by evidence-base, but some of them seemed to be promoting drinking instead. Zhang et al. have described how they have attempted to overcome the limitations of current alcohol applications in their video feature recently published. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to evaluate (a) the receptiveness of the general population toward an alcohol tracker application and to determine (b) user preferences with regards to the different features present in an alcohol tracker. METHODS: Android Java Developmental kit (ADK) was utilized to program the core functions of the applications. The entire developmental process took approximately 6 weeks to complete and the android version of the application was launched and offered for free download on the android play store since the 4th of February 2015. The utilization of the application was then monitored and recorded using Google analytics. User perspectives with regards to the individual features of the application were collated via an application feedback survey embedded within the application. RESULTS: Based on the analytics, a total of 339 users have had access to the application. A cumulative total of 2029 downloads of the application have been made to date. Most of the participants are male (66%) and are of the age group of 30-39 years old (34%). The vast majority of the participants (94%) do not have any prior treatment for alcohol. Interestingly, the vast majority of the users have indicated that they have a drink 4 or more times a week (61%) and tend to drink between 3 to 4 drinks on a typical day they are out drinking. the vast majority reported that they were slightly and moderately comfortable with managing their alcohol use problem (25%). After the usage of the application, 27% of the individuals were moderately comfortable with managing their alcohol use problems and 20% of individuals were extremely comfortable with managing their alcohol use problems. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this is perhaps one of the first few studies to demonstrate the receptiveness of an alcohol tracker that has included other behavioral change methods within as well as a variant of the conventional methodology of tracking alcohol consumption. The current study shows the receptiveness of global users as well as how such an intervention could help them gain more control about managing their underlying alcohol issue. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Many smart systems have been proposed to help blind people in these difficult, often dangerous, situations. However, some of them are uncomfortable, difficult to obtain or simply too expensive. In this paper, a low-cost wearable system for visually impaired people was implemented which allows them to detect and locate obstacles in their locality. The proposed system consists of two main hardware components, a laser pointer ($12) and an android smart phone, making our system relatively cheap and accessible. The collision avoidance algorithm uses image processing to measure distances to objects in the environment. This is based on laser light triangulation. This obstacle detection is enhanced by edge detection within the captured image. An additional feature of the system is to recognize and warn the user when stairs are present in the camera's field of view. Obstacles are brought to the user's attention using an acoustic signal.

Methods: We used a previously developed mobile application. The knowledge of 17 caregivers of children with CP (including parents) about the daily care of their children was evaluated through a self-assessment and a test with multiple-choice and true-false questions. Next, the application, which included several educational modules for the daily care of the children with CP, was given to the caregivers to use continually for two months. After this period, the knowledge of the caregivers was evaluated by the same tools. Data analysis was performed by SPSS-16, using paired-sample t-test or Wilcoxon test. Results: The effect of the use of this educational application on the knowledge of caregivers in all childcare domains, except for eating, was reported to be significant (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the results of the multiplechoice test revealed that this application increased the knowledge of caregivers in all domains except playing (p < 0.05).

In this paper, we first test the feasibility of the DFTS-OFDM modulated VLC system by analyzing the constellation and the transmission error rate via the headset interface of the smartphone. Then we change the peak value of the signal generated by the AWG as well as the static current to find the best working point. We tested the effect of changing the up-sample number on the BER performance of the communication system, and compared the BER performance of 16QAM and 8QAM modulation in different equalization method. We also do experiment to find how distance affect the performance of the communication and the maximum communication rate that can be achieved.

This study utilized Android-based Nexus 7 tablets and tested the operation of the three location services available on this system in a 24-h fixed location test and a shorter duration multiple location field test. In the 24-h test, the ""network"" location system had a measured error of 37.19 m while reporting an accuracy of 55.56 m. The ""gps"" location system had a measured error of 2.57 m and a reported accuracy of 3.20 m. Multiple tests were conducted with the location system added by Google Services code because the measured error was much higher than the reported accuracy. With this system, the measured errors were 14.13, 3.4, 24.08, 14.01, and 16.15 m with reported accuracies of 3.95, 4.83, 3.99, 7.18, and 6.68 m, respectively. All the tests with the Google Services location system had much higher variability in location estimates than the ""gps"" location system. For both services, the high values for reported accuracy did not correspond with high values for measured error. Field testing was only performed with the Google Services and ""gps"" location systems as the ""network"" location system did not operate in the test field. Statistical analysis confirmed that the ""gps"" system was more accurate in this testing but the difference was not as dramatic as in the 24-h testing. The average reported accuracy level was 3.0 m in all field tests with the ""gps"" system and 3.9 m in all field tests with the Google Services system. The field test data were also used to estimate areas of 0.14-ha rectangular plots. Among all three tests with the ""gps"" system and all three tests with the Google Services system, the mean absolute area percent error varied from 4% to 7%, and in every test at least one plot was over- or underestimated by at least 10%. The error characteristics and patterns for all but the ""gps"" service differed significantly from the random walk pattern and/or other characteristics of GNSS locators to which precision farming engineers have become accustomed. Mobile platform creators like Apple and Google are either requiring (Apple) or strongly encouraging (Google) developers to switch to newer services that don't provide access to the underlying locating mechanism. Therefore, it is clear that careful consideration of these differences and what they may mean to location based apps in agriculture will be important.

However, the OLED remains one of the most power-hungry components in mobile devices. Various optimization schemes have been proposed based on the color-dependent power consumption feature of OLED pixels. These schemes mainly focus on color modification during the playback phase and require significant overhead in terms of frame analysis and real-time modification. While such schemes are effective, the power saving opportunities during the camera recording phase are overlooked. To further enhance the power optimization, the camera parameters during the recording phase could be effectively utilized to reduce or eliminate the optimization overhead. Hence, we proposed MORPh, a cross-layer optimization system for OLED display in the smartphones. We analyze three fundamental parameters of smartphone camera system and their impact on the OLED screen power consumption. We then define corresponding metrics to quantitatively assess each parameter's potential of power saving guidance. Finally, we develop a set of schemes and integrated them into a video recording and playback application on an existing Android smartphone.

Even worse, DSRC is not supported by the smartphones for vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication. In this paper, a smartphone-based framework named SenSafe is developed to improve the traffic safety. SenSafe is a framework which only utilizes the smartphone to sense the surrounding events and provides alerts to drivers. Smartphone-based driving behaviors detection mechanism is developed inside the framework to discover various steering behaviors. Besides, the Wi-Fi association and authentication overhead is reduced to broadcast the compressed sensing data using the Wi-Fi beacon to inform the drivers of the surroundings.

So far there is no treatment available that reliably reduces the tinnitus perception. The research is hampered by the large heterogeneity of tinnitus and the fact that the tinnitus perception fluctuates over time. It is therefore necessary to develop tools for measuring fluctuations of tinnitus perception over time and for analyzing data on single subject basis. However, this type of longitudinal measurement is difficult to perform using the traditional research methods such as paper-and-pencil questionnaires or clinical interviews. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) represents a research concept that allows the assessment of subjective measurements under real-life conditions using portable electronic devices and thereby enables the researcher to collect longitudinal data under real-life conditions and high cost efficiency. Here we present a new method for recording the longitudinal development of tinnitus perception using a modern smartphone application available for iOS and Android devices with no costs for the users. The TrackYourTinnitus (TYT) app is available and maintained since April 2014. A number of 857 volunteers with an average age of 44.1 years participated in the data collection between April 2014 and February 2016. The mean tinnitus distress at the initial measurement was rated on average 13.9 points on the Mini-Tinnitus Questionnaire (Mini-TQ; max. 24 points). Importantly, we could demonstrate that the regular use of the TYT app has no significant negative influence on the perception of the tinnitus loudness nor on the tinnitus distress. The TYT app can therefore be proposed as a safe instrument for the longitudinal assessment of tinnitus perception in the everyday life of the patient. © 2016 Schlee, Pryss, Probst, Schobel, Bachmeier, Reichert and Langguth.","Chronic tinnitus; Crowd sourcing; Ecological momentary assessment; Ecological validity; Moment-to-moment analysis; Smartphone application","adult; aged; Article; audiometry; cost effectiveness analysis; daily life activity; female; hearing; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Mini Tinnitus Questionnaire; mobile application; questionnaire; smartphone; tinnitus; validity",2-s2.0-85009458810

The aim of the project was to exploit the plethora of on-board sensors within modern smartphones (accelerometer, GPS, compass, camera) to generate ready-to-use spatial data from lightweight aerial platforms such as drones or kites. A visual coding 'scheme blocks' framework was used to build the application ('app'), so that users could customise their own data capture tools in the field. The paper reports on the coding framework, then shows the results of test flights from kites and lightweight drones and finally shows how open-source geospatial toolkits were used to generate geographical information system (GIS)-ready GeoTIFF images from the metadata stored by the app. Two Android smartphones were used in testing-a high specification OnePlus One handset and a lower cost Acer Liquid Z3 handset, to test the operational limits of the app on phones with different sensor sets. We demonstrate that best results were obtained when the phone was attached to a stable single line kite or to a gliding drone. Results show that engine or motor vibrations from powered aircraft required dampening to ensure capture of high quality images. We demonstrate how the products generated from the open-source processing workflow are easily used in GIS. The app can be downloaded freely from the Google store by searching for 'UAV toolkit' (UAV toolkit 2016), and used wherever an Android smartphone and aerial platform are available to deliver rapid spatial data (e.g. in supporting decision-making in humanitarian disaster-relief zones, in teaching or for grassroots remote sensing and democratic mapping).",,"aircraft; geographic information system; remote sensing; smartphone; Aircraft; Geographic Information Systems; Remote Sensing Technology; Smartphone",2-s2.0-85015617259

Their sensing, processing, and communication capabilities along with crowdsourcing facility ease technical difficulties and reduce financial burdens of instrumentation and monitoring for SHM in civil infrastructures. However, smartphones are vulnerable to unintentional misuses and malicious attacks. This paper analyzes the vulnerabilities of smartphones in performing SHM and reveals the exploitation of those vulnerabilities. The work probes the attack surface of both devices and data. Device attack scenarios include hacking individual smartphones to modify the data stored on them and orchestrating smartphones to launch a distributed denial-of-service attack. Specifically, experiments are conducted to remotely access an Android smartphone and modify the sensing data of structural health stored on it. The work also presents a case study that reveals the sensitivity of a popular perturbation analysis method to faulty data delivered by a smartphone. The paper provides the direction of meeting the security challenge to using smartphones for SHM. As the first line of defense, device authentication is implemented in the smartphone to stop spoofing. Subsequently, message authentication is devised to maintain data integrity. There is a need to apply data science for the SHM immunity system against the sensitivity to data inaccuracy. The work also evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the proposed security measures, recommending varying levels of security to mitigate the adversaries to smartphones used in SHM systems. It calls for security solutions at the design stage of SHM systems rather than patching up after their implementations. © 2016 SPIE.","Data science; Device authentication; Message authentication; Perturbation analysis; Security; Sensitivity study; Smartphone for civil infrastructure health; Structural health monitoring (SHM)","Authentication; Characterization; Cost effectiveness; Denial-of-service attack; Network security; Nondestructive examination; Personal computing; Perturbation techniques; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Structural health monitoring; Civil infrastructures; Data science; Device authentications; Message authentication; Perturbation Analysis; Security; Sensitivity studies; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Mobile security",2-s2.0-84981333369

A number of factors can affect the validity of the measurements generated. However, there are no studies examining smartphone-based goniometer applications focusing on measurement variability and error arising from the electromechanical properties of the device being used. Objective: To examine the concurrent validity and interrater reliability of 2 goniometric mobile applications (Goniometer Records, Goniometer Pro), an inclinometer, and a universal goniometer (UG). Design: Nonexperimental, descriptive validation study. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: 3 physical therapists having an average of 25 y of experience. Main Outcome Measures: Three standardized angles (acute, right, obtuse) were constructed to replicate the movement of a hinge joint in the human body. Angular changes were measured and compared across 3 raters who used 3 different devices (UG, inclinometer, and 2 goniometric apps installed on 3 different smartphones: Apple iPhone 5, LG Android, and Samsung SIII Android). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots were used to examine interrater reliability and concurrent validity. Results: Interrater reliability for each of the smartphone apps, inclinometer and UG were excellent (ICC = .995-1.000). Concurrent validity was also good (ICC = .998-.999). Based on the Bland-Altman plots, the means of the differences between the devices were low (range = -0.4° to 1.2°). Conclusions: This study identifies the error inherent in measurement that is independent of patient factors and due to the smartphone, the installed apps, and examiner skill. Less than 2° of measurement variability was attributable to those factors alone. The data suggest that 3 smartphones with the 2 installed apps are a viable substitute for using a UG or an inclinometer when measuring angular changes that typically occur when examining ROM and demonstrate the capacity of multiple examiners to accurately use smartphone-based goniometers. © 2016, Human Kinetics, Inc.","Concurrent validity; Goniometer; Interrater reliability; Mobile applications; Psychometric properties; Smartphone","arthrometry; devices; human; mobile application; observer variation; reproducibility; smartphone; validation study; Arthrometry, Articular; Humans; Mobile Applications; Observer Variation; Reproducibility of Results; Smartphone",2-s2.0-85014901025

Methods: A mobile teledentistry model was developed to facilitate the acquisition of dental images, and transmission and reviewing of data. One hundred regularly attending patients at a dental clinic participated in the study. Following an on-site clinical examination by a senior dentist, photographs of participants' teeth were taken by a teledental assistant, using a smartphone camera. These intraoral photographs were directly uploaded from an Android App to a cloud-based server, ‘Remote-i’, using an encrypted store-and-forward telemedicine technology. The photographic assessment carried out by two independent screeners (MLDPs), was compared to the visual oral examination scores of a benchmark examiner. Results: The sensitivity and specificity values for the photographic assessment method (assessed by screeners) as compared to the direct visual examination ranged from 60% to 68%, and 97% to 98%, respectively. The intra-rater reliability for the photographic assessment was almost perfect, with a kappa score of 0.89. The inter-rater reliability between the photographic and visual oral assessments ranged from moderate to substantial agreement, with kappa scores ranging from 0.57 to 0.61.

To address practicing surgeons’ preference for increased use of mobile learning, a point-of-care educational app was planned by a committee of experienced faculty. The goals were to deliver the app to surgeons, trainees, and other healthcare professionals, to measure usage, and to evaluate the impact on patient care. Materials and methods: The committee of geriatricians and surgeons designed and developed four modules on osteoporosis, delirium, anticoagulation, and pain based on published evidence and the content was programmed into mobile app formats. A registration form was integrated and a 14-question online evaluation survey was administered to users. Results: The AOTrauma Orthogeriatrics app was installed by 17,839 users worldwide between September 2014 and October 2015: Android smartphones (44 %), iPhones (32 %), iPads (15 %), Android tablets (9 %). 920 users registered and 100 completed the online evaluation: orthopedic/trauma surgeons (67 %), residents/fellows (20 %), and other professionals (13 %). Ratings for all aspects were 4 or higher on a 1–5 Likert scale (5 = Excellent). 80 % of evaluation respondents found the answer to their question or educational need on their last visit, and 26 of 55 respondents (47 %) reported making a change in an aspect of their management of patients as a result of their learning from the app. Conclusion: The orthogeriatrics app reached its intended audiences and was rated highly as a method of providing education to help improve patient care.

In developing countries, the main problem with low volume roads which are managed by local road agencies is the lack of funding for maintenance and resources. The funds allocated to local authorities are largely insufficient to maintain low volume road network at good condition. Fund allocation can be optimized to achieve better overall network performance if the decision making can be supported by up to date information of the road network condition. Unfortunately the road transport sector in many developing countries lacks these and as a result planning decisions on maintenance are mostly taken based on subjective judgment without a consistent objective basis. Road roughness information is very useful for road agencies because it can be used to assess the road condition and be used in decision making process for maintenance planning and programming. But existing measurement technologies to measure road roughness are very expensive and difficult to use with the prevailing constraints in the local road agencies. The development of smartphones with 3-Axis accelerometer allows it to take acceleration measurements in m/s2 along each of x, y, z axes. Past research on used of this technology has given evidence of the use of smartphones to measure road roughness. In this research two such android applications were used to develop a roughness evaluationn method for low volume roads which can be used in the maintenance decision making. © Copyright 2016 by Mairepav8 2016 Organizers.","Low volume roads; Pavement maintenance; Roughness; Smartphone apps","Accelerometers; Decision making; Developing countries; Maintenance; Pavements; Roads and streets; Smartphones; Surface roughness; Average daily traffics; Decision making process; Low volume roads; Maintenance decision making; Measurement technologies; Pavement maintenance; Road transport sectors; Smartphone apps; Transportation",2-s2.0-85003674271

Such apps engage users while in proximity of places of interest (malls, bus stops, restaurants, theatres), but remain closed or unused after the user goes away. Since the number of 'places of interest' is constantly growing and can be large, it is impractical to install a large number of corresponding native applications on the phone when each app engages the user for only a small period of time. In this paper, we propose a dynamic framework for deploying highly-localized mobile web applications. Such web applications are deployed locally to users in proximity, and can be opened in the browser. Communication in the web app is performed over the Delay-Tolerant Network of mobile users, removing the need of an Internet connection. DTN protocols can be dynamically added or removed at run-time, allowing each application to use a protocol best suited to its needs. After usage, the web application is closed either manually by the user, or automatically when the user goes away from the place of interest. To restrict deployment of web apps to only those users in a relevant context (e.g.: people walking nearby a store), and to automatically switch off DTN protocols when user context changes, we have extended the framework to be 'context-aware', using the low-power barometer sensor on the phone to detect when the user is idle, walking, or in vehicle. Applications can specify which protocols to run in these user contexts, and when to switch them off, reducing power consumption. We have implemented the framework on Android. Our analysis of the framework show that the memory and performance overhead incurred is small. Using this framework, we have written a simple DTN web application for bus-stops to help the physically challenged. Using real-device measurements, we show that adding context awareness to the framework can reduce power consumption by at least 53%. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, HAR via a smartphone or wearable sensor can provide important information regarding the level of daily physical activity, especially in situations where a sedentary behavior usually occurs, like in modern workplace environments. Increased sitting time is significantly associated with severe health diseases, and the workplace is an appropriate intervention setting, due to the sedentary behavior typical of modern jobs. Within this paper, the state-of-the-art components of HAR are analyzed, in order to identify and select the most effective signal filtering and windowing solutions for physical activity monitoring. The classifier development process is based upon three phases; a feature extraction phase, a feature selection phase, and a training phase. In the training phase, a publicly available dataset is used to test among different classifier types and learning methods. A user-friendly Android-based smartphone application with low computational requirements has been developed to run field tests, which allows to easily change the classifier under test, and to collect new datasets ready for use with machine learning APIs. The newly created datasets may include additional information, like the smartphone position, its orientation, and the user's physical characteristics. Using the mobile tool, a classifier based on a decision tree is finally set up and enriched with the introduction of some robustness improvements. The developed approach is capable of classifying six activities, and to distinguish between not active (sitting) and active states, with an accuracy near to 99%. The mobile tool, which is going to be further extended and enriched, will allow for rapid and easy benchmarking of new algorithms based on previously generated data, and on future collected datasets. © 2016 Susanna Spinsante et al.",,"Algorithms; Application programming interfaces (API); Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Filtration; Learning systems; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Smartphones; Statistical tests; Wearable sensors; Accelerometer sensor; Computational requirements; Development process; Human activity recognition; Physical activity monitoring; Physical characteristics; Smart-phone applications; Workplace environments; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-84984698013

As a result, early signs of malnutrition are missed and nutritional treatment is initiated when patients have already experienced severe weight loss. Objective: We report on a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the global assessment and nutritional triage of the nutritional condition of oncology outpatients. The system combines clinical and laboratory data collected in the clinical setting with patient-generated data from a smartphone application for monitoring the patients' nutritional status. Our objective is to assess the feasibility of a CDSS that combines the aforementioned data sources and describe its integration into a hospital information system. Furthermore, we collected patients' opinions on the value of the system, and whether they would regard the system as a useful aid in coping with their condition. Materials and methods: The system implements the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) to monitor nutritional status in the outpatient setting. A smartphone application is used to collect patient-generated data by performing weekly mini-surveys on patients concerning their eating habits, weight, and overall well-being. Data are uploaded on completion of each mini-survey and stored on a secure server at the Medical University of Vienna (MUV). The data are then combined with relevant clinical information from the Vienna General Hospital (VGH) information system. The knowledge base for the CDSS is implemented in medical logic modules (MLMs) using Arden Syntax. A three-month pilot clinical trial was performed to test the feasibility of the system. Qualitative questionnaires were used to obtain the patients' opinions on the usability and personal value of the system during the four-week test period. Results: We used the existing separation between the scientific and clinical data domains in the secured network environment (SNE) at the MUV and VGH to our advantage by importing, storing, and processing both patient-generated and routine data in the scientific data domain. To limit exposure to the SNE, patient-generated data stored outside the SNE were imported to the scientific domain once a day. The CDSS created for nutritional assessment and triage comprised ten MLMs, each including either a sub-assessment or the final results of the PG-SGA. Finally, an interface created for the hospital information system showed the results directly in clinical routine. In all 22 patients completed the clinical study. The results of the questionnaires showed that 91% of the patients were generally happy with the usability of the system, 91% believed that the application was of additional value in detecting cancer-related malnutrition, and 82% found it helpful as a long-term monitoring tool. Discussion and conclusion: Despite strict protection of the clinical data domain, a CDSS employing patient-generated data can be integrated into clinical routine. The CDSS discussed in this report combined the information entered into a smartphone application with clinical data in order to inform the physician of a patient's nutritional status and thus permit suitable and timely intervention. The initial results show that the smartphone application was well accepted by patients, who considered it useful, but not many oncological outpatients were willing to participate in the clinical study because they did not possess an Android phone or lacked smartphone expertise. Furthermore, the results indicate that patient-generated data could be employed to augment clinical data and calculate metrics such as the PG-SGA without excessive effort by using a secure intermediate location as the locus of data storage and processing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Disease-related malnutrition; Medical oncology; Mobile health; Nutritional status; Telemedicine","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Hospitals; Information systems; Knowledge based systems; Logic devices; Mobile security; Nutrition; Oncology; Patient treatment; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Surveys; Syntactics; Telemedicine; Clinical decision support systems; Clinical information; Hospital information systems; Medical oncology; Mobile health; Nutritional conditions; Nutritional status; Smart-phone applications; Decision support systems",2-s2.0-84964414692

What is smartphone and why is it a smart? A smartphone by definition is as the name suggests, it is a phone is smart enough to not only be limited to the features and capabilities of a traditional cellular phone but also perform what a ""smart"" device can. And in recent years, the device that is deemed as the most intelligent device is the computer as it is the most advance piece of technology that is commercially available to the general public. Why this is so, is because in our opinion it has revolutionized how most if not all of the societies of today work. Hence what makes a smartphone is the mobile operating system that it is built upon, which is similar to a computer. It is becoming more and more of a common sight nowadays and this is because they are being offered at a price where more people are able to afford, hence they are reaching the hands of ceiling of the lower income families, all the way up to the higher income families. Back then, pure play devices were mostly simple in terms of how it function and works, hence if possible, we could suggest that the security aspect was never or rather has never been an issue other than the alteration of data after operation such as the tape of video recorders or images captured but never in the process, in the sense that there were no interruptions during operation, most likely is because it was clear and visible, but nowadays when you combine all of those devices into a complex entity, we tend to leave a hole in the cloth somewhere that we did not or rather can't see due to the overwhelming amount of other things that we have. In this paper we discuss the current state of the commercially available operating systems of the two biggest names in smart devices, namely iOS and Android; and measure how secure and/or vulnerable (susceptible) are they to malwares and the nature of the mobile ad hoc network. We first analyze the integrity of the core of a smart device, the operating system and then use it to evaluate the effectiveness of their techniques and defenses of preventing and identifying malwares. © 2016 SERSC.","Data extraction; Semantic analysis; Social media","Complex networks; Computer operating systems; Malware; Mobile ad hoc networks; Semantics; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Video recording; Complex entities; Data extraction; Intelligent devices; ITS applications; Mobile operating systems; Security aspects; Semantic analysis; Social media; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84995961312

This paper utilizes the embedded sensors in a smartphone to recognise a number of common human actions and postures. We group the range of all possible human actions into five basic action classes, namely walking, standing, sitting, crouching and lying. We also consider the postures pertaining to three of the above actions, including standing postures (backward, straight, forward and bend), sitting postures (lean, upright, slouch and rest) and lying postures (back, side and stomach). Training data was collected through a number of people performing a sequence of these actions and postures with a smartphone in their shirt pockets. We analysed and compared three classification algorithms, namely k Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Decision Tree Learning (DTL) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in terms of classification accuracy and efficiency (training time as well as classification time). kNN performed the best overall compared to the other two and is believed to be the most appropriate classification algorithm to use for this task. The developed system is in the form of an Android app. Our system can real-time accesses the motion data from the three sensors and on-line classifies a particular action or posture using the kNN algorithm. It successfully recognizes the specified actions and postures with very high precision and recall values of generally above 96%. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Learning algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Classification accuracy and efficiency; Classification algorithm; Classification time; Daily living activities; Data-driven approach; Decision tree learning; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Linear discriminant analysis; Data mining",2-s2.0-85000428307

Thus, algal growth should be carefully monitored during the summer season, especially in frequented recreational areas. Traditionally, water samples must be sent to a lab to analyze the data to predict algal blooms, costing time and money. Models on a smartphone predicting harmful algal blooms from easily measurable parameters could help individuals to take precautionary measures in order to prevent health risks from drinking and bathing in water and help to raise public awareness. In this work we present a mobile smartphone application that generates a prediction of the likelihood of an algal bloom from a variety of easily-measured input parameters that could be obtained by an informed smartphone user with simple instruments. Our model was implemented in an Android mobile phone application using App Inventor. The model we use is based on the Verhulst equation and allows users to enter any of the following measurements to predict and algal bloom: surface temperature, inverse Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen (DO) at the surface, and chlorophyll fluorescence (Chl-a). Our model was developed using a data set by weekly sampling of eutrophication parameters (temperature, conductivity, DO, phosphate, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, Chl-a, Secchi depth) during the summer season of 2013 (June-October) from a shallow lake situated in a recreational area within the town of Wolfenbüttel, Germany. Temperature differences within water depth layers were observed in mid-June, then partial circulation of the upper three water layers was reached in mid-August until temperatures gradually reached equilibrium at the beginning of August (full circulation). This coincided with full development of algal bloom (cyanobacterial Chl-a values reaching 40 μg L-1), Secchi depth values below 0.6 m and a sharp drop in phosphate and ammonia levels within the bottom water layer. Thus, phosphate concentration at lake bottom, temperature difference between water layers, and surface temperature were recognized as valuable parameters for a simple prediction model of harmful algal growth based on the Verhulst equation Nt = N0 + (k - N0)∗exp(-r0 ∗t). A partial least square analysis revealed parameters for estimation of chlorophyll fluorescence (total Chl-a (μg L-1) = -6.4775 + 21.6396 ∗ inverse Secchi depth (m) + 0.0006 ∗ square (DO surface (%); r2 = 0.69) as well as cyanobacterial chlorophyll fluorescence (cyanobacterial Chl-a (μg L-1) = 0.409-0.7486∗ surface temperature (°C) + 17.6979 ∗ inverse Secchi depth (m); r2 = 0.76) from this data set. From these datasets and models, we created a single model that uses Secchi depth in combination with either DO or temperature at the surface to predict algae blooms. © 2016 E.

Smart cities harness the power of data from sensors in order to understand and manage city systems. The most important of these sensing devices are smartphones as they provide the most important means to connect the smart city systems with its citizens, allowing personalization n and cocreation. The battery lifetime of smartphones is one of the most important parameters in achieving good user experience for the device. Therefore, the management and the optimization of handheld device applications in relation to their power consumption are an important area of research. This paper investigates the relationship between the energy consumption of a localization application and the strength of the global positioning system (GPS) signal. This is an important focus, because location-based applications are among the top power-hungry applications. We conduct experiments on two android location-based applications, one developed by us, and the other one, off the shelf. We use the results from the measurements of the two applications to derive a mathematical model that describes the power consumption in smartphones in terms of SNR and the time to first fix. The results from this study show that higher SNR values of GPS signals do consume less energy, while low GPS signals causing faster battery drain (38% as compared with 13%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a quantitative understanding of how the poor strength (SNR) of satellite signals will cause relatively higher power drain from a smartphone's battery. © 2013 IEEE.","Energy Efficiency; Green Mobile Computing; Power Model; Signal Strength; Smart Cities; Smart Phones","Electric batteries; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Hand held computers; Information management; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Urban growth; Digital infrastructures; Location-based applications; Power model; Satellite signals; Signal strengths; Smart cities; Time to first fixes; Urban development; Global positioning system",2-s2.0-84979820330

With increasing ubiquity of wearable heart rate monitors and their unobtrusiveness, HRV (Heart rate variability) derived from heart rate signals has emerged as one of the most relevant parameters for continuous monitoring of stress. In the present work, we have made an attempt to address the challenges about distinguishing between stressed and non-stressed state of a person based on just one minute of IBI (Inter Beat Interval) records with good accuracy. Such ultra-short term analysis of HRV is particularly advantageous towards capturing very short term fluctuations in mental stress levels and enhanced scope for frequent monitoring. We have analyzed various time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear HRV features to narrow down to a most influential set of features for accurate classification between stressed and non-stressed state. We have identified RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) of IBI series to be the most direct indicator of stressed state. We also provide a continuous stress score which, when used in continuous monitoring scenario, provides the user with adequate details about his/her stress levels. This helps the user to understand stress patterns across a day in a better way and to take appropriate measures to manage stressful situations.

For the purpose of this study, we define low-literate as those users whose education is equal or more than Standard Four and less than or equal to Standard Eight in the Indian State education system. Our users were recruited primarily from the contractual house-keeping staff of a very large Private Organization and an Educational Institute (42 Male, 3 Female), household help (3 Female), drivers (5 Male), guards (1 Male), shopkeepers (1 Male, 1 Female) and homemakers (4 Female). Our objective was to develop an understanding of information security issues in the context of the mobile phone, identification of problems and design ideas for design of interventions. Our methodology included Contextual Inquiry and Analysis with notes pertaining to User Statements, Task Breakdowns, Observations and Design Ideas. The notes across the study were consolidated using Affinity Diagrams. We found that users have an elementary understanding of asset valuation and response. Literacy impedes adoption of an appropriate response to the threats using the mechanisms provided by the mobile phone since conceptual models are not clearly comprehended. It is also impeded because the users are unable to articulate a structured response to the landscape of threats. Due to the cognitive load induced by the possible factors which may get involved in risk articulation, users tend to adopt mitigation techniques propagated by the micro-networks without complete comprehension of risks or due analysis. Belief systems are more likely to drive a response than a more reasoned, well-aware response. Information or awareness is propagated via social mechanisms - however, these are not necessarily correct most of the times, primarily due to the inappropriate conceptual models formulated. The interface and conceptual model complexity of a modern touch screen smartphone compounds matters. Mobile Learning AIDS or Gamification of concepts can help users adopt more appropriate response mechanism to perceived threats to privacy and security issues. Interfaces built with single sign-on, local language display and text input would also help in building more safe environments for users to use the mobile phone. While more-literate users are likely to mimic a =plan-do-check-act model low-literate are more likely to have a =do or a =do or a =do-act cycle due to non-awareness or non-comprehension of =plan-check components. © 2015 ACM.","Android; Contextual Inquiry; Feature Phone; ICT4D; Low-Literate Users; Mobile Applications; Mobile Phones; Mobile Security; Smartphone; Usable Security; User Study","Cellular telephones; Complex networks; E-learning; Mobile phones; Mobile security; Risk assessment; Security of data; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Touch screens; Android; Contextual inquiry; Feature phones; ICT4D; Low literates; Mobile applications; Usable security; User study; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-84959282694

Still, during the last years many new messengers were developed for Android, where often privacy was not considered to be a key issue. Due to the widespread use of these apps even in corporate environments this opens up attack vectors that can result in advanced persistent threats. In this paper we analyze the most prominent messenger apps with respect to privacy concepts, focusing not only on the transmission layer regarding the support of encrypted communication, but also attacks targeting the communication metadata, e.g. detecting the existence of communication between users, as well as providing an enumeration of all users of a service. Furthermore, device theft and loss is a major issue regarding the protection of user privacy. Thus, we also analyzed, whether the messages are stored in a secure way on the device itself, or if control over the physical device allows access to the message data. In order to analyze the possible usability of these messengers as means for targeted surveillance of users by the provider (or an entity controlling it), we also analyzed the rights and privileges the respective apps need in order to be able to install and work. Here, major differences could be detected, with several apps claiming privileges that could not be explained with the normal mode of operation, thus posing a serious risk for the privacy of the respective user base. © 2015 ACM.",,"Information analysis; Web services; Websites; World Wide Web; Attack vector; Communication software; Corporate environment; Encrypted communication; General publics; Physical devices; Privacy protection; Transmission layers; Information retrieval",2-s2.0-84966728794

A monitoring application may require different types of sensing data, while under a budget constraint. This paper explores the crucial problem of maximizing the aggregate data utility of heterogeneous sensing tasks while maintaining utility-centric fairness across different tasks under a budget constraint. In particular, we take the redundancy of sensing data into account. This problem is highly challenging given its unique characteristics including the intrinsic trade off between aggregate data utility and fairness, and the large number of smartphones. We propose a fairness-aware distributed approach to solving this problem. To overcome the intractability of the problem, we decompose it to two sub problems of recruiting smartphones under a budget constraint and allocating workloads of sensing tasks. For the first sub problem, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm which has a constant approximation ratio of two. For the second problem, we apply dual based decomposition based on which we design a distributed algorithm for determining the workloads of different tasks on each recruited smartphone. We have implemented our distributed algorithm on a windows-based server and Android-based smartphones. With extensive simulations we demonstrate that our approach achieves high aggregate data utility while maintaining good utility-centric fairness across sensing tasks. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Aggregates; Approximation algorithms; Budget control; Economic and social effects; Smartphones; Windows operating system; Approximation ratios; Budget constraint; Distributed approaches; Extensive simulations; Greedy algorithms; Heterogeneous sensing; Monitoring applications; Real time monitoring; Problem solving",2-s2.0-84976501293

To simplify the measurement and reduce the cost, software based on artificial neural networks for measuring heat collection rate and heat loss coefficient of water-inglass evacuated tube solar water heaters was developed. Using multilayer feed-forward neural networks with back-propagation algorithm, we developed and tested our program on the basis of 915measuredsamples of water-in-glass evacuated tube solar water heaters. This artificial neural networks-based software program automatically obtained accurate heat collection rateand heat loss coefficient using simply ""portable test instruments"" acquired parameters, including tube length, number of tubes, tube center distance, heat water mass in tank, collector area, angle between tubes and ground and final temperature.

Smartphone apps are usually not secure and need user permission to access protected system resources. Specifically, the existing Android permission system will check whether the calling app has the right permission to invoke sensitive system APIs. Android OS allows third-party applications. Whenever a user installs any third party application user is having, only limited options at the time of installation. Either user can agree to all terms and conditions and install that application or reject from the installation of applications. Existing approaches failed to provide security to user's sensitive data from being violated. To protect user's privacy, there is a need for secure permission management for Android applications. In this paper, to fine-grained the permission management, we have proposed a system which provides a facility to smartphone user's grant or revoke access to user's private sensitive data as per user's choice.

An elevated road may overlap with the ground surface road. This poses a great challenge to auto navigation systems. It is particularly difficult for auto navigation systems to determine if an vehicle is running on an elevated road because altitude readings from GPS (Global Positioning Systems) receivers are of low accuracy. Without correct positioning of elevated or surface roads, an auto navigation system may recommend wrong routes which may lead to serious traffic accidents or cause drivers' anxiety. In this paper, we design a smartphone-based system called DEEL for detecting road elevation as the vehicle moves on urban roads. HMM-based models are built to characterize the patterns of vehicle dynamics with respect to the elevation of the road that the vehicle is moving on. The system leverages smartphone sensors to sense the instantaneous vehicle dynamics, including the 3D acceleration, the speed, and the number of perceived GPS satellites. Based on the sensed dynamics, it determines whether the vehicle is running on an elevated road or not in an online fashion. We have successfully implemented our system in Android-based smartphones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the system achieves a high accuracy of 92.1% with strong robustness to variations of vehicles, drivers and roads. © 2015 IEEE.","detection; online; road elevation; Smartphones; vehicles","Dynamics; Error detection; Global positioning system; Navigation systems; Roads and streets; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; 3D accelerations; Ground surfaces; On-line fashion; online; road elevation; Strong robustness; Urban traffic congestion; Vehicle dynamics; Transportation",2-s2.0-84960870508

One of the leaders of this evolution is Android, a mobile operating system that continuously elevates existing features and offers new applications. Such improvements allowed Android to gain popularity worldwide. A combination of Android's advance technology and increasing popularity allow smartphones supporting this operating system to become a rich source of trace evidence. Traces found on Android smartphones form a significant part of digital investigations, especially when the user of the smartphone is involved in criminal activities. A key component of these traces is the date and time, often formed as timestamps. These timestamps allow the examiner to relate the traces found on Android smartphones to some real event that took place. Knowing when events occurred in digital investigations is of great importance to the overall success of the investigation. This paper introduces a new solution, called the Authenticity Framework for Android Timestamps (AFAT) that establishes the authenticity of timestamps found on Android smartphones. Currently the framework determines the authenticity of timestamps found in SQLite databases by following two individual methods. The first method identifies the presence of certain changes in the Android file system, which are indications of the manipulation of the SQLite databases. The second method subsequently focuses on the individual SQLite databases and the identification of inconsistencies in these databases. The presence of specific file system changes as well as inconsistencies in the associated SQLite databases indicates that authenticity of the timestamps might be compromised. The results presented in the paper provide preliminary evidence that the suggested approach, Authenticity Framework for Android Timestamps, shows potential. © 2015 IEEE.","Android; Digital Forensics; Manipulation; Mobile Forensics; Smartphones; SQLite Databases; Timestamps","Database systems; File organization; Security of data; Smartphones; Android; Digital forensic; Manipulation; Mobile forensics; Time stamps; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84962050537

We have proposed a prototype which is an indoor navigation application for blinds that uses QR codes. It is developed for android Smart phones and does not require any additional hardware for navigation. It provides automatic navigational assistance on pre-defined paths for blind. QR codes are placed on the floor sections after specific distance that acts as an input for current location detection and navigation. Whenever a QR code is scanned it provides the user with the information of the current location and asks the user to select the destination and then offers optimal and shortest path using path finding algorithms. During navigation whenever the deviation from the proposed path is detected it prompts the user and guides back to the right path by comparing the current path with the generated path. All of the instructions throughout the application are provided in audio form to the user. The interface of the application is well built for blinds which makes the smart phones user-friendly and useable for blind people. The user interacts with the application through a specific set of user-friendly gestures for specific inputs and operations.

This method needs to collect the RSSI of APs from the interested place beforehand to build the building's WiFi radio fingerprint database and this task is time-consuming. Meanwhile, it also needs to resample very often in order to keep the accuracy of the positioning result. In this paper, we design and test a fast setup algorithm for collecting those sampling information. The Android smartphone and its build-in motion sensors were used to help collecting the AP's RSSI. We use the motion sensor to detect the pace while walking and collect the AP's RSSI in every step. The method gets through the sampling work in a walking duration which is much shorter than traditional method. This paper also compares the fast setup method with the traditional method from the positioning accuracy point of view. Experiments show that there is no significant difference on positioning accuracy between them. © 2015 ICST.","Indoor Positioing System; IPS; motion sensor; radio-map; Smartphone; WiFi","Indoor positioning systems; Laptop computers; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Mobile telecommunication systems; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Wi-Fi; Android smartphone; Indoor Positioing System; Mobile communications; Motion sensors; Positioning accuracy; Radio fingerprints; Radio maps; Sampling information; Cellular telephone systems",2-s2.0-84962428816

A communication divide exists between the deaf and hearing communities, to the disadvantage of the deaf. This paper explores the design and implementation of a mobile application for South African Sign Language recognition. The application connects, via Bluetooth, to an instrumented glove developed by the University of Cape Town. The objective is to recognize the manual alphabet and manual numeric digits that have static gestures (31 signs in total). Two neural networks (one with a log-sigmoid, and one with a symmetric Elliott activation function) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared. The SVM was chosen for implementation primarily because of its high accuracy of 99% and its superior robustness. The mobile application is developed for Android and allows the user to connect to a Bluetooth glove, display and dictate the classification output and calibrate the connected glove. On a low-end smartphone, the classification time did not exceed 45ms, the memory usage did not exceed 15 MB, and the battery life during typical usage was approximately 11 hours. © 2015 IEEE.","Android; Glove Based Input; Machine Learning; Mobile Application; Neural Networks; SASL; South African Sign Language; SVM; Translation","Android (operating system); Artificial intelligence; Audition; Bluetooth; Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Neural networks; Radioactivity logging; Support vector machines; Translation (languages); Android; Glove Based Input; Mobile applications; SASL; Sign language; Mobile computing",2-s2.0-84962577478

The approach allows to compose gestures synthetically, i.e., by recording complex gestures directly as they are performed, and analytically, i.e., by selecting and composing existing gestures to define more complex ones. Analytical gesture composition doesn't have to be sequential: the gestures can be superposed. We explored this in a setting of using a mobile device to control a remote device. In our case, this was a smartphone controlling a computer, which we assume to be most probable setting in practice. For this, a client-server system was developed consisting of the application running on the Android mobile device using the accelerometer, proximity sensor, touchscreen, and ambient light sensor to capture gestures. The server-side application that runs on a computer was developed to store and recognize gestures. The preliminary evaluation results are promising exhibiting the 85% rate in the ability of users to replicate gestures not created by them.

In this context, we present a self-contained smart phone implementation of video plethysmography for Android OS, which employs both stochastic and deterministic algorithms, and we use this to study the effect of lighting parameters (illuminance, color spectrum) on the accuracy of the remote HR measurement. Using two different phone models, we present the median HR error for five different video plethysmography algorithms under three different types of lighting (natural sunlight, compact fluorescent, and halogen incandescent) and variations in brightness. For most algorithms, we found the optimum light brightness to be in the range 1000-4000 lux and the optimum lighting types to be compact fluorescent and natural light. Moderate errors were found for most algorithms with some devices under conditions of low-brightness (<500 lux) and high-brightness (>4000 lux).

In contrast with previous solutions in the existing literature, which are based on the performance of a single element (a smartphone), this paper proposes and evaluates a fall detection system that benefits from the detection performed by two popular personal devices: a smartphone and a smartwatch (both provided with an embedded accelerometer and a gyroscope). In the proposed architecture, a specific application in each component permanently tracks and analyses the patient's movements. Diverse fall detection algorithms (commonly employed in the literature) were implemented in the developed Android apps to discriminate falls from the conventional activities of daily living of the patient. As a novelty, a fall is only assumed to have occurred if it is simultaneously and independently detected by the two Android devices (which can interact via Bluetooth communication). The system was systematically evaluated in an experimental testbed with actual test subjects simulating a set of falls and conventional movements associated with activities of daily living. The tests were repeated by varying the detection algorithm as well as the pre-defined mobility patterns executed by the subjects (i.e., the typology of the falls and non-fall movements). The proposed system was compared with the cases where only one device (the smartphone or the smartwatch) is considered to recognize and discriminate the falls. The obtained results show that the joint use of the two detection devices clearly increases the system's capability to avoid false alarms or 'false positives' (those conventional movements misidentified as falls) while maintaining the effectiveness of the detection decisions (that is to say, without increasing the ratio of 'false negatives' or actual falls that remain undetected). © 2015 Casilari, Oviedo-Jiménez.

Traditional defenses to malware, however, are not suitable for smartphones due to their resource intensive nature. This necessitates the design of novel mechanisms that can consider the specifics of the smartphone malware and smartphones themselves. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight permission enforcement approach - Tap-Wave-Rub (TWR) - for smartphone malware prevention. TWR is based on simple cyber-physical human interactions, i.e., human gestures, that are very quick and intuitive but less likely to be exhibited in users' daily activities. Presence or absence of such gestures, prior to accessing an application, can effectively inform the OS whether the access request is benign or malicious. In particular, we present the design of two mechanisms: 1) acceleration-based phone tapping detection and 2) proximity-based finger tapping, rubbing, or hand waving detection. The first mechanism is geared for near field communication applications, which usually require the user to tap her phone with another device. The second mechanism involves very simple gestures, i.e., tapping or rubbing a finger near the top of phone's screen or waving a hand close to the phone, and broadly appeals to many applications (e.g., SMS). In addition, we present the TWR-enhanced Android permission model, the prototypes implementing the underlying gesture recognition mechanisms, and a variety of novel experiments to evaluate these mechanisms. Our results suggest the proposed approach could be very effective for malware detection/prevention, with quite low false positives and false negatives, while imposing little to no additional burden on the users. © 2015 IEEE.","context recognition; malware; mobile devices; NFC; sensors","Computer crime; Gesture recognition; Mobile devices; Near field communication; Sensors; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Context recognition; Cyber physicals; False negatives; Human interactions; Malware detection; NFC; Recognition mechanism; Smartphone malware; Malware",2-s2.0-84941145672

In collaboration with Doctors without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), this study presents a novel approach to collect information about socio-economic vulnerabilities related to malnutrition, access to resources and coping capacities. The first technical test was carried out in the North of the country (sub-prefecture Kabo) in May 2015. All activities were aimed at the investigation of technical feasibility, not at operational data collection, which requires a random sampling strategy. At the core of the study is an open-source Android application named SATIDA COLLECT that facilitates rapid and simple data collection. All assessments were carried out by local MSF staff after they had been trained for one day. Once a mobile network is available, all assessments can easily be uploaded to a database for further processing and trend analysis via MSF in-house software. On one hand, regularly updated food security assessments can complement traditional large-scale surveys, whose completion can take up to eight months. Ideally, this leads to a gain in time for disaster logistics. On the other hand, recording the location of every assessment via the smart phones' GPS receiver helps to analyze and display the coupling between drought risk and impacts over many years. Although the current situation in the Central African Republic is mostly related to violent conflict it is necessary to consider information about drought risk, because climatic shocks can further disrupt the already vulnerable system. SATIDA COLLECT can easily be adapted to local conditions or other applications, such as the evaluation of vaccination campaigns. Most importantly, it facilitates the standardized collection of information without pen and paper, as well as straightforward sharing of collected data with the MSF headquarters or other aid organizations. © 2015 Enenkel et al.

Although indoor maps are becoming increasingly available, there is no practical and reliable indoor map matching solution available at present. We present MapCraft, a novel, robust and responsive technique that is extremely computationally efficient (running in under 10 ms on an Android smartphone), does not require training in different sites, and tracks well even when presented with very noisy sensor data. Key to our approach is expressing the tracking problem as a conditional random field (CRF), a technique which has had great success in areas such as natural language processing. Unlike directed graphical models like Hidden Markov Models, CRFs capture arbitrary constraints that express how well observations support state transitions, given map constraints. In addition, we show how to further improve tracking accuracy, by tuning the parameters of the motion sensing model using an unsupervised EM-style optimization scheme. Extensive experiments in multiple sites show how MapCraft outperforms state-of-the art approaches, demonstrating excellent tracking error and accurate reconstruction of tortuous trajectories with zero training effort. As proof of its robustness, we also demonstrate how it is able to accurately track the position of a user from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements only (i.e., gyro- And Wi-Fi-free).

If not considered, this could lead to significant memory contention and result in lowered user experience. In this paper, we design experiments to analyze the performance degradation caused by the interference at the memory subsystem for a broad range of commonly-used smart phone applications.

A number of interesting and important questions remain unanswered, such as why a user likes/dislikes an app, how an app becomes popular or eventually perishes, how a user selects apps to install and interacts with them, how frequently an app is used and how much traffic it generates, etc. This paper presents an empirical analysis of app usage behaviors collected from millions of users of Wandoujia, a leading Android app marketplace in China. The dataset covers two types of user behaviors of using over 0.2 million Android apps, including (1) app management activities (i.e., installation, updating, and uninstallation) of over 0.8 million unique users and (2) app network traffic from over 2 million unique users. We explore multiple aspects of such behavior data and present interesting patterns of app usage.

In order to enrich the functions of the phone and facilitate the utilization of users, more and more Android applications have been developed. Unfortunately, a greatly increasing amount of malware targeting the Android platform mingle with the numerous benign applications and hide in almost every market, even the official market Google Play. Therefore, it is a pressing concern about how to measure and assess the risk of such apps. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with this problem. First of all, through the empirical analysis with market-scale dataset, we verify the following fact: for a set of benign applications in the same category, the type and number of permissions they request are similar and consistent in general. Hence, for the benign applications in each category, we can construct a standard permission vector model, which can be used as a baseline to measure and assess the risk of applications in the category. For a downloaded app, we extract its requested permissions to form a permission vector, whose deviation from the baseline can be calculated by employing Euclidean distance and weighted Euclidean distance. The deviation can be used as metric to measure and assess the risk of the app. Finally, an experiment on real-world dataset, consisting of 7737 market apps and 1260 malware samples, is conducted to evaluate our method. The empirical result validates the effectiveness of our approach to help users understand the risk when they decide to install an app. © 2015 IEEE.","Android application; risk; smartphone","Commerce; Computer crime; Malware; Mobile devices; Risk assessment; Risks; Software engineering; Android applications; Android platforms; Effective approaches; Empirical analysis; Euclidean distance; Popular platform; Vector models; Weighted euclidean distance; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84958159416

Achieving effective record-andreplay is a balancing act between accuracy and overhead. On smartphones, the act is particularly complicated, because smartphone apps receive a high-bandwidth stream of input (e.g., network, GPS, camera, microphone, touchscreen) and concurrency events, but the stream has to be recorded and replayed with minimal overhead, to avoid interfering with app execution. Prior record-and-replay approaches have focused on replaying machine instructions or system calls, which is not a good fit on smartphones.We propose a novel, stream-oriented record-and-replay approach which achieves high-accuracy and low-overhead by aiming at a sweet spot: recording and replaying sensor and network input, event schedules, and inter-app communication via intents. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we have constructed a tool named VALERA that supports record-and-replay on the Android platform. VALERA works with apps running directly on the phone, and does not require access to the app source code. Through an evaluation on 50 popular Android apps, we show that: VALERA's replay fidelity far exceeds current record-and-replay approaches for Android; VALERA's precise timing control and low overhead (about 1% for either record or replay) allows it to replay high-throughput, timing-sensitive apps such as video/audio capture and recognition; and VALERA's support for event schedule replay enables the construction of useful analyses, such as reproducing event-driven race bugs. © 2015 ACM.","App testing; Event-based races; Google Android; Mobile applications; Record-and-replay","Computational linguistics; Computer systems programming; Object oriented programming; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android platforms; Event-based; Google Android; High throughput; Machine instructions; Mobile applications; Record-and-replay; Smartphone apps; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84958681574

Smartphone camera technology has provided an efficient way for capturing digital images. Unauthorized sharing of data may lead to illegal usage of data for different purposes. Hence watermarking proves to be an efficient way for preventing piracy and illegal misuse of data. We implement watermarking algorithm using frequency domain techniques of DCT on Real Time captured images. We implement watermark embedding as well as extraction algorithm for digital images. Visible watermarking algorithms are developed by keeping the Android image processing tools as the base structure and invisible watermarking is implemented using OpenCV. On using this system, pre-specified copyright information is embedded directly on the pictures when they are taken. User can also neglect embedding watermark by capturing images using default methods like in the usual way. OpenCV provides a better and efficient interface for implementing complex and computationally expensive algorithms. The watermark extraction algorithm is also implemented using frequency domain analysis. For qualitative analysis, we perform various image distortion operations for calculating the efficiency of our algorithm.

As our analyzed dataset is small as compared to the total population of Android users, we also study how unicity would vary with larger datasets. This work emphasizes the need of better privacy guards against collection, use and release of the list of installed apps.",,"Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Learning systems; Semantics; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Identifiability; Off-the-shelf machine; Re identifications; Smart-phone applications; Smartphone apps; User interests; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84959554680

In the event of a crime, the photographic evidence that these cameras leave in a smartphone's memory becomes vital pieces of digital evidence, and forensic investigators are tasked with recovering and analyzing this evidence. Unfortunately, few existing forensics tools are capable of systematically recovering and inspecting such in-memory photographic evidence produced by smartphone cameras. In this paper, we present VCR, a memory forensics technique which aims to fill this void by enabling the recovery of all photographic evidence produced by an Android device's cameras. By leveraging key aspects of the Android framework, VCR extends existing memory forensics techniques to improve vendor-customized Android memory image analysis. Based on this, VCR targets application-generic artifacts in an input memory image which allow photographic evidence to be collected no matter which application produced it. Further, VCR builds upon the Android framework's existing image decoding logic to both automatically recover and render any located evidence. Our evaluation with commercially available smartphones shows that VCR is highly effective at recovering all forms of photographic evidence produced by a variety of applications across several different Android platforms. © 2015 ACM.","Android; Digital forensics; Memory forensics","Cameras; Recovery; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android; Android platforms; Digital evidence; Digital forensic; Forensics tool; Memory forensics; Smart-phone cameras; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84954092717

Such information provides vital clues to the investigation of crimes in both cyber and physical spaces. In real-world digital forensics however, once an electronic device becomes evidence most manual interactions with it are prohibited by criminal investigation protocols. Hence investigators must resort to ""image-and-analyze""memory forensics (instead of browsing through the subject phone) to recover the apps' GUIs. Unfortunately, GUI reconstruction is still largely impossible with state-of-the-art memory forensics techniques, which tend to focus only on individual in-memory data structures. An Android GUI, however, displays diverse visual elements each built from numerous data structure instances. Furthermore, whenever an app is sent to the background, its GUI structure will be explicitly deallocated and disintegrated by the Android framework. In this paper, we present GUITAR, an app-independent technique which automatically reassembles and redraws all apps' GUIs from the multitude of GUI data elements found in a smartphone's memory image. To do so, GUITAR involves the reconstruction of (1) GUI tree topology, (2) drawing operation mapping, and (3) runtime environment for redrawing. Our evaluation shows that GUITAR is highly accurate (80-95% similar to original screenshots) at reconstructing GUIs from memory images taken from a variety of Android apps on popular phones. Moreover, GUITAR is robust in reconstructing meaningful GUIs even when facing GUI data loss. © 2015 ACM.","Android; Digital forensics; Memory forensics","Data structures; Electronic crime countermeasures; Graphical user interfaces; Musical instruments; Semantics; Smartphones; Telephone sets; User interfaces; Android; Contextual information; Criminal investigation; Digital forensic; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Manual interaction; Memory forensics; Runtime environments; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84954089515

These apps steal users' secret data and transmit it out of the phones. By analyzing the required permissions and the abnormal behaviors, some malicious apps may be easily detected. However, in this paper, we present a bidirectional covert channel in Android, named biTheft, which steals secrets and privacies covertly without any permission. biTheft firstly collects secret data from a set of unprotected shared resources in Android system. Then, it analyzes and infers secrets from the data. With the Intent mechanism, biTheft transmits secrets by legally launching some activities of other apps without requiring any permission itself. biTheft also monitors the usages and statuses of the shared resources to receive commands from remote server. We implement a biTheft scenario, and demonstrate that some types of secrets can be stolen and transmitted out. With pre-agreement, biTheft dynamically adjusts according with the remote server commands. Comparing with the traditional covert channels, biTheft is more practical in the real world scenarios.","Android applications; Bidirectional covert channel; HTML5; Intent mechanism; Privacy leakage; Zero-permission","Data privacy; Security of data; Android applications; Covert channels; HTML5; Privacy leakages; Zero-permission; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84954138765

Although today's smartphone operating systems are trying to provide a secure environment, they fail to provide users with ade- quate control over and visibility into how third-party appli- cations use their private data. Whereas there are a few tools that alert users when ap- plications leak private information, these tools are often hard to use by the average user or have other problems. To address these problems, we present PrivacyGuard, an open-source VPN-based platform for intercepting the net- work traffic of applications. PrivacyGuard requires neither root permissions nor any knowledge about VPN technology from its users. PrivacyGuard does not significantly increase the trusted computing base since PrivacyGuard runs in its entirety on the local device and traffic is not routed through a remote VPN server. We implement PrivacyGuard on the Android platform by taking advantage of the VPNService class provided by the Android SDK. PrivacyGuard is configurable, extensible, and useful for many different purposes. We investigate its use for detect- ing the leakage of multiple types of sensitive data, such as a phone's IMEI number or location data. PrivacyGuard also supports modifying the leaked information and replac- ing it with crafted data for privacy protection. According to our experiments, PrivacyGuard can detect more leakage incidents by applications and advertisement libraries than TaintDroid. We also demonstrate that PrivacyGuard has reasonable overhead on network performance and almost no overhead on battery consumption. © 2015 ACM.",,"Computer privacy; Data privacy; Mobile devices; Smartphones; Virtual private networks; Android platforms; Battery consumption; Information leakage; Privacy protection; Private information; Sensitive datas; Trusted computing base; VPN - Technology; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84955516044

The core of Android, System Server (SS), is a multi-threaded process that contains most of the system services and provides the essential functionalities to support applications (apps). Considering the complicated design of the SS and its easily-accessible system services (e.g., via Android APIs), we conjecture that the SS may face DoS attacks. As the SS plays the important role in Android, serious DoS attacks could cause single-point-of-failure to the phone system. By studying the source code, we discovered a general design trait in the concurrency control mechanism of the SS that could be vulnerable to DoS attacks. To validate our hypothesis, we design a tool to cost efficiently explore high-risk methods in the SS. After a systematic analysis of 2,154 candidate-risky methods, we found four unknown vulnerabilities in critical services (e.g., the ActivityManager and the WindowManager), which are named the Android Stroke Vulnerabilities (ASVs). Exploiting the ASVs would continuously block all other requests for system services, followed by killing the SS and soft-rebooting the OS. Results of a further threat analysis show that by writing a loop to invoke Android APIs in an app, an attacker can continually freeze (reboot) the device at targeted critical moments (e.g., when patching vulnerable apps). Furthermore, ASVs can be exploited to enhance malware with anti-removal capability or to design the ransomware by putting the devices into continuous DoS loops. After being informed, Google confirmed our findings promptly. We also proposed to their Android framework team several improvements in their concurrency control design and a finegrained failure recovery mechanism for the SS.","Denial of service; Mobile security; Risk measurement; Vulnerability detection","Android (operating system); Biomedical equipment; Computer crime; Concurrency control; Denial-of-service attack; Design; Malware; Risk assessment; Critical service; Denial of Service; Failure recovery mechanism; Mission critical tasks; Risk measurement; Satellite projects; Systematic analysis; Vulnerability detection; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84954115060

However, the clinical reliability of these medical apps remains questionable. We reviewed available apps themed specifically towards Orthopaedic Sports Medicine and related conditions and assessed the level of medical professional involvement in their design and content, along with a review of these apps. Method: The most popular smartphone app stores (Android, Apple, Blackberry, Windows, Samsung, Nokia) were searched for Orthopaedic Sports medicine themed apps, using the search terms; Orthopaedic Sports Medicine, Orthopaedics, Sports medicine, Knee Injury, Shoulder Injury, Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear, Medial Collateral Ligament Tear, Rotator Cuff Tear, Meniscal Tear, Tennis Elbow. All English language apps related to orthopaedic sports medicine were included. Results: A total of 76 individual Orthopaedic Sports Medicine themed apps were identified. According to app store classifications, there were 45 (59 %) medical themed apps, 28 (37 %) health and fitness themed apps, 1 (1 %) business app, 1 (1 %) reference app and 1 (1 %) sports app. Forty-nine (64 %) apps were available for download free of charge. For those that charged access, the prices ranged from £0.69 to £69.99. Only 51 % of sports medicine apps had customer satisfaction ratings and 39 % had named medical professional involvement in their development or content. Conclusions: We found the majority of Orthopaedic Sports Medicine apps had no named medical professional involvement, raising concerns over their content and evidence-base. We recommend increased regulation of such apps to improve the accountability of app content. © 2015 Wong et al.","Apps; Orthopaedic sports medicine; Smartphone",,2-s2.0-84944706282

New versions may fix important security bugs, which is why users should usually update their apps. However, occasionally apps turn malicious or radically change features in a way users dislike. Users should not necessarily always update in those circumstances, but current update processes are largely automatic. Therefore, it is important to understand user behaviors around updating apps and help them to make security-conscious choices. We conducted two related studies in this area. First, to understand users' current update decisions, we conducted an online survey of user attitudes toward updates. Based on the survey results, we then designed a notification scheme integrating user reviews, which we tested in a field study. Participants installed an Android app that simulated update notifications, enabling us to collect users' update decisions and reactions. We compared the effectiveness of our review-based update notifications with the permission-based notifications. Compared to notifications with permission descriptions only, we found our review-based update notification was more effective at alerting users of invasive or malicious app updates, especially for less trustworthy apps. © 2015 ACM.","Security and privacy; Smartphone application","Behavioral research; Mobile devices; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Surveys; Field studies; Online surveys; Security and privacy; Security bugs; Smart-phone applications; User attitudes; User behaviors; User reviews; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84955442423

By extract the control flow graph, we form structural information of methods in Android application called'4-tuple'. After we create the structural information extracted from the control flow graph it is necessary to compare the matching process. Matching process we propose has two steps, 'initial matching' and 'second matching'. Initial matching step is the process of matching the'4-tuple' information but not exactly same with each other only a single in Android application. Second matching step is process of matching in the same way as the initial matching target method that calling its method and method that is invoked.

Assessment of current mental fitness for executing a task at hand might avoid unnecessary risks. To obtain this knowledge, two physiological measurements were recorded in this work using customized non-invasive wearable instrumentation that measures electrocardiogram (ECG) and thoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) signals. The relevant information from each measurement is extracted via evaluation of a reduced set of selected features. These features are primarily obtained from filtered and processed versions of the raw time measurements with calculations of certain statistical and descriptive parameters. Selection of the reduced set of features was performed using genetic algorithms, thus constraining the computational cost of the real-time implementation. Different classification approaches have been studied, but neural networks were chosen for this investigation because they represent a good tradeoff between the intelligence of the solution and computational complexity. Three different application scenarios were considered. In the first scenario, the proposed system is capable of distinguishing among different types of activity with a 21.2% probability error, for activities coded as neutral, emotional, mental and physical. In the second scenario, the proposed solution distinguishes among the three different emotional states of neutral, sadness and disgust, with a probability error of 4.8%. In the third scenario, the system is able to distinguish between low mental load and mental overload with a probability error of 32.3%. The computational cost was calculated, and the solution was implemented in commercially available Android-based smartphones. The results indicate that execution of such a monitoring solution is negligible compared to the nominal computational load of current smartphones. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bioimpedance; ECG; Ergonomics; Physiological measurements; Smart textiles; Smartphone; Stress detection","Complex networks; Electric impedance; Electrocardiography; Ergonomics; Errors; Genetic algorithms; Patient monitoring; Physiology; Probability; Real time control; Smart textiles; Smartphones; Wearable technology; Bio-impedance; Classification approach; Electrical bio-impedance; Physiological measurement; Physiological signals; Professional activities; Real-time implementations; Stress detection; Risk assessment; ambulatory monitoring; artificial neural network; bioengineering; devices; diagnosis; emotion; human; impedance plethysmography; mental stress; mobile application; physiological stress; procedures; signal processing; smartphone; textile; wireless communication; Emotions; Human Engineering; Humans; Mobile Applications; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Neural Networks (Computer); Plethysmography, Impedance; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Smartphone; Stress, Physiological; Stress, Psychological; Textiles; Wireless Technology",2-s2.0-84943742389

We developed a smartphone application for CHO, LIP, and PRO counting in daily food and assessed its usability in real-life conditions and potential usefulness.METHODS: Ten T1D patients used the android application for 1 week to collect their food intakes. Data included meal composition, premeal and 2-hour postmeal blood glucose, corrections for hypo- or hyperglycemia after meals, and time for entering meals in the application. Meal insulin doses were based on patients' CHO counting (application in blinded mode). Linear mixed models were used to assess the statistical differences.RESULTS: In all, 187 meals were analyzed. Average computed CHO amount was 74.37 ± 31.78 grams; LIP amount: 20.26 ± 14.28 grams and PRO amount: 25.68 ± 16.68 grams. Average CHO, LIP, and PRO contents were significantly different between breakfast and lunch/dinner. The average time for meal entry in the application moved from 3-4 minutes to 2.5 minutes during the week. No significant impact of LIP and PRO was found on available blood glucose values.CONCLUSION: Our study shows CHO, LIP, and PRO intakes can be easily captured by an application on smartphone for meal entry used by T1D patients. Although LIP and PRO meal contents did not influence glucose levels when insulin doses were based on CHO in this pilot study, this application could be used for further investigation of this topic, including in closed-loop conditions. © 2015 Diabetes Technology Society.","carbohydrates; glucose control; lipids; proteins; smartphone application; type 1 diabetes","antidiabetic agent; biological marker; carbohydrate diet; fat intake; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; insulin; protein intake; administration and dosage; adult; artificial pancreas; blood; carbohydrate diet; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; diabetic diet; diet therapy; drug effects; equipment design; evaluation study; fat intake; female; glucose blood level; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; mobile application; pilot study; protein intake; smartphone; software design; software validation; statistical model; time factor; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diet, Diabetic; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Equipment Design; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Pancreas, Artificial; Pilot Projects; Smartphone; Software Design; Software Validation; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85012228935

Utilizing cloud computing infrastructures and virtualization technologies allows for the transformation of traditional healthcare systems that demand manual care and monitoring to more salient, automatic and cost effective systems. The goal of this paper is to develop a multimedia-assisted mobile healthcare application using cloud-computing virtualization technologies. We consider calorie measurement as an example healthcare application that can benefit from cloud-computing virtualization technology. The key functionalities of our application entail image segmentation, image processing and deep learning algorithms for food classification and recognition. Client side devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets etc.) have limitations in handling time sensitive and computationally intensive algorithms pertained to our application. Image processing and deep learning algorithms, used in food recognition and calorie measurement, consume devices’ batteries quickly, which is inconvenient for the user. It is also very challenging for client side devices to scale for large number of data and images, as needed for food recognition. The entire process is time-consuming and inefficient and discomforting from users’ perspective and may deter them from using the application. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a virtualization mechanism in cloud computing that utilizes the Android architecture. Android allows for parting an application into activities run by the front-end user and services run by the back-end tasks. In the proposed virtualization mechanism, we use both the hosted and the hypervisor models to publish our Android-based food recognition and calorie measurement application in the cloud. By so doing, the users of our application can control their virtual smartphone operations through a dedicated client application installed on their smartphones, while the processing of the application continue to run on the virtual Android image even if the user is disconnected due to any unexpected event. We have performed several experiments to validate our mechanism. Specifically, we have run our deep learning and image processing algorithms for food recognition on different configuration platforms on both the cloud and local server connected to the mobile. The results show that the accuracy of the system with the virtualization mechanism is more than 94.33 % compared to 87.16 % when we run the application locally. Also, with our virtualization mechanism the results are processed 49 % faster than the case of running the application locally. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud computing; Food recognition; Healthcare; Multimedia; Virtualization","Algorithms; Android (operating system); Cloud computing; Cost effectiveness; Distributed computer systems; Health care; Image processing; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Multimedia services; Smartphones; Virtual reality; Classification and recognition; Cloud computing infrastructures; Computationally intensive algorithms; Health care application; Image processing algorithm; Multimedia; Virtualization technologies; Virtualizations; Mobile cloud computing",2-s2.0-84942552149

To address the problem, we propose MMSnap, a new forensic system based on Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) for recovering stolen phones. When a user finds his phone has been stolen, he simply calls the phone using a predefined number saved in our system. No matter the culprit answers the call or not, once the system detects the number it secretly takes silent snapshots when he hangs up the phone. Even if the culprit replaces the SIM card, our system can still be triggered when he answers or makes a phone call, because it checks the state of the SIM card when processing each incoming or outgoing call. We leverage MMS to send snapshots, because it is designed to transmit multimedia content, supported by every smartphone, included in every wireless plan, and does not need any configuration. We have implemented the system on the Android platform and evaluated it using several smartphones. The experimental results show the system works effectively and takes less than one minute to gather forensic pictures. © 2015 IEEE.","Cellular phones; Electronic messaging; Image forensics; Information security","Cellular telephones; Mobile phones; Recovery; Security of data; Smartphones; Android platforms; Cellular Phone; Electronic messaging; Image forensics; Multimedia contents; Multimedia messaging service; Phone calls; SIM cards; Telephone sets",2-s2.0-84958635352

In turn, these OSs also support the installation of additional, mobile applications (apps) on the fly. With an increase in the number of apps that users may choose to install on their smartphones, the vulnerability of the information stored on the device potentially also increases as a result. This is due to the fact that cyber criminals are able to write apps that can often gain access to not only personal user information, but also sensitive organizational information stored on these smartphone devices. In this paper we have a look at smartphone OS trends over the past 5 years on both a global and a local scale. We subsequently identify Android as the top grossing OS in both scenarios making it the most popular OS in the world. We proceed with an investigation of various aspects relating to smartphone apps including a discussion on some of the official app distribution platforms (referred to as marketplaces), the problems experienced by marketplaces due to malicious apps being distributed and also the current techniques being employed in an attempt to minimize the publication of malicious apps. We continue our discussion on apps by looking at the typical process followed for downloading and also updating an app ' these are in turn used to form a complete user journey map of a generic app marketplace. Finally, we focus our attention to the smartphone user. By introducing the Smartphone User Competency Evolution (SUCE) model as well as the Smartphone Application User Security Competency Evolution (SAUSCE) model, we discuss the significance of determining an individual user's level of understanding and competence relating to the usage of their smartphone and the apps installed on it. We conclude by noting that the SAUSCE model could potentially aid individual users and/or their organizations at providing level appropriate training and awareness to aid smartphone users in their ongoing battle against smartphone abusers. The efficacy that such a model may have when used in conjunction with other best practices however, relies greatly on the successful implementation of 'if the shoe fits, put it on' understanding, regulation and enforcement. As a result, it will no longer be a question of if the shoe fits, put it on, but rather, if the smartphone security level fits, put (switch) it on. © 2015 ACM.","Android; Application lifecycle; Application marketplace; Bring Your Own Device; BYOD; Smartphone application permissions; Smartphone applications","Android (operating system); Commerce; Engineers; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android; Application Lifecycle; Bring your own devices; BYOD; Smart-phone applications; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84959420038

New mobile technologies such as smartphones facilitate the delivery of brief tailored messages to promote adherence. However, the best approach for tailoring messages is unknown. Persons living with HIV (PLWH) might be more receptive to some messages than others based on their current psychological state. Methods: We recruited 37 PLWH from a parent study of motivational states and adherence. Participants completed smartphone-based surveys at a random time every day for 2 weeks, then immediately received intervention or control tailored messages, depending on random assignment. After 2 weeks in the initial condition, participants received the other condition in a crossover design. Intervention messages were tailored to match PLWH’s current psychological state based on five variables – control beliefs, mood, stress, coping, and social support. Control messages were tailored to create a mismatch between message framing and participants’ current psychological state. We evaluated intervention feasibility based on acceptance, ease of use, and usefulness measures. We also used pilot randomized controlled trial methods to test the intervention’s effect on adherence, which was measured using electronic caps that recorded pill-bottle openings. Results: Acceptance was high based on 76% enrollment and 85% satisfaction. Participants found the hardware and software easy to use. However, attrition was high at 59%, and usefulness ratings were slightly lower. The most common complaint was boredom. Unexpectedly, there was no difference between mismatched and matched messages’ effects, but each group showed a 10%–15% improvement in adherence after crossing to the opposite study condition. Conclusion: Although smartphone-based tailored messaging was feasible and participants had clinically meaningful improvements in adherence, the mechanisms of change require further study. Possible explanations might include novelty effects, increased receptiveness to new information after habituation, or pseudotailoring, three ways in which attentional processes can affect behavior. © 2015 Cook et al.","Adherence; Communication; Feasibility; HIV; Technology","antiretrovirus agent; adult; Article; boredom; clinical article; computer; computer program; controlled study; coping behavior; feasibility study; female; health belief; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; medication compliance; mobile phone; mood; motivation; patient compliance; patient satisfaction; social support; stress",2-s2.0-84942795993

Today, many applications running on smartphones periodically generate background traffic by sending and receiving messages or retrieving updates (i.e. without user interaction). Since each activity requires the UE to first attach and then to detach from the LTE network, a large volume of signaling traffic is generated. When the timing of these activities synchronizes among many UEs, a storm of signaling traffic is caused. We refer to this phenomenon as a signaling spike. Such a spike is a serious risk for telecom operators as it may overload its gateways and eventually disrupt services. As a way to suppress these spikes, we propose a new approach called a user equipment based network access control scheme (UENAC). The aim of UENAC is to autonomously decentralize the access timing among of UEs by adding a variable delay before sending packets upon attachment to the LTE network. We implement the UENAC entity on a commercial Android smartphone and show that the scheme has no negative effect on existing applications with delays up to 8 seconds. Furthermore, we simulate the signaling traffic based on commercial traffic pattern and show that the proposed scheme is able to effectively decentralize signaling spikes. © 2015 IEEE.",,,2-s2.0-84953776180

We apply a state-of-The-Art group detection algorithm to annotate such location traces with group vs. individual context, and then show that individuals vs. groups exhibit significant differences along three behavioural traits: (1) the mobility pattern, (2) the responsiveness to calls / SMSs and (3) application usage. We show that these significant differences are robust to underlying errors in the group detection technique and that the use of such group context leads to behavioural results that differ from those reported in prior popular work.

Therefore, the road traffic management is a major concern. Vehicles, mostly uses traffic congestion information broadcasted by FM Radio operators. Currently FM Radio operators get this information telephonically from media reporters in India. This information might be insufficient as these media reporters and drivers do not cover all road segments at all the time. If radio operators starts acceptance of traffic calls from entrusted vehicle drivers then some vehicle drivers intentionally send wrong information to the radio. In this work we are presenting and implementing a GPS based road traffic congestion reporting system (ITM). The proposed approach uses Smartphone, equipped with a GPS receiver to probe congestion on the roads and accelerometer to compute the speed of vehicle driver. The proposed system consists of two Subsystems: Client and Server. Client is an Android application that captures user location through GPS receiver. This information is uploaded to the server after fulfilling the constraints to avoid false and redundant information. A server in the office of FM operator or traffic authority processes this data to represent and report the traffic congestion by the help of offline map. The efficiency of system is checked by collecting real time traffic congestion information of different road segments of Indore, India and compares the results with existing approach. Results show the system is more efficient in time to report and reduce human effort. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Collector efficiency; Frequency modulation; Global positioning system; Highway planning; Roads and streets; Street traffic control; Traffic control; Transportation; Vehicles; Android applications; Congestion conditions; Real time traffics; Reporting systems; Road traffic management; Traffic authorities; Traffic congestion information; Vehicle drivers; Traffic congestion",2-s2.0-84952862665

However, smartphone platforms are not effective in properly communicating privacy risks to their users. Furthermore, common privacy risk communication approaches in smartphone app ecosystems do not consider the actual data-access behavior of individual apps in their risk assessments. Beyond privacy risks such as the leakage of single information (first-order privacy risk), we argue that privacy risk assessments and risk communication should also consider threats to user privacy coming from user-profiling and data-mining capabilities based on the long-term data-access behavior of apps (second-order privacy risk). In this paper, we introduce Styx, a novel privacy risk communication system for Android that provides users with privacy risk information based on the second-order privacy risk perspective. We discuss results from an experimental evaluation of Styx regarding its effectiveness in risk communication and its effects on user perceptions such as privacy concerns and the trustworthiness of a smartphone. Our results suggest that privacy risk information provided by Styx improves the comprehensibility of privacy risk information and helps the users in comparing different apps regarding their privacy properties. The results further suggest that an improved privacy risk communication on smartphones can increase trust towards a smartphone and reduce privacy concern. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Experimental research; Human factors; Information-flow monitoring; Privacy behavior; Privacy risk communication; Smartphone privacy","Android (operating system); Data mining; Human engineering; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android smartphone; Behavior patterns; Experimental evaluation; Experimental research; Information flows; Privacy concerns; Privacy risks; Risk communication; Data privacy",2-s2.0-84940725153

A multiplex immunoassay was designed on a microarray chip, having built-in positive and negative quality controls. After the immunoassay procedure, the 48 microspots were labelled with Quantum Dots (QD) depending on the protein biomarker levels in the sample. QD-fluorescence was subsequently detected by the smartphone camera under UV light excitation from LEDs embedded in a simple 3D-printed opto-mechanical smartphone attachment. The somewhat aberrant images obtained under such conditions, were corrected by newly developed Android-based software on the same smartphone, and protein biomarker profiles were calculated. The indirect detection of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) in milk extracts based on altered biomarker profile of anti-rbST antibodies was selected as a real-life challenge. RbST-treated and untreated cows clearly showed reproducible treatment-dependent biomarker profiles in milk, in excellent agreement with results from a flow cytometer reference method. In a pilot experiment, anti-rbST antibody detection was multiplexed with the detection of another rbST-dependent biomarker, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Milk extract IGF-1 levels were found to be increased after rbST treatment and correlated with the results obtained from the reference method. These data clearly demonstrate the potential of the portable protein microarray concept towards simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers.

However, use of OCR in outdoor settings is resource intensive, and text detection is often error prone in uncontrolled settings. We develop an algorithm that can handle partial errors in the collection of business names to locate the user. Partial errors in text detection are handled by using similarity scores based on approximate text matching.

We develop a compact magnetic levitation platform compatible with a smart-phone to separate micro-objects and estimate the density of the sample based on its levitation height. A 3D printed attachment is mechanically installed over the existing camera unit of a smart-phone. Micro-objects, which may be either spherical or irregular in shape, are suspended in a paramagnetic medium and loaded in a microcapillary tube which is then inserted between two permanent magnets. The micro-objects are levitated and confined in the microcapillary at an equilibrium height dependent on their volumetric mass densities (causing a buoyancy force toward the edge of the microcapillary) and magnetic susceptibilities (causing a magnetic force toward the center of the microcapillary) relative to the suspending medium. The smart-phone camera captures magnified images of the levitating micro-objects through an additional lens positioned between the sample and the camera lens cover. A custom-developed Android application then analyzes these images to determine the levitation height and estimate the density. Using this platform, we were able to separate microspheres with varying densities and calibrate their levitation heights to known densities to develop a technique for precise and accurate density estimation. We have also characterized the magnetic field, the optical imaging capabilities, and the thermal state over time of this platform. © 2015 Knowlton et al.",,"gadolinium; microsphere; Article; buoyancy force; camera; concentration (parameters); density; equipment design; fluorescence imaging; force; height; high temperature; image quality; levitation height; magnetic field; magnetic levitation; magnetism; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; mobile application; mobile phone; particle size; reliability; smart phone; chemistry; magnetic field; physical phenomena; smartphone; temperature; three dimensional printing; time factor; Equipment Design; Gadolinium; Magnetic Fields; Particle Size; Physical Phenomena; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Smartphone; Temperature; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84943303363

This problem is further amplified as multiple applications attempt to monitor multiple sensors simultaneously. In this paper, we present ShareSens, our approach to opportunistically merge independent sensing requirements of applications. We achieve this using sensing schedulers for sensors, which determine the lowest sensing rate which would satisfy all requests, and then use custom filters to send out only the needed data to each application. Sensing requests made through the ShareSens API (which we have implemented for Android) are forwarded to the relevant schedulers which determine the optimum sensing rates to satisfy all requests.

Since the Android source code is publicly available, the security community has the chance to assess the security mechanisms of Android. Due to its large code body, a completely manual code review is tedious, and hence, tool support for this task is desirable. As a first step in this direction, we propose to extract the implemented access control policy from the code for Android system services with the help of program slicing.

To improve the communication reliability, VINCE adopts a feedback-based retransmission scheme, and dynamically adjusts the number of encoding brightness levels based on the current light channel condition.

Using a small buffer can reduce the bandwidth wastage, but may consume more energy and introduce rebuffering delay. In this paper, we analyze the power consumption during video streaming considering user skip and early quit scenarios. We first propose an offline method to compute the minimum power consumption, and then introduce an online solution to save energy based on whether the user tends to watch video for a long time or tends to skip.

Few studies have investigated long-term daily illness activity and none has compared bipolar type I and II using daily data. The objectives were to investigate differences in daily illness activity between bipolar disorder type I and II. Methods A smartphone-based system for self-monitoring was developed. A total of 33 patients treated in a mood clinic used the system for daily self-monitoring during a median period of 310 days [IQR 189; 437]. Data presented summarize over 8500 observations. Results Patients with bipolar disorder type II (n=20), compared to patients with bipolar disorder type I (n=13), experienced a significant lower mean level of mood on a scale from-3; +3 (-0.54 (95% CI:-0.74;-0.35) versus-0.19 (95% CI:-0.35;-0.02), p=0.02), less time euthymic (51.0% (95% CI: 36.4; 65.7) versus 74.5% (95% CI: 62.4; 86.7), p=0.03) and a higher proportion of time with depressive symptoms (45.1% (95% CI: 30.6; 59.5) versus 18.8% (95% CI: 6.9; 30.7), p=0.01). The proportion of time spent with (hypo)manic symptoms did not differ (2.7% (95% CI: 0.1; 5.5) versus 5.5% (95% CI: 3.1; 7.8), p=0.17). Limitations Patients received different types, doses and combinations of psychopharmacological treatment. Conclusion Euthymia was obtained for a substantial proportion of time in patients with bipolar disorder type I, but despite on-going treatment only for half of the time for patients with bipolar disorder type II.

The core functions of the architecture are performed by two Android applications: the Asset Proximity Locator (APL) and the Wandering Objects Location Finder (WOLF). The key feature of the asset tracking function is the ability to maximize smartphone battery lifetime by switching on and off the GPS unit, thus guaranteeing that the smartphone can be used for an entire working shift. A detailed energy consumption analysis is carried out for each component of the architecture.

It is frequently noticed that text password remains predominantly popular over the other formats of passwords, due to the fact that it is simple and expedient. However, text passwords are not always sturdy enough and are very easily stolen and misused under different vulnerabilities. Other persons can obtain a text password when a person creates a weak password or a password that is completely reused in many sites. In this condition if one password is hacked, it can be used for all the websites. This is called the Domino Effect. Another unsafe situation is when a person enters his/her password in a computer that is not trust-worthy; the password is prone to stealing attacks such as phishing, malware and key loggers etc. Among the most significant current threats to online banking are keylogging and phishing. These attacks extract user identity and account information to be used later for unauthorized access to user's financial accounts. This paper proposes a user authentication protocol which leverages a user's Android Smartphone and short message service to resist password stealing and password reuse attacks. This protocol only requires each participating website possesses a unique phone number and users only need to remember a long-term password for login on all websites. To provide more security to Android Smartphone, an additional method called color pattern screen locking is also proposed in this paper. © 2015 IEEE.","Authentication; Encryption and decryption; Network security; Password; password reuse attack; password stealing attack","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Cryptography; Embedded systems; Locks (fasteners); Malware; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Websites; Authentication protocols; Data and information; Encryption and decryption; Password; password reuse attack; password stealing attack; Short message services; User authentication protocols; Authentication",2-s2.0-84957037695

Smartphone technology is more and more becoming the predominant communication tool for people across the world. People use their smartphones to keep their contact data, to browse the internet, to exchange messages, to keep notes, carry their personal files and documents, etc. Users while browsing are also capable of shopping online, thus provoking a need to type their credit card numbers and security codes. As the smartphones are becoming widespread, it's also becoming a popular target for security threats and attack. Since smartphones use the same software architecture as in PCs, they are vulnerable to be exposed to similar threats such as in PCs. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS). Major limitations of smartphone technology are its processing power and its scarce energy source since smartphones rely on battery usage. The smartphones have less storage and computational power to put into effect highly complex algorithms for intrusion detection and implementing signature based attack detection.

Objectives: To assess the variety of smartphone applications relating to paediatric radiology and the presence of health care professional involvement in their development. As a secondary objective, we explore whether there are gaps within the paediatric radiology app market. Materials and methods: The most popular smartphone marketplaces (Apple iTunes App Store, Blackberry Mobile Market, Google Play Android Market, Nokia Ovi, Samsung and Microsoft Windows Marketplace) were searched for terms relating to paediatric radiology. Cost, review ratings, number of downloads, health care involvement and target audience were recorded. Results: Nine paediatric radiology applications were found in the Apple iTunes App Store and nine in the Google Play Android Market. The target audiences for all applications were health care professionals. None were available for patients or their caregivers. All applications were reported to have medical expertise in their development. Conclusion: All paediatric radiology applications were developed with the aid of a health care professional.

We utilised Android-based smartphones to collect data electronically from more than 8,000 households during a national round of polio immunisation in South Sudan. The results of the household surveys are presented here, together with discussion of the application of mobile information technology for polio campaign planning, implementation and evaluation in a real-time setting. Methods: Electronic questionnaires were programmed onto Android-based smartphones for mapping, supervision and survey activities during a national round of polio immunisation. National census data were used to determine the sampling frame for each activity and select the payam (district). Individual supervisors, in consultation with the local district health team, selected villages and households within each payam. Data visualisation tools were utilised for analysis and reporting. Results: Implementation of mobile information technology and local management was feasible during a national round of polio immunisation in South Sudan. Red Cross visits during the polio campaign were equitable according to household wealth index and households who received a Red Cross visit had significantly higher odds of being aware of the polio campaign than those who did not. Nearly 95% of children under five were reported to have received polio immunisation (according to maternal recall) during the immunisation round, which varied by state, county and payam. A total of 11 payams surveyed were identified with less than 90% reported immunisation coverage and the least poor households had significantly higher odds of being vaccinated than the most poor. More than 95% of households were aware of the immunisation round and households had significantly higher odds of being vaccinated if they had prior awareness of the campaign taking place. Conclusion: Pre-campaign community education and household awareness of polio is important to increase campaign participation and subsequent immunisation coverage in South Sudan. More emphasis should be placed on ensuring immunisation is equitable according to geographic area and household socio-economic index in future rounds. We demonstrate the utility of mobile information technology for household mapping, supervision and survey activities during a national round of polio immunisation and encourage future studies to compare the effectiveness of electronic data collection and its application in polio planning and programming.

To estimate SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) values, various features were extracted from each image. Then, superior features were extracted by stepwise regression and sensitivity analysis. The selected features were finally used use as inputs to the linear (regression) and neural network models. Performance of the models was evaluated using the images taken from a corn field located in West of Ames, IA, USA, with Minolta SPAD 502 Chlorophyll Meter. The R2 and RMSE values for the linear model were 0.74 and 6.2. The corresponding values for the neural network model were 0.82 and 5.10, respectively.

Education of parents in the perinatal period with stool cards depicting acholic and normal stools has been associated with improved time-to-diagnosis and survival in BA. PoopMD is a mobile application that utilizes a smartphone's camera and color recognition software to analyze an infant's stool and determine if additional follow-up is indicated. PoopMD was developed using custom HTML5/CSS3 and wrapped to work on iOS and Android platforms. In order to define the gold standard regarding stool color, seven pediatricians were asked to review 45 photographs of infant stool and rate them as acholic, normal, or indeterminate. Samples for which 6+ pediatricians demonstrated agreement defined the gold standard, and only these samples were included in the analysis. Accuracy of PoopMD was assessed using an iPhone 5s with incandescent lighting. Variability in analysis of stool photographs as acholic versus normal with intermediate rating weighted as 50% agreement (kappa) was compared between three laypeople and one expert user. Variability in output was also assessed between an iPhone 5s and a Samsung Galaxy S4, as well as between incandescent lighting and compact fluorescent lighting. Six-plus pediatricians agreed on 27 normal and 7 acholic photographs; no photographs were defined as indeterminate. The sensitivity was 7/7 (100%). The specificity was 24/27 (89%) with 3/27 labeled as indeterminate; no photos of normal stool were labeled as acholic. The Laplace-smoothed positive likelihood ratio was 6.44 (95% CI 2.52 to 16.48) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.13 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.83). kappauser was 0.68, kappaphone was 0.88, and kappalight was 0.81. Therefore, in this pilot study, PoopMD accurately differentiates acholic from normal color with substantial agreement across users, and almost perfect agreement across two popular smartphones and ambient light settings. PoopMD may be a valuable tool to help parents identify acholic stools in the perinatal period, and provide guidance as to whether additional evaluation with their pediatrician is indicated.

In last decade, various incidents including militant attacks and ransom-demands have been reported in which cell phones played a central role in communication between the culprits. The tracking of these criminals is very important and the government needs to adopt technologies to track mobile phones if they are being used for dangerous activities. In this paper, an android based application is presented which is designed and tested to track a suspect without his/her attention. This application tracks a smartphone by obtaining its current location and monitors a suspect remotely by retrieving information such as call logs, message logs etc. It also detects the face of the suspect and covertly captures the picture using cell phone camera and then sends it via multiple messages. Moreover, the monitoring user can also make calls to the phone which the culprit is using in stealth mode to hear the conversation happening in surroundings of the user without the knowledge of suspect. © 2015 Centre for Multidisciplinary Research, Innovation and Collaboration (C-MRiC.ORG).","GPS location; security; security apps; smartphones; tracking","Android (operating system); Cellular telephone systems; Cellular telephones; Mobile phones; Monitoring; National security; Smartphones; Surface discharges; Telecommunication equipment; Telephone sets; Cell phone; Cell phone camera; GPS location; Monitoring system; Multiple messages; Pakistan; security; Security application; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84963773480

This paper presents an empirical study of analyzing the characteristics of accelerometer and magnetometer data to infer users' input on Android smartphones. The rationale behind is that the touch input actions in different positions would cause different levels of posture and motion change of the smartphone. In this work, an Android application was run as a background process to monitor data of motion sensors. Accelerometer data were analyzed to detect the occurrence of input actions on touchscreen. Then the magnetometer data were fused with accelerometer data for inferring the positions of user inputs on touchscreen. Through the mapping relationship from input positions and common layouts of keyboard or number pad, one can easily obtain the inputs. Analyses were conducted using data from three types of smartphones and across various operational scenarios. The results indicated that users' inputs can be accurately inferred from the sensor data, with the accuracies of 100% for input-action detection and 80% for input inference in some cases. Additional experiments on the effect of smartphone screen size, sampling rate, and training data size were provided to further examine the reliability and practicability of our approach. These findings suggest that readings from accelerometer and magnetometer data could be a powerful side channel for inferring user inputs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the fact that the improvements in the security often come with a penalty in the usability can present a problem.

Since the Android platform has taken the dominant position in smartphone popularity, the number of Android malware has grown correspondingly and represents critical threat to the smartphone users. This rise in malware is primarily attributable to the occurrence of variants of existing malware. A set of variants stem from one malware can be considered as one malware family, and malware families cover more than half of the Android malware population. A conventional technique for defeating malware is the use of signature matching which is efficient from a time perspective but not very practical because of its lack of robustness against the malware variants. As a counter approach for handling the issue of variants behavior analysis techniques have been proposed but require extensive time and resources. In this paper, we propose an Android malware detection mechanism that uses automated family signature extraction and family signature matching. Key concept of the mechanism is to extract a set of family representative binary patterns from evaluated family members as a signature and to classify each set of variants into a malware family via an estimation of similarity to the signatures. The proposed family signature and detection mechanism offers more flexible variant detection than does the legacy signature matching, which is strictly dependent on the presence of a specific string. Furthermore, compared with the previous behavior analysis techniques considering family detection, the proposed family signature has higher detection accuracy without the need for the significant overhead of data and control flow analysis. Using the proposed signature, we can detect new variants of known malware efficiently and accurately by static matching. We evaluated our mechanism with 5846 real world Android malware samples belonging to 48 families collected in April 2014 at an anti-virus company; experimental results showed that; our mechanism achieved greater than 97% accuracy in detection of variants. We also demonstrated that the mechanism has a linear time complexity with the number of target applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Android; Family signature; Malware; Smartphone security; Static analysis; Variant detection","Android (operating system); Computer crime; Mobile security; Network security; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Static analysis; Viruses; Android; Control flow analysis; Conventional techniques; Family signature; Linear time complexity; Signature extraction; Smart-phone applications; Smartphone securities; Malware",2-s2.0-84924898377

In this paper, we propose image recognition methods which are suitable for mobile devices. The proposed method enables real-time food image recognition on a consumer smartphone. This characteristic is completely different from the existing systems which require to send images to an image recognition server. To recognize food items, a user draws bounding boxes by touching the screen first, and then the system starts food item recognition within the indicated bounding boxes. To recognize them more accurately, we segment each food item region by GrubCut, extract image features and finally classify it into one of the one hundred food categories with a linear SVM. As image features, we adopt two kinds of features: one is the combination of the standard bag-of-features and color histograms with χ2 kernel feature maps, and the other is a HOG patch descriptor and a color patch descriptor with the state-of-the-art Fisher Vector representation. In addition, the system estimates the direction of food regions where the higher SVM output score is expected to be obtained, and it shows the estimated direction in an arrow on the screen in order to ask a user to move a smartphone camera. This recognition process is performed repeatedly and continuously. We implemented this system as a standalone mobile application for Android smartphones so as to use multiple CPU cores effectively for real-time recognition. In the experiments, we have achieved the 79.2 % classification rate for the top 5 category candidates for a 100-category food dataset with the ground-truth bounding boxes when we used HOG and color patches with the Fisher Vector coding as image features.

However, most existing systems assume that all required applications are installed in the smartphones of all participants before the disaster occurs, which is unrealistic in actual disaster scenarios. If an Internet connection is unavailable, obtaining the applications necessary for communication becomes difficult because most applications are provided through the Internet by platforms such as Google Play. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for distributing applications and present its implementation. Our method uses the default web browser and tethering function of the Android operating system. These, combined with a web server embedded in our application, enable Internet-less application distribution. To evaluate the feasibility of our proposed system, we conducted an experiment with four participants who are unfamiliar with our application.

The W-iPCN is a small, compact and lightweight system which has the ability to process and analyze body sensor data. Furthermore, this system is capable of communicating with other devices through wireless protocols. The purpose of having the W-iPCN for wireless body sensor network system is to provide in-depth biomedical data to the user in real-time.

All applications were installed and analysed. The applications were scrutinised to assess the following information: cost; whether the information included was referenced; when the information was last updated; and whether they made any reference to UK guidelines. A novel rating score based on these criteria was applied to each application. Fifty applications were identified: 24 for Apple’s iOS; 23 for Google’s Android; 2 for Blackberry OS; and 1 for Windows OS.

However, the user experience is still far from being optimal. In particular, despite the rapid hardware upgrades, current smartphones often suffer various unpredictable delays during operation, e.g., when launching an app, leading to poor user experience. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of reads and writes in smartphones. We conduct the first large-scale measurement study on the Android I/O delay using the data collected from our Android application running on 2611 devices within nine months. Among other factors, we observe that reads experience up to 626% slowdown when blocked by concurrent writes for certain workloads. Additionally, we show the asymmetry of the slowdown of one I/O type due to another, and elaborate the speedup of concurrent I/Os over serial ones. We use this obtained knowledge to design and implement a system prototype called SmartIO that reduces the application delay by prioritizing reads over writes, and grouping them based on assigned priorities.

Despite its diverse application scenarios and growing popularity, Miracast consumes substantial power due to a combination of video encoding/ decoding and transmission. In this paper, we first conduct a measurement study to quantify and model key parameters that scale Miracast's power consumption. We then propose a set of optimization mechanisms to bypass redundant codec operations, reduce video tail traffic, and relocate the Miracast channel dynamically to maximize transmission efficiency. We have implemented this energy-efficient Miracast framework on an Android smartphone. Experimental results show that the legacy Miracast system costs 1.3 to 2.4 Watts. Our framework reduces the power consumption by 29% to 61%, depending on the Miracast application's video traffic patterns. Our optimization mechanisms do not affect the video quality, and can even reduce the latency of certain Miracast applications.

Due to its features, ABE has been adopted in several applications, such as encrypted storage or access control systems. Recently, researchers argued about the non acceptable performance of ABE when implemented on mobile devices. Indeed, the non feasibility of ABE on mobile devices would hinder the deployment of novel protocols and services-that could instead exploit the full potential of such devices. However, we believe the conclusion of non usability was driven by a not-very efficient implementation. In this paper, we want to shine a light on this concern by studying the feasibility of applying ABE on smartphone devices. In particular, we implemented AndrABEn, an ABE library for Android operating system. Our library is written in the C language and implements two main ABE schemes: Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, and Key Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. We also run a thorough set of experimental evaluation for AndrABEn, and compare it with the current state-of-the-art (considering the same experimental setting). The results confirm the possibility to effectively use ABE on smartphone devices, requiring an acceptable amount of resources in terms of computations and energy consumption. Since the current state-of-the-art claims the non feasibility of ABE on mobile devices, we believe that our study (together with the AndrABEn library that we made available online) is a key result that will pave the way for researchers and developers to design and implement novel protocols and applications for mobile devices. © 2015 ACM.",,"Access control; C (programming language); Digital storage; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Mobile devices; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Acceptable performance; Attribute-based encryptions; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Design and implements; Efficient implementation; Encrypted storages; Experimental evaluation; State of the art; Cryptography",2-s2.0-84944673148

As a result, app markets are also populated with spam apps, which reduce the users' quality of experience and increase the workload of app market operators. Apps can be ""spammy"" in multiple ways including not having a specific functionality, unrelated app description or unrelated keywords and publishing similar apps several times and across diverse categories. Market operators maintain anti-spam policies and apps are removed through continuous human intervention. Through a systematic crawl of a popular app market and by identifying a set of removed apps, we propose a method to detect spam apps solely using app metadata available at the time of publication. We first propose a methodology to manually label a sample of removed apps, according to a set of checkpoint heuristics that reveal the reasons behind removal. This analysis suggests that approximately 35% of the apps being removed are very likely to be spam apps. We then map the identified heuristics to several quantifiable features and show how distinguishing these features are for spam apps. Finally, we build an Adaptive Boost classifier for early identification of spam apps using only the metadata of the apps. Our classifier achieves an accuracy over 95% with precision varying between 85%-95% and recall varying between 38%-98%. By applying the classifier on a set of apps present at the app market during our crawl, we estimate that at least 2.7% of them are spam apps.","Android; Mobile Apps; Spam; Spam Apps","Commerce; Heuristic methods; Metadata; Quality of service; Smartphones; World Wide Web; Android; Anti-spam; Human intervention; Market operators; Mobile apps; Quality of experience (QoE); Spam; Internet",2-s2.0-84968854020

A major challenge in designing a voice control application is that it requires continuous monitoring of user's voice input through the microphone. Such applications utilize hotwords such as ""Okay Google"" or ""Hi Galaxy"" allowing them to distinguish user's voice command and her other conversations. A voice control application has to continuously listen for hotwords which significantly increases the energy consumption of the smart-devices. To address this energy efficiency problem of voice control, we present AccelWord in this paper. AccelWord is based on the empirical evidence that accelerometer sensors found in today's mobile devices are sensitive to user's voice. We also demonstrate that the effect of user's voice on accelerometer data is rich enough so that it can be used to detect the hotwords spoken by the user. To achieve the goal of low energy cost but high detection accuracy, we combat multiple challenges, e.g. how to extract unique signatures of user's speaking hotwords only from accelerometer data and how to reduce the interference caused by user's mobility. We finally implement AccelWord as a standalone application running on Android devices. Comprehensive tests show AccelWord has hotword detection accuracy of 85% in static scenarios and 80% in mobile scenarios. Compared to the microphone based hotword detection applications such as Google Now and Samsung S Voice, AccelWord is 2 times more energy efficient while achieving the accuracy of 98% and 92% in static and mobile scenarios respectively.

However, there is little systematic evidence exploring possible risks associated with apps intended for patient use. Because self-medication errors are a recognized source of avoidable harm, apps that affect medication use, such as dose calculators, deserve particular scrutiny. We explored the accuracy and clinical suitability of apps for calculating medication doses, focusing on insulin calculators for patients with diabetes as a representative use for a prevalent long-term condition. Methods: We performed a systematic assessment of all English-language rapid/short-acting insulin dose calculators available for iOS and Android. Results: Searches identified 46 calculators that performed simple mathematical operations using planned carbohydrate intake and measured blood glucose. While 59% (n = 27/46) of apps included a clinical disclaimer, only 30% (n = 14/46) documented the calculation formula. 91% (n = 42/46) lacked numeric input validation, 59% (n = 27/46) allowed calculation when one or more values were missing, 48% (n = 22/46) used ambiguous terminology, 9% (n = 4/46) did not use adequate numeric precision and 4% (n = 2/46) did not store parameters faithfully. 67% (n = 31/46) of apps carried a risk of inappropriate output dose recommendation that either violated basic clinical assumptions (48%, n = 22/46) or did not match a stated formula (14%, n = 3/21) or correctly update in response to changing user inputs (37%, n = 17/46). Only one app, for iOS, was issue-free according to our criteria. No significant differences were observed in issue prevalence by payment model or platform. Conclusions: The majority of insulin dose calculator apps provide no protection against, and may actively contribute to, incorrect or inappropriate dose recommendations that put current users at risk of both catastrophic overdose and more subtle harms resulting from suboptimal glucose control. Healthcare professionals should exercise substantial caution in recommending unregulated dose calculators to patients and address app safety as part of self-management education. The prevalence of errors attributable to incorrect interpretation of medical principles underlines the importance of clinical input during app design. Systemic issues affecting the safety and suitability of higher-risk apps may require coordinated surveillance and action at national and international levels involving regulators, health agencies and app stores. © Huckvale et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","App; Calculator; Diabetes; mHealth; Mobile health; Safety; Smartphone","glucose; insulin; glucose blood level; insulin derivative; Article; carbohydrate intake; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; drug dose calculator; glucose blood level; insulin treatment; mathematical analysis; measurement accuracy; mobile application; mobile phone; nomenclature; validation process; analysis; blood; diabetes mellitus; human; mobile phone; procedures; self care; Blood Glucose; Cell Phones; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Insulins; Mobile Applications; Self Care",2-s2.0-84929332826

This study assesses the reliability and validity of a custom Smartphone application for assessing hip joint range of motion. Design: Intra-tester reliability with concurrent validity. Methods: Passive hip joint range of motion was recorded for seven different movements in 20 males on two separate occasions. Data from a Smartphone, bubble inclinometer and a three dimensional motion analysis (3DMA) system were collected simultaneously. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), coefficients of variation (CV) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used to assess reliability. To assess validity of the Smartphone application and the bubble inclinometer against the three dimensional motion analysis system, intraclass correlation coefficients and fixed and proportional biases were used. Results: The Smartphone demonstrated good to excellent reliability (ICCs. >. 0.75) for four out of the seven movements, and moderate to good reliability for the remaining three movements (ICC. =. 0.63-0.68). Additionally, the Smartphone application displayed comparable reliability to the bubble inclinometer. The Smartphone application displayed excellent validity when compared to the three dimensional motion analysis system for all movements (ICCs. >. 0.88) except one, which displayed moderate to good validity (ICC. =. 0.71). Conclusions: Smartphones are portable and widely available tools that are mostly reliable and valid for assessing passive hip range of motion, with potential for large-scale use when a bubble inclinometer is not available.

To identify food items, the user simply snaps a photo of the food plate. The system detects the salient region, crops its image, and subtracts the background accordingly. Hierarchical segmentation is performed to segment the image into regions. We then extract features at different locations and scales and classify these regions into different kinds of foods using a linear support vector machine classifier. In addition, the system determines the portion size which is then used to estimate the calorific and nutrition content of the food present on the plate.

Gamification provides a motivation to participate, but also requires the development of specialized, research-question specific games that can be costly to produce. Our solution combines gamification and crowdsourcing in a smartphone-based system that emulates the popular Freemium model of play to motivate voluntary participation through in-game rewards, using a robust framework to study multiple unrelated research questions within the same system. We deployed our game on the Android store and compared it to a gamified laboratory version and a non-gamified laboratory version, and found that players who used the in-game rewards were motivated to do experimental tasks. There was no difference between the systems for performance on a motor task; however, performance on the cognitive task was worse for the crowdsourced game.

This paper presents the design and implementation of Samba - an aquatic surveillance robot that integrates an off-the-shelf Android smartphone and a robotic fish to monitor harmful aquatic processes such as oil spill and harmful algal blooms. Using the built-in camera of on-board smartphone, Samba can detect spatially dispersed aquatic processes in dynamic and complex environments. To reduce the excessive false alarms caused by the non-water area (e.g., trees on the shore), Samba segments the captured images and performs target detection in the identified water area only. However, a major challenge in the design of Samba is the high energy consumption resulted from the continuous image segmentation. We propose a novel approach that leverages the power-efficient inertial sensors on smartphone to assist the image processing. In particular, based on the learned mapping models between inertial and visual features, Samba uses real-time inertial sensor readings to estimate the visual features that guide the image segmentation, significantly reducing energy consumption and computation overhead. Samba also features a set of lightweight and robust computer vision algorithms, which detect harmful aquatic processes based on their distinctive color features. Lastly, Samba employs a feedback-based rotation control algorithm to adapt to spatiotemporal evolution of the target aquatic process. We have implemented a Samba prototype and evaluated it through extensive field experiments, lab experiments, and trace-driven simulations. The results show that Samba can achieve 94% detection rate, 5% false alarm rate, and a lifetime up to nearly two months.

We can see that these restrictions are inconvenient for users. In this paper, we propose a step calculation algorithm, which can relieve the above restrictions and can count users' steps precisely. The proposed algorithm is composed of two phases. The first phase collects linear acceleration and gravity values from the smartphone's accelerometer. Then, this phase derives the horizontal components of the perceived linear acceleration values and identifies possible start points of periodical regular fluctuations (of linear acceleration measurements). The second phase adopts the concept of correlation coefficients to identify whether the collected sensing measurements exhibit similar tendencies and calculates step counts. In this paper, we implement the proposed method on the android platform. The experiment results indicate that the proposed scheme can analyze gaits accurately and count steps effectively. © 2014 IEEE.","accelerometer; gait analysis; smartphone; step counting","Accelerometers; Algorithms; Gait analysis; Signal encoding; Telephone sets; Android platforms; Calculation algorithms; Correlation coefficient; Design and implementations; Linear accelerations; Second phase; Start point; Step counting; Smartphones",2-s2.0-84923924168

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods.

Despite the already confrmed AR benefts in the referred areas, many of the existing AR systems rely on heavy and obsolete hardware bundles composed of several devices and numerous cables that usually culminate in considerably expensive solutions.

We assessed how changes over a 2-year period affected the clinical suitability of apps providing self-management information and tools for people with asthma by updating a review first performed in 2011. Methods: Systematic content assessment of all apps for iOS and Android examining the comprehensiveness of asthma information, consistency with the evidence base for asthma self-management and adherence to best practice principles for trustworthy content, comparing the quality of apps available in 2011 to those released since. Results: Between 2011 and 2013, numbers of asthma apps more than doubled from 93 to 191, despite withdrawal of 25% (n=23/93) of existing apps. Newer apps were no more likely than those available in 2011 to include comprehensive information, such as the use of action plans, or offer guidance consistent with evidence; 13% (n=19/147) of all apps, and 39% (n=9/23) of those intended to manage acute asthma, recommended self-care procedures unsupported by evidence. Despite increases in the numbers of apps targeting specific skills, such as acute asthma management (n=12 to 23) and inhaler technique (from n=2 to 12), the proportion consistent with guidelines (17%, n=4/23) and inhaler instructions (25%, n=3/12), respectively, was low, and most apps provided only either basic information about asthma (50%, n=75/147) or simple diary functions (24%, n=36/147). Conclusions: In addition to persisting questions about clinical quality and safety, dynamic aspects of app turnover and feature evolution affect the suitability of asthma apps for use in routine care. The findings underline the need for coordinated quality assurance processes that can adapt to changing clinical and information governance-related risks, ensure compliance with the evidence base and reflect local variations in clinical practice.

As with visual and vibrotactile biofeedback, kinesthetic haptic feedback may assist in postural control, and can achieve balance control. Kinesthetic haptic feedback in terms of body sway can be delivered via a commercially available haptic device and can enhance the balance stability of both young healthy subjects and stroke patients. Method: Our system features a waist-attached smartphone, software running on a computer (PC), and a dedicated Phantom OmniÂ® device. Young healthy participants performed balance tasks after assumption of each of four distinct postures for 30 s (one foot on the ground; the Tandem Romberg stance; one foot on foam; and the Tandem Romberg stance on foam) with eyes closed. Patient eyes were not closed and assumption of the Romberg stance (only) was tested during a balance task 25 s in duration. An Android application running continuously on the smartphone sent mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) tilt angles to a PC, which generated kinesthetic haptic feedback via Phantom OmniÂ®. A total of 16 subjects, 8 of whom were young healthy and 8 of whom had suffered stroke, participated in the study. Results: Post-experiment data analysis was performed using MATLABÂ®. Mean Velocity Displacement (MVD), Planar Deviation (PD), Mediolateral Trajectory (MLT) and Anteroposterior Trajectory (APT) parameters were analyzed to measure reduction in body sway. Our kinesthetic haptic feedback system was effective to reduce postural sway in young healthy subjects regardless of posture and the condition of the substrate (the ground) and to improve MVD and PD in stroke patients who assumed the Romberg stance. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed that kinesthetic haptic feedback significantly reduced body sway in both categories of subjects. Conclusion: Kinesthetic haptic feedback can be implemented using a commercial haptic device and a smartphone. Intuitive balance cues were created using the handle of a haptic device, rendering the approach very simple yet efficient in practice. This novel form of biofeedback will be a useful rehabilitation tool improving the balance of stroke patients.

An example would be a malicious application surreptitiously recording a confidential business conversation. The problem arises from the fact that Android users do not have control over the application capabilities once the applications have been granted the requested privileges upon installation. In many cases, however, whether an application may get a privilege depends on the specific user context and thus we need a context-based access control mechanism by which privileges can be dynamically granted or revoked to applications based on the specific context of the user. In this paper we propose such an access control mechanism. Our implementation of context differentiates between closely located sub-areas within the same location.

Then, the web browser can put the wireless radio interface into low power state, release the radio resource, and then run the remaining computations. Second, we introduce a practical data mining based method to predict the user reading time of webpages, based on which the smartphone can switch to low power state when the reading time is longer than a threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our energy-aware approaches, we develop a testbed with Android phones on T-Mobile UMTS network.

Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smartphones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analyzing images of chronic foot ulcers is an attractive option. In this paper, we propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smartphone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smartphone with the assistance of an image capture box. After that, the smartphone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the foot is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on red-yellow-black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient. Experimental results on wound images collected in UMASS - Memorial Health Center Wound Clinic (Worcester, MA) following an Institutional Review Board approved protocol show that our system can be efficiently used to analyze the wound healing status with promising accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.","Android-based smartphone; mean shift; patients with diabetes; wound analysis","Cost effectiveness; Diseases; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Diabetic foot ulcer; Examination methods; High-resolution digital cameras; Image analysis systems; Institutional review boards; Mean shift; Mean shift algorithm; wound analysis; Android (operating system); accuracy; algorithm; Article; camera; computer program; diabetic foot; disease simulation; human; image analysis; image processing; mobile phone; quantitative analysis; skin color; wound assessment; wound care; wound healing; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; device failure analysis; devices; diabetic foot; equipment design; illumination; mobile application; pathology; photography; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; wound healing; Algorithms; Cell Phones; Diabetic Foot; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lighting; Mobile Applications; Photography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Wound Healing",2-s2.0-84921442182

Outdoor localization can be solved by the GPS technique, but how to accurately and efficiently localize pedestrians in indoor environments is still a challenging problem. Recent techniques based on WiFi or pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) have several limiting problems, such as the variation of WiFi signals and the drift of PDR. An auxiliary tool for indoor localization is landmarks, which can be easily identified based on specific sensor patterns in the environment, and this will be exploited in our proposed approach. In this work, we propose a sensor fusion framework for combining WiFi, PDR and landmarks. Since the whole system is running on a smartphone, which is resource limited, we formulate the sensor fusion problem in a linear perspective, then a Kalman filter is applied instead of a particle filter, which is widely used in the literature. Furthermore, novel techniques to enhance the accuracy of individual approaches are adopted. In the experiments, an Android app is developed for real-time indoor localization and navigation. A comparison has been made between our proposed approach and individual approaches. The results show significant improvement using our proposed framework.

However, smartphone users usually download third-party applications that can leak personal data without user authorization. For this reason, the dynamic taint analysis mechanism is used to control the manipulation of private data by third-party apps [9]. But this technique does not detect control flows. In particular, untrusted applications can circumvent Android system and get privacy sensitive information through control flows. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines static and dynamic analysis to propagate taint along control dependencies in Android system. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we analyse 27 free Android applications. We found that 14 of these applications use control flows to transfer sensitive data.We successfully detect that 8 of them leaked private information.

In order to protect this sensitive information from misuse due to loss, or other accidental reasons, strong smartphone authentication has become imperative and has received considerable attention in recent years. However, when we directly implement traditional authentication schemes in smartphone devices, the balance between security and user-friendliness of authentication becomes challenging, mainly because of the input-in-motion environments. In this paper, without adding extra hardware devices, we present a user-friendly, dual-factor authentication scheme called Duth, for Android smartphone devices. Specifically, the proposed Duth scheme is characterized by utilizing the spatial and time features of the user-writing process as two factors of authentication; a user can be authenticated only if these two features are fulfilled. We implement Duth in Java as a library, which we make publicly available. With extensive discussions on parameter selection, we choose proper parameters and implement Duth on a smartphone with Android 2.3 for experiments, and the experiment results demonstrate that Duth can indeed achieve efficient and effective dual-factor authentication.

Most smartphones have cameras and kinds of sensors, such as gyroscope, accelerometer and magnet meter. Indoor navigation based on smartphone is very important and valuable. According to the features of the smartphone and indoor navigation, a new indoor integrated navigation method is proposed, which uses MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), camera and magnet meter of smartphone. The proposed navigation method mainly involves data acquisition, camera calibration, image measurement, IMU calibration, initial alignment, strapdown integral, zero velocity update and integrated navigation. Synchronous data acquisition of the sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer and magnet meter) and the camera is the base of the indoor navigation on the smartphone. A camera data acquisition method is introduced, which uses the camera class of Android to record images and time of smartphone camera. Two kinds of sensor data acquisition methods are introduced and compared. The first method records sensor data and time with the SensorManager of Android. The second method realizes open, close, data receiving and saving functions in C language, and calls the sensor functions in Java language with JNI interface. A data acquisition software is developed with JDK (Java Development Kit), Android ADT (Android Development Tools) and NDK (Native Development Kit). The software can record camera data, sensor data and time at the same time. Data acquisition experiments have been done with the developed software and Sumsang Note 2 smartphone. The experimental results show that the first method of sensor data acquisition is convenient but lost the sensor data sometimes, the second method is much better in real-time performance and much less in data losing. A checkerboard image is recorded, and the corner points of the checkerboard are detected with the Harris method. The sensor data of gyroscope, accelerometer and magnet meter have been recorded about 30 minutes. The bias stability and noise feature of the sensors have been analyzed.

This fact makes Android users the biggest target group for malware developers. Trend analyses show large increase in mobile malware targeting the Android platform. Android's security mechanism is based on an instrument that informs users about which permissions the application needs to be granted before installing them. This permission system provides an overview of the application and may help gain awareness about the risks. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that standard users read or digital investigators understand these permissions and their implications. Digital investigators need to be on the alert for the presence of malware when examining Android devices, and can benefit from supporting tools that help them understand the capabilities of such malicious code. This paper presents a permission-based Android malware detection system, APK Auditor that uses static analysis to characterize and classify Android applications as benign or malicious. APK Auditor consists of three components: (1) A signature database to store extracted information about applications and analysis results, (2) an Android client which is used by end-users to grant application analysis requests, and (3) a central server responsible for communicating with both signature database and smartphone client and managing whole analysis process. To test system performance, 8762 applications in total, 1853 benign applications from Google's Play Store and 6909 malicious applications from different sources were collected and analyzed by the system developed. The results show that APK Auditor is able to detect most well-known malwares and highlights the ones with a potential in approximately 88% accuracy with a 0.925 specificity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Arrhythmia occasionally happens under certain conditions, such as stress. Therefore, it is difficult to be diagnosed using electrocardiogram (ECG) devices available in hospitals for just a few minutes. Constant diagnosis and monitoring of heartbeat is required to reduce death caused by cardiovascular diseases. OBJECTIVE: Mobile healthcare system has emerged as a potential solution to assist patients in monitoring their own heart condition, especially those who are isolated from the reference hospital. This paper proposes a self-diagnostic electrocardiogram system for mobile healthcare that has the capability to perform a real-time ECG diagnostic. METHODS: The self-diagnostic capability of a real-time ECG signal is achieved by implementing a detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method. The result obtained from DFA is used to display the patient's health condition on a smartphone anytime and anywhere. If the health condition is critical, the system will alert the patient and his medical practitioner for further diagnosis. RESULTS: Experimental results verified the validity of the developed ECG diagnostic application on a smartphone.

To manage information and features on smart phones, Android employs intent-based mechanism for inter-application or intra-application communication and provides a permission-based security model that requires each application to explicitly request permissions in its manifest file. However, misconfiguration defined in manifest files and that embedded in application code may result in vulnerabilities due to developer confusion and general misuse of the features provided by Android. In this paper, we propose a logic-programming-based approach to analyze smart phones and discover misconfiguration vulnerabilities in Android manifest file and application code. To enable misconfiguration vulnerability analysis and detection, we develop a static technique to extract security related information from application code, and employ logic predicates to describe various vulnerabilities. Based on this approach, we developed a tool called SADroid to systematically analyze and detect misconfiguration vulnerabilities in Android smart phones.

In the meantime, more and more personal data are thus spread around different data silos in the Internet. One day, you will find that you may want to access your own data, but the service providers may not allow or the vendors do not provide any application for your need. It means your personal data are locked in by the service vendors. While the advances in the hardware/software technology of the smart mobile devices enable more complicated application than the user can image a couple of years ago, those devices still fall short of big storage, powerful computing and more battery capacity for better user experience. The user may expect a device with secure and unlimited storage for his personal data and run his application as he wishes without incurring more energy consumption. So far, no simple solutions have been proposed to enable compute cloud for code offloading Android application and trusted storage cloud for personal data. The work described in this paper enhances current Android application framework to address the aforementioned issues. We introduce the MobileFBP framework to augment the compute part for the Android device and propose to leverage the central storage part with personal data store, that is, PDS, for trusted usage. In addition to the design and implementation of the enhanced framework, our preliminary experimental results are illustrated as well.

We propose an Android phone-based botnet communication model over the Google Talk; Google Talk is one of the way to use GTalk service. Because GTalk service provides robust connectivity with traffic encryption, botnet communication over the GTalk service network will be resilient against low signal levels and eavesdropping. In addition, botnet communication traffic will be blended into vast quantities of legitimate Android traffic, which makes botnet detection even harder. These characteristics possess malicious potentials of GTalk service communication channel. Our extensive simulation studies and Android implementations demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of controlling Android botnets via the Google Talk.","Android; Botnets; Google Talk; Smartphone","Communication channels (information theory); Malware; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Transportation; Android; Botnet detections; Botnets; Communication modeling; Extensive simulations; Google talk; Low signal levels; Robust connectivities; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84943575413

This is partly because Android and its task scheduler, the completely fair scheduler (CFS), may incur perceptibly long response time to user-interactive tasks. Particularly, the Android framework cannot systemically favor user-interactive tasks over other background tasks since it does not distinguish between them. Furthermore, user-interactive tasks can suffer from high dispatch latency due to the non-preemptive nature of CFS. To address these problems, this paper presents framework-assisted task characterization and virtual time-based CFS. The former is a cross-layer resource control mechanism between the Android framework and the underlying Linux kernel. It identifies user-interactive tasks at the framework-level, by using the notion of a user-interactive task chain. It then enables the kernel scheduler to selectively promote the priorities of worker tasks appearing in the task chain to reduce the preemption latency. The latter is a cross-layer refinement of CFS in terms of interactivity. It allows a task to be preempted at every predefined period. It also adjusts the virtual runtimes of the identified user-interactive tasks to ensure that they are always scheduled prior to the other tasks in the run-queue when they wake up. As a result, the dispatch latency of a user-interactive task is reduced to a small value. We have implemented our approach into Android 4.1.2 running with Linux kernel 3.0.31. Experimental results show that the response time of a user interaction is reduced by up to 77.35% while incurring only negligible overhead. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Android smartphone; cross-layer resource management; interactivity enhancement; Linux task scheduling","Chains; Computer operating systems; Linux; Multitasking; Scheduling; Smartphones; Virtual addresses; Android smartphone; Background tasks; Interactivity; Kernel schedulers; Resource control; Resource management; Task-scheduling; User interaction; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84943539287

Most of these efforts have focused on the dataset available for analysis and/or the algorithms used to distinguish between normal or abnormal behavior. These factors have major impacts on the accuracy performance of the detection techniques as well as on their time and space complexities. In this paper, we revisit a classical anomaly-based malware detection approach (i.e., database of normal behavior) analyzing Android system calls with two conflicting objectives: reducing the time and space complexities of the selected approach without decreasing its accuracy performance. To achieve this goal, we introduce a filtering and abstraction process, which (i) removes irrelevant system calls to describe the main behavior of an Android application and (ii) unifies system calls having the same functionality but different names. This process is used to build a database describing a canonical normal behavior model of Android applications. This model is based on the 200 most popular free Android applications available in the Android market. It represents the last line of defense of an in-depth protection strategy for smartphone systems. The results of our experimentations show that our filtering and abstraction process has positive impacts on the performance and the accuracy of the selected malware detection approach.

Our approach is to use a single smartphone with accelerometer, magnetic field, and gyroscope sensors to provide the necessary monitoring measurements to enable effective tele-rehabilitation. This work proposes a framework for such a system and has successful developed prototype based on the Android platform. Also, there are many different smartphones in the market. Therefore, we evaluated performance of three different smartphones, which are Samsung Google Nexus S, Samsung Galaxy Note 1, and Sony Xperia Z Ultra. According to the experimentation, we have shown that smartphones with the appropriate sensors are suitable for tele-rehabilitation.

The aim of this review was to demonstrate the current availability of apps related to burns on Google's Android and Apple's iOS store as well as to include a review of their developers, features, and costs. Methods A systematic online review of Google Play Store and Apple's App Store was performed by using the following search terms: ""burn,"" ""burns,"" ""thermal,"" and the German word ""Verbrennung."" All apps that were programmed for use as medical apps for burns were included. The review was performed from 25 February until 1 March 2014. A closer look at the free and paid calculation apps including a standardized patient was performed. Results Four types of apps were identified: calculators, information apps, book/journal apps, and games. In Google Play Store, 31 apps were related to burns, of which 20 were calculation apps (eight for estimating the total body surface area (TBSA) and nine for total fluid requirement (TFR)). In Apple's App Store, under the category of medicine, 39 apps were related to burns, of which 21 were calculation apps (19 for estimating the TBSA and 17 for calculating the TFR). In 19 out of 32 available calculation apps, our study showed a correlation of the calculated TFR compared to our standardized patient. Conclusion The review demonstrated that many apps for medical burns are available in both common app stores. Even free available calculation apps may provide a more objective and reproducible procedure compared to manual/subjective estimations, although there is still a lack of data security especially in personal data entered in calculation apps.

Advances in smartphones, such as increased computing power, improved device-to-device communication and the option of installing additional third-party applications, have led to a sharp rise in their popularity. This popularity, combined with the extensive adoption of smartphones by the general public, has now drawn the attention of mobile malware developers. On popular platforms, such as Android, malware have grown exponentially since the detection of the first mobile Trojan horse in 2010. Android malware families detected during 2013 displayed capabilities that revealed the transition from traditional computer-based botnets to the Android platform. To effectively mitigate or defend against Android botnets, an insightful understanding of them is required. This paper aims to characterise existing Android malware families that display botnet functionality, allowing for the development of proper mitigation and anti-botnet solutions. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, the Android malware collection presented in this paper includes 20 families, which covers the majority of malware families displaying botnet behaviour, ranging from their debut in December 2010 to the recent ones discovered in December 2013. These families are thoroughly characterised based on their detailed behaviour breakdown, including propagation methods, command and control channels, and attack strategies. Secondly, an evolution-based study of representative Android botnet families is performed, revealing the rapid growth of Android botnets and the pressing need for anti-botnet solutions. The characterisation of the Android malware families and the subsequent evolution-based study reveal the sophistication of Android botnets. These identifiable characteristics can, however, be incorporated into new and existing mitigation solutions to defend and protect against Android botnet infections. The outcome of this study show that Android botnets are real and a current threat to smartphone users and that there is a need for proper anti-botnet solutions on mobile platforms.","Android; Android botnets; Mobile botnets; Mobile malware; Smartphones","Computer crime; Malware; Smartphones; Android; Botnets; Constant improvement; Device-to-Device communications; Mobile botnets; Mobile malware; Third party application (Apps); Traditional computers; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84969141792

This fact creates many risks which are not fully recognized. Even advanced users often naively think that by using antivirus software, a firewall, encryption and updates, as well as avoiding potentially risky sites and applications they will be secure. This list is not exhaustive, but nevertheless, in most cases, each item in it only provides the illusion of security. The authors have summarized and pointed out several actual Android security issues and have proposed a number of possible solutions. Practical experience as well as direct testing reveals that some Android applications may contain malware. The harmful characteristics of an application often become visible only after it has been run a few times, after an update, or after harmful web content has been downloaded and shown by the application. It has been observed that applications often try to get unauthorized or inattentively authorized access to user data and to send it outside the device. The situation with Android applications is getting more and more out of control. The authors have proposed a solution for overcoming security issues, while respecting the latest Google solutions. The target group of the proposal is users who use a smartphone or tablet both for private and corporate needs, i.e. a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) case. The authors point out and compare four possible Android technical administration solutions based on the unified model for a BYOD case. The authors also propose changes to Android architecture to enhance its security. A look at the mobile operating system, as a web server, has been proposed.

Using this software application, the user's current location will be retrieved and then use the acquired data to provide information for that location. In line with the National Greening Program, the City Government of Butuan spearheaded the ""Balangayan Grow a Million Tree Project"". Funds were allocated for the various activities associated with this project such as site preparation, seedling production, hauling of seedlings to planting sites including the maintenance and protection of the established plantations. The CGB needs to keep a track of the numbers of the seedlings planted so that the funds allocated are justified. There is need of a tool that will aid the CGB to monitor the site and the seedlings planted in it. With the use of Android Technology and GPS enabled handset, seedlings may be located anywhere in the field. Once the location is acquired, the information obtained can then be attached to various media in the form of meta-data. Geotagging is the process of adding geographical information to photographs. Information such as species name, cost, date planted and planters are stored in the SQLite. SQLite database is an integral part of the application program, due to the server-less design of SQLite applications, and this database require less configuration than client server databases. Aside from Geotagging, Android Technology is also capable of defining a virtual boundary around a real world geographical area.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of English-language, smartphone-platform OC reminder apps currently available for download in the US. Methods: During June-July 2013, official Internet-based, mobile app platforms for the two major smartphone operating systems in the US-Android (Google Play Store) and iPhone (iTunes)-were searched. ""Birth control,"" ""the pill,"" and ""contraception"" were entered into the search-bar of each Smartphone store.

As a result, many of them are open to malicious attacks, notably man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. For some classes of mobile medical devices, such as pulse oximeters, a MITM attack may have little impact on the safety and privacy of the patient. For more essential devices, such as pacemakers and insulin pumps, protection against MITM attacks can have fatal consequences. Though future medical devices may be designed more securely, a significant portion of existing medical devices still use an overlytrusting procedure to communicate with their desired access point. Thus, these legacy devices are still at risk of attack. This paper presents the design and implementation of an Android application to act as a personal security device (PSD) that defends against MITM attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first smartphone application designed for this purpose. The use of this PSD requires no changes to either the medical device or its monitoring software, offers protection for millions of existing devices, and adds an insignificant amount of overhead to the original functionality of the medical device. Furthermore, the PSD is easily obtainable by anyone with an Android smartphone. We evaluate our defense approach by analyzing its robustness against various attacks, and we conclude with a discussion of future applications of our defense mechanism. © 2014 IEEE.","Man-in-the-middle attack; Medical device security","Android (operating system); Mobile security; Network security; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Ubiquitous computing; Android applications; Bluetooth enabled mobiles; Design and implementations; Man in the middle attacks; Man in the middles (MITM); Medical Devices; Mobile medical devices; Smart-phone applications; Biomedical equipment",2-s2.0-84925262453

At the same time there has been a rise in malware targeting the platform, with more recent strains employing highly sophisticated detection avoidance techniques. As traditional signature-based methods become less potent in detecting unknown malware, alternatives are needed for timely zero-day discovery. Thus, this study proposes an approach that utilises ensemble learning for Android malware detection. It combines advantages of static analysis with the efficiency and performance of ensemble machine learning to improve Android malware detection accuracy. The machine learning models are built using a large repository of malware samples and benign apps from a leading antivirus vendor.

The methodology consisted of testing more than 100 smartphones in a reverberation room. White noise was utilised to test the ability of smartphones to measure noise at background, 50, 70 and 90 dB(A) and these measurements were compared with true noise levels acquired via a calibrated sound level meter. Tests were conducted on phones using the Android and iOS platforms. For each smartphone, tests were completed separately for three leading noise monitoring apps culminating in more than 1400 tests. The results suggest that apps written for the iOS platform are superior to those running on the Android platform which, in relative terms, performed rather poorly. For one of the iOS noise apps, the test results were within 1 dB(A) of the true noise level indicating the clear potential of the iPhone to be used as a low cost monitoring device in the future.

The first image is the normal or auto-exposure image and the second image is a short-exposure image that is automatically captured immediately before or after the auto-exposure image is taken. A low rank approximation image is obtained by applying singular value decomposition to the auto-exposure image which may appear blurred due to handshakes. This approximation image does not suffer from blurring while incorporating the image brightness and contrast information. The eigenvalues extracted from the low rank approximation image are then combined with those from the shortexposure image.

The gold standard of measuring sleep and diagnosing sleep disorders is Polysomnography (PSG). Although PSG is accurate, it is expensive and it lacks portability. A number of wearable devices with embedded sensors have emerged in the recent past as an alternative to PSG for regular sleep monitoring directly by the user. These devices are intrusive and cause discomfort besides being expensive. In this work, we present an algorithm to detect sleep using a smartphone with the help of its inbuilt accelerometer sensor. We present three different approaches to classify raw acceleration data into two states - Sleep and Wake. In the first approach, we take an equation from Kushida's algorithm to process accelerometer data. Henceforth, we call it Kushida's equation. While the second is based on statistical functions, the third is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) training. Although all the three approaches are suitable for a phone's resources, each approach demands different amount of resources. While Kushida's equation-based approach demands the least, the HMM training-based approach demands the maximum. We collected data from mobile phone's accelerometer for four subjects for twelve days each. We compare accuracy of sleep detection using each of the three approaches with that of Zeo sensor, which is based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor to detect sleep. EEG is an important modality in PSG. We find that HMM training-based approach is as much as 84%accurate. It is 15%more accurate as compared to Kushida's equation-based approach and 10%more accurate as compared to statistical method-based approach. In order to concisely represent the sleep quality of people, we model their sleep data using HMM. We present an analysis to find out a tradeoff between the amount of training data and the accuracy provided in the modeling of sleep. We find that six days of sleep data is sufficient for accurate modeling. We compare accuracy of our HMM training-based algorithm with a representative third party app SleepTime available from Google Play Store for Android. We find that the detection done using HMM approach is closer to that done by Zeo by 13%as compared to the third party Android application SleepTime. We show that our HMM training-based approach is efficient as it takes less than ten seconds to get executed on Moto G Android phone. © 2015 IEEE.","Mobile Sensing; Physical Analytics; Smart Healthcare","Accelerometers; Algorithms; Android (operating system); Electroencephalography; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Wearable sensors; Accelerometer data; Accelerometer sensor; Accurate modeling; Android applications; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Mobile sensing; Physical Analytics; Statistical functions; Sleep research",2-s2.0-84930446789

With the popularity of smartphones, the privacy of smartphone users are challenged by various malware and attacks. A large amount of malware has been developed and spread such as Soundcomber, Screenmilker, TouchLogger, and so on. In addition, some smartphone attacks are based on physical access to the phone like smudge attacks. All these have reminded current users to pay more attention for smartphone security such as installing anti-malware software to defend against malicious apps, which may reduce the effectiveness of most malware. In this paper, we identify a vulnerability of smartphone charging and design a new type of charging attacks (called juice filming attacks) based on a standard USB connector and HDMI, which can steal users' secrets through automatically video-capturing their inputs (e.g., unlock patterns, PIN code). The efficiency of our designed attacks relies on the observations that users are not aware of any risk when charging their phones in public places and that most users would interact with their phone during the charging. Different from other malware and attacks, our designed juice filming attacks possess six major features: 1) be simple but quite efficient; 2) user unawareness; 3) does not need to in- stall any apps on phone's side; 4) does not need to ask for any permissions; 5) cannot be detected by any current anti- malware software; 6) can be scalable and effective in both Android OS and iOS. To implement this attack, we employ a VGA /RGB frame grabber and further conduct several user studies to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of our attacks.

This 'app' would be run on smartphone devices with cameras which could take a picture of a particular skin abnormality. The image of the lesion would be sent from the smart-phone to a central server/computer which would use color and symmetry based analysis with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the image as benign or malignant.

Work in this latter direction aimed, for example, at inferring the apps a user has installed on his device, or identifying the presence of a specific user within a network.

Objective We compared the standard 12-lead ECG to the smartphone ECG in healthy young adults, elite athletes, and cardiology clinic patients. Accuracy for determining baseline ECG intervals and rate and rhythm was assessed. Methods In 381 participants, 30-second lead I ECG waveforms were obtained using an iPhone case or iPad. Standard 12-lead ECGs were acquired immediately after the smartphone tracing was obtained. De-identified ECGs were interpreted by automated algorithms and adjudicated by two board-certified electrophysiologists. Results Both smartphone and standard ECGs detected atrial rate and rhythm, AV block, and QRS delay with equal accuracy. Sensitivities ranged from 72% (QRS delay) to 94% (atrial fibrillation). Specificities were all above 94% for both modalities. Conclusion Smartphone ECG accurately detects baseline intervals, atrial rate, and rhythm and enables screening in diverse populations.

The data collector extracts a umque set of defined features from raw data and sends them to the data storage cloud. The workstation module receives the training data from the cloud and generates classification models. The activity recogniser determines the user's current activity based on up-to-date available classifier from the cloud.

In this cross-sectional study to ascertain the content of medical apps designed for HTN management, we queried Google Play and Apple iTunes using the search terms ""hypertension"" and ""high blood pressure."" The top 107 apps were analyzed. Major app functionalities including tracking (for blood pressure [BP], pulse, weight, body mass index), medical device (to measure pulse or BP), general information on HTN, and medication adherence tools were recorded along with consumer engagement parameters. Data were collected from May 28 to May 30, 2014. A total of 72% of the apps had tracking function, 22% had tools to enhance medication adherence, 37% contained general information on HTN, and 8% contained information on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. These data showed that a majority of apps for HTN are designed primarily for health management functions. However, 14% of Google Android apps could transform the smartphone into a medical device to measure BP. None of these apps employed the use of a BP cuff or had any documentation of validation against a gold standard. Only 3% of the apps were developed by healthcare agencies such as universities or professional organizations. In regression models. the medical device function was highly predictive of greater number of downloads (odds ratio, 97.08; P <.001) and positive consumer reviews (Incidence rate ratios, 1204.39; P <.001). A large majority of medical apps designed for HTN serve health management functions such as tracking blood pressure, weight, or body mass index. Consumers have a strong tendency to download and favorably rate apps that are advertised to measure blood pressure and heart rate, despite a lack of validation for these apps.

Other watermarking techniques are offered for flexibility.

The alarming App was evaluated with six types of alarm along with a remote control car. During experiment, four metrics were measured, such as response time, collision, disturbance, and satisfaction by recording and questionnaire. The results show that, among six sorts of alarm, providing pre-warning with colorful background was useful to a pedestrian’s response time to a main warning, but transparency for background color was not useful. These results demonstrate that offering prewarning alarm makes the users promptly avoid the collision with cars. On the part of preference, going against our assumption, people prefer an apparent warning to a transparent background-color warning for less disturbance. Participants expressed that the less clear notification message is provided with transparent background, the more disturbed they are. Through experiments, it is shown that the proposed two-level depthbased alarming service can significantly reduce a pedestrian’s reaction to a main warning message, leading to the provisioning of better safety for pedestrians. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Alarming; Distracted walking; Pre-warning; Smartphone; Texting","Alarm systems; Internet; Remote control; Safety engineering; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Alarming; Cognitive neurosciences; Design and evaluations; Distracted walking; Pre-warning; Texting; Vehicular networks; Warning messages; Pedestrian safety",2-s2.0-84952011710

This often leads to over-provisioned hardware, which drains the battery quickly. To save energy for battery-powered smartphones, it is necessary to let the processor run at a power-saving state without sacrificing user experience. Android has implemented a set of CPU governors by leveraging dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) according to the computational requirements of apps. However, they commonly adopt very conservative policies due to limited information, therefore leaving considerable energy reduction opportunities unexplored; or they are not responsive to user interactions, leading to poor user experiences. In this work, we start from an important observation on the repetitive patterns of smartphone usage for each individual user, and propose UH-DVFS, a usage history-directed DVFS framework leveraging on this observation. UH-DVFS can identify repetitive user transactions, and store their execution history information within a table. When such a user transaction is launched again, the table is consulted for an appropriate CPU frequency adaptation to reduce the energy consumption of the user transaction without sacrificing user experience. We have implemented the proposed framework on Android smartphones, and have tested it with real-world interaction-intensive apps. The results show that our framework can save energy from 10% to 36% without affecting the quality of user experiences. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Android; DVFS; Energy reduction; Smartphone; User transaction","Computer architecture; Dynamic frequency scaling; Electric batteries; Energy utilization; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Power management; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Voltage scaling; Android; Application processors; Computational requirements; DVFS; Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling; Energy reduction; Frequency adaptation; User transaction; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84959350994

Therefore, we developed an open source Android based toolset for NFC tag testing and performance evaluation. The toolset is designed in such a way that it is extensible with respect to supported tags and supported benchmarking routines. The architecture of the toolset comprises a basic library that provides a single interface for communication with a range of NFC tags, one app for benchmarking, and one app to test proprietary communications protocols. To confirm that the apps fulfill their purpose, extensive testing is performed to compare five tags based on five different standards. The benchmark results reveal that the communication performance between the NFC reader and the tag is not significantly influenced by an increasing distance between them in the range of zero to 30mm, not even when a body of saline solution separates them. One unexpected result is the measured energy consumption for powering the tag, which is about 30% higher than that for writing to the tag. We can also conclude from the results that throughput of the communication between tag and smartphone is the most important factor for energy efficiency. © VDE Verlag GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany.",,"Android (operating system); Benchmarking; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network architecture; Standards; Application developers; Communication performance; Communications protocols; Extensive testing; Measured energy consumption; Open sources; Saline solutions; Toolsets; Near field communication",2-s2.0-84979649983

Thus, in order to provide better academic achievement, more and more instructors are adapting collaborative learning to their classes. Collaborative learning, by definition, means that students have to become socially active and achieve learning goals in a group-based environment. The benefits of collaborative learning include learning concepts more effectively, encouraging more participation, improving learning satisfaction, developing teamwork skills, and promoting higher-order thinking. However, it is difficult to apply collaborative learning because students tend to engage passively with traditional lectures. As a result, interactive technologies such as clickers have been applied to increase interactive learning and raise the rate of interaction. Nevertheless, these interactive technologies still have some limitations, such as limited mobility, high costs, setup issues, technical difficulties, and little support of higher-order thinking skills. Technology is accelerating at an exponential rate, so almost every student now lives with a smartphone. Therefore, we have designed the Smartphone-Supported Collaborative Learning System (SSCLS), which includes the MyResponse mobile app and the Delphi method. SSCLS not only addresses the limitations of mobile technologies, but also achieves collaborative learning. In this study, we first provide detailed implementation of MyResponse mobile app and explain how we apply it to increase the rates of in-class participation and interaction. Next, we describe how we apply the Delphi method to develop students' knowledge and promote higher-order thinking. Then, we explain how we utilize SSCLS in a course to achieve five cognitive processes from Bloom's revised taxonomy and facilitate the construction of knowledge. Furthermore, we ask students to evaluate their experiences and provide feedback about SSCLS. Based on students' overall feedback, we finally conclude that SSCLS can support collaborative learning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For assessment, a trial setup is done to acquire sensor's information of diverse positions. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Android (operating system); Pattern recognition; Sensor networks; Smartphones; Built-in sensors; Daily life activities; Human activity recognition; Kinematic sensors; Notification Service; Prevention systems; Signal magnitude; Technology support; Accident prevention",2-s2.0-84946220103

In consequence, quick and simple authentication mechanisms along with energy saving consideration are generally adopted by these smart handheld devices such as screen autolock schemes. When a smart device activates its screen lock mode to protect user privacy and data security on this device, its screen auto-lock scheme will be executed at the same time. Device user can setup the length of time period to control when to activate the screen lock mode of a smart device. However, it causes inconvenience for device users when a short time period is set for invoking screen auto-lock. How to get balance between security and convenience for individual users to use their own smart devices has become an interesting issue.

It is sometimes difficult to identify the location where a vehicular accident has occurred. It can also be difficult to determine after an incident occurs, if it was accidental or not. Usually, the deployment of a vehicle's airbag is very suggestive of an accident having taken place. Smartphones have many features that can help people manage many things. One of these features is global positioning system technology (GPS). The current study proposes an algorithm that combines Wi-Fi with GPS signals to produce a guide for locating the end-user of the application in the event of a vehicular accident. We tested this proposed approach in a real environment for one week, from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm daily. Ten different locations were used for these tests within a city of United States. Our approach achieved good results in all ten locations. We concluded that, by using a mobile application, the average time interval between the occurrence of an accident and the contact made with the Emergency Services was 15 seconds. Additionally, we found that during the period of our study, the highest number of vehicular accidents occurred on May 01, 2014.

However, this will not necessarily save energy if there is no systematic mechanism to evaluate the effect of offloading an app onto the cloud.

While in most election settings election authorities perform the task of trustees, elections in small groups such as board elections can be implemented in a way that all voters are also trustees. This is actually the ideal case for an election as trust is maximally distributed. A number of voting schemes have been proposed for facilitating such elections. Our focus is on a mix net based approach to maximize flexibility regarding ballot design. We proposed and implemented a corresponding voting scheme as an Android smartphone application. We believe smartphones are most likely to be used in the election settings that we consider in the paper. Our implementation also enables voters to remotely participate in the voting process.

Graphical password and alphanumeric password are two common types of screen locking schemes. The alphanumeric password scheme has shown some security and usability drawbacks. For example, a user may pick an easy to remember alphanumeric password that may also be easy to guess. On the contrary, if as user picks a password that is hard to guess it may also be hard to remember. Several alternative password mechanisms have been introduced. Graphical password is one of them, and it is based on pictures or patterns. However, graphical password is also vulnerable to certain types of attack. In this paper, we study an alphanumeric password method (i.e., PIN) and a graphical password method (i.e., pattern) in order to unravel security and usability issues related to mobile device authentication. The study uses observation and survey data to compare these two authentication methods on following criteria: creation time, memorability, and login time and login success rate. In addition, we also measure how the screen size of a mobile device affects usability and security aspects of screen locks by measuring differences on creation time, memorability, login time, login success rate for Android smartphone and tablet.",,"Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Locks (fasteners); Mobile devices; Smartphones; Usability engineering; Alphanumeric passwords; Android smartphone; Authentication methods; Comparative studies; Device authentications; Security and usabilities; Sensitive informations; Usability and security; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84928749066

Taking advantage of the emerging concept of connected car, the popularity of smartphones and the rise of Internet of Things, this work proposes a solution to predict where the best available parking spots are. The proposal includes both a centralized system to predict empty indoor parking spaces based on cellular automata, and a low-cost mobile application based on different technologies to help the driver to find empty parking spaces. On the one hand, cellular automata are used to model the behavior of drivers in parking facilities. Specifically, the system applies the idea behind the game of life to capture some features of parking occupancy based on common user behaviors, in order to reduce the time to find empty parking spots. On the other hand, the proposal involves a smartphone application that uses accurate technologies for indoor positioning. The client software is a lightweight Android application that provides different indoor positioning solutions, such as precise positioning systems based on Quick Response codes or Near Field Communication tags, or semi-precise positioning systems based on Bluetooth Low Energy beacons. The proposed service takes into account that it will be gradually adopted by users. The results obtained from a preliminary implementation show how the proposal improves the parking experience and increases efficiency of parking facilities in terms of time and energy costs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Cellular automata; Indoor parking; Intelligent transport system; Location-Based service; Sensors; Smartphone application","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Cellular automata; Costs; Forecasting; Indoor positioning systems; Intelligent systems; Mobile devices; Near field communication; Parking; Sensors; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telecommunication services; Ubiquitous computing; Android applications; Bluetooth low energies (BTLE); Centralized systems; Intelligent transport systems; Mobile applications; Precise positioning system; Quick response code; Smart-phone applications; Location based services",2-s2.0-84952361117

In the past, without the Internet technology, the elderly must spend their life in the nursing home even though they are not in any serious sickness due to the expensive wage of the personal curator. Fortunately, nowadays, the capability of mobile phone and the quality of networking have been improved. With the proposed model, the elderly health care strategy is changed. To begin with, the questionnaire has been carried out to the caretaker of the elderly. The result shows that almost all of them would like to tend the elderly at home if these three major problems; falling, medicine taking, and monitoring, can be solved. In this paper, not only the senior patient can recuperate at home safely without home health aides but also, this new model runs with everyday technologies and low-cost equipment such as Smartphone. The falling is detected with an integrated tri-axial gyroscope and the alert will be sent to the caretaker via the Internet.

However, many smartphone users are unhappy with its battery life, which is shorter than that of conventional cellphones. Users attribute this problem to the energy consumption caused by the background traffic that installed applications create. In most cases, users are not unaware of the background traffic in their daily use, and the energy consumption of background traffic is actually significant, as A. Carrol et al. [1] mention. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the energy consumption due to this background traffic, including a method that limits the time allocated for sending outgoing packets[2]. However, existing control methods may affect the behavior of installed applications. In this paper, we propose a mobile interface control scheme for saving energy that has less impact on installed applications.

It can also be used to track location of individuals (relatives, children) as well as that of lost or stolen device (say, phone)fromany type ofother handheld devices.

Although hundreds of alcohol-related apps are available, there is little information about the behavior change techniques (BCTs) they contain, or the extent to which they are based on evidence or theory and how this relates to their popularity and user ratings. Objective: Our aim was to assess the proportion of popular alcohol-related apps available in the United Kingdom that focus on alcohol reduction, identify the BCTs they contain, and explore whether BCTs or the mention of theory or evidence is associated with app popularity and user ratings. Methods: We searched the iTunes and Google Play stores with the terms ""alcohol and ""drink, and the first 800 results were classified into alcohol reduction, entertainment, or blood alcohol content measurement. Of those classified as alcohol reduction, all free apps and the top 10 paid apps were coded for BCTs and for reference to evidence or theory. Measures of popularity and user ratings were extracted. Results: Of the 800 apps identified, 662 were unique. Of these, 13.7% (91/662) were classified as alcohol reduction (95% CI 11.3-16.6), 53.9% (357/662) entertainment (95% CI 50.1-57.7), 18.9% (125/662) blood alcohol content measurement (95% CI 16.1-22.0) and 13.4% (89/662) other (95% CI 11.1-16.3). The 51 free alcohol reduction apps and the top 10 paid apps contained a mean of 3.6 BCTs (SD 3.4), with approximately 12% (7/61) not including any BCTs. The BCTs used most often were ""facilitate self-recording (54%, 33/61), ""provide information on consequences of excessive alcohol use and drinking cessation (43%, 26/61), ""provide feedback on performance"" (41%, 25/61), ""give options for additional and later support"" (25%, 15/61) and ""offer/direct towards appropriate written materials"" (23%, 14/61). These apps also rarely included any of the 22 BCTs frequently used in other health behavior change interventions (mean 2.46, SD 2.06). Evidence was mentioned by 16.4% of apps, and theory was not mentioned by any app. Multivariable regression showed that apps including advice on environmental restructuring were associated with lower user ratings (B=-46.61, P=.04, 95% CI -91.77 to -1.45) and that both the techniques of ""advise on/facilitate the use of social support"" (B=2549.21, P=.04, 95% CI 96.75-5001.67) and the mention of evidence (B=1376.74, P=.02, 95%, CI 208.62-2544.86) were associated with the popularity of the app. Conclusions: Only a minority of alcohol-related apps promoted health while the majority implicitly or explicitly promoted the use of alcohol. Alcohol-related apps that promoted health contained few BCTs and none referred to theory. The mention of evidence was associated with more popular apps, but popularity and user ratings were only weakly associated with the BCT content.","Alcohol; Android; Apps; Behaviour change; Digital; Intervention; Iphone; Mhealth; Smartphone","behavior therapy; drinking behavior; health behavior; human; male; mobile application; mobile phone; procedures; telemedicine; Alcohol Drinking; Behavior Therapy; Cell Phones; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Mobile Applications; Telemedicine",2-s2.0-84930356096

Millions of smartphone applications (apps) are available on different app stores which gives users plethora of options to choose from, however, it also raises concern if these apps are adequately tested before they are released for public use. In this study, we want to understand the test automation culture prevalent among app developers. Specifically, we want to examine the current state of testing of apps, the tools that are commonly used by app developers, and the problems faced by them. To get an insight on the test automation culture, we conduct two different studies. In the first study, we analyse over 600 Android apps collected from F- Droid, one of the largest repositories containing information about open-source Android apps. We check for the presence of test cases and calculate code coverage to measure the adequacy of testing in these apps. We also survey developers who have hosted their applications on GitHub to understand the testing practices followed by them. We ask developers about the tools that they use and ''pain points'' that they face while testing Android apps. For the second study, based on the responses from Android developers, we improve our survey questions and resend it to Windows app developers within Microsoft. We conclude that many Android apps are poorly tested - only about 14% of the apps contain test cases and only about 9% of the apps that have executable test cases have coverage above 40%. Also, we find that Android app developers use automated testing tools such as JUnit, Monkeyrunner, Robotium, and Robolectric, however, they often prefer to test their apps manually, whereas Windows app developers prefer to use in-house tools such as Visual Studio and Microsoft Test Manager. Both Android and Windows app developers face many challenges such as time constraints, compatibility issues, lack of exposure, cumbersome tools, etc. We give suggestions to improve the test automation culture in the growing app community. © 2015 IEEE.","Android; App Developers; Microsoft; Test Automation Culture","Automation; Open source software; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software testing; Surveys; Testing; Verification; Android; App Developers; Automated testing tools; MicroSoft; Smart-phone applications; Test Automation; Time constraints; Visual studios; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84935144721

It uses computer vision techniques and multiple-resolution template matching to detect speed limit signs and alert the driver if the speed limit is exceeded. It inputs an image of the sign to be detected and creates a set of multiple-resolution templates. It also inputs photographs of the road from the smartphone camera at regular intervals and generates multiple-resolution images from the photographs. In the first step of processing, fast filters restrict the focus of attention to smaller areas of the photographs where signs are likely to be present. In the second step, the system matches the templates against the photographs using fast normalized cross correlation to detect speed limit signs. The multiple resolutions enable this approach to detect signs at different scales. In the third step, the system recognizes the sign by matching a series of annotated speed templates to the image at the position and scale that were determined by the detection step. It compares the speed limit with the actual vehicle speed as computed from the smartphone GPS device and issues warnings to the driver as necessary. The system is implemented as an Android application that runs on an ordinary smartphone as part of a client-server architecture.

Unlike other power hungry components in a smartphone, the cellular data and Wi-Fi interfaces often continue to be used even when the phone is in its idle state in order to accommodate background (necessary or unnecessary) data traffic produced by some applications. In addition, bad reception has been proven to greatly increase energy consumed by the radio, which happens frequently when smartphone users are inside buildings. In this paper, we present a Short message service Push based Service (SPS) system to save unnecessary power consumption when smartphones are in idle state, especially in bad reception areas. First, SPS disables a smartphone's data interfaces whenever the phone is in idle state. Second, to preserve the real-time notification functionality required by some apps, such as new email arrivals and social media updates, when a notification is needed, a push server will deliver a wakeup text message to the phone (which does not rely on data interfaces), and then SPS enables the phone's data interfaces to connect to the corresponding server to retrieve notification data via the normal data network. Once the notification data has been retrieved, SPS will disable the data interfaces again if the phone is still in idle state. We have developed a complete SPS prototype for Android smartphones. Our experiments show that SPS consumes less energy than the current approaches. In areas with bad reception, the SPS prototype can double the battery life of a smartphone. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Electric batteries; Energy conservation; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Battery life; Data interfaces; Data network; Data traffic; Push-based; Real time; Short message services; Social media; Interface states",2-s2.0-84943169826

In this study, current mobile apps icons collected from app stores were characterized and examined based on different composition of “stylization” (three categories: pictorial illustration, graphic rendering and graphic symbology) and “border shape” (two categories: open and close border). The six different compositions of icons were then implemented functionally on a smartphone to test recognition time, accuracy and subjective opinion. Results show that participants prefer pictorial illustration icons, but have no significant preference on border shape. For the recognition, users perform better time on simplified stylization, but make more errors relatively. Results indicate that open border shape icon is beneficial for recognition.

A lot of research has since then been devoted to extend and improve its properties, leading to the appearance of multiple schemes. Despite this progress, the practical feasibility of E-Cash systems is still today an open question. Payment tokens are typically portable hardware devices in smart card form, resource constrained due to their size, and therefore not suited to support largely complex protocols such as E-Cash. Migrating to more powerful mobile platforms, for instance, smartphones, seems a natural alternative. However, this impliesmoving computations from trusted and dedicated execution environments to generic multiapplication platforms, which may result in security vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose a new anonymous E-Cash system to overcome this limitation. Motivated by existing payment schemes based on MTM (Mobile Trusted Module) architectures, we consider at design time a model in which user payment tokens are composed of two modules: an untrusted but powerful execution platform (e.g., smartphone) and a trusted but constrained platform (e.g., secure element). We show how the protocol's computational complexity can be relaxed by a secure split of computations: nonsensitive operations are delegated to the powerful platform, while sensitive computations are kept in a secure environment. We provide a full construction of our proposed Anonymous Split E-Cash scheme and show that it fully complies with the main properties of an ideal E-Cash system. Finally, we test its performance by implementing it on an Android smartphone equipped with a Java-Cardcompatible secure element. © 2015 ACM.","Android; Anonymity; E-Cash; Java Card; Payment systems; Privacy-enhancing technologies","Android (operating system); Data privacy; Electronic money; Signal encoding; Smart cards; Smartphones; Trusted computing; Android; Anonymity; E-Cash; JAVA card; Payment systems; Privacy enhancing technologies; Mobile security",2-s2.0-84941959851

MAINOUTCOMES ANDMEASURES: Percentage of days using sun protection and time spent outdoors (days and minutes) inthe midday sun and number of sunburns in the past 3 months were collected. RESULTS: Individuals in the treatment group reported more shade use (mean days staying in the shade, 41.0% vs 33.7%;P =.03) but less sunscreen use (mean days, 28.6%vs 34.5%; P =.048) than controls. There was no significant difference in number of sunburns in the past 3 months (mean, 0.60 in the treatment group vs 0.62 for controls; P =.87). Those who used the mobile app reported spending less time in the sun (mean days keeping time in the sun to a minimum, 60.4% for app users vs 49.3% for nonusers; P =.04) and using all protection behaviors combined more (mean days, 39.4%vs 33.8%; P =.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The mobile app improved some sun protection. Use of the mobile app was lower than expected but associated with increased sun protection. Providing personalized advice when and where people are in the sun may help reduce sun exposure.",,"sunscreen; vitamin D; sunscreen; adult; age; aged; Article; Caucasian; controlled study; female; follow up; forecasting; geography; health behavior; health care delivery; health promotion; Hispanic; human; human experiment; information processing; male; mobile application; mobile phone; normal human; patient counseling; personalized medicine; pretest posttest control group design; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; shade; skin protection; sun exposure; sunburn; time; ultraviolet radiation; very elderly; adolescent; analysis of variance; devices; health behavior; medical information system; middle aged; mobile phone; procedures; Skin Neoplasms; sunburn; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Cell Phones; Female; Health Behavior; Health Information Exchange; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Precision Medicine; Skin Neoplasms; Sunburn; Sunscreening Agents; United States; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84929670021

While previous studies investigate social connectivity to deduce proliferation paths, we focus on the physical contacts of each individual that are the dominant cause of influenza infections. To estimate the probability of an infection through each physical contact we measure the surrounding features of each contact including the staying time of a contact, the human density and the openness of the space, and the infection status of each individual. By using a smartphone equipped with various sensors we can estimate the infection status of its owner by analyzing both the envelope of incoming sound and the surrounding features of the contact. A surveillance server, which aggregates the information from multiple smartphones, monitors the infection status of influenza and ranks both high risk persons and influential persons that have to be vaccinated promptly. To evaluate the forecast accuracy of ISFS we have implemented a full ISFS including an Android ISFS client and compare the forecast accuracy of ISFS against that of the traditional forecast system based on social connectivity. Our evaluation results suggest that influenza surveillance and forecast should be performed based on human activity rather than social connectivity. This would not only improve the forecast accuracy but it can also improve the cost efficiency and the suppression effect of vaccinations by finding the most influential persons in the proliferation paths. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Influential people; Influenza forecast; Influenza surveillance; Social networks","Epidemiology; Monitoring; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Evaluation results; Forecast accuracy; Forecast systems; Human activities; Influential people; Physical contacts; Suppression effects; Surrounding feature; Forecasting",2-s2.0-85028166817

More recently, hackers have started exploiting inherent weaknesses in current mobile platforms allowing them to remotely convert a victim's smartphone device into a roving spy bug without his knowledge. The goal of this paper is to illustrate with the aid of an Android mobile platform application that permissions gained in a legitimate way can be used to evade the integrity and privacy of the mobile device and install malware that remains completely hidden. When the attacker makes a call to the victim's phone, he is able to listen in to the victim's surroundings transforming the mobile phone into a sophisticated covert listening device. This communication-level attack goes undetected by current detection mechanisms. An anomaly-based detection feature set is another contribution of this paper to mitigate the proposed attack. As more and more mobile devices are being rapidly integrated into enterprises with the increase in bring-your-own-device model in many organizations, without a rigorous security screening policy, this weakness tends to facilitate corporate espionage by presumably allowing as many spy bugs in the board meeting as there are attendees with mobiles. This work provides a demonstration of a dangerous espionage attack targeting smartphones whereby an attacker can, with the aid of an Android mobile platform application, make a call to the victim's phone and listen in to the victim's surroundings transforming the mobile phone into a sophisticated covert listening device.

A significant activity is a predefined activity to be inferred, for example, waiting for a bus, having a meeting, working in office, taking a break in a coffee shop et al. In this framework, smartphone contextual information consists of local time, user state as well as user significant location. This contextual triad forms a contextual tuple at each time epoch. The activity inference engine is developed using the dynamic Naive Bayes classifier (DNBC) method, which extends a standard hidden Markov model (HMM) to make real-time inference less expensive and to maximize the flexibility of the overall framework for adopting adaptive context tuple elements and significant activity states. As for significant activity prediction, the solution is designed to forecast upcoming user activities based on virtual contextual tuple observation generated by mining historical significant locations and user states. This is achieved in two steps: 1) build virtual contextual observations and maintain a context data file which continuously record the user's contextual information based on the Naïve Bayes strategy, but in a real time algorithm; 2) use the DNBC method for activity prediction. The performance of the overall contextual thinking framework was evaluated at the campus of Texas A&M University Corpus Christi. A contextual thinking engine for user significant activity inference and prediction is developed based on the Android platform. Six significant activities were defined and tested by three different testers for a full week at TAMUCC campus using three different Samsung smartphones. Experiment results reveal that the activity inference process can reach an average accuracy level of 78%. Prediction accuracy is relatively poor due to limited data length and low time quantization level.",,"Classifiers; Engines; Global positioning system; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Activity inference; Activity predictions; Contextual information; Naive Bayes classifiers; Prediction accuracy; Real time algorithms; Real-time inference; Significant locations; Forecasting",2-s2.0-84975804479

Irrigation schedules in the smartphone apps are based on evapotranspiration (ET) or a water balance methodology using real-time weather data from the Florida Automated Weather Network and the Georgia Environmental Monitoring Network. The FAO Penman Monteith method is used for calculating reference ET and crop coefficients (Kc) are applied based on time after planting, calendar month, or a crop's phenological stage. The functionality of each app was customized for each user group considering the most common irrigation systems used. Custom features include water conservation options, splitting irrigation events, spreadsheet output emails, and the use of notifications. App inputs varied by crop (primarily due to the irrigation system used); however, all apps required root depth, irrigation rate, and soil type except the strawberry app. App outputs also varied and included estimated reference ET, days between irrigation events, irrigation depth and duration, accumulated rain for previous 7 days, and growing degree days. National Weather Service forecast data are also provided in the apps. The apps are available in Android and iOS stores. A limitation to the app irrigation schedules is the spatial variation in rainfall given the finite set of weather station; future efforts will focus on more accurate inclusion of rainfall into the irrigation schedules generated by the Smartlrrigation apps.","Avocado; Citrus; Cotton; Irrigation; Irrigation scheduling; Peanut; Strawberry; Turf; Vegetable","Cotton; Crops; Fruits; Oilseeds; Rain; Scheduling; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Vegetables; Water conservation; Weather forecasting; Weather information services; Avocado; Citrus; Irrigation scheduling; Peanut; Strawberry; Turf; Irrigation",2-s2.0-84969760251

Everyday millions of applications are developed and made available through the different appstores, i.e., Google Play, Apple store, BlackBerry World, etc. With 91% of Americans owning one or more cellphones, this is a crucial market to tap into for application developers. Due to progress in the health sciences and people awareness of the importance of following a healthier lifestyle, people are living longer leading to a demographic change where more and more nations have rapidly growing aging population. Thus, there will be a shortage of doctors to care for this fast growing aging population. Moreover, as the population ages managing multiple chronic diseases becomes a daily challenge. Also, given the size of the population, many more people will be diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Hence, proper measures are needed to encourage this population to act and think independently while taking advantage of what current technologies are offering.

These courses normally involve access to a teaching laboratory that is equipped with hardware boards, in particular DSP boards, together with their supporting software. A number of textbooks have been written discussing how to achieve real-time implementation on these hardware boards. This book discusses how smartphones can be used as hardware boards for real-time implementation of signal processing algorithms as an alternative to the hardware boards that are currently being used in signal processing teaching laboratories. The fact that mobile devices, in particular smartphones, have now become powerful processing platforms has led to the development of this book, thus enabling students to use their own smartphones to run signal processing algorithms in real-time considering that these days nearly all students possess smartphones. Changing the hardware platforms that are currently used in applied or real-time signal processing courses to smartphones creates a truly mobile laboratory experience or environment for students. In addition, it relieves the cost burden associated with using a dedicated signal processing board noting that the software development tools for smartphones are free of charge and are well-developed. This book is written in such a way that it can be used as a textbook for applied or real time digital signal processing courses offered at many universities. Ten lab experiments that are commonly encountered in such courses are covered in the book. This book is written primarily for those who are already familiar with signal processing concepts and are interested in their real-time and practical aspects. Similar to existing real-time courses, knowledge of C programming is assumed.

Hence, the proposed system just requires participators to install the special smartphone application, and participators can easily join a sensing network and can work for participatory sensing unconsciously. We employ the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is a short-range wireless communication standard, to realize communication between the beacon device and the smartphone application. Additionally, we achieve low power operations of the smartphone application by employing iBeacon, which is a short-range recognition mechanism for BLE.

This is tedious, time consuming, bears security and privacy risks, and contrasts the idea of Internet of Things (IoT) where intelligent devices operate in concert to enrich the overall user experience by sharing resources and capabilities. We present Xapp, a context-aware service mobility framework for Android. Our goal is to enable users to securely distribute the functionality of applications to mutually untrusted smart devices, e.g., to enable a smartphone to use a nearby Android TV screen as a display for a video call, let a smartphone navigation app direct an autonomous vehicle, or let it use the vehicle for an object-recognition task rather than using a cloud service with the attendant privacy risks. We built a prototype for Android as the first step towards this goal. Our system is a set of extensions to the existing Remote-OSGi service platform, an emerging industry standard which unfortunately does not secure the communications between devices. This paper describes our proposal for the required security architecture. We designed and implemented an authentication protocol suite, where trust is bootstrapped using NFC for the sake of usability. On top of this we built a fine-grained access control system so that mutually mistrustful Xapp apps can be used simultaneously in the same neighborhood and even on the same devices. Hence, with Xapp users can run an Android app across multiple devices without having to install it on each of them individually.

Typically, the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) in a smartphone are used for data collection. However, the limited battery life of the smartphone has become a major barrier to effective data collection. The sampling rate, as a primary configurable parameter of an inertial sensor, may have important impact on power consumption. Presumably, a lower sampling rate would consume less battery power. However, it may compromise the accuracy of data analysis. In this study, we investigate how the sampling rate of inertial sensors impacts the battery power consumption as well as the accuracy of data analysis. The four pre-defined sampling rate settings of the Android OS were evaluated for their impact on the smartphone’s power consumption. Additionally, we also measured the accuracy differences of the four sampling settings by comparing the sensor data-derived wheelchair maneuvering distances with the actual distances.

Methods: Thirty-eight participant pairs (MS and cohabitant) aged 18-55 years participated in the study. Each participant received an Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone containing a custom application suite of 19 tests capturing participant performance and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Over 1 year, participants were prompted daily to complete one assigned test. Results: A total of 22 patients with MS and 17 cohabitants completed the entire study. Among patients with MS, low scores on PROs relating tomental and visual function were associated with dropout (p < 0.05). We illustrate several novel features of a smartphone platform. First, fluctuations in MS outcomes (e.g., fatigue) were assessed against an individual's ambient environment by linking responses to meteorological data. Second, both response accuracy and speed for the Ishihara color vision test were captured, highlighting the benefits of both active and passive data collection. Third, a new trait, a person-specific learning curve in neuropsychological testing, was identified using spline analysis. Finally, averaging repeated measures over the study yielded the most robust correlation matrix of the different outcome measures. Conclusions: We report the feasibility of, and barriers to, deploying a smartphone platform to gather useful passive and active performance data at high frequency in an unstructured manner in the field.

Methods: Participants underwent baseline in-clinic assessments, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and were provided smartphones with an Android operating system that contained a smartphone application that assessed voice, posture, gait, finger tapping, and response time. Participants then took the smart phones home to perform the five tasks four times a day for a month. Once a week participants had a remote (telemedicine) visit with a Parkinson disease specialist in which a modified (excluding assessments of rigidity and balance) UPDRS performed. Using statistical analyses of the five tasks recorded using the smartphone from 10 individuals with PD and 10 controls, we sought to: (1) discriminate whether the participant had PD and (2) predict the modified motor portion of the UPDRS. Results: Twenty participants performed an average of 2.7 tests per day (68.9% adherence) for the study duration (average of 34.4 days) in a home and community setting. The analyses of the five tasks differed between those with Parkinson disease and those without. In discriminating participants with PD from controls, the mean sensitivity was 96.2% (SD 2%) and mean specificity was 96.9% (SD 1.9%).

This paper aims to develop and evaluate algorithms to detect the movement patterns of elderly people in order to realize whether they are lost. We then make use of this algorithm to develop a diagnostic tool for cog-nitively impaired elderly people. In this paper, five healthy people are asked to simulate AD subjects in order to build the database with two different labels: (1) normal controls (NCs), and (2) AD subjects. A navigation tool is therefore developed to detect whether the subjects get lost during the well-designed walking navigation experiments. To begin with, we develop this navigation diagnostic tool based on an Android smartphone with a simple graphic user interface, since most elderly people cannot handle too much information at the same time. This diagnostic tool contains four sensors: (1) accelerometer, (2) gyroscope, (3) magnetometer, and (4) global navigation satellite system receiver, in order to calculate the angle of the direction in which the subjects should head. Data on the subjects' acceleration during the experiments is also collected to help analyze the elderly people's cognitive and navigation abilities through signal processing. The raw data collected from the accelerometer is extracted into informative features with a 30-second sliding window. The classification model used to classify whether the subject is an AD patient is the one-nearest-neighbor algorithm. Since the measured behavior is a temporal sequence, an elastic distance measurement, called dynamic time warping distance, is applied for the one-nearest-neighbor algorithm. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this proposed navigation tool, with a classification accuracy of 90% using one-nearest-neighbor algorithm with the mean of z-axis acceleration, and the standard deviation of the resultant acceleration as extracted features.","Accelerometer; Cognitive impairment; GNSS; Gyroscope; Magnetometer; Pattern recognition; Smartphone","Accelerometers; Algorithms; Data mining; Diagnosis; Diagnostic products; Gyroscopes; Inertial navigation systems; Magnetometers; Navigation; Neurodegenerative diseases; Pattern recognition; Satellites; Signal encoding; Signal processing; Smartphones; User interfaces; Classification accuracy; Classification models; Cognitive impairment; Dynamic time warping distance; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; GNSS; Graphic user interface; Nearest neighbor algorithm; Global positioning system",2-s2.0-84975789291

Most prior research on application recommendation provides a limited solution to the problem of application overload. These recommendation techniques, developed outside of the mobile environment, have a number of limitations such as cold start problem and domain disparity. In this paper, we propose AppTrends, which incorporates a graph-based technique for application recommendation in the Android OS environment.

The system is developed on a single, low-power, 65-nm field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) chip that interfaces directly with Android based smart-devices (smartphone or tablet) and consumes 12.42 mW of power. As a result, image data from an endoscopic capsule can be saved (or viewed) directly on smart-device, tablet, laptop, workstation or secured server connected to a hospital's or residential Wi-Fi network. This eliminates the need to carry a bulky data logger and enables medical doctors to analyze data and perform diagnosis in real time from a remote place. The system supports full-duplex data communication between the endoscopic capsule and smart-device which further allows doctors to control many features of the capsule in real-time. Due to the flexible and reprogrammable nature of the system, various image processing and compression algorithms can be employed without any change in hardware. The system supports multi-spectral imaging including white light imaging (WLI) and narrow band imaging (NBI). A variable-length, low-complexity image compression algorithm is used that is based on a novel color-space followed by an optimized Golomb-rice coding. The entire system is prototyped using circular PCBs with a size of 16 mm × 36 mm. An Android mobile app is designed with many features to control the operation of the capsule as well as display the captured images. Both in vivo and ex vivo trials using live pig have been conducted to validate the advantage of the proposed system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This information aids them in avoiding delays and uncertainties on the road, enhancing their navigation experience. Several US departments of transportation provide information from street cameras in the form of a snapshot of a particular location on a Google map. However, it is difficult for drivers to manually select cameras on the map to obtain consolidated information about road conditions along a particular route. In this paper, we design an energy-efficient mobile service that provides drivers with a convenient interface to observe live camera coverage along a route. Our proposed solution comprises an Android application and a cloud-based proxy service between smartphones and traffic cameras. The proxy provides an abstraction layer over different communication protocols adopted by traffic cameras, and transfers camera images for a specified route to the smartphone as a batch, thereby reducing communication overhead and improving user response time. By employing an in-memory cache, the proxy server maintains the most recently accessed camera images and reduces camera polling. We integrate our solution with traffic cameras from cities in Massachusetts, New York, and Washington DC, and demonstrate its reduced energy consumption and reduced response time. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Abstracting; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Proxy caches; Roads and streets; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Abstraction layer; Android applications; Communication overheads; Departments of transportations; Energy efficient; Real-time information; Smart-phone applications; User response time; Cameras",2-s2.0-84943181161

In photography, the common guidelines of composing portrait images exist. However, these rules usually do not consider the background scene. Therefore, in this article, we investigate human-scenery positional relationships and construct a photographic assistance system to optimize the position of human subjects in a given background scene, thereby assisting the user in capturing high-quality souvenir photos. We collect thousands of well-composed portrait photographs to learn human-scenery aesthetic composition rules. In addition, we define a set of negative rules to exclude undesirable compositions.

From the local perspective, innovation opportunity appears when it suits characteristics of the country and behaviors of its people. The realization of such an opportunity has been enabled by development of a mobile-herbal (m-herbal) service application. The service has been designed according to the following framework: scanning the market demand, defining specific applications, defining the actors, exploring tacit knowledge of the actors, and developing engineering functions for support of implantation innovation and concurrent innovative development. We used the results of a previous market survey emphasizing a need for health-related services in the Indonesian market. Herbal remedies were chosen collectively as the focal point of health-related service development since it is well-known that indigenous methods of treatment using Indonesian natural ingredients are employed commonly. The service has been developed to run on an Android-based smartphone, which connects to the database called Indonesian HerbalDB. It consists of two main features: queries (searches) regarding herbal remedies and a self-evaluation. Users of the service may search the names of traditional Indonesian plants, their local names, and the kinds of diseases that can be treated by using them. Through self-evaluations, users are encouraged to describe their personal perceptions of certain herbal remedies and recommend them to other users.

Data is vital in assessing the severity of a crisis, informing organizations on how to prepare or give aid, and informing the community about an event. Mobile phones in general, and smartphones in particular, are an ideal tool for the collectionof this valuable data. The development effort required to create smartphone applications is usually substantial. There are technical barriers to entry, and usually lengthy development times.

Similarly, a post-surgical patient may be discharged from a medical facility to their house, which electronically facilitates their recuperation and promotes recovery. Smart environments are making the task of providing assistive technology in the home easier and more affordable. Near-field communication (NFC) has become popular in recent years. Increasing uptake of NFC-enabled smartphones has opened a new avenue to facilitate creation of a smart environment without the need for significant infrastructure. HTML5 is the latest version of the hypertext markup language, with unique code that enables access to advanced features on a smartphone. Proprietary apps can potentially be inconvenient and inconsistent and may even decrease uptake of the technology. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to enable NFC tags and NFC smartphones in conjunction with HTML5 backbone code, to be used for smart environments in home health care applications without the need for specific applications to be installed on the smartphone. Results show significant promise with just the built in phone software with use of NFC and HTML5 for various applications of smart environments. In many common tasks in a smart environment that increase patient safety, NFC tags can be not only informative, but an integral component of the system by triggering specific HTML5 code to provide appropriate responses-without the need to install specialized apps as long as the NFC is enabled in the mobile device. © 2015 IEEE.","Android; Home Monitoring; HTML5; Mobile Monitoring; NFC; RFID","Application programs; Codes (symbols); Health care; HTML; Hypertext systems; Markup languages; Mobile devices; Near field communication; Patient rehabilitation; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android; Home monitoring; HTML5; Mobile monitoring; NFC; Home health care",2-s2.0-84939524524

Based on this, we argue that there exists a critical need for a tool that allows a user to (a) identify apps that are energy hungry, and (b) understand why an app is consuming energy, on her phone. Towards addressing this need, we present TIDE, a tool to detect high energy apps on any particular smartphone. TIDE's key characteristic is that it accounts for usage-centric information while identifying energy hungry apps from among a multitude of apps that run simultaneously on a user's phone. Our evaluation of TIDE on a testbed of Android-based smartphones, using weeklong smartphone usage traces from 17 real users, shows that TIDE correctly identifies over 94% of energy-hungry apps and has a false positive rate of < 6%. © 2015 IEEE.","energy management; smartphones; user-centric","Electric batteries; Energy management; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Telephone sets; Battery consumption; False positive rates; Key characteristics; Measurement study; Usage patterns; User-centric; Distributed computer systems",2-s2.0-84944326850

The booming mobile phone sector and the popular use of text messages have provided an opportunity to assess the impact of real-time communication systems in HWC mitigation strategies. Preliminary tests were conducted in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with FrontlineSMS, a mobile data collection system. The overall system can be improved by using an Android application such as KoBoCollect on a smartphone enabling easier recording of georeferenced data.

The measurement scenario is defined based on the link between master-station at car dashboard to all possible sensor positions.

The measurement results show that the RSSI receptions from all sensor nodes are higher than the used receiver-sensitivity threshold. Therefore, the implementation of Bluetooth is feasible. However, in the real application, the sensitivity of the implemented Bluetooth module should be carefully considered because the signal reception has possibility to drop below typical threshold in the Bluetooth standard.

The Kalman filter is applied for the integration of two different positioning approaches. In practice, received signal strength (RSS) significantly varies by not only environmental changes, but also device types and device orientations. Due to the RSS variation problem, the radio map constructed in the offline phase of the fingerprinting positioning becomes outdated or inaccurate. The outdated radio map leads to unreliable fingerprinting positioning results, and the errors are contained in the tracking results. A RSS transformation method is proposed which scales the online RSS according to the difference from the offline RSS to obtain more reliable fingerprinting positioning results with the outdated radio map. The proposed algorithm is implemented into an Android-based smartphone and evaluated in a real environment. Through the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed algorithm enables higher accuracy than the Kalman filter-based location tracking algorithm without the RSS transformation. © 2014 IEEE.","fingerprinting; fusion positioning; Kalman filter; PDR; RSS","Algorithms; Balloons; Kalman filters; Location; Mobile computing; RSS; Tracking (position); Environmental change; fingerprinting; Indoor location tracking; Location tracking algorithms; PDR; Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR); Received signal strength; Transformation methods; Palmprint recognition",2-s2.0-84940471251

These devices usually host selected content, personal information and useful applications for their users, apart from continuously gathering their context data and preferences. Taking this fact as starting point, this paper describes PERSEO, a system that implements a mobile-instrumented interaction concept to personalize the smart space by using a network of presence sensors and media objects. PERSEO is device-centric and relies on physical interaction. This means that on touch, grasp or proximity with any of the trigger objects in the presence network (e.g. NFC or Bluetooth enabled devices), the smartphone seamlessly transfers contents or application control to the available (media) objects, in order to improve the user experience. The transfer actions are governed by an event-condition-action logic that may be customized by the user in the smartphone. Actions depend on the identification of the foreground applications running in the smartphone hosting PERSEO's logic. To enable the interaction concept, it has been necessary to design and implement a custom Digital Media Controller based on REST interfaces compatible with DLNA standard for media streaming. The paper explains the interaction flows and details the architecture components through an Android-based mobile prototype working in a smart living room.

But how can platform providers encourage desirable behaviours by complementors (i.e., application developers) in the absence of formal roles and hierarchical control structures? Although previous studies of software-based platforms have identified openness as critical instrument at the macro (i.e., platform) level and have provided initial attempts to measure the construct, no research has been dedicated to comprehensively conceptualize and operationalize platform openness at the micro level from the perspective of application developers. To go beyond these preliminary findings and to theorize about the nature and effects of platform openness as perceived by application developers, we develop a construct called perceived platform openness (PPO). Drawing on recently advanced scale development methodologies, we conceptualize PPO as a multidimensional construct and empirically validate it with important consequent variables linked to developers' continuous platform contributions. Empirical evidence from several rounds of qualitative and quantitative steps supports the conceptual validity of the construct and empirical relevance of the scale across different smartphone platform contexts (i.e., Apple iOS and Google Android). Researchers will benefit from the study's systematic and comprehensive conceptualization of PPO, how it is measured, and how it relates to critical application developer beliefs and attitudes.

We propose an Android application that integrates Pedestrian Dead Reckoning and Computer Vision algorithms, using an off-the-shelf Smartphone connected to a Smartwatch. The detection, recognition and pose estimation of specific objects or features in the scene derive an estimate of user location with sub-meter accuracy when combined with a hardware-sensor pedometer. The proposed prototype interfaces with a user by means of Augmented Reality, exploring a variety of sensorial modalities other than just visual overlay, namely audio and haptic modalities, to create a seamless immersive user experience. The interface and interaction of the preliminary platform have been studied through specific evaluation methods.

It is very critical task to identify new sites using traditional way for dumping of solid waste. A rule based identification of new site can be done using a Remote Sensing and GIS, which can save time and increase accuracy. For that purpose a required data was collected from the Survey of India and NRSC Hyderabad. A Spatial feature extraction was done using for Reserved Forest area, Water bodies, Canals, drainage Network, Road and Railway Network. Rasterization processes were applied on Toposheet to extract Settlement area. For every spatial feature a Buffer Zone was created as per guideline given by the Ministry of Environment, GOI. After this process a one by one Overlay Analysis was performed. Seven sites which follow the guidelines and having more than 100 Acres area were selected for Field visit. In Field visit Geographic coordinates were taken using GPS enabled Smartphone with 'My GPS Coordinates' android application having accuracy of 4 meter and verified these sites on Google Earth also.

This paper explores some of the real-time constraints on the data-flow and control of a wireless connected ultrasound machine. The paper will define an ultrasound server and the capabilities necessary for real-time use of the device. The concept of an ultrasound server wirelessly (or over any network) connected to multiple lightweight clients on devices like an iPad, iPhone, or Android-based tablet, smartphone and other network-attached displays (i.e., Google Glass) is explored. Latency in the ultrasound data stream is one of the key areas to measure and to focus on keeping as small as possible (<30ms) so that the ultrasound operator can see what is at the probe at that moment, instead of where the probe was a short period earlier. By keeping the latency less than 30ms, the operator will feel like the data he sees on the wireless connected devices is running in real-time with the operator. The second parameter is the management of bandwidth. At minimum we need to be able to see 20 frames-per- second. It is possible to achieve ultrasound in triplex mode at >20 frames-per-second on a properly configured wireless network. The ultrasound server needs to be designed to accept multiple ultrasound data clients and multiple control clients. A description of the server and some of its key features will be described. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

When driver is in this state he can cause accidents because his reaction time is slower, his attentiveness is reduced, and his information processing is less efficient. Driver Fatigue Detection System (called FDS) has been proposed by the authors in a recent work. The FDS aims to monitor the driver and the alertness to prevent them from falling asleep at the wheel. In the present paper, the FDS software is modified to be run in smartphone instead of Laptop which is very hard to fixed in a car and use all advantages of smartphone like camera and late weight. The proposed system will solve this problem by using a mobile phone camera; the phone will be put on a stand in the car to make the driver feels comfortable. The proposed system has hardware and software components such as mobile camera and Android SDK. Both components are integrated together to record real video for the driver, and then processing it for real-time eye tracking. This system has reserve all advantages in FDS like fast and real-time face and eye tracking, external illumination interference is limited, more robustness and accuracy allowance for fast head/face movement. The Main goals of this system are to ensure that the driver is staying awake during his drive, make the driver feels comfortable and to help decrease the number of accidents. © 2015 The Authors.

In addition, a large number of motor vehicle traffic accidents are reported annually, of which it is estimated that a quarter involve the illegal use of a hand-held mobile device by the driver. Establishing whether mobile phone usage was a causal factor for an accident involves carrying out a forensic analysis of a mobile handset to ascertain a timeline of activity on the device, focussing on whether the handset was used immediately prior to, or during, an incident. Previously, this involved identifying whether SMS messages have been sent or received on the handset alongside an examination of the call logs. However, with advancements in smartphone and application design, there are now a number of ways a driver can interact with their mobile device resulting in less obvious forms of evidence which can be termed as 'passive activity'.

Designed to store rarely-changed files on both interactive devices with limited storage (such as smartphones) and non-interactive devices with large amounts of storage (such as storage appliances), PocketLocker differs from previous systems in not requiring that each device be able to store all available content or be configured to only view certain files. Instead, a storage orchestrator running as a cloud service distributes erasure-coded file chunks across all available devices to maximize performance and capacity and minimize energy usage at battery-powered clients while meeting configurable backup requirements. Unlike current cloud storage options, PocketLocker is free and will scale as users add devices. We motivate PocketLocker's design by analyzing two months of file access traces taken from 100 smartphones, and evaluate its performance using trace-based simulations to explore design parameters and measurements of a prototype Android implementation to establish real-world performance. By locating content close to where it will be accessed by mobile devices, PocketLocker provides low-latency access to large amounts of content.

The Learning Enhanced Watershed Assessment System (LEWAS) is a real-time watershed monitoring lab that seeks to address these complexwater related challenges by improving water-related education at the community college and four year university levels. The Online Watershed Learning System (OWLS), the data sharing and visualization component of the LEWAS, is an environmental exploration tool that gives users access to historical and live LEWAS data, watershed-specific case studies, and virtual tours of the LEWAS watershed. By using an HTML5-driven web interface, the OWLS interactively delivers integrated live and/or historical remote system data (visual, environmental, geographical, etc.) to end users regardless of the hardware (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) and software (Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, etc.) platforms of their choice. We have built upon a prior study that used the expectancy-value theory of motivation to show that exposure to live watershed data via the LEWAS increased students' levels of motivation. A pilot test of the OWLS has demonstrated positive learning gains in engineering seniors and was overwhelmingly viewed by students as having helped them learn hydrology concepts. The pilot test also revealed the strengths of the OWLS to be anywhere, anytime access to live system data and interactive graphical representations of the data. Using the framework of situated learning, the current research implements the OWLS as a remote lab for both freshmen community college students in general engineering courses as well as senior university students in a hydrology course. We seek to determine: (i) how the OWLS influences student learning with respect to course learning objectives, and (ii) how the use of OWLS in engineering courses impacts motivation in students. The assessment follows an experimental design with pre- and post-test questions that include both Likert-style motivation questions and concept inventory-style cognitive learning questions that have been developed by content experts for each course level and are scaled using Bloom's Revised Cognitive Taxonomy.

This study (the Simplified Cardiovascular Management Study [SimCard]) aims to develop and evaluate a simplified cardiovascular management program delivered by community health workers with the aid of a smartphone-based electronic decision support system. Methods and Results - The SimCard study was a yearlong cluster-randomized, controlled trial conducted in 47 villages (27 in China and 20 in India). Recruited for the study were 2086 individuals with high cardiovascular risk (aged ≥40 years with self-reported history of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and/or measured systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg). Participants in the intervention villages were managed by community health workers through an Android-powered app on a monthly basis focusing on 2 medication use and 2 lifestyle modifications. In comparison with the control group, the intervention group had a 25.5% (P<0.001) higher net increase in the primary outcome of the proportion of patient-reported antihypertensive medication use pre- and post-intervention. There were also significant differences in certain secondary outcomes: aspirin use (net difference: 17.1%; P<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (-2.7 mm Hg; P=0.04). However, no significant changes were observed in the lifestyle factors. The intervention was culturally tailored, and country-specific results revealed important differences between the regions.

Our intent is to share the applications' development and improvement process in the hopes that other innovators can benefit from the lessons learned through our experience. The AIChE Concept Warehouse was developed with the intent of fostering a community of learning within chemical engineering. The Concept Warehouse is a web-enabled database infrastructure that is designed to promote concept-based instruction through the use of concept questions. These concept questions are used in core curriculum courses like Material/Energy Balances, Thermodynamics, Transport Phenomena, Kinetics and Reactor Design, and Materials Science. Availability of high quality concept questions can lower the barrier for faculty to use concept-based instruction and assessment. This software allows the instructor to engage students and evaluate student learning in real-time. The instructor is then able to adjust the pace of lecture in response to student understanding. The Concept Warehouse also allows for reflective assessments such as ""the muddiest point."" The student mobile application was developed to make it easier for students to submit answers and written explanations to these assessments using mobile devices. Originally, students could submit their answers to conceptual questions using clickers, mobile browsers on smartphones, and laptops. Input via smartphones, however, proved cumbersome because it depended on the quality of the student's mobile browser and utilized the full-size webpage interface. The improved mobile student interface facilitates participation by making responses via smartphone more user-friendly. After the development of the application, we conducted initial usability tests with students who had previously used the web-based options for answer submission. In order to gauge usability, we collected usage statistics from student responses to a usability survey. Survey responses were used to identify student likes and dislikes as well as to compare different available options for answer submission.

Products and technologies are only great if they support and assist healthy habits by either improving our routine or creating greater satisfaction in the reward. And those who create new technology that offer this support become the businesses and individuals often marked as pioneers and innovators. Consider the advent of the iPhone in 2008. It certainly wasn't the first smartphone, but it became a memorable mark in the advancement of technology because it provided a new platform with which to access information and help manage the most important resource of all - life! The cue for this device was the App Store, which offered habitcraving apps like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, SoundCloud, Google Maps, Skype, and more. Apps like this have changed our behavior. We download them, use them for things like Instagram and Facebook, and feed them our data. Steve Jobs and his team got it right. The magic wasn't in the device itself, it was in the access to content that the device could offer - namely, greater interoperability. It's estimated that there will be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet by the year 2020. That's only five years from now. The apps that we've grown fond of for the iPhone, Android, and Windows phone will become secondary to the interoperability afforded by the devices that are now emerging. In this paper, we will explore just how the IoT is quickly becoming an instrument for interoperability to gather and distribute new content. Contrary to the iTunes Store and App Store, where data is pulled down to the consumer, IoT will allow people, machines, and other operational resources to serve and provide content to be pushed up and delivered to other ""federates."" We will also explore how modeling and simulation (M&S) might play a key role in the ""Interoperability of Things,"" and what new habits might emerge. We will examine what standards exist, and what new standards might be needed for the countless ""resources"" that represent live, virtual, or constructive federates, whether they are executed on a laptop or reflected in an autonomous or living resource like you or me. © Copyright 2015, SISO, Inc.","Agents; Cloud; Internet of Things; Interoperability; M&S; Technology","Agents; Clouds; Information management; Internet; Interoperability; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Technology; Websites; App stores; Facebook; Google maps; Internet of thing (IOT); Model and simulation; Steve Jobs; Windows phones; YouTube; Internet of things",2-s2.0-84964078882

However, offering real-time transit services has been challenging for many transit agencies. While mobile applications (apps) have emerged as a preferred dissemination method for real-time information, it is typically cost-prohibitive for transit agencies to fund custom development of native mobile apps for all popular smartphone platforms. Third-party developers can offer services if an agency openly shares real-time data, but these individuals are volunteers whose priorities and deadlines may not be the same as the agency’s. As a result, few cities have full app portfolios that cover all smartphone platforms. This paper presents the OneBusAway multi-region project, a collaborative effort that is enabling the rapid expansion of native mobile transit apps to new cities. OneBusAway is an open-source transit information system that has provided real-time transit services to the Puget Sound (Washington) area since 2008. The new OneBusAway multi-region feature expands the coverage of the existing Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, and Windows 8 apps for OneBusAway to new cities, including Tampa and Atlanta. The multi-region system architecture, collaborative design and development process, and lessons learned from this ground-breaking project are discussed. The fundamental shift from proprietary to open-source software in the transit industry that has made this type of project possible also is examined. © 2014, University of South Florida.

The algorithm uses three image processing methods: edge detection, line detection, and corner detection. The algorithm targets medium- to high-end mobile devices with single or quad-core ARM systems. Since cameras on these devices capture several frames per second, the algorithm is designed to minimize false positives rather than maximize true ones, because, at such frequent frame capture rates, it is far more important for the overall performance to minimize the processing time per frame. The algorithm is implemented on the Google Nexus 7 Android 4.3 smartphone. Evaluation was done on 378 frames, of which 266 contained NLs and 112 did not.

These novel mobile phone applications rely on advanced sensor information processes, which mainly involve raw data acquisition, feature extraction, data interpretation and transmission. However, the continuous accessing of sensing resources to acquire sensor data in smartphones is still very expensive in terms of energy, particularly due to the periodic use of power-intensive sensors, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The key underlying idea to design energy-efficient schemes is to control the duty cycle of the GPS receiver. However, adapting the sensing rate based on dynamic context changes through a flexible middleware has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel modular middleware architecture and runtime environment to directly interface with application programming interfaces (APIs) and embedded sensors in order to manage the duty cycle process based on energy and context aspects. The proposed solution has been implemented in the Android software stack. It allows continuous location tracking in a timely manner and in a transparent way to the user. It also enables the deployment of sensing policies to appropriately control the sampling rate based on both energy and perceived context. We validate the proposed solution taking into account a reference location-based service (LBS) architecture. A cloud-based storage service along with online mobility analysis tools have been used to store and access sensed data.

Design: The investigation comprised three studies. Study 1 evaluated calibration accuracy across four Samsung S5301 smartphones (Android v4.0.4) using commercial Sennheiser HD202 headphones. Study 2 involved referencing smartphone microphone sensitivity to narrowband noise intensity as measured in octave bands by a sound-level meter between 30 and 75 dB SPL (5 dB increments). Study 3 compared screening outcomes of smartphone based and conventional hearing screening. Study sample: Study 2: 15 normal-hearing subjects (age range, 18-22 years; all female). Study 3: 162 children (324 ears) aged 5 to 7 years. Results: Smartphone calibration at 20, 30, and 40 dB was within 1 dB of recommended reference equivalent thresholds levels. Microphone calibration for noise monitoring had maximum variability across phones of 0.9, 0.6, and 2.9 dB at 1, 2, and 4 kHz, respectively, from reference intensities (30 to 75 dB SPL). Screening outcomes demonstrated no signifi cant difference between smartphone and conventional audiometry with an overall referral rate of 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively.

This is increasingly becoming a concern due to the fact that smartphone applications are progressively becoming complex and energy-intensive, whereas the battery technology is unable to keep up. Existing studies have proposed a number of testing and re-factoring techniques that can be used to increase the energy-efficiency of such applications, after the development has been completed. However, we feel that maximum level of energy-efficiency can be achieved only if energy-efficient design practices are used in the software development process.

Despite the fact that Android supports writing concurrent code via AsyncTask, we know little about how developers use AsyncTask to improve responsiveness. To understand how AsyncTask is used/underused/misused in practice, we first conduct a formative study using a corpus of top 104 most popular open-source Android apps comprising 1.34M SLOC. Our study shows that even though half of the apps use AsyncTask, there are hundreds of places where they missed opportunities to encapsulate long-running operations in AsyncTask. Second, 46% of the usages are manually refactored. However, the refactored code contains concurrency bugs (such as data races) and performance bugs (concurrent code still executes sequentially). Inspired by these findings, we designed, developed, and evaluated Asynchronizer, an automated refactoring tool that enables developers to extract long-running operations into AsyncTask. Asynchronizer uses a points- to static analysis to determine the safety of the transformation. Our empirical evaluation shows that Asynchronizer is (i) highly applicable, (ii) accurate, (iii) safer than manual refactoring (iv) it saves development effort, (v) its results have been accepted by the open-source developers. This shows that Asynchronizer is useful.

This has lead to a widespread availability of smartphone applications. Since smartphones operate on a limited amount of battery power, it is important to develop tools and techniques that aid in energy-efficient application development. Energy inefficiencies in smartphone applications can broadly be categorized into energy hotspots and energy bugs. An energy hotspot can be described as a scenario where executing an application causes the smartphone to consume abnormally high amount of battery power, even though the utilization of its hardware resources is low. In contrast, an energy bug can be described as a scenario where a malfunctioning application prevents the smartphone from becoming idle, even after it has completed execution and there is no user activity. In this paper, we present an automated test generation framework that detects energy hotspots/bugs in Android applications. Our framework systematically generates test inputs that are likely to capture energy hotspots/bugs. Each test input captures a sequence of user interactions (e.g. touches or taps on the smartphone screen) that leads to an energy hotspot/bug in the application. Evaluation with 30 freely-available Android applications from Google Play/F-Droid shows the efficacy of our framework in finding hotspots/bugs. Manual validation of the experimental results shows that our framework reports reasonably low number of false positives. Finally, we show the usage of the generated results by improving the energy-efficiency of some Android applications.

An “Artificial Pancreas” (AP) is a closed-loop control system that uses a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pump and an internal algorithm to automatically manage insulin infusion to keep the subject’s blood glucose within a desired range.

We describe our findings from a smartphone-based study, in which an Android-based application we developed called CalFit was used to collect information related to young adults' dietary behaviors. In addition to monitoring dietary patterns, we were interested in understanding contextual factors related to when and where an individual eats, as well as how their dietary intake relates to physical activity (which creates energy demand) and psychosocial stress. 12 participants were asked to use CalFit to record videos of their meals over two 1-week periods, which were translated into nutrient intake by trained dietitians. During this same period, triaxial accelerometry was used to assess each subject's energy expenditure, and GPS was used to record time-location patterns. Ecological momentary assessment was also used to prompt subjects to respond to questions on their phone about their psychological state. The GPS data were processed through a web service we developed called Foodscoremap that is based on the Google Places API to characterize food environments that subjects were exposed to, which may explain and influence dietary patterns. Furthermore, we describe a modeling framework that incorporates all of these information to dynamically infer behavioral patterns that may be used for future intervention studies. © 2014 IEEE.",,,2-s2.0-84929485964

The adoption of automatic fall detection mechanisms can noticeably reduce the response time of the medical staff or caregivers when a fall takes place. Smartphones are being increasingly proposed as wearable, cost-effective and not-intrusive systems for fall detection. The exploitation of smartphones’ potential (and in particular, the Android Operating System) can benefit from the wide implantation, the growing computational capabilities and the diversity of communication interfaces and embedded sensors of these personal devices. After revising the state-of-the-art on this matter, this study develops an experimental testbed to assess the performance of different fall detection algorithms that ground their decisions on the analysis of the inertial data registered by the accelerometer of the smartphone. Results obtained in a real testbed with diverse individuals indicate that the accuracy of the accelerometry-based techniques to identify the falls depends strongly on the fall pattern. The performed tests also show the difficulty to set detection acceleration thresholds that allow achieving a good trade-off between false negatives (falls that remain unnoticed) and false positives (conventional movements that are erroneously classified as falls). In any case, the study of the evolution of the battery drain reveals that the extra power consumption introduced by the Android monitoring applications cannot be neglected when evaluating the autonomy and even the viability of fall detection systems. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Accelerometer; Android; eHealth; Fall detection; Smartphone","Accelerometers; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Testbeds; Acceleration threshold; Android; Android operating systems; Communication interface; Computational capability; Ehealth; Fall detection; Monitoring applications; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84908519662

This paper presents the results of several vehicle tracking tests comparing smartphone speeds to benchmark values obtained for three types of routes. Benchmark values were obtained using a high frequency calibrated V-Box mounted on the test vehicle with four Android OS smartphone units.A relationship is established linking error in smartphone instantaneous speeds to the corresponding signal Circular Error Probable (CEP) range for different road and traffic conditions. This relationship is used to provide speed adjustment factors for the smartphone probe estimates subject to varying satellite signal strength. The CEP test is a reported GPS unit indicator of precision based on a known ground control benchmark.Smartphone speeds (adjusted and unadjusted) are compared to aggregate speed profiles from a stationary radar detector placed at a given location along SS106 in southern Italy. The smartphone devices were found to replicate closely the observed speed profiles obtained from the fixed detector station. Simple t-tests suggest that the means of the smartphone speeds for the unadjusted case differed significantly from the means obtained from the radar detector, when the smartphone estimates were adjusted for uncertainty (CEP range related), however, the difference in mean speeds between the smartphone probes and the radar detector profile was not found to be statistically significant. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Analysis of speed and location error; GPS smartphone traffic probes; Speed estimates","Errors; Global positioning system; Probes; Radar; Radar equipment; Roads and streets; Rock mechanics; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Space-based radar; Tracking (position); Traffic signals; Uncertainty analysis; Vehicles; Circular error probable; Detector stations; Dynamic characteristics; High frequency HF; Instantaneous speed; Location errors; Satellite signals; Traffic conditions; Speed; GPS; mobile communication; radar; road transport; satellite; tracking; traffic congestion; transport vehicle; uncertainty analysis; Italy",2-s2.0-84908378028

Firstly, fractures were measured along several scanlines using a traditional compass and a modern application on an Android smartphone. Overall, the smartphone measurements reflect the same orientation as traditional compass measurements but generate in the same time a much higher number of data. Secondly, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was used to measure and visualise the topographic relief of the quarry walls down to centimetre resolution for close-up digital analysis of fractures. With this method, we were able to identify the same fracture groups as identified in the manually measured scanlines. All measurements indicate two dominant NE‒SW and NW‒SE striking fracture sets, regardless of the technique. An additional W‒E striking set is indicated immediately in the footwall of the Sandgewand Fault. Furthermore, fault-related fracturing is indicated by an increase of fracture densities towards the Sandgewand Fault. In addition to the fractures, minor NW‒SE striking faults were also observed in the Hastenrath quarry, some with tens of metres of displacement. Locally horizontal slickensides overprint earlier down-slip movement. Based on dextral slickensides on these fault surfaces oriented parallel to the large Sandgewand Fault, we assume that the latter also had a late dextral strike-slip motion component. Based on the results presented in this paper, we conclude that smartphone measurements of fractures and terrestrial laser scanning are appropriate tools to analyse fracture networks in reservoir analogues in a rapid and accurate way. © 2014 E.

The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study screened 101,168 North American participants for serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation, and C282Y genotyping for the HFE gene.METHODS: Logistic regression involving a subsample of Caucasians (n=44,809) was used to predict individual probabilities of HFE C282Y homozygosity using serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values. Men (n=17,323) and women (n=27,486) were analyzed separately. Regression equations were evaluated using area under the curve from ROC analysis and variance explained by Nagelkerke's pseudo R-squared. An Android smartphone App and website application were developed to provide physicians with easy access to predicting C282Y homozygosity of the HFE gene.RESULTS: The logistic equation had an area under the ROC curve of 0.91 for men and 0.89 for women. The pseudo R-squared was 0.44 for men and 0.34 for women. An example analysis was a Caucasian man with a transferrin saturation of 50% and a ferritin level of 500 μg/L, who had a 1.3% (95% CI 1.1% to 8.8%) probability of being a C282Y homozygote.CONCLUSIONS: A large primary care-based sample of 44,809 participants contributed to the development of a new computer/smartphone tool that predicts the probability of being a C282Y homozygote of the HFE gene from serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values. © 2014 Pulsus Group Inc.

Locating these problems is labor-intensive and automated diagnosis is highly desirable. However, a key challenge is the lack of a decidable criterion that facilitates automated judgment of such energy problems. Our work aims to address this challenge. We conducted an in-depth study of 173 open-source and 229 commercial Android applications, and observed two common causes of energy problems: missing deactivation of sensors or wake locks, and cost-ineffective use of sensory data. With these findings, we propose an automated approach to diagnosing energy problems in Android applications. Our approach explores an application's state space by systematically executing the application using Java PathFinder (JPF). It monitors sensor and wake lock operations to detect missing deactivation of sensors and wake locks. It also tracks the transformation and usage of sensory data and judges whether they are effectively utilized by the application using our state-sensitive data utilization metric. In this way, our approach can generate detailed reports with actionable information to assist developers in validating detected energy problems. We built our approach as a tool, GreenDroid, on top of JPF. Technically, we addressed the challenges of generating user interaction events and scheduling event handlers in extending JPF for analyzing Android applications. We evaluated GreenDroid using 13 real-world popular Android applications. GreenDroid completed energy efficiency diagnosis for these applications in a few minutes. It successfully located real energy problems in these applications, and additionally found new unreported energy problems that were later confirmed by developers. © 2014 IEEE.","Automated diagnosis; Energy inefficiency; Green computing; Sensory data utilization; Smartphone application","Automation; Energy efficiency; Human computer interaction; Java programming language; Locks (fasteners); Metadata; Open source software; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Wakes; Automated diagnosis; Energy inefficiency; Green computing; Sensory data; Smart-phone applications; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84922962966

In this context, there is a need for a diverse community of app users, medical researchers, and app developers to better understand the app landscape. Methods. In mid-2012, we undertook an environmental scan and classification of the medical app landscape in the two dominant platforms by searching the medical category of the Apple iTunes and Google Play app download sites. We identified target audiences, functions, costs and content themes using app descriptions and captured these data in a database. We only included apps released or updated between October 1, 2011 and May 31, 2012, with a primary ""medical"" app store categorization, in English, that contained health or medical content. Our sample of Android apps was limited to the most popular apps in the medical category. Results: Our final sample of Apple iOS (n = 4561) and Android (n = 293) apps illustrate a diverse medical app landscape. The proportion of Apple iOS apps for the public (35%) and for physicians (36%) is similar. Few Apple iOS apps specifically target nurses (3%). Within the Android apps, those targeting the public dominated in our sample (51%). The distribution of app functions is similar in both platforms with reference being the most common function. Most app functions and content themes vary considerably by target audience. Social media apps are more common for patients and the public, while conference apps target physicians. Conclusions: We characterized existing medical apps and illustrated their diversity in terms of target audience, main functions, cost and healthcare topic. The resulting app database is a resource for app users, app developers and health informatics researchers. © 2014 Seabrook et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","App; Application; Handheld computer; Mobile health; Smartphone; Software","computer language; data base; mobile application; Database Management Systems; Mobile Applications; Programming Languages",2-s2.0-84906922268

Here, we demonstrate the adaptation of a smartphone's camera to function as a compact lensless microscope. Unlike other chip-scale microscopy schemes, this method uses ambient illumination as its light source and does not require the incorporation of a dedicated light source. The method is based on the shadow imaging technique where the sample is placed on the surface of the image sensor, which captures direct shadow images under illumination. To improve the image resolution beyond the pixel size, we perform pixel super-resolution reconstruction with multiple images at different angles of illumination, which are captured while the user is manually tilting the device around any ambient light source, such as the sun or a lamp. The lensless imaging scheme allows for sub-micron resolution imaging over an ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV). Image acquisition and reconstruction are performed on the device using a custom-built Android application, constructing a stand-alone imaging device for field applications.

Through extensive measurements, we have validated the existence of such service quality difference. Then, through peer to peer interfaces such as WiFi direct, a mobile device (node) with low service quality can offload its data traffic to nodes with better service quality, to save energy and reduce delay. To achieve this goal, we propose a Quality-Aware Traffic Offloading (QATO) framework to offload network tasks to neighboring nodes with better service quality. QATO can identify neighbors with better service quality and provide incentive mechanisms to motivate nodes to help each other. To validate our design, we have implemented QATO on Android platform and have developed a web browser and a photo uploader on top of it. Experimental results show that QATO can significantly reduce energy and delay for both data downloading and uploading.

Due to the limitations of communication bandwidth, storage and processing capability, it is a challenge to transfer the huge amount of crowdsourced photos. To address this problem, we propose a framework, called SmartPhoto, to quantify the quality (utility) of crowd-sourced photos based on the accessible geographical and geo-metrical information (called metadata) including the smart-phone's orientation, position and all related parameters of the built-in camera. From the metadata, we can infer where and how the photo is taken, and then only transmit the most useful photos. Three optimization problems regarding the tradeoffs between photo utility and resource constraints, namely the Max-Utility problem, the online Max-Utility problem and the Min-Selection problem, are studied. Efficient algorithms are proposed and their performance bounds are theoretically proved. We have implemented SmartPhoto in a testbed using Android based smart-phones, and proposed techniques to improve the accuracy of the collected metadata by reducing sensor reading errors and solving object occlusion issues.

The results of the data analysis suggest that mobile OS competition, mobile network standard competition, open source OS share (platform openness), and price influence the early diffusion of smartphones in OECD countries. However, in BRICS countries, open source OS share (platform openness) and price are the main factors of smartphone diffusion. As the smartphone market continues to grow, it seems that the effects of mobile platform competition and indirect network effects on smartphone diffusion may co-exist in global smartphone markets. In addition, the results of the data analysis suggest that a platform (standard)-neutral policy is important in the growth stage of smartphone markets. Also, analyses of influential factors on smartphone price reveal that the size of the installed base of subscribers and market entry of Android phones in global smartphone markets contribute to decreases in smartphone price in OECD and BRICS countries.

Subjects and Methods: Twelve subjects with type 1 diabetes (five men, seven women; weight, 68.9±3.1=kg; age, 38±3.3 years; glycated hemoglobin, 6.9±0.2%) participated in a randomized crossover clinical trial comparing CTR versus CTR+HR in two 26-h admissions, each including 30=min of mild exercise. The CTR algorithm was implemented in the DiAs portable artificial pancreas platform based on an Android® (Google, Mountainview, CA) smartphone. We assessed blood glucose (BG) decline during exercise, the Low BG Index (LBGI) (a measure of hypoglycemic risk), number of hypoglycemic episodes (BG <70=mg/dL) and overall glucose control (percentage time within the target range 70=mg/dL≤BG≤180=mg/dL). Results: Using HR to inform the CTR algorithm reduced significantly the BG decline during exercise (P=0.022), indicated marginally lower LBGI (P=0.3) and fewer hypoglycemic events during exercise (none vs. two events; P=0.16), and resulted in overall higher percentage time within the target range (81% vs. 75%; P=0.2). LBGI and average BG remained unchanged overall, during recovery, and overnight. Conclusions: HR-informed closed-loop control can be implemented in a portable artificial pancreas. Although closed loop has been shown to reduce hypoglycemia, adding HR signal may further limit the risk for hypoglycemia during and immediately after exercise. The most prominent effect of adding HR information is reduced BG decline during exercise, without deterioration of overall glycemic control. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",,"glucose; hemoglobin A1c; antidiabetic agent; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; adult; algorithm; article; artificial pancreas; blood glucose monitoring; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; deterioration; diabetic patient; exercise; female; glucose blood level; glycemic control; heart rate; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Low BG Index; male; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; risk reduction; adverse effects; comparative study; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; drug effects; exercise; feasibility study; hypoglycemia; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiologic monitoring; pilot study; treatment outcome; Adult; Algorithms; Blood Glucose; Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Exercise; Feasibility Studies; Female; Heart Rate; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pancreas, Artificial; Pilot Projects; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84905253286

Effective, simple, and generalisable interventions that will increase physical activity in populations are needed. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone application (app) to increase physical activity in primary care. Design and setting: An 8-week, open-label, randomised controlled trial in rural, primary care in the west of Ireland. Method: Android smartphone users >16 years of age were recruited. All participants were provided with similar physical activity goals and information on the benefits of exercise. The intervention group was provided with a smartphone app and detailed instructions on how to use it to achieve these goals. The primary outcome was change in physical activity, as measured by a daily step count between baseline and follow-up. Results: A total of 139 patients were referred by their primary care health professional or self-referred. In total, 37 (27%) were screened out and 12 (9%) declined to participate, leaving 90 (65%) patients who were randomised. Of these, 78 provided baseline data (intervention = 37; control = 41) and 77 provided outcome data (intervention?=?37; control = 40). The mean daily step count at baseline for intervention and control groups was 4365 and 5138 steps per day respectively. After adjusting, there was evidence of a significant treatment effect (P = 0.009); the difference in mean improvement in daily step count from week?1 to week 8 inclusive was 1029 (95% confidence interval 214 to 1843) steps per day, favouring the intervention.

A multitude of applications rely on location information to provide a wide range of services. Location information is, however, extremely sensitive and can be easily abused. In this paper, we introduce the first protocols for secure computation of distance and for proximity testing over a sphere. Our secure distance protocols allow two parties, Alice and Bob, to determine their mutual distance without disclosing any additional information about their location. Through our secure proximity testing protocols, Alice only learns if Bob is in close proximity, i.e., within some arbitrary distance. Our techniques rely on three different representations of Earth, which provide different trade-offs between accuracy and performance. We show, via experiments on a prototype implementation, that our protocols are practical on resource-constrained smartphone devices. Our distance computation protocols runs, in fact, in 54 to 78 ms on a commodity Android smartphone. Similarly, our proximity tests require between 1.2 s and 2.8 s on the same platform.

That is, attackers clone the code from legitimate Android applications, assemble it with malicious code or advertisements, and publish these ''purpose-added"" app clones on the same or other markets for benefits. Three inherent and unique characteristics make app clones difficult to detect by existing techniques: a billion opcode problem caused by cross-market publishing, gap between code clones and app clones, and prevalent Type 2 and Type 3 clones. Existing techniques achieve either accuracy or scalability, but not both. To achieve both goals, we use a geometry characteristic, called centroid, of dependency graphs to measure the similarity between methods (code fragments) in two apps. Then we synthesize the method-level similarities and draw a Y/N conclusion on app (core functionality) cloning.

However, many smartphone applications suffer from bugs that cause significant performance degradation, thereby losing their competitive edge. Unfortunately, people have little understanding of these performance bugs. They also lack effective techniques to fight with such bugs. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study of 70 real-world performance bugs collected from eight large-scale and popular Android applications. We studied the characteristics (e.g., bug types and how they manifested) of these bugs and identified their common patterns. These findings can support follow-up research on performance bug avoidance, testing, debugging and analysis for smartphone applications. To demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we implemented a static code analyzer, PerfChecker, to detect our identified performance bug patterns. We experimentally evaluated PerfChecker by applying it to 29 popular Android applications, which comprise 1.1 million lines of Java code. PerfChecker successfully detected 126 matching instances of our performance bug patterns. Among them, 68 were quickly confirmed by developers as previously-unknown issues that affect application performance, and 20 were fixed soon afterwards by following our optimization suggestions. © 2014 ACM.","Empirical study; performance bug; static analysis; testing","Java programming language; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software engineering; Static analysis; Testing; Android applications; Application performance; Empirical studies; Optimization suggestions; performance bug; Performance degradation; Real-world performance; Smart-phone applications; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84994099386

Currently, the Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers in smartphones primarily provide the location information for these services. Usually, GPS only works well if the smartphone has an unobstructed clear sky view. Besides GPS, smartphones support many additional communications systems such as GSM, UMTS, LTE, WiFi, Bluetooth, and NFC. These communications technologies complement GPS for location based services, especially in urban and indoor environments. Hence, companies like Apple or Google already exploit the identity of WiFi hotspots and cellular base stations for a fast, sometimes crude, first position fix. Besides that, regulatory bodies such as US Federal Communications Commission require operators of cellular communications networks to guarantee, for emergency calls, a service quality of the measured location (FCC 1999). Hence, there exists a strong market and regulation driven development of positioning with current and future wireless communications technologies. Personally, we started working on localization as early as 1997 with some early signal design studies on Galileo at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Then, positioning with wireless communications, in particular with cellular communications technologies complementing GPS and the future Galileo system, became our focus from 2005. As our backgrounds are in information and communication theory as well as signal processing, we were not familiar with the specific challenges and requirements of positioning and corresponding signal processing. For example, communications engineers often model the wireless channel by a tapped delay line starting with delay zero. However, they do not take into account the delay of the first arriving path. This path is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver. Thus, it is essential to determine the location of a mobile terminal. Hence, this book reflects our learning process on positioning with wireless communications. It also shows our work experience through several projects on positioning. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract In this paper, we propose a new education assistant system model using both smartphones and service robots for children's learning. Through the interaction between a smartphone and a robot, various use cases can be derived. For example, we can control the movement of the robot remotely, watch the status of the children using real-time streaming, or read the answer on the smartphone while only the question is displayed on the robot. Considering these facts, we present three use cases, namely 'remote control', 'streaming' and 'N-screen' for robot-based learning with smartphones. The proposed learning model is implemented in Android-based smartphones and a service robot using the OPRoS platform, and we show that the proposed model works well.1 © 2014 The Author(s).

In particular, sociologists are interested in the question if such pervasive access increases or decreases face-to-face interactions. Unlike triangulation which seeks to precisely define position, the question of face-to-face interaction reduces to one of proximity, i.e., are the individuals within a certain distance? Moreover, the problem of proximity estimation is complicated by the fact that the measurement must be quite precise (1-1.5 m) and can cover a wide variety of environments. Existing approaches such as GPS and Wi-Fi triangulation are insufficient to meet the requirements of accuracy and flexibility. In contrast, Bluetooth, which is commonly available on most smartphones, provides a compelling alternative for proximity estimation. In this paper, we demonstrate through experimental studies the efficacy of Bluetooth for this exact purpose. We propose a proximity estimation model to determine the distance based on the RSSI values of Bluetooth and light sensor data in different environments. We present several real world scenarios and explore Bluetooth proximity estimation on Android with respect to accuracy and power consumption. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Bluetooth; face-to-face proximity; proximity estimation model; RSSI; smartphone","Distance-based; Estimation models; Face-to-face interaction; face-to-face proximity; Light sensor; Pervasive access; Real-world scenario; RSSI; Estimation; Smartphones; Triangulation; Bluetooth",2-s2.0-84897907760

Mobile malware, a dominant threat for modern mobile devices, was almost non-existent before the official release of the Android platform in 2008. The rapid development of mobile platform apps and app markets coupled with the open nature of the Android platform triggered an explosive growth of specialized malware and subsequent search for effective defence mechanisms. In spite of considerable research efforts in this area, the majority of the proposed solutions have seen limited success, which has been attributed in the research community to the lack of proper datasets, lack of validation and other deficiencies of the experiments. We feel that many of these shortcomings are due to immaturity of the field and a lack of established and organized practice. To remedy the problem, we investigated the employed experimentation practices adopted by the smartphone security community through a review of 120 studies published during the period between 2008-2013.

If any unknown person gets the device they can miss use the data stored inside the mobile since there is no protection for the stored data. It is the major problem for smart phone users because of the limited security of the mobile. To address this problem, it introduced a new technique which is functional on Android platform. This paper propose an application named Private Data Mode (PDM) to illustrate the technique of securing the user data by using cloud services. Through the PDM application the user can store the data directly to the cloud and not necessary to store inside mobile storage. The application utilizes a multiple level security techniques to protect the data which starts with image pattern matching as first level authentication for cloud entry. The next level of security aspect is cloud authentication which decides the type of data to be secured. The user can manually create or select the storage data by this application and they can instantly store into the cloud.

It's been over 25 years since the GIF format was introduced, and we've since then made significant progress in video compression. By converting GIF to video formats, you not only gain the possibility of user interaction, but you also reduce its size significantly without any noticeable loss of quality. The paper will present a way to achieve this using FFmpeg, utilizing commands which has been specifically optimized for the purpose of GIF to HTML5 Video conversion. The average GIF will load ~8 times faster after it has been converted to video formats, and users who don't support HTML5 Video will have access to the original GIF. Converting GIF to video formats offer many benefits and little to no drawbacks (as long as the original GIF remains available). It is therefore in the best interest for both businesses and consumers to convert GIF to HTML5 Video, thus optimizing GIF for modern browsers. © 2014 IEEE.","Android; FFmpeg; FFprobe; GIF; GIF optimization; GIF to HTML5 Video; Graphics Interchange Format; IOS; Modern Browsers; MP4; Ogv; Smartphone; WebM","HTML; Android; FFmpeg; FFprobe; GIF; GIF to HTML5 Video; Interchange formats; IOS; Modern Browsers; MP4; Ogv; WebM; Video signal processing",2-s2.0-84946690674

Nowadays, Video Surveillance is integral to security of many locations such as banks, malls, shops, and even homes. The proposed Smart Video Surveillance system uses motion detection to detect the presence of any intruder(s) in the environment. The method used for motion detection is the Cauchy distribution model which compares the current frame in the continuous video sequence to the previous frame, which is taken as the reference frame. The idea is that, if the difference between the current frame and the reference frame exceeds a specific threshold function, a motion is detected and detected pixel is identified. A novel method which sends an alert to the user's android smartphone via Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) is used. A motion is detected when this difference exceeds the threshold value and the corresponding image is captured and stored while the user is notified with a GCM alert along with a custom sound. This image can be viewed and saved by the authorized user on the Android Smartphone. The performance of the proposed method is found to be better than the other existing systems as it enables the user to take immediate action to stop the crime while it is in progress. The registered user can alert police authorities if required. © 2014 IEEE.","Background subtraction; Cauchy distribution model; GCM alert; Motion detection","Android (operating system); Intrusion detection; Monitoring; Motion analysis; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Android smart phones; Android smartphone; Background subtraction; Cauchy distribution; GCM alert; Motion detection; Smart video surveillance systems; Threshold functions; Security systems",2-s2.0-84949924705

An attack of obtaining the root-level privilege in the Android operating system can be a serious threat to users because it can break down the whole system security. This paper proposes a new Android security framework that can meet the following three goals: (1) preventing privilege escalation attacks, (2) maintaining system integrity, and (3) protecting users' personal information. To achieve these goals, our proposed framework introduces three mechanisms: Root Privilege Protection (RPP), Resource Misuse Protection (RMP), and Private Data Protection (PDP). RPP keeps track of a list of trusted programs with root-level privileges and can detect and respond to malware that illegally tries to acquire root-level privileges by exploiting system-level vulnerabilities. RMP keeps track of a list of critical system resources and can protect system resources from illegal manipulation by malicious applications. PDP keeps personal information safe by enforcing strict access controls so that even privileged applications cannot access users' private data if the applications violate the least privilege rule. The framework is verified using experiments on the Android operating system, which shows that our framework achieved the goals with processing overheads of 25.33 % on average. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Android; Privacy protection; Privilege escalation attacks; Smartphone security; System integrity; Unified security framework","Android; Privacy protection; Privilege escalation attacks; Security frameworks; Smartphone securities; System integrity; Access control; Ubiquitous computing; Robots",2-s2.0-84896702808

This mobile diagnosis system uses an artificial Neural Network algorithm to analyze the retinal images captured by the microscopic lens to identify retinal disease conditions. The algorithm is first of all trained with infected and normal retinal images using a personal computer and then further developed into a mobile-based diagnosis application for Android environments. The application is optimized by using the rooted method in order to increase battery lifetime and processing capacity. A duty cycle method is also proposed to greatly improve the energy efficiency of this retinal scan and diagnosis system in Smartphone environments. The proposed mobile-based system is tested and verified using two well-known medical ophthalmology databases to demonstrate its merits and capabilities.

In this paper, backward walking is scheduled by interchange of angles and angular velocities and additional change of signs in angular velocities at all the via-points connecting cubic polynomial trajectories. Turning direction in walking is also implemented by activating the transversal hip joint initially located in the support leg in two stages. After validation of the proposed walking schemes with Matlab simulator, a smartphone application for the omnidirectional walking has been developed to control a humanoid robot platform named DARwIn-OP interconnected via Wi-Fi. Experiment result of the present wireless control of a humanoid robot with smartphone is successful, and the application will be released in application market near future. © ICROS 2014.","Android application; Biped walking; Direction turning; Humanoid robot; Wireless control",,2-s2.0-84894093873

While hundreds of smoking cessation apps are currently available in the app stores, there is no information about who uses them. Smartphones also offer potential as a research tool, but this has not previously been explored. Objective: This study aims to measure and compare the uptake of a smoking cessation app over one year in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It also assesses the feasibility of conducting research via an app, describing respondents' characteristics (demographics, smoking status, and other health related app use), and examining differences across countries. Methods: This is a cross-sectional exploratory study of adults 18 years and older, passively recruited over one year in 2012, who downloaded this study app (Quit Advisor) via the two largest app stores (Apple and Android). Results: The total number of app downloads after one year was 1751, 72.98% (1278/1751) of them were Apple operation system users. Of these 1751 participants, 47.68% (835/1751) were from the United States, 29.18% (511/1751) were from the United Kingdom, and 16.68% (292/1751) were from Australia. There were 602 participants, 36.75% (602/1638) that completed a questionnaire within the app. Of these 602 participants, 58.8% (354/602) were female and the mean age was 32 years. There were no significant differences between countries in terms of age, operation system used, number of quitting attempts, and language spoken at home. However, there were significant differences between countries in terms of gender and stage of change. There were 77.2% (465/602) of the respondents that were ready to quit in the next 30 days and the majority of these had never sought professional help (eg, ""Quitline""). More than half had downloaded smoking cessation apps in the past and of these, three-quarters had made quitting attempts (lasted at least 24 hours) using an app before. Respondents who had attempted to quit three times or more in the previous year were more likely to have tried smoking cessation apps (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.1-5.2). There were 50.2% (302/602) of the respondents that had used other health related apps before. Of these, 89.4% (270/302) were using health related apps at least once a week, but 77.5% (234/302) never checked the credibility of the health app publishers before downloading. Conclusions: A smartphone app was able to reach smokers across three countries that were not seeking professional help, but were ready to quit within the next 30 days. Respondents were relatively young and almost demographically similar across all three countries. They also frequently used other health related apps, mostly without checking the credibility of their publishers.","Apps; Global health; Handheld computers; Health Informatics; Health promotion; Prevention; Public health; Smartphone; Tobacco and smoking",,2-s2.0-84897625169

It would be very helpful to have an indoor localization system. Many researches in indoor localization can be found in the literature. However, they usually need to deploy sensors in the environment. It is costly and inconvenient. In this research, we propose to develop a smartphone indoor positioning application based on accelerometer and gyroscope data. The PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) method is used to build this application. Calibration points are marked both on the floor ground and on the map of the application. The user first finds a calibration mark, stand on it and face the right direction. He/she then place the android icon (representing the user) on top of the calibration point. When he/she starts to move, the android icon also moves on the map following the real-time estimates of step length and orientation change for each step from accelerometer and gyroscope data, respectively. Preliminary results in walking distance and orientation estimation show high accuracy. The application seems promising and useful as long as a map and calibration marks are built in advance. © 2014 IEEE.","ambient intelligence; indoor localization; Pedestrian Dead Reckoning; positioning; Smartphone applicaitons","Accelerometers; Android (operating system); Calibration; Gyroscopes; Navigation; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Ambient intelligence; Indoor localization; Indoor localization systems; Indoor positioning; Orientation changes; Orientation estimation; Pedestrian dead reckonings; positioning; Indoor positioning systems",2-s2.0-84946689190

However, these ad modules often collect users' personal information and device identification numbers along with usage statistics, which is a violation of privacy. In our analysis of 1,188 Android applications' network traffic, we identified 797 applications that included 45 previously known ad modules. We analyzed these ad modules' network behavior, and found that they have characteristic network traffic patterns for acquiring ad content, specifically images. In order to accurately differentiate between ad modules' network traffic and valid application network traffic, we propose a novel method based on the distance between network traffic graphs mapping the relationships between HTTP session data (such as HTML or Java Script). This distance describes the similarity between the sessions. Using this method, we can detect ad modules' traffic by comparing session graphs with the graphs of already known ad modules. In our evaluation, we generated 20,903 graphs of applications. We separated the application graphs into those generated by known ad modules (4,698 graphs), those we manually identified as ad modules (2,000 graphs), and standard application traffic. We then applied 1,000 graphs of known ad graphs to the other graph sets (the remaining 3,698 known ad graphs and the 2,000 manually classified ad graphs) to see how accurately they could be used to identify ad graphs. Our approach showed a 76% detection rate for known ad graphs, and a 96% detection rate for manually classified ad graphs. © 2014 IEEE.","Android; Network Security; Privacy; Smartphone","Android (operating system); Behavioral research; Data privacy; Graphic methods; Java programming language; Security of data; Android; Android applications; Application networks; Identification number; Network behaviors; Network traffic; Personal information; Usage statistics; Network security",2-s2.0-84988233617

However, despite ankle sprains being the single most common sports injury and despite an active approach by various Dutch organisations in implementing preventive measures, large-scale community uptake of these preventive measures, and thus actual prevention of ankle sprains, is lagging well behind. In an attempt to bridge this implementation gap, the Dutch Consumer Safety Institute VeiligheidNL developed a freely available interactive App ('Strenghten your ankle' translated in Dutch as: 'Versterk je enkel; available for iOS and Android) that contains - next to general advice on bracing and taping - a proven cost-effective neuromuscular program. The 'Strengthen your ankle' App has not been evaluated against the 'regular' prevention approach in which the neuromuscular program is advocated through written material. The aim of the current project is to evaluate the implementation value of the 'Strengthen your ankle' App as compared to the usual practice of providing injured athletes with written materials. In addition, as a secondary outcome measure, the cost-effectiveness will be assessed against usual practice. Methods/Design. The proposed study will be a randomised controlled trial. After stratification for medical caregiver, athletes will be randomised to two study groups. One group will receive a standardized eight-week proprioceptive training program that has proven to be cost-effective to prevent recurrent ankle injuries, consisting of a balance board (machU/ MSG Europe BVBA), and a traditional instructional booklet. The other group will receive the same exercise program and balance board. However, for this group the instructional booklet is exchanged by the interactive 'Strengthen your ankle' App. Discussion. This trial is the first randomized controlled trial to study the implementation effectiveness of an App for proprioceptive balance board training program in comparison to a traditional printed instruction booklet, with the recurrence of ankle sprains among athletes as study outcome. Results of this study could possibly lead to changes in practical guidelines on the treatment of ankle sprains and in the use of mobile applications for injury prevention.

In order to lower the complexity and the cost of the front-end as well as to reduce its power consumption, an effective method for the acquisition of external sensor signals through the Smartphone audio input is proposed in this paper. As a proof of concept, a sensor system composed by a photoplethysmographic sensor for cardiac signal monitoring and a pair of electrodes for tissue impedance estimation has been used. Specific software routines for Android operating system have been developed to process the acquired sensor signals providing visualization, data storage and simple data analysis, and thus demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2014 IEEE.","Android; external sensor acquisition; photoplethysmographic sensor; Smartphone; tissue impedance estimation","Application programs; Communication; Data visualization; Digital devices; Robots; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Tissue; Android; Android operating systems; Communication interface; External informations; External sensors; Photoplethysmographic; Software applications; Tissue impedances; Sensors",2-s2.0-84900000640

Banking and e-shopping portals, which are paramount of cyber-attacks, strongly recommend that both the merchant (i.e., a merchant web portal) and its customers (customers using these portals) be certain about each other's identity. This emphasizes not only that the merchant portal must be able to detect an attacker spoofing the identity of one of its customers, but also that a customer must not leave her secrets with a fraud-cum-look-alike website spoofing address of the merchant's portal.This thesis envisages a novel, scalable approach to detect a fraud, look-alike web page to help a customer unaware of digital certificates, Internet security policies and their glitches, truly recognize her merchant's web-site using her smartphone. The approach uses a reverse challenge-response framework; and uses QR codes which are generated dynamically and depend on the GPS parameters of the customer. The customer uses her smartphone to scan the QR codes with an application provided by the merchant; which detects correctly whether she logged on to the genuine website. The additional benefit of this approach is that it can be modelled to offer a novel, non-telephonic two-step authentication system with minor modifications. © 2014 SERSC.","Accelerometer and gyroscope; Android; GPS encryption; Personalized security; QR codes; Two-step authentication","Android; Android smartphone; Collaborative framework; Motion parameters; Personalized security; QR codes",2-s2.0-84907816589

In the evaluation we evaluated the degree to which these practices were able to save energy as compared to their unoptimized code counterparts. Our results provide useful guidance for mobile app developers. In particular, we found that bundling network packets up to a certain size and using certain coding practices for reading array length information, accessing class fields, and performing invocations all led to reduced energy consumption. However, other practices, such as limiting memory usage had a very minimal impact on energy usage. These results serve to inform the developer community about specific coding practices that can help lower the overall energy consumption and improve the usability of their applications.","Energy; Programming patterns","Android (operating system); Application programs; Codes (symbols); Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Mobile devices; Android smartphone; Empirical evaluations; Energy; Mobile applications; Performance enhancing; Programming patterns; Programming practices; Software developer; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-84942418456

Earlier studies demonstrated that a smartphone image sensor can detect UVA radiation and the responsivity can be calibrated to measured direct solar irradiance. This current research provides the data collection, calibration, processing, calculations and display all on a smartphone. A very strong coefficient of determination of 0.98 was achieved when the digital response was recalibrated and compared to the Microtops sun photometer direct UVA irradiance observations. The mean percentage discrepancy for derived direct solar irradiance was only 4% and 6% for observations at 380 and 340 nm, respectively, lessening with decreasing solar zenith angle. An 8% mean percent difference discrepancy was observed when comparing aerosol optical depth, also decreasing as solar zenith angle decreases. The results indicate that a specifically designed Android app linking and using a smartphone image sensor, calendar and clock, with additional external narrow bandpass and neutral density filters can be used as a field sensor to evaluate both direct solar UVA irradiance and low aerosol optical depths for areas with low aerosol loads.

Roughness also affects vehicle delay costs, fuel consumption, tires, and maintenance costs. Roughness is predominantly characterized by the international roughness index (IRI), which is often measured with inertial profilers. Inertial profilers are equipped with sensitive accelerometers, a height-measuring laser, and a distance-measuring instrument for measuring vehicle vertical acceleration data and the pavement profile. Modern smartphones are equipped with several sensors including a three-axis accelerometer, which was used in this project to collect vehicle acceleration data with an Android-based application. In the study, acceleration data were double integrated numerically to obtain a pavement profile, which was input info the software program ProVAL. The pavement roughness was then calculated. For the initial validation, pavement profile and acceleration data were collected with both an inertial profiler and the newly developed smartphone application from three test sites. The initial validation results suggest that the newly developed smartphone application can measure IRI with good correspondence to the inertial profiler and with good repeatability between measurement replications. However, calibration is needed for rougher pavement sections because the current analysis techniques do not directly account for acceleration damping resulting from vehicle suspension systems. With improvements in analysis that consider the vehicle suspension effects and additional validation, the approach could he used to reduce the cost of acquiring pavement roughness data for agencies and to reduce user costs for the traveling public by providing more robust feedback about route choice and Its effect on estimated vehicle maintenance cost and fuel efficiency.",,"Acceleration; Accelerometers; Amphibious vehicles; Android (operating system); Automobile suspensions; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Maintenance; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Suspensions (components); Vehicle suspensions; Vehicles; Distance measuring instruments; International roughness index; Smart-phone applications; Three axis accelerometers; Vehicle acceleration; Vehicle maintenance; Vehicle suspension systems; Vertical accelerations; Pavements",2-s2.0-84938526126

In this paper, we identify three library-centric threats in the real-world Android application markets: (i) the library modification threat, (ii) the masquerading threat and (iii) the aggressive library threat. These three threats cannot effectively be fully addressed by existing defense mechanisms such as software analysis, anti-virus software and anti-repackaging techniques. To mitigate these threats, we propose Duet, a library integrity verification tool for Android applications at application stores. This is non-trivial because the Android application build process merges library code and application-specific logic into a single binary file. Our approach uses reverse-engineering to achieve integrity verification. We implemented a full working prototype of Duet. In a dataset with 100,000 Android applications downloaded from Google Play between February 2012 and September 2013, we verify integrity of 15 libraries. On average, 80.50% of libraries can pass the integrity verification. In-depth analysis indicates that code insertion, obfuscation, and optimization on libraries by application developers are the primary reasons for not passing integrity verification. The evaluation results not only indicate that Duet is an effective tool to mitigate library-centric attacks, but also provide empirical insight into the library integrity situation in the wild. © 2014 ACM.","android; library integrity verification; library-centric security threat; smartphone; third-party library","Libraries; Wireless networks; android; Android applications; Android operating systems; Antivirus softwares; Application developers; Application stores; Integrity verifications; Security threats; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84907417558

This is in turn done by instrumenting the Android operating system to provide information about power/performance state changes of various smartphone components at the lowest layer of the kernel to avoid time stamping delays and component state observability issues. This technique then enables one to perform fine-grained (in time and space) power metering in the smartphone.

However, the user experience is still far from being optimal. In particular, despite the rapid hardware upgrades, current smartphones often suffer various unpredictable delays during operation, e.g., when launching an application, leading to poor user experience. This video features our study of storage impact on smartphone application delay. We conduct the first large-scale measurement study on the I/O delay of Android using the data collected from our application running on 1009 devices within 130 days. We observe that Android devices spend up to 58% of their CPU active time waiting for storage I/Os to complete. This negatively affects the smartphone's overall application performance, and results in slow response time. Further investigation, among others, reveals that reads experience up to a 626% slowdown in the presence of concurrent writes.

Malapp writers abuse repackaging techniques to rebuild applications with code changes. Existing anti-malware applications do not successfully defeat or defend against the repackaged malapps due to numerous variants. Software-based attestation approaches widely used in a resource-constrained environment have been developed to detect code changes of software with low resource consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel software-based attestation approach, called MysteryChecker, leveraging an unpredictable attestation algorithm. For its unpredictable attestation, MysteryChecker applies the concept of code obfuscation, which changes the syntax in order to avoid code analysis by adversaries. More precisely, unpredictable attestation is achieved by chaining randomly selected crypto functions. A verifier sends a randomly generated attestation module, and the target application must reply with a correct response using the attestation module. Also, the target application periodically receives a new module that contains a different attestation algorithm. Thus, even if the attacker analyzes the attestation module, the target application replaces the existing attestation module with a new one and the analysis done by the attacker becomes invalid. Experimental results show that MysteryChecker is completely able to detect known and unknown variants of repackaged malapps, while existing anti-malware applications only partially detect the variants. © 2014 IEEE.","Repackaged Application Detection; Smartphone Security; Software-based Attestation","Android (operating system); Codes (symbols); Computer crime; Malware; Smartphones; Anti-malware; Code analysis; Code changes; Code obfuscation; Resource consumption; Smartphone securities; Target application; Application programs",2-s2.0-84922577177

Android, as one of the most popular smartphone operating systems, adopts a global buddy system with the FCFS (first come, first served) principle for memory allocation, and releases requests to manage external fragmentations and maintain the memory allocation efficiency. However, extensive experimental study on thread behaviors indicates that memory external fragmentation is no longer the crucial bottleneck in most Android applications. Specifically, a thread usually allocates or releases memory in bursts, resulting in serious memory locks and inefficient memory allocation. Furthermore, the pattern of such bursting behaviors varies throughout the life cycle of a thread. The conventional FCFS policy of Android buddy system fails to adapt to such variations and thus suffers from performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel memory management framework, called Memory Management Based on Thread Behaviors (MMBTB), for multi-core smartphone systems. It adapts to various thread behaviors through targeted optimizations to provide efficient memory allocation. The efficiency and effectiveness of this new memory management scheme on multicore architecture is proved by a theoretical emulation model. Our experimental studies on the real Android system show that MMBTB can improve the efficiency of memory allocation by 12%-20%, confirming the theoretical analysis results. © 2014 IEEE.","Android; behaviors; memory management; smartphone; thread","Android; Behavior-based; behaviors; Memory management; Multi core; thread",2-s2.0-84908401146

Aim: To describe the diverse nature of pregnancy related applications (apps) for the smartphone and to flag that these apps can potentially affect maternity care and should be considered in future planning of care provision. Methods: The 2 smartphone platforms, Apple and Android, were searched for pregnancy related apps and reviewed for their purpose and popularity. Findings: iTunes and Google Play returned 1059 and 497 pregnancy related apps respectively. Forty percent of the apps were informative, 13% interactive, 19% had features of a medical tool and 11% were social media apps. By far the most popular apps, calculated as the number of reviews multiplied by average reviewer rating, were those with interactive features. Discussion: The popularity of pregnancy-related apps could indicate a shift towards patient empowerment within maternity care provision. The traditional model of 'shared maternity care' needs to accommodate electronic devices into its functioning. Reliance on healthcare professionals may be reduced by the availability of interactive and personalised information delivered via a smartphone. This combined with the fact that smartphones are widely used by many women of childbearing age, has the potential to modify maternity care and experiences of pregnancy. Therefore it is important that healthcare professionals and policy-makers are more aware of these new developments, which are likely to influence healthcare and alter health-seeking behaviour. In addition healthcare professionals need to consider whether to discuss the use of apps in pregnancy with the women in their care. © 2013 Australian College of Midwives.","Maternity care; Pregnancy; Smartphone","age; article; empowerment; expectant mother; health care personnel; health care planning; human; maternal care; medical information; midwife; mobile application; mobile phone; personal experience; physician; pregnant woman; priority journal; smartphone; social media; social network; Maternity care; Pregnancy; Smartphone; Adult; Cellular Phone; Computers, Handheld; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Maternal Health Services; Midwifery; Obstetrics; Physicians; Pregnancy",2-s2.0-84896315847

Medical smartphone apps are now widely used in clinical practice and present an opportunity to provide support to inexperienced prescribers. This study assesses the contemporary range of smartphone apps with prescribing or related content. Six smartphone app stores were searched for apps aimed at the healthcare professional with drug, pharmacology or prescribing content. Three hundred and six apps were identified. 34% appeared to be for use within the clinical environment in order to aid prescribing, 14% out with the clinical setting and 51% of apps were deemed appropriate for both clinical and non-clinical use. Apps with drug reference material, such as textbooks, manuals or medical apps with drug information were the commonest apps found (51%), followed by apps offering drug or infusion rate dose calculation (26%). 68% of apps charged for download, with a mean price of £14.25 per app and a range of £0.62-101.90. A diverse range of pharmacology-themed apps are available and there is further potential for the development of contemporary apps to improve prescribing performance. Personalized app stores may help universities/healthcare organizations offer high quality apps to students to aid in pharmacology education. Users of prescribing apps must be aware of the lack of information regarding the medical expertise of app developers. This will enable them to make informed choices about the use of such apps in their clinical practice. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.","apps; e-learning; education; pharmacology; prescribing; smartphone","article; clinical pharmacology; clinical practice; computer program; cost; dose calculation; drug dose calculator; drug information; drug infusion; electronic prescribing; health care organization; health care personnel; human; medical education; medical literature; medical school; medical student; mobile phone; priority journal; smart phone; clinical pharmacology; devices; education; medical information system; prescription; Cell Phones; Clinical Pharmacy Information Systems; Drug Prescriptions; Humans; Pharmacology, Clinical; Software",2-s2.0-84891090269

Comparable to efforts in biology in mapping the occurrence of plants and animals, the new smartphone application can be used as a tool in citizen science as well as in research projects by students and scientists. Based on The Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) or other classification systems, Ecosystem Service Mapping (ESM) App users can map ESS they either observe or use, and additionally select the ecosystems or land-use types in which the ESS are used or which are providing the ESS. The App uses built-in GPS functionality of the smartphones to locate the ESS, as well as the internal clock for a time stamp. Recorded ESS can directly be displayed on a map. Once recorded, results are stored on the phone and submitted to a server, which is collecting mapping results of all users. Beyond ESS mapping, users optionally can provide their home location for distance calculations, rank how important mapped ESS are for them and export recorded ESS. All users receive a registry code number provided by the server, but all records are submitted anonymously and beyond the registry code, no user-specific information is collected. The ESM-App currently is in its beta phase and has been sent out to users for field testing.

Although there has been much interest in adopting Android in real-time contexts, surprisingly little work has been done to examine the suitability of Android for real-time systems. Existing work only provides solutions to traditional problems, including real-time garbage collection at the virtual machine layer and kernel-level real-time scheduling and resource management. While it is critical to address these issues, it is by no means sufficient. After all, Android is a vast system that is more than a Java virtual machine and a kernel. Thus, this paper goes beyond existing work and examines the internals of Android. We discuss the implications and challenges of adapting Android constructs and core system services for real-time and present a solution for each. Our system is unique in that it redesigns Android's internal components, replaces Android's Java VM (Dalvik) with a real-time VM, and leverages off-the-shelf real-time OSes.

The Arduino MEGA controls the propulsion and direction, while the UNO processes the information received from the distance sensor to stop the RC at a pre-defined distance. The Android application uses the embedded orientation sensor on the smartphone to determine the four directions (forward, backward, left and right) intended by the user; hence, rotating the smartphone to different directions results in to the corresponding propulsion of the RC unit.

First, relevant permissions can be missed in long lists of permissions. Second, apps that access personal information for functionality may appear suspicious even if they don't have the ability to disclose that information. Finally, updates to apps can lead to new permissions, accessing personal data, being granted. We modified the Google Play permissions interface to include a quantitative measure (sensitivity score) of an app's ability to disclose personal information and to highlight the relevant permissions that contributed to this score in order to focus the user's attention on permissions that have the ability to access personal data. These improvements are easily integratable within the current structures and policies of the Android permissions interface and have been designed to allow inexperienced users to understand the permission interface and make informed and conscious decisions about access to their personal data. We validated the effectiveness of this approach with a study of 125 Android smartphone users. We compared the current and improved versions of the interface and found that our improved permission interface led participants - especially inexperienced ones - To choose apps with less possible access to their personal data.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of keystroke inference when user taps on a soft keyboard are captured by the stereoscopic microphones on an Android smartphone. We developed algorithms for sensor-signals processing and domain specific machine learning to infer key taps using a combination of stereo-microphones and gyroscopes. We implemented and evaluated the performance of our system on two popular mobile phones and a tablet: Samsung S2, Samsung Tab 8 and HTC One.

We show that stereo-microphones are a much more effective side channel as compared to the gyroscope, however, their data can be combined to boost the accuracy of prediction. While previous studies focused on larger key sizes and repetitive attempts, we show that by focusing on the specifics of the keyboard and creating machine learning models and algorithms based on keyboard areas combined with adequate filtering, we can achieve an accuracy of 90% - 94% for much smaller key sizes in a single attempt.

These third-party marketplaces usually provide thousands of applications, but can't guarantee their security. Among the malicious applications, repackaging is one of the most common techniques to piggyback malicious payloads into legitimate applications. In order to keep the android ecosystem healthy, an app similarity measurement system is proposed to detect repackaged applications directly from the DEX file. We use the string length as the fingerprint to measure the similarity between third-party application and the original one, afterwards according to the similarity score whether one third-party application is repackaged or not can be determined. We perform a systematic study on five popular Android-based third-party marketplaces with randomly 200 samples from each third-party marketplace. Further manual investigation shows that these repackaged apps are mainly used to replace existing in-app advertisements or embed new ones to ""steal"" or re-route ad revenues. We also identify a few cases with planted malicious payloads among repackaged apps.","Android; DEX file; Repackaging","Commerce; Smartphones; Android; Android applications; DEX file; Repackaging; Similarity measurements; Similarity scores; Systematic study; Third party application (Apps); Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84929484286

The StoreDroid framework, described in this paper, addresses possible data violations that can occur in the current Android system by adding protection mechanisms in several layers as follows: (1) at the Linux level we use the security-enhanced Linux and security-enhanced Android plugins that prevent today's privileged escalation data access; (2) StoreDroidApp is a generic sensor-based access control mechanism where the sensors (such as biometric sensors and GPS) and the rules to access the data are defined by the service provider for better protection - we took advantage of the fact that Android systems are usually integrated with various hardware sensors in order to protect the user as well as the service provider; and (3) a secured message passing protocol to ensure that sensitive data will not be compromised by unwanted applications. The StoreDroid framework makes the following contributions: (1) the generic StoreDroidApp stub that is installed when the ROM is built narrows possible illegal data access for assigned application by the set of semantic and limiting sensor-based access rules, and (2) on top of the regular Linux used in Android, the customized security-enhanced Linux ensures that the sensor-based application will keep the data isolated and secured. © 2014 IEEE.","Android; Data Security; Mobile Computing; Security-Enhanced Linux","Access control; Biometrics; Computer operating systems; Message passing; Mobile computing; Security of data; Semantics; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Wireless telecommunication systems; Access control mechanism; Android; Biometric sensors; Hardware sensors; Protection mechanisms; Security-enhanced linux; Sensor-based applications; Smart-phone applications; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84908626508

Data collection is a core process of geomatics which usually adopt precise equipment to measure geospatial data. With the development of technology, a smartphone in this present era is not simply for communication; several low cost measurement devices such as Global Positioning System (GPS), gyro and camera are assembled in a smartphone. Although the devices assembled in a smartphone could not meet the needs of accuracy requirement for many geomatics applications, millions of mobile applications (Apps) can be downloaded and installed from Google Play and Apple Store freely, and a variety of sensors can be chosen for user. Considering that the popularity and convenience of a smartphone, and assuming that the accuracy of those collected data is acceptable for learning purposes, it is expected that a smartphone can be employed in geomatics for hand-on education. For example, Vespucci OSM Editor is an App to edit the OpenStreetMap on Android. The user may have the hand-on experience on GPS positioning, web services and mapping via Vespucci OSM Editor. The aim of this paper is to collect and analyze different Apps for geomatics education. The Apps are classified into four categories, namely, surveying, remote sensing, GPS and Geographic Information System (GIS). In this paper, more than 20 free Apps are collected and analysed for different hand-on studies in geomatics education. Finally, all the related Apps are listed on a website for updating.","Applications (Apps); Education; Geomatics; Smartphone","Computer software maintenance; Data acquisition; Education; Global positioning system; Remote sensing; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Surveying; Web services; Websites; Data collection; Geo-spatial data; Geomatics; Google plays; GPS positioning; Low-cost measurements; Mobile applications; Smartphone apps; Geographic information systems",2-s2.0-84924245661

Current approaches assessing privacy risk lack user input, assuming that the value of each smartphone sub-asset (e.g. contact list, usage history) is perceived similarly across users. Thus, per user privacy risk assessment is not achievable. This paper refines our previous work on smartphone risk assessment by proposing an approach for assessing the privacy risk of Android users. Its cornerstone is impact valuation from users, as well as their usage profiles, which enables assessment of per user risk. Threat likelihood is assessed based on the presence of specific permission combinations, which we consider vulnerabilities that enable privacy threat scenarios. These permission combinations correspond to users' app profiles, i.e. to the app categories of Google Play that each user regularly visits. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Android; Attacks; Permission; Personal data; Privacy; Risk","Android (operating system); Data privacy; Risks; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Software testing; Android; Attacks; Contact lists; Permission; Privacy risks; Privacy threats; Usage history; User privacy; Risk assessment",2-s2.0-84905020847

However despite the use of such anonymizers, in many cases applications are still able to identify the user and the device by different means than the IP address. The reason is that very often applications require device services and information that go beyond the capabilities of anonymous networks in protecting users' identity and privacy. In this paper, we propose two solutions that address this problem. The first solution is based on an approach that shadows user and application data, device information, and resources that can reveal the user identity. Data shadowing is executed when the smartphone switches to the ""anonymous modality"". Once the smartphone returns to work in the normal (i.e. non-anonymous) modality, application data, device information and resources are returned back to the state they had before the anonymous connection. The second solution is based on run-time modifications of Android application permissions. Permissions associated with sensitive information are dynamically revoked at run-time from applications when the smartphone is used under the anonymous modality. They are re-instated back when the smartphone returns to work in the normal modality. In addition, both solutions offer protection from applications that identify their users through traces left in the application's data storage or through exchanging identifying data messages. We developed Identi Droid, a customized Android operating system, to deploy these solutions and built Identi Droid Profile Manager, a profile-based configuration tool that allows one to set different configurations for each installed Android application. With this tool, applications running within the same device are configured to be given different identifications and privileges to limit the uniqueness of device and user information. We analyzed 250 Android applications to determine what information, services, and permissions can identify users and devices. Our experiments show that when Identi Droid is deployed and properly configured on Android devices, users' anonymity is better guaranteed by either of the proposed solutions with no significant impact on most device applications.",,"Signal encoding; Smartphones; Tools; Android applications; Android operating systems; Anonymous Networks; Device application; Device information; Mobile applications; Sensitive informations; User information; Robots",2-s2.0-84899651651

Hence, intensive research is being conducted on the etiology and treatment of the condition. However, the traditional clinical approach based surveys and interviews has serious limitations: health professionals cannot perform continual assessment and intervention for the affected group and the subjectivity of assessment is questionable. To cope with these limitations, a comprehensive ICT (Information and Communications Technology) system called SAMS (Smartphone Addiction Management System) is developed for objective assessment and intervention. The SAMS system consists of an Android smartphone application and a web application server. The SAMS client monitors the user's application usage together with GPS location and Internet access location, and transmits the data to the SAMS server. The SAMS server stores the usage data and performs key statistical data analysis and usage intervention according to the clinicians' decision. To verify the reliability and efficacy of the developed system, a comparison study with survey-based screening with the K-SAS (Korean Smartphone Addiction Scale) as well as self-field trials is performed. The comparison study is done using usage data from 14 userswho are 19 to 50 year old adults that left at least 1 week usage logs and completed the survey questionnaires. The field trial fully verified the accuracy of the time, location, and Internet access information in the usage measurement and the reliability of the system operation over more than 2 weeks. The comparison study showed that daily use count has a strong correlation with K-SAS scores, whereas daily use times do not strongly correlate for potentially addicted users. The correlation coefficients of count and times with total K-SAS score are CC=0.62 and CC =0.07, respectively, and the t-test analysis for the contrast group of potential addicts and the values for the non-addicts were p=0.047 and p=0.507, respectively. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","ICT system; Objective assessment; Smartphone addiction; Statistical analysis","accuracy; addiction; article; community; data analysis; global positioning system; health practitioner; human; information system; Internet; interview; measurement; mental health; mobile phone; questionnaire; reliability; screening; smartphone addiction management system; adult; Behavior, Addictive; devices; female; geographic information system; Internet; male; microcomputer; middle aged; mobile phone; pilot study; reproducibility; South Korea; time; Adult; Behavior, Addictive; Cell Phones; Computers, Handheld; Female; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Reproducibility of Results; Republic of Korea; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84891518669

For system-wide optimization, energy and computational resources are often the two most critical issues. Monitoring the energy state of each hardware component and measuring the time spent in each state is needed for accurate energy and performance prediction. For software optimization, it is important to profile the energy and the time consumed by each software construct in a realistic operating environment with a proper workload. However, the conventional approaches of simulation often fail to produce satisfying data. First, building a cycle-accurate simulation environment for a complex system, such as an Android smartphone, is difficult and can take a long time. Second, a slow simulation can significantly alter the behavior of multithreaded, I/O-intensive applications and can affect the accuracy of profiles. Third, existing software-based profilers generally do not work on simulators, which makes it difficult for performance analysis of complicated software, for example, Java applications executed by the Dalvik VM in an Android system. To address these aforementioned problems, we proposed and prototyped a framework, called virtual performance analyzer (VPA). VPA takes advantage of an existing emulator or virtual machine monitor to reduce the complexity of building a simulator. VPA allows the user to selectively and incrementally integrate timing models and power models into the emulator with our carefully designed performance/power monitors, tracing facility, and profiling tools to evaluate and analyze the emulated system. The emulated system can perform at different levels of speed to help verify if the profile data are impacted by the emulation speed. Finally, VPA supports existing software-based profiles and enables non-intrusive tracing/profiling by minimizing the probe effect. Our experimental results show that the VPA framework allows users to quickly establish a performance/power evaluation environment and gather useful information to support system design and software optimization for Android smartphones. © 2014 ACM.","Android system emulation; Full system emulation; Performance profiling; Performance tracing; Power model; Timing estimation","Optimization; Smartphones; Systems analysis; Virtual addresses; Android systems; Performance profiling; Performance tracing; Power model; System emulation; Timing estimation; Robots",2-s2.0-84896996102

On these devices, games constitute the class of most popular applications and are at the same time highly compute-intensive. Every game consists of several states like the loading, main menu and the gaming state. Each of those states has its own workload characteristics, e.g., the loading phase is likely to be memory bound and the main menu state is less interactive than the gaming state. We propose an interception technique that allows to profile the game and detect its current state based on the game’s communication with the underlying OS. Current power management governors are unaware of the running applications and scale the processor’s voltage and frequency merely based on the system’s utilization. We provide the game’s state information and workload profile to our governor which selects the processing frequency such that the desired frame rate of the current state is ensured. This leads to an optimal choice of processing frequencies and thereby significantly reduces power consumption. We have implemented the scheme on an Android-based Samsung Galaxy Nexus smartphone using popular games like Jetpack Joyride and Temple Run. We reduced the CPU’s power consumption by up to 43.2 % compared to the Android interactive governor without impacting the gaming experience. Motivated by these results we propose a power management API that would allow game developers to significantly reduce the power consumption of their game using simple API calls. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Android; DVFS; Game; Power management; Workload prediction","Android (operating system); Governors; Personal computers; Power management; Smartphones; Android; DVFS; Game; Gaming experiences; Portable device; Running applications; Workload characteristics; Workload predictions; Loading",2-s2.0-84920257470

In a lab experiment with 48 participants we find that users tend to choose more often the app with a lower number of permissions when statistical information is provided together with graphics. We also find that the privacy-intrusiveness and trustworthiness of apps is perceived differently when statistical information is given. © 2014 IEEE.","Android permissions; app functionality; risk communication; statistical information; Users","Health risks; Network security; Statistics; Android permissions; app functionality; Risk communication; Statistical information; Users; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84920747514

A data search was undertaken using keywords and phrases relating to weight loss surgery. Apps designed for the non-surgical treatment of obesity were excluded. Results: A total of 38 apps were identified (Google Play = 17, Apple App Store = 21, Blackberry World = 0). Ten of 38 apps were duplicated therefore 28 apps were reviewed. Mean app rating was 3.6/5 and mean app cost was £1.89. Twenty-six of 28 (92.9%) apps were designed for use by patients. Apps were categorised into the following categories: patient information (ten), patient support forums (six), patient record tools (six), weight loss clinic advertisements (four), a journal app (one) and a conference tool (one). Health professional involvement was evident in 12 of 28 (42.9%) apps. Conclusions: This study has identified that the majority of available apps relating to weight loss surgery do not have health professional input. The establishment of a 'quality stamp' provided by an established bariatric surgical body could improve the confidence with which patients and clinicians use these new information sources. Weight loss surgery apps offer a unique opportunity to provide accurate and reliable patient information and their use as part of the informed consent process should be explored. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Apps; Cellular phone; Obesity surgery; Smartphone; Technology","advertizing; article; bariatric surgery; conservative treatment; cost; group dynamics; health practitioner; human; informed consent; medical record; mobile application; paramedical personnel; patient information; patient support forum; priority journal; smartphone apps; telehealth; weight reduction; Bariatric Surgery; Cellular Phone; Humans; Internet; Mobile Applications; Obesity",2-s2.0-84893120003

With somany different hardware components inmodern smartphones, there are situations where certain components may be powered down or reduced in functionality without disrupting the user experience. We propose a transparent correlation-based scheme for energy efficient context sensing and fusion under Android systems. We experiment with the idea of disabling hardware functionality based on context. Our scheme focuses on inferring a user’s location and subsequently disabling the GPS, which is considered to be one of themost energy-expensive components included in a smartphone. For example, when a user has connected to aWi- Fi network with a known location, we disable GPS navigation and deliver the known location in its place.

As the use of smartphones, tablets, phablets based on android operating system is increasing, many scenarios related with anti-theft have already been proposed and many software based on anti-theft have also been developed, but most of these software are not freely available and it's difficult to identify the thief by using these software's e.g. GPS Tracking. We put forward a new scheme, which enhances the present scenario, based on new technologies like Multimedia Messages. The scenario proposed in this work is totally dependent on the hardware of your smartphone like camera (front & back) and support for multimedia messages. Once this software is installed, it will work in the background, stores the current SIM number in a variable and keeps checking continuously for SIM change, whenever SIM gets changed from mobile, it will take snapshots and record a video in the background i.e., without taking user permission and then it will send an MMS, and number of snap shots, to an alternate mobile number and an email id, which was provided during installation. The enviable advantage of this software is that it is very easy to configure and it keeps running in the background without interrupting the user. To some extent it helps the owner to identify the thief. © 2014 IEEE.","Android; Email; MMS; Multimedia Messages; Snapshots","Electronic mail; Smartphones; Android; Android operating systems; Different services; GPS tracking; MMS; Multimedia messages; Running-in; Snapshots; Robots",2-s2.0-84899067851

The availability of reuse-oriented development methodologies and automated malware production tools makes exceedingly easy to produce new specimens. As a result, market operators and malware analysts are increasingly overwhelmed by the amount of newly discovered samples that must be analyzed. This situation has stimulated research in intelligent instruments to automate parts of the malware analysis process. In this paper, we introduce Dendroid, a system based on text mining and information retrieval techniques for this task. Our approach is motivated by a statistical analysis of the code structures found in a dataset of Android OS malware families, which reveals some parallelisms with classical problems in those domains. We then adapt the standard Vector Space Model and reformulate the modelling process followed in text mining applications. This enables us to measure similarity between malware samples, which is then used to automatically classify them into families. We also investigate the application of hierarchical clustering over the feature vectors obtained for each malware family. The resulting dendograms resemble the so-called phylogenetic trees for biological species, allowing us to conjecture about evolutionary relationships among families. Our experimental results suggest that the approach is remarkably accurate and deals efficiently with large databases of malware instances. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We report on the development of a usersuggested improvement to the AIChE Concept Warehouse: incorporation of an Android operating system based Student Mobile Application. Our intent is to share what we have learned through our improvement process, such that other innovators can benefit from the lessons learned through our experience. The AIChE Concept Warehouse was developed with the goal of fostering a community of learning within chemical engineering. The Concept Warehouse's cyber-enabled database infrastructure is designed to promote concept-based instruction through the use of concept questions in core curriculum courses like Material/Energy Balances, Thermodynamics, Transport Phenomena, Kinetics and Reactor Design, and Materials Science. Concept questions, both as Concept Inventories and as ConcepTests, are available to help lower the barrier of using conceptbased instruction and assessment. This instruction and these assessments can be used to promote and evaluate student learning in real-time. The instructor can then adjust the pace of lecture in response to student understanding, spending more time on more difficult concepts. This tool also allows for reflective assessments such as the ""muddiest point."" A Student Mobile Application is being developed to make it easier for students to submit answers and written explanations to these assessments using mobile devices. Previously, students could input their answers to conceptual questions using clickers, smartphones, and laptops. However, input via smartphones was cumbersome because it depended on a student's web browser and the full size web page. The improved student interface will facilitate student participation by making it easier for them to submit responses via smartphone. Once the application is developed, we will conduct initial usability testing with students who have been using the previous web-based options for answer submissions. In order to assess the usability, usage statistics from student responses to usability surveys will be collected. Survey responses will be used to identify student likes and dislikes and compare the different available options for answer submission. Results from usage statistics will be used to improve the design of the application. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.",,"Android (operating system); Curricula; Engineering education; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Smartphones; Surveys; Thermodynamics; Warehouses; Websites; Android operating systems; Concept inventories; Concept-based instruction; Conceptual questions; Educational innovations; Mobile applications; Student participation; Transport phenomena; Students",2-s2.0-84905157977

Furthermore, smartphones can utilize various networks like private WiFi networks. Such openness of smartphones means that their traffic is uncontrollable for both carriers and users. This creates various problems such as network overloads and security risks that degrade user experience. To address the issue of uncontrollability, we propose STCoS, a software-defined, i.e., programmable, traffic control scheme for smartphones. STCoS is designed to work standalone basis in a smartphone for ease of deployment. It is also designed to have a layered architecture with a well-defined API for improved programmability. STCoS directs traffic of smartphone applications to the appropriate network interface, monitors the traffic, and filters the traffic as needed. It enables control logic to be implemented in the form of a smartphone application. The programmability facilitates real-time traffic control on a moment-to-moment basis. Thus STCoS recovers controllability on smartphone traffic with simple programming. Control logic implementation in example programs, such as a sophisticated WiFi offloading program, demonstrated that STCoS can be used to easily program traffic control. Implementation of STCoS in an Android smartphone demonstrated that the overhead of STCoS is low enough for practical use. © 2014 IEEE.","Mobile Network; Offloading; OpenFlow; Smartphone; WiFi","Signal encoding; Wi-Fi; Wireless networks; Android smartphone; Layered architecture; Moment-to-moment basis; Offloading; Openflow; Real-time traffic control; Smart-phone applications; Traffic control schemes; Smartphones",2-s2.0-84937567462

Unencrypted parts of a disk can be read out and are open to system manipulations. We present a tool named EvilDroid to show that with physical access to an encrypted smartphone only (i.e., without user level privileges), the Android system partition can be subverted with keylogging.

Data recovery tools like FROST exploit the remanence effect of RAM to recover data from encrypted smartphones, at worst the disk encryption key. With a Linux kernel module named Armored, we demonstrate that Android's software encryption can be improved to withstand cold boot attacks by performing AES entirely on the CPU without RAM.

However, it also attracts malware writers to exploit Android devices in order to distribute malicious apps in the wild. In fact, Android malware are becoming more sophisticated and they use advanced 'dynamic loading' techniques like Java reflection or native code execution to bypass security detection. To detect dynamic loading, one has to use dynamic analysis. Currently, there are only a handful of Android dynamic analysis tools available, and they all have shortcomings in detecting dynamic loading. The aim of this paper is to design and implement a dynamic analysis system which allows analysts to perform systematic analysis of dynamic payloads with malicious behaviors. We propose 'DroidTrace', a ptrace based dynamic analysis system with forward execution capability. Our system uses ptrace to monitor selected system calls of the target process which is running the dynamic payloads, and classifies the payloads behaviors through the system call sequence, e.g., behaviors such as file access, network connection, inter-process communication and even privilege escalation.

Results: Of the 220 apps meeting inclusion criteria, the majority were available through the iPhone (80.0 percent). The cost for downloading each app ranged from US $0.00 to 89.99; however, the majority of apps were ≤US $4.99. There was no evidence of HCP involvement in the development of the majority of apps (65.0 percent). Chronic, nonspecific pain was the focus of half (50.5 percent) of the apps, followed by back and/or neck pain (25.9 percent). The primary purpose of the apps was categorized as follows: pain education (n = 53, 24.1 percent), pain self-management (n = 137, 62.3 percent), and both pain education and self-management (n = 30, 13-6 percent). Conclusion: Overall, most of the pain-related apps included within our review not only lacked evidence of HCP input regarding development but also contained few evidence-based pain management features. © 2014 Journal of Opioid Management, All Rights Reserved.","Mobile health (mhealth); Pain management; Smartphone applications; Systematic review","arthritis; backache; behavior change; chronic pain; coping behavior; cost; fibromyalgia; headache; health care personnel; health education; human; hypnosis; migraine; mobile application; neck pain; relaxation training; review; self care; systematic review; United States; Cellular Phone; Chronic Pain; Computers, Handheld; Humans; Patient Education as Topic; Self Care; Telemedicine; United States",2-s2.0-84897126348

Given this high variability, dynamic optimization of radio connectivity choice is promising. To increase the flexibility and payoff of such optimizations, we recognize that many applications have significant delay tolerance, which we exploit to schedule data transmissions. This paper proposes and evaluates techniques for cost-optimizing connectivity choice based on application delay tolerance, as well as on predictions of upcoming data usage and connectivity availability. We explore optimal (MILP-based) and heuristic approaches for optimizing this choice while abiding by application performance requirements. Our work studies how errors in predicting data usage or network connectivity impact each approach's success at cost reduction. We evaluate the technique through both simulation and a prototype on an Android smartphone. Overall, our technique averages more than 2× reduction in cellular data usage, and for some scenarios, the reduction is as high as 5×. In addition, the Android prototype also demonstrates the importance of accounting for radio switching overhead and TCP flow migration time. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Android (operating system); Cost reduction; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Mobile devices; Optimization; Scheduling; Transmission control protocol; Android smartphone; Application performance; Delay tolerances; Dynamic optimization; Heuristic approach; Multiple networks; Orders of magnitude; Radio connectivity; Data reduction",2-s2.0-84908892394

Urolithiasis presents a major healthcare burden. Patients are increasingly keen to educate themselves regarding the diagnosis and management of their condition. There is no formal regulation of healthcare apps, including a large number of apps relating to urolithiasis. This review aims to examine the range of apps available, and the prevalence of healthcare professional input. Four international smartphone app stores were searched: Apple’s App Store, Google Play (Android), BlackBerry App World and the Windows Phone App store. A total of 42 unique apps were downloaded and analysed. Recorded data included the cost (£/$), publisher information, number of ratings, average rating and any documentation of medical professional involvement. Twenty-one (50 %) apps required payment for download. The mean cost was £3.58 ($6.04) with range £0.61–£34.90 ($1.03–$58.87). Thirty-three (79 %) of the 42 apps were designed to be used by patients. Fifteen (36 %) of the 42 apps had clear input from health professionals. Twenty-two apps offered patient information, including dietary advice on lowering calcium intake, which is contrary to current evidence-based practice. We conclude that urolithiasis apps have future potential to inform both patients and healthcare professionals on stone management. However, inaccuracies in the recommendations made by some apps can be misleading or even harmful due to a lack of specialist involvement.

Ubiquitous Surveying provides cost-effective, smart and available surveying techniques while traditional surveying equipment are so expensive and have small availability specially in indoor and daily surveying jobs. In order to have a smart surveying instrument, different information technology methods and tools like Triangle method, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) method and laser sensor are used. These new ways in combine with surveying equations introduces a modern surveying equipment called Ubi-Total Station that also employed different sensors embedded in smartphone and mobile stand. RSSI-based localization and Triangle method technique are easy and well known methods to predict the position of an unknown node in indoor environments whereas additional measures are required for a sufficient accuracy. In this paper the main goal is to introduce the Ubiquitous Total Station as a development in smart and ubiquitous GIS. In order to public use of the surveying equipment, design and implementation of this instrument has been done. Conceptual model of Smartphone-based system is designed for this study and based on this model, an Android application as a first sample is developed. Finally the evaluations shows that absolute errors in X and Y calculation are 0.028 and 0.057 meter respectively. Also RMSE of 0.26 was calculated in RSSI method for distance measurement. The high price of traditional equipment and their requirement for professional surveyors has given way to intelligent surveying. In the suggested system, smartphones can be used as tools for positioning and coordinating geometric information of objects.","Laser sensor; RSSI; Smartphone; Triangle method; Ubiquitous surveying; Ubiquitous Total Station","Cost effectiveness; Equipment; MEMS; Signal encoding; Smartphones; Surveys; Ubiquitous computing; Design and implementations; Laser sensor; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Received signal strength indicators; RSSI; Technological advances; Total station; Triangle method; Surveying",2-s2.0-84924152531

Smartphones are like small computer which accompany us everywhere and allow us to access various functionalities. Smart phone is a personnel device which provides entertainment, information, making call, writing SMS and accessing different applications like check the email, to browse the Internet or to play games with our friends. We have to install applications on our smartphone in order to take all the advantage that these devices offer. The increasing importance of smart phones has increased competition among technology giants to take over the bigger part of the market share for mobile platform. As a result, in 2005 Google introduced Android (developed by Andy Rubin the Director of Mobile Platforms for Google), an open source mobile platform for smart phone devices which is consisting of a Linux Kernel, runtime environment, development framework, libraries and key applications.

In the almost all smartphone applications, client-server model is used because end-to-end communication is prevented by NAT routers. Recently, some smartphone applications provide real time services such as voice and video communication, online games etc. In these applications, end-to-end communication is suitable to reduce transmission delay and achieve efficient network usage. Also, IP mobility and security are important matters. However, the conventional IP mobility mechanisms are not suitable for these applications because most mechanisms are assumed to be installed in OS kernel. We have developed a novel IP mobility mechanism called NTMobile (Network Traversal with Mobility). NTMobile supports end-to-end IP mobility in IPv4 and IPv6 networks, however, it is assumed to be installed in Linux kernel as with other technologies. In this paper, we propose a new type of end-to-end mobility platform that provides end-to-end communication, mobility, and also secure data exchange functions in the application layer for smartphone applications. In the platform, we use NTMobile, which is ported as the application program. Then, we extend NTMobile to be suitable for smartphone devices and to provide secure data exchange. Client applications can achieve secure end-to-end communication and secure data exchange by sharing an encryption key between clients. Users also enjoy IP mobility which is the main function of NTMobile in each application. Finally, we confirmed that the developed module can work on Android system and iOS system. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Electronic data interchange; iOS (operating system); Mobile devices; Routers; Smartphones; Transport aircraft; Voice/data communication systems; Application layers; Client applications; Client-server models; End-to-End communication; Mobility platform; Real time service; Smart-phone applications; Transmission delays; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-84906833621

All the trails are deemed as flat level with a slop of 0 degree, resulting in great error when calculating energy expenditure (EE). In this study, a smartphone-based system for health promotion and EE monitoring of gradient walking was developed under the Android platform. The App adopting GPS and motion detectors accompanied with digitized altitude information of mountain trails was developed for calculating EE in real-time manner. The EE was calculated based on Kramer's equation which considers trail slope, as well as weight, hiking speed, and gender of the tourist. First, a male graduate student was asked to walk repeatedly for 9 times along a level track with a perimeter of 232 m on a university sportfield. Under an average speed of 1.46±0.14 m/sec, the mean EEsare 5.47±0.66 and 4.82±0.66 Kcal/min for the values obtained from the developed App and calculated from Kramar's equation, respectively, without reaching significant difference (p > 0.05). The subject was further asked to hike on one of the mountain trails in round trip repeatedly for 6 times. It was shown that, by keeping similar duration and speed between uphill and downhill (p > 0.05), hiking uphill consumes more energy than downhill s (p < 0.05). This result is again matched with the theory proposed in previous investigation. In conclusion, the developed Android-based App can be used to calculate the energy expenditure more accurately than traditional systems without considering the trail altitude. We suggest the systems developed for calculating energy expenditure should consider attitude information. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Communication; Smartphones; Students; Android platforms; Average speed; Energy expenditure; Google maps; Graduate students; Health promotion; Motion detectors; Traditional systems; Embedded systems",2-s2.0-84896671737

However, the performance of the Open APIs integrated in smartphone apps (Mobile Open APIs) remains hidden from app developers and app users because of the lack of a method to isolate the Open API calls from the whole app execution process. In this paper, we present the very first effort on characterizing Mobile Open APIs and analyzing their performance in terms of four metrics: response latency, network traffic, energy consumption, and CPU usage. We first develop APIExtractor (APIX), a software tool to extract the Mobile Open API calls as fine-grained as in the function level from Android app files (.apk). Then the popularity of the Open API functions were ranked by running APIX on 200 top popular apps downloaded from the Android app store. We then perform in-depth case studies on the the top 17 most popular Mobile Open APIs, by wrapping each of them in a specifically designed app (called APISymphone) and test the apps on both Wi-Fi and cellular network.

The new feature enables real-time adaptive waveform detection using an algorithm of linear time complexity. It can also recognize notches in the waveform and it is inherently robust to baseline drift. An implementation of the algorithm on Android is available for free download.

We developed a smartphone application that aids stroke patient self-screening and hospital selection, and may also decrease hospital arrival time. Materials and Methods: The application was developed for iPhone and Android smartphones. Map data for the application were adopted from the open map. For hospital registration, a web page (http://stroke119.org) was developed using PHP and MySQL. Results: The Stroke 119 application includes a stroke screening tool and real-time information on nearby hospitals that provide thrombolytic treatment. It also provides information on stroke symptoms, thrombolytic treatment, and prescribed actions when stroke is suspected. The stroke screening tool was adopted from the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale and is displayed in a cartoon format. If the user taps a cartoon image that represents abnormal findings, a pop-up window shows that the user may be having a stroke, informs the user what to do, and directs the user to call emergency services. Information on nearby hospitals is provided in map and list views, incorporating proximity to the user's location using a Global Positioning System (a built-in function of smartphones). Users can search for a hospital according to specialty and treatment levels. We also developed a web page for hospitals to register in the system.

Due to its continuing popularity, SMS technology is nowadays used in various fields of application. This also includes security-sensitive fields such as e-banking, or e-government. In these fields, SMS technology is for instance employed to authorize financial transactions or the creation of qualified electronic signatures. Modern smartphone platforms such as Google Android provide application developers with the means to include SMS functionality. This can be beneficial in most cases but also facilitates the implementation of malware that is able to send and receive SMS messages unnoticed by the legitimate end user. In this context, SMS sniffers and SMS catchers have recently attracted attention. This kind of malware intercepts incoming SMS messages either to spy on security-sensitive data transmitted via SMS or to receive SMS-based malware control commands. For security-sensitive SMS-based applications, SMS catchers pose a serious threat. A recent attack on SMS-based e-banking systems has employed SMS catchers on smartphones to steal 36.000.000 Euro from corporate and private bank accounts in Europe. Unfortunately, security software for smartphones is still in the fledging stages and current solutions are not able to reliably detect SMS catchers. To overcome this problem, we introduce different methods to detect SMS sniffers and SMS catchers on smartphones. We discuss benefits and limitations of the proposed methods and show how these methods can be assembled to a comprehensive detection workflow for SMS-based malware. By providing means to detect SMS catchers and sniffers on smartphones, our work contributes to the security of current and future SMS-based applications. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Android (operating system); Computer crime; Electronic commerce; Government data processing; Malware; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Prisms; Security of data; Smartphones; Application developers; Control command; Financial transactions; Mobile communication services; Qualified electronic signature; Security software; Sensitive datas; Short message services; Text messaging",2-s2.0-84936818053

Why do independent application developers and innovators join these ecosystems, and which factors influence their choice between different platform options? Objective This paper evaluates why innovators publish applications for smartphone operating systems, and which factors influence their choice between the two most common platforms, Android and Apple iOS, and leading them to join this respective ecosystem. Method A quantitative questionnaire containing questions related to demographics, motivational factors, factors impacting choice of platform and application publishing history. 113 Application developers from all over the world responded, relatively evenly split between the two operating systems. Results The main motivations are the experience of fun and intellectual stimulation during the process itself and learning of new skills or know-how. Financial gain, on the other hand, was found to be of less importance. There are also significant differences between the developers according to their preferred platform, e.g. iOS developers are more often motivated by financial gain. In choosing which ecosystem to join, network size, openness and entry barriers play major roles, and according to these criteria the two ecosystems are perceived to be significantly different. In addition, the toolkit quality is one of the most important factors for developers, but not a point of differentiation between the two ecosystems. Conclusion This paper complements prior research with the viewpoint of the developers themselves, focusing on how they perceive both technical and economic, as well as governance related aspects. In addition, most research so far has focused on one aspect only, mostly application markets, while this study assess the perception of the whole ecosystem, including end user device, markets and OS. It is concluded that the motivations and perceptions of developers comprise a major component in the creation and management of a large and diverse ecosystem, and that there exists a significant group of user innovators, who are not motivated by financial gain. There are several other aspects besides network size that drive the choice of platform. In addition, developers perceive hardware, software, marketplaces and other aspects as one single construct. Any platform owner therefore has to carefully consider and manage their expectations and perceptions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this, the high-frequency, low-duration nature of the average smartphone session makes passwords or PIN-locks even less usable than in the desktop context. To combat these issues, implicit authentication (IA) schemes can be developed and deployed to smartphones. IA schemes continuously authenticate users by profiling their behaviour using the variety of sensors prevalent on the phones, such as touchscreens and accelerometers. When a non-owner acquires the device and attempts to access sensitive data on it, the IA scheme recognizes the difference in behaviour and automatically ejects the attacker from the system. In particularly sensitive contexts, IA schemes can also be deployed as a secondary defence mechanism on top of explicit authentication, providing layered security in the event of, for example, a shoulder-surfing attack compromising the device's PIN or an operating system vulnerability allowing its bypass. In this work, we evaluate existing proposals for IA schemes using different behavioural feature sets, and evaluate them against real-world data to show when they are (and are not) useful. We have implemented them in an easily extensible open source framework for the Android operating system called Itus, which allows other researchers to iteratively improve on the existing mechanisms for performing IA. Itus performs IA at the app level, which we have shown allows app developers to selectively protect sensitive data while decreasing the impact on battery life and device performance, and at the same time obtaining better detection accuracy for the IA scheme being invoked.

The main goal of the proposed system is to protect mobile device users and cellular infrastructure companies from malicious applications by: (1) identification of malicious attacks or masquerading applications installed on a mobile device, and (2) identification of republished popular applications injected with a malicious code (i.e., repackaging). More specifically, we attempt to detect a new type of mobile malware with self-updating capabilities that were recently found on the official Google Android marketplace. Malware of this type cannot be detected using the standard signatures approach or by applying regular static or dynamic analysis methods. The detection is performed based on the application's network traffic patterns only. For each application, a model representing its specific traffic pattern is learned locally (i.e., on the device). Semi-supervised machine-learning methods are used for learning the normal behavioral patterns and for detecting deviations from the application's expected behavior. These methods were implemented and evaluated on Android devices. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that: (1) various applications have specific network traffic patterns and certain application categories can be distinguished by their network patterns; (2) different levels of deviation from normal behavior can be detected accurately; (3) in the case of self-updating malware, original (benign) and infected versions of an application have different and distinguishable network traffic patterns that in most cases, can be detected within a few minutes after the malware is executed while presenting very low false alarms rate; and (4) local learning is feasible and has a low performance overhead on mobile devices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing research findings have shown that the percentage of closure of eyelid (a.k.a PERCLOS) is an effective indicator to evaluate the driver's drowsiness. We present the Sober-Drive system, which leverages PERCLOS for on-vehicle drowsy driving detection using smart phones. Specifically, Sober-Drive is built upon a number of indicators that are discrete-approximated from PERCLOS, blink time and blink rate, and it exploits the Neural Network to classify the eye ""open/close"" states. We developed a Sober-Drive prototype on Android smart phones, and we conducted extensive real-world experiments to evaluate its performance, the results of which show that Sober-Drive has a high detection rate of more than 90% for drowsy driving behaviors. © 2014 IEEE.","drowsiness detection; eye detection; neural network; personalized training","Eye protection; Neural networks; Android smart phones; Blink rates; Detection system; Drowsiness detection; Drowsy driving; Eye detection; High detection rate; Real world experiment; Smartphones",2-s2.0-84899569937
