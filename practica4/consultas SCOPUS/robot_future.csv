To develop robots that possess teaming capabilities, such as being able to communicate implicitly, the present study implemented a closed-loop system. This system enabled the robot to provide adaptive aid without the need for explicit commands from the human teammate, through the use of multiple physiological workload measures. Such measures of workload vary in sensitivity and there is large inter-individual variability in physiological responses to imposed taskload. Workload models enacted via closed-loop system should accommodate such individual variability. The present research investigated the effects of the adaptive robot aid vs. imposed aid on performance and workload. Results showed that adaptive robot aid driven by an individualized workload model for physiological response resulted in greater improvements in performance compared to aid that was simply imposed by the system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive systems; Inter-individual variability; Workload model","Adaptive systems; Closed loop systems; Physiological models; Physiology; Human robots; Human-robot-team; Individual variability; Physiological response; Taskload; Technological development; Work-load models; Robots; human; robotics; workload",2-s2.0-85030314509

This work proposes a new approach based on “contextual information”, in which users receive information not only about the current time step, but also about the past (how the target force has changed over time) and the future (how the target force will change). A test was run to compare the performance of the contextual approach in relation to the punctual information, in which each participant had to memorize and then reproduce a pattern of force after training with a multimodal system. The findings suggest that the contextual approach is a useful strategy for force pattern learning. The advantage of the contextual information approach over the punctual information approach is that users receive information about the evolution of their performance (helping to correct the errors), and they also receive information about the next forces to be exerted (providing them with a better understanding of the target force profile). Finally, the contextual approach could be implemented in medical training platforms or surgical robots to extend the capabilities of these systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Force skill training; Motor skill training; Multimodal training; Virtual training","Engineering; Hardware; Contextual information; Medical training; Motor skills; Multi-modal; Multimodal system; Pattern Learning; Skill training; Virtual training; Personnel training",2-s2.0-85032707375

Recently, the interaction between features generated from the same audio source was rarely considered, which may produce redundant features and increase the computational costs. To solve this problem, feature selection method based on correlation analysis and Fisher is proposed, which can remove the redundant features that have close correlations with each other. To improve the recognition performance of the feature subset after proposal feature selection further, an emotion recognition method based on extreme learning machine (ELM) decision tree is proposed according to the confusion degree among different basic emotions. A framework of speech emotion recognition is proposed and the classification experiments based on proposed classification method by using Chinese speech database from institute of automation of Chinese academy of sciences (CASIA) are performed. And the experimental results show that the proposal achieved 89.6% recognition rate on average. By proposal, it would be fast and efficient to discriminate emotional states of different speakers from speech, and it would make it possible to realize the interaction between speaker-independent and computer/robot in the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Correlation analysis; Decision tree; Extreme learning machine; Feature selection; Speech emotion recognition","Classification (of information); Correlation methods; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Speech; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Classification methods; Computational costs; Correlation analysis; Extreme learning machine; Feature selection methods; Speaker independents; Speech emotion recognition; Speech recognition",2-s2.0-85028353735

Nevertheless, usually, a bilateral communication between industry and research does not exist, even among the different existing research areas.

Soil-machine interaction studies seek to provide scientific knowledge on how tillage tools and traction devices interact with the terrain over which they work or move. Variables usually investigated include; force required to pull or push the tillage tool, vertical and lateral forces on tools, soil failure patterns, soil particles displacement, force generated at the interface of the wheel and the soil, wheel sinkage, rolling resistance, wheel contact area estimation, and soil stress at different depths. Soil bin facility is a model laboratory for tillage and traction experiments. The main components include the soil bin that models the ground; mobile tool carrier that models tool/implement frame; soil engaging tool/device for modeling tillage tools or traction elements; power source and the drive system that model the prime mover; soil conditioning equipment for preparation of the soil before experiments; motion control system for controlling the moving components along the rails of the soil bin; measurement/data acquisition and analysis system for real time measurement, analysis and display of variables during experiments; a lifting system for hoisting of heavy components. Simulations with Finite Element and Discrete Element Methods together with experimental analyses in the field or the soil bin are applied by many researchers in studying soil-machine interaction.

Most extant DoD systems represent “automated” versus “autonomous” systems, which adds complexity to our understanding of user acceptance of autonomy. The trust literature posits several key trust antecedents to automated systems, with few field applications of these factors into the context of DoD systems. The current paper will: (1) review the trust literature as relevant to acceptance of future autonomy, (2) present the results of a qualitative analysis of trust barriers for two future DoD technologies (Automatic Air Collision Avoidance System [AACAS]; and Autonomous Wingman [AW]), and (3) discuss knowledge gaps for implementing future autonomous systems within the DoD. The study team interviewed over 160 fighter pilots from 4th Generation (e.g., F-16) and 5th Generation (e.g., F-22) fighter platforms to gauge their trust barriers to AACAS and AW. Results show that the trust barriers discussed by the pilots corresponded fairly well to the existing trust challenges identified in the literature, though some nuances were revealed that may be unique to DoD technologies/operations. Some of the key trust barriers included: concern about interference during operational requirements; the need for transparency of intent, function, status, and capabilities/limitations; concern regarding the flexibility and adaptability of the technology; cyber security/hacking potential; concern regarding the added workload associated with the technology; concern for the lack of human oversight/decision making capacity; and doubts regarding the systems’ operational effectiveness. Additionally, the pilots noted several positive aspects of the proposed technologies including: added protection during last ditch evasive maneuvers; positive views of existing fielded technologies such as the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System; the potential for added operational capabilities; the potential to transfer risk to the robotic asset and reduce risk to pilots; and the potential for AI to participate in the entire mission process (planning-execution-debriefing).

These systems could offer an identical environment for remote communication just as a face-to-face meeting. However, two critical issues are pointed out. One is lack of existence for remote participants and the other one is lack of relationship with remote participants. This study proposes an idea of active display interface for remote communication system called ARM-COMS (ARm-supported eMbodied COmmunication Monitor System) to tackle these issues. The concept of an active display is to enhance the existence of a digital object shown in the screen by physical movement of the display. The idea of ARM-COMS comes from this concept, and enhances the existence of a remote person by mimicking the physical movement of the remote person using the active display. In addition to this basic feature, ARM-COMS shows the relationship with the remote person by an entrainment control of the active display.

It has been shown that, although complicated, these problems can be formulated as a set of equations and the key is to find the zeros of them. Zeroing neural networks (ZNN), as a class of neural networks particularly dedicated to find zeros of equations, have played an indispensable role in the online solution of time-varying problem in the past years and many fruitful research outcomes have been reported in the literatures. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the research on ZNNs, including continuous-time and discrete-time ZNN models for various problems solving as well as their applications in motion planning and control of redundant manipulators, tracking control of chaotic systems, or even populations control in mathematical biosciences. By considering the fact that real-time performance is highly demanded for time-varying problems in practice, stability and convergence analyses of different continuous-time ZNN models are reviewed in detail in a unified way.

First, we describe the spectrum of medical robots in minimally invasive surgery and teleechography applications and particularly the variety of kinematic architectures used. We present the robots and their kinematic architectures and highlight differences that occur in each medical application. We perform a statistical analysis which can serve as a resource in topological synthesis for each specific medical application. Safety is an important specification in medical robotics, and for that reason we show the means used to take into account this constraint. This study demonstrates that the nature of medical robots implies specific requirements leading to different kinematic structures. The statistical analysis gives information on choice of kinematic structures for medical applications (minimally invasive surgery and echography).

These microrobots, having a 5mm × 2mm footprint, are formed from silicon with integrated thin-film lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) and high-aspect-ratio parylene-C polymer microactuation elements. The in-chip dynamics of the microrobots are measured when actuated with tethered electrical signal to characterize the resonant behavior of different parts of the robot and its piezoelectric actuation. Out-of-chip robot motion is then stimulated by external vibration after the robot has been detached from its silicon tethers, which removes access to external power but permits sustained translation over a surface. A dynamic model for robot and ground interaction is presented to explain robot locomotion in the vibrating field using the in-chip measurements of actuator dynamics and additional dynamic properties obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) and other design information. The model accounts for the microscale interaction between the robot and ground, for multiple resonances of the robot leg, and for rigid robot body motion of the robot chassis in five degrees-of-freedom. For each mode, the motions in vertical and lateral direction are coupled. Simulation of this dynamic model with the first three resonant modes (one predominantly lateral and two predominantly vertical) of each leg shows a good match with experimental results for the motion of the robot on a vibrating surface, and allows exploration of influence of small-scale forces such as adhesion on robot locomotion. Further predictions for future autonomous microrobot performance based on the dynamic phenomena observed are discussed. © 2017 by ASME.",,"Aspect ratio; Data communication equipment; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dynamic models; Dynamics; Ferroelectric ceramics; Finite element method; Robots; Semiconducting lead compounds; Silicon; Structural dynamics; Design information; External vibrations; High aspect ratio; Lateral directions; Lead zirconate titanate; Multiple resonances; Piezoelectric actuation; Resonant behavior; Machine design",2-s2.0-85029771887

Recently, with the development of medical engineering technology, several evaluation methods have been proposed. Among them, kinematic analysis, an unsupervised and data-based method, has been accepted by many researchers. However, this method is still limited by the number of metrics and unconvinced scoring system. This paper aims to propose a new evaluation method to assess surgical skills efficiently and objectively. Methods: this research proposed an efficient and effective surgical skills evaluation algorithm which used the trajectories of instrument tip and dynamic time warping (DTW) to provide trainees with real-time and summative feedback. The optimum trajectories based on ‘Therbligs’ theory was designed as a template. DTW algorithm was used to align actual trajectories to optimum trajectories with an evaluating indicator designed to emphasize the crucial motion features in surgical skills evaluation. The real-time feedback was obtained through a sliding time window to help trainees improve learning efficiency. Results: experts (n = 2) and novices (n = 8) were invited to complete the peg transfer tasks and 60 instrument tip trajectories were assessed by the proposed algorithm. Significant differences between different groups were observed (experts’ right trajectories versus experts’ left trajectories, p = 0.0002; experts’ right trajectories versus novices’ right trajectories, p = 0.0124). In addition, evaluation results of trajectories with operational mistakes were significantly different from those of others. Conclusions: the proposed evaluation method showed its advantages in distinguishing and evaluating surgical performance. Given its ability to evaluate the performance based on kinematic information, the proposed evaluation method can be further developed in the future. Furthermore, because the proposed method can provide real-time feedback, it also has the potential to be a monitoring system in operation room. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic time warping; Motion features; Real-time feedback; Robotic skills assessment; Surgical training","Biomedical engineering; Kinematics; Personnel training; Robotics; Surgery; Surgical equipment; Trajectories; Transplantation (surgical); Dynamic time warping; Evaluating indicators; Kinematic information; Minimally invasive surgery; Motion features; New evaluation methods; Real-time feedback; Surgical training; Robotic surgery; Article; feedback system; human; laparoscopic surgery; learning; physician attitude; residency education; robot assisted surgery; surgical training",2-s2.0-85029695744

In the Radio Frequency domain, this is currently addressed by antennas that unfold or deploy on-orbit. However, in the optical and infrared domains, this is a significantly more challenging problem, and has up to now either been addressed by simply having large monolithic mirrors (which are fundamentally limited by the volume and mass lifting capacity of any launch vehicle) or by complex ‘semi-folding’ designs such as the James Webb Space Telescope. An alternative is to consider a fractionated instrument which is launched as a collection of individual smaller elements which are then assembled (or self-assemble) once in space, to form a much larger overall instrument. SSTL has been performing early concept assessment work on such systems for high resolution science observations from high orbits (potentially also for persistent surveillance of Earth). A point design of a 25 m sparse aperture (annular ring) telescope is presented. Key characteristics of 1) multiple small elements launched separately and 2) on-orbit assembly to form a larger instrument are included in the architecture. However, on-orbit assembly brings its own challenges in terms of guidance navigation and control, robotics, docking mechanisms, system control and data handling, optical alignment and stability, and many other elements. The number and type of launchers used, and the technologies and systems used heavily affect the outcome and general cost of the telescope.

The drawbacks are the inability to plan under uncertain dynamic environments, non-optimality, failure in crowded complex situations, and difficulty in predicting the velocity vector of obstacles. This study aims (1) to develop a new predictive method to avoid static and dynamic obstacles in planning the path of a mobile robot in unknown dynamic environments in which the obstacles are moving and their speed profiles are not pre-identified, to find a safe path and to react rapidly and (2) to integrate a decision-making process with the predictive behavior of the velocity vector of obstacles by using the sensory system information of the robot. Information on the locations, shapes, and velocities of static and dynamic obstacles is presumed to be unavailable. Such information is determined online using rangefinder sensors. Thus, the robot recognizes free directions that lead it toward its destination and keep it safe and prevent collision with obstacles. Extensive simulations confirm the efficiency of the suggested approach and its success in handling complex and extremely dynamic environments that contain various obstacle shapes. Findings indicate that the proposed method exhibits attractive features, such as high optimality, high stability, low running time, and zero failure rates.

In this article we investigate a learning mechanism, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), which is very reliable and hence an important candidate for real-world deployment even on safety-critical systems such as space robots. To demonstrate this reliability, we introduce a novel SSL setup that allows a stereo vision equipped robot to cope with the failure of one of its cameras. The setup learns to estimate average depth using a monocular image, by using the stereo vision depths from the past as trusted ground truth. We present preliminary results from an experiment on the International Space Station (ISS) performed with the MIT/NASA SPHERES VERTIGO satellite. The presented experiments were performed on October 8th, 2015 on board the ISS. The main goals were (1) data gathering, and (2) navigation based on stereo vision. First the astronaut Kimiya Yui moved the satellite around the Japanese Experiment Module to gather stereo vision data for learning. Subsequently, the satellite freely explored the space in the module based on its (trusted) stereo vision system and a pre-programmed exploration behavior, while simultaneously performing the self-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation on board. The two main goals were successfully achieved, representing the first online learning robotic experiments in space. These results lay the groundwork for a follow-up experiment in which the satellite will use the learned single-camera depth estimation for autonomous exploration in the ISS, and are an advancement towards future space robots that continuously improve their navigation capabilities over time, even in harsh and completely unknown space environments. © 2017 IAA","Monocular depth estimation; Persistent self-supervised learning; Space robotics; Stereo vision","Cameras; Computer vision; Distance education; Learning systems; Robotics; Robots; Safety engineering; Satellites; Space research; Space stations; Stereo image processing; Supervised learning; Autonomous exploration; Depth Estimation; Enabling technologies; International Space stations; Japanese experiment modules; Real world deployment; Safety critical systems; Space robotics; Stereo vision",2-s2.0-85026883328

Data Sources Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving people with SCI that compared robot-assisted upper limbs or lower limbs training with a control of other treatment approach or no treatment. We included studies involving people with complete or incomplete SCIs. Study Selection We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library), and Embase to August 2016. Bibliographies of relevant articles on the effect of body-weight–supported treadmill training on subjects with SCI were screened to avoid missing relevant articles from the search of databases. Data Extraction All kinds of objective assessments concerning physical ability, mobility, and/or functional ability were included. Assessments could be clinical tests (ie, 6-minute walk test, FIM) or laboratory tests (ie, gait analysis). Subjective outcome measures were excluded from this review. Data Synthesis Eleven RCT studies involving 443 subjects were included in the study. Meta-analysis was performed on the included studies. Walking independence (3.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], −4.92 to −2.53; P&lt;.00001; I2=38%) and endurance (53.32m; 95% CI, −73.15 to −33.48; P&lt;.00001; I2=0%) were found to have better improvement in robot-assisted training groups. Lower limb robot-assisted training was also found to be as effective as other types of body-weight–supported training. There is a lack of upper limb robot-assisted training studies; therefore, performing a meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions Robot-assisted training is an adjunct therapy for physical and functional recovery for patients with SCI. Future high-quality studies are warranted to investigate the effects of robot-assisted training on functional and cardiopulmonary recovery of patients with SCI. © 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","Exoskeleton device; Rehabilitation; Spinal cord injuries","body weight; electrostimulation; endurance; gait; human; intermethod comparison; laboratory test; meta analysis; outcome assessment; oxygen consumption; physical capacity; physiotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; robot assisted training; robotics; six minute walk test; spinal cord injury; walking",2-s2.0-85028312613

Patients and Methods: We identified 348 patients from March 2005 to December 2013 at six institutions. Data on all cases of laparoscopic (n = 85) and robot-assisted PN (n = 263) performed were retrospectively gathered. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were used to identify the associations between various time points of PRF and the RAIV, as a continuous variable. Results: The mean (sd) RAIV was 24.2 (29.2) cm3. The mean preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the eGFRs at postoperative day 1, 6 and 36 months after PN were 91.0 and 76.8, 80.2 and 87.7 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. In multivariable linear regression analysis, the amount of decline in PRF at follow-up was significantly correlated with the RAIV (β 0.261, 0.165, 0.260 at postoperative day 1, 6 and 36 months after PN, respectively). This study has the limitation of its retrospective nature. Conclusion: Preoperatively calculated RAIV significantly correlates with the amount of decline in PRF during long-term follow-up. The RAIV could lead our research to the level of prediction of the amount of PRF decline after PN and thus would be appropriate for assessing the technical advantages of emerging techniques. © 2017 The Authors BJU International © 2017 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","kidney function; nephrectomy; renal cancer","adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; follow up; human; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; laparoscopic surgery; long term care; major clinical study; male; minimally invasive surgery; nephron volume loss; outcome assessment; partial nephrectomy; patient safety; postoperative care; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; renal system parameters; resected and ischemic volume; retrospective study; robot assisted surgery; treatment planning; conservative treatment; glomerulus filtration rate; kidney; Kidney Neoplasms; middle aged; nephrectomy; pathophysiology; preoperative care; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Nephrectomy; Organ Sparing Treatments; Preoperative Care; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85025107099

In this method, the predictor has been utilized to estimate the future state variables of the controlled system to compensate for the time-varying delay. The T2FNN is used to estimate some unknown nonlinear functions to construct the controller. By introducing a new adaptive compensator for the predictor and controller, the effects of the external disturbance, estimation errors of the unknown nonlinear functions, and future sate estimation errors have been eliminated. In the proposed method, using an appropriate Lyapunov function, the stability analysis as well as the adaptation laws is carried out for the T2FNN parameters in a way that all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded and the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically. Moreover, compared to the related existence predictive controllers, as the number of T2FNN estimators are reduced, the computation time in the online applications decreases. In the proposed method, T2FNN is used due to its ability to effectively model uncertainties, which may exist in the rules and data measured by the sensors. The proposed T2FNNP controller is applied to a nonlinear inverted pendulum and single link robot manipulator systems with input time-varying delay and compared with a type-1 fuzzy sliding predictive (T1FSP) controller.

The key problem is to guide the car to the destination in real-time with a safe and obstacle free path in real-world environments. We propose an innovative self-driving car navigation approach that incorporates a VFH (Vector Field Histogram) local path planner adapted for modern 3D laser scanners and a global path planner using satellite positioning and digital map along with a custom built PID controller (Proportional Integral Derivative controller). Since classical path planning methods such as VFH are often used on small robots with ultrasonic rangefinders or in simulation based environments, we applied the VFH method to a real self-driving car with two different LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) configurations. The quantitative results from extensive experiments indicate that the developed VFH method with the modern real-time 3D LiDAR generally outperform the conventional LIDAR in terms of efficiency, accuracy and reliability. In addition, the tracks produced by 3D LIDAR are more convergent, smooth and consistent than the other configuration. The maximum position deviation for the VFH with 3D LiDAR is 0.28 m and −0.16 m while the deviation for the other low-cost solution is 0.88 m and −0.49 m respectively. The global path planner can provide an accuracy of within 1 meter most of the time. The proposed approach is successfully implemented and tested on our self-driving car which took part in the national self-driving car competitions in recent years, and ranked No.3 and 4. in the future challenge 2014 self-driving car competition in China. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Autonomous vehicle; LiDAR; Path planning; Satellite navigation; Self-driving; Vector field histogram","Air navigation; Graphic methods; Laser applications; Motion planning; Navigation; Proportional control systems; Robot programming; Robots; Scanning; Three term control systems; Tracking (position); Two term control systems; Ultrasonic applications; Autonomous Vehicles; LIDAR (light detection and ranging); Proportional integral derivative controllers; Real world environments; Satellite navigation; Satellite positioning; Self drivings; Vector field histograms; Optical radar",2-s2.0-85000870064

Firstly, the paper applies the Batesonian ecology of mind for constructing a unified roboethical framework which endorses a flat ontology embracing multiple forms of agency, borrowing elements from Floridi’s information ethics, classic virtue ethics, Felix Guattari’s ecosophy, Braidotti’s posthumanism, and the Japanese animist doctrine of Rinri. The proposed framework wishes to act as a pragmatic solution to the endless dispute regarding the nature of consciousness or the natural/artificial dichotomy and as a further argumentation against the recognition of future artificial agency as a potential existential threat. Secondly, schismogenic analysis is employed to describe the emergence of the hostile human–robot cultural contact, tracing its origins in the early scientific discourse of man–machine symbiosis up to the contemporary countermeasures against superintelligent agents. Thirdly, Bateson’s double bind theory is utilized as an analytic methodological tool of humanity’s collective agency, leading to the hypothesis of collective schizophrenic symptomatology, due to the constancy and intensity of confronting messages emitted by either proponents or opponents of artificial intelligence. The double bind’s treatment is the mirroring “therapeutic double bind,” and the article concludes in proposing the conceptual pragmatic imperative necessary for such a condition to follow: humanity’s conscience of habitualizing danger and familiarization with its possible future extinction, as the result of a progressive blurrification between natural and artificial agency, succeeded by a totally non-organic intelligent form of agency. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","Artificial agents; Double bind; Ecology of mind; Roboethics; Schismogenesis; Virtue ethics","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Ecology; Intelligent robots; Philosophical aspects; Artificial agents; Double bind; Roboethics; Schismogenesis; Virtue ethics; Bins",2-s2.0-84994545365

Its application for large tumors remains controversial. In this study, we evaluated the safety and feasibility of RAT for large thymomas in comparison with transsternal thymectomy (ST). Methods A single institution database was reviewed for patients who underwent RAT for thymoma of 4 cm or larger between 2004 and 2016. Propensity scores were applied to match RAT with ST patients, based on age, sex, tumor size, and Masaoka stage. Perioperative outcomes were compared. Results Twenty patients (15 women and 5 men, median age 59 years) underwent RAT for a large thymoma (median size 6.0 cm). A right-sided approach was used in 14 patients (70%). A control group of 34 ST patients (median size 6.7 cm) had similar Masaoka staging (p = 0.64). Combined resection of adjacent structures, including pericardium, lung, and phrenic nerve, were frequently performed in both groups (50% RAT versus 47% ST, p = 0.83). RAT patients had lower blood loss (25 mL versus 150 mL, p = 0.001), were more frequently managed with a single chest tube (85% versus 56%, p = 0.027), and had a shorter median length of stay (3 days versus 4 days, p = 0.034). There were no perioperative deaths and no major vascular injuries. Three RAT patients (15%) were converted to open approach. Overall complication rates were similar between RAT and ST patients (15% versus 24%, p = 0.45). No difference was seen in R0 resection rates (90% versus 85%, p = 0.62). Conclusions RAT can be performed safely and effectively in a radical fashion for large thymomas.

Our communication system comprises a chemoemitter module that encodes information by producing volatile pheromone components and a chemoreceiver module that decodes the transmitted ratiometric information via polymer-coated piezoelectric Surface Acoustic Wave Resonator (SAWR) sensors. The inspiration for such a system is based on the pheromone-based communication between insects. Ten features are extracted from the SAWR sensor response and analysed using multi-variate classification techniques, i.e., Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Multilayer Perception Neural Network (MLPNN) methods, and an optimal feature subset is identified. A combination of steady state and transient features of the sensor signals showed superior performances with LDA and MLPNN. Although MLPNN gave excellent results reaching 100% recognition rate at 400 s, over all time stations PNN gave the best performance based on an expanded data-set with adjacent neighbours. In this case, 100% of the pheromone mixtures were successfully identified just 200 s after they were first injected into the wind tunnel.

This focus on technology makes it difficult to compare systems&#x0027; concepts; moreover, it led to different views on tele-immersion in different fields, such as remotely controlled robots, immersive video conferencing, and tele-collaboration. In this work, we give a general, structured principle to describe the conceptual part of any tele-immersion system. This principle naturally unifies the different views on tele-immersion. Our idea is based on the insight that, in order to be general, immersion must be described separately for each direction of communication. Using this principle, we define a typology, which enables the comparison and enumeration of tele-immersion concepts. We apply this typology to survey the concepts of existing tele-immersion systems and thereby demonstrate how three well-known tele-immersive scenarios --- Marvin Minsky&#x0027;s tele-operated robot, the Office of the Future, and the asymmetric Beaming scenario --- integrate naturally.

There have been few reports on the repair of multiple aneurysms conducted with the Da Vinci robot-assisted surgical platform (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA), especially for those located in renal artery primary bifurcations. Case presentation: We report our experience in the surgical management of two expanding right-sided RAAs in a 64-year-old man using a robot-assisted laparoscopic approach. Two aneurysms were located in renal artery primary bifurcations, whose diameter was 1.8 and 1.2 cm. The aneurysms were resected and the renal artery branch reconstructed by in situ arteriorrhaphy. The operation lasted for 2 h and 35 min with a warm ischemia time of 26 min and estimated blood loss of 150 ml. The hospital stay was 6 days. The computed tomography (CT) scan performed 2 months after the surgery showed resolution of the aneurysms. Additionally, split renal function indicated the preservation of right renal function in the follow-up period. Conclusions: The robot-assisted laparoscopic procedure is a safe and effective surgical technique, which may be considered as an alternative to open surgery for complex multiple RAAs in the future. © 2017 The Author(s).","Case report; Reconstruction; Renal artery aneurysms; Renovascular disease; Robotic surgery",,2-s2.0-85031693895

Thus, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials to assess which approach is better. Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, CNKI and WanFang were systematically searched to identify potentially eligible articles. Main endpoints containing the accuracy of pedicle screw implantation and proximal facet joint violation were evaluated as risk ratio (RR) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), while radiation exposure and surgical duration were presented as mean difference (MD) or standard mean difference (SMD). Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Six studies involving 158 patients (688 pedicle screws) in robot-assisted group and 148 patients (672 pedicle screws) in freehand group were identified matching our study. The Grade A accuracy rate in robot-assisted group was superior to freehand group (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00, 1.06; P = 0.04), but the Grade A + B accuracy rate did not differ between the two groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99, 1.02; P = 0.29). With regard to proximal facet joint violation, the combined results suggested that robot-assisted group was associated with significantly fewer proximal facet joint violation than freehand group (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01, 0.55; P = 0.01). As was the radiation exposure, our findings suggested that robot-assisted technique could significantly reduce the intraoperative radiation time (MD − 12.38, 95% CI − 17.95, − 6.80; P < 0.0001) and radiation dosage (SMD − 0.64, 95% CI − 0.85, − 0.43; P < 0.00001). But the overall surgical duration was longer in robot-assisted group than conventional freehand group (MD 20.53, 95% CI 5.17, 35.90; P = 0.009). Conclusions: The robot-assisted technique was associated with equivalent accuracy rate of pedicle screw implantation, fewer proximal facet joint violation, less intraoperative radiation exposure but longer surgical duration than freehand technique.

In recent years, machines have surpassed humans in the performance of certain specific tasks, such as some aspects of image recognition. Although it is unlikely that machines will exhibit broadly-applicable intelligence comparable to or exceeding that of humans in the near future, experts forecast that rapid progress in the field of specialized AI will continue, with machines reaching and exceeding human performance on an increasing number of tasks. Simultaneous interpreting, being among the most complex of human cognitive/linguistic activities, with all the associated ergonomic elements, has been discussed profusely as one of the most likely to be taken over by AI in a couple of years. Given that so much has to be there simultaneously, i. e. anticipation, restoration of the implicit-explicit balance, and communicative re-packaging ('re-ostension'1) of the discourse, simultaneous interpreting (SI) has yet to be fully explained, not the least the rich pragmatic information guiding the construction of the appropriate contexts and the speaker's underlying intentionalities, which is the centre piece of SI, given the illusive nature of meaning assembly could be quite beyond even the most intelligent robots.

However, while considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of their technological realization, the ability of robots to interact with humans in an intuitive and social way is still quite limited. An important challenge for social robotics is to determine how to design robots that can perceive the user's needs, feelings, and intentions, and adapt to users over a broad range of cognitive abilities. It is conceivable that if robots were able to adequately demonstrate these skills, humans would eventually accept them as social companions. We argue that the best way to achieve this is using a systematic experimental approach based on behavioral and physiological neuroscience methods such as motion/eye-tracking, electroencephalography, or functional near-infrared spectroscopy embedded in interactive human-robot paradigms. This approach requires understanding how humans interact with each other, how they perform tasks together and how they develop feelings of social connection over time, and using these insights to formulate design principles that make social robots attuned to the workings of the human brain. In this review, we put forward the argument that the likelihood of artificial agents being perceived as social companions can be increased by designing them in a way that they are perceived as intentional agents that activate areas in the human brain involved in social-cognitive processing. We first review literature related to social-cognitive processes and mechanisms involved in human-human interactions, and highlight the importance of perceiving others as intentional agents to activate these social brain areas. We then discuss how attribution of intentionality can positively affect human-robot interaction by (a) fostering feelings of social connection, empathy and prosociality, and by (b) enhancing performance on joint human-robot tasks. Lastly, we describe circumstances under which attribution of intentionality to robot agents might be disadvantageous, and discuss challenges associated with designing social robots that are inspired by neuroscientific principles. © 2017 Wiese, Metta and Wykowska.","Attribution of intentionality; Human-robot interaction; Mind perception; Social neuroscience; Social robotics",,2-s2.0-85030532644

Widespread acceptability of mobile service robots in daily life is hindered by robot's inability to navigate in crowded and dynamic human environments in a socially acceptable way that would guarantee human safety and comfort. In this paper, we propose an effective proactive social motion model (PSMM) that enables a mobile service robot to navigate safely and socially in crowded and dynamic environments. The proposed method considers not only human states (position, orientation, motion, field of view, and hand poses) relative to the robot but also social interactive information about human-object and human group interactions. This allows development of the PSMM that consists of elements of an extended social force model and a hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle technique. The PSMM is then combined with a path planning technique to generate a motion planning system that drives a mobile robot in a socially acceptable manner and produces respectful and polite behaviors akin to human movements. Note to Practitioners - In this paper, we validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed proactive social motion model (PSMM) through both simulation and real-world experiments under the newly proposed human comfortable safety indices. To do that, we first implemented the entire navigation system using the open-source robot operating system. We then installed it in a simulated robot model and conducted experiments in a simulated shopping mall-like environment to verify its effectiveness. We also installed the proposed algorithm on our mobile robot platform and conducted experiments in our office-like laboratory environment. Our results show that the developed socially aware navigation framework allows a mobile robot to navigate safely, socially, and proactively while guaranteeing human safety and comfort in crowded and dynamic environments. In this paper, we examined the proposed PSMM with a set of predefined parameters selected based on our empirical experiences about the robot mechanism and selected social environment. However, in fact a mobile robot might need to adapt to various contextual and cultural situations in different social environments. Thus, it should be equipped with an online adaptive interactive learning mechanism allowing the robot to learn to auto-adjust their parameters according to such embedded environments. Using machine learning techniques, e.g., inverse reinforcement learning [1] to optimize the parameter set for the PSMM could be a promising research direction to improve adaptability of mobile service robots in different social environments. In the future, we will evaluate the proposed framework based on a wider variety of scenarios, particularly those with different social interaction situations and dynamic environments. Furthermore, various kinds of social cues and signals introduced in [2] and [3] will be applied to extend the proposed framework in more complicated social situations and contexts. Last but not least, we will investigate different machine learning techniques and incorporate them in the PSMM in order to allow the robot to automatically adapt to diverse social environments. © 2017 IEEE.","Human comfortable safety; mobile service robots; proactive social motion model (PSMM); social robots; socially aware robot navigation","Behavioral research; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Mobile robots; Mobile telecommunication systems; Motion planning; Navigation; Robot programming; Robots; Dynamic environments; Interactive informations; Mobile service robots; Motion modeling; Path planning techniques; Reciprocal velocity obstacles; Robot navigation; Social robots; Economic and social effects",2-s2.0-85028458074

To overcome the high disturbance, a new underwater robot with tilting thrusters was proposed previously, which can compensate for disturbance by focusing the thrusting force in the direction of the disturbance. However, the tilting motion of the thrusters makes the system nonlinear, and the limited tilting speed sometimes makes the robot unstable. Therefore, an optimized controller is necessary. A new positioning controller is proposed for this robot using a vector decomposition method. Based on the dynamic model, the nonlinear force input term of the tilting thrusters is decomposed in the horizontal and vertical directions. Based on the decomposition, the solution is determined by a pseudo-inverse and null-space solution. Using the characteristics of the decomposed input matrix, the final solution can be found by solving a simple second-order algebraic equation to overcome the limitations of the tilting speed. The positioning was simulated to validate the proposed controller by comparing the results with a switching-based controller. Tracking results are also presented. In future work, a high-level control strategy will be developed to take advantage of the tilting thrusters by focusing the forcing direction toward the disturbance with a limited stability margin. © 2017, Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems and The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Decomposition; positioning control; tilting thruster; underwater robot","Decomposition; Inverse problems; Robots; Algebraic equations; High level control; Optimized controllers; Positioning control; tilting thruster; Underwater robots; Vector decompositions; Vertical direction; Controllers",2-s2.0-85025118672

Unsurprisingly, the answer depends on the exact formulation of the safety objective, as well as the physical capabilities and limitations of the robot and the obstacles. Because uncertainties about the exact future behavior of a robot's environment make this a challenging problem, we formally verify corresponding controllers and provide rigorous safety proofs justifying why the robots can never collide with the obstacle in the respective physical model. To account for ground robots in which different physical phenomena are important, we analyze a series of increasingly strong properties of controllers for increasingly rich dynamics and identify the impact that the additional model parameters have on the required safety margins. We analyze and formally verify: (i) static safety, which ensures that no collisions can happen with stationary obstacles; (ii) passive safety, which ensures that no collisions can happen with stationary or moving obstacles while the robot moves; (iii) the stronger passive-friendly safety, in which the robot further maintains sufficient maneuvering distance for obstacles to avoid collision as well; and (iv) passive orientation safety, which allows for imperfect sensor coverage of the robot, i.e., the robot is aware that not everything in its environment will be visible. We formally prove that safety can be guaranteed despite sensor uncertainty and actuator perturbation. We complement these provably correct safety properties with liveness properties: we prove that provably safe motion is flexible enough to let the robot navigate waypoints and pass intersections. To account for the mixed influence of discrete control decisions and the continuous physical motion of the ground robot, we develop corresponding hybrid system models and use differential dynamic logic theorem-proving techniques to formally verify their correctness. Since these models identify a broad range of conditions under which control decisions are provably safe, our results apply to any control algorithm for ground robots with the same dynamics. As a demonstration, we also synthesize provably correct runtime monitor conditions that check the compliance of any control algorithm with the verified control decisions. © SAGE Publications.","ground robot; hybrid systems; navigation; obstacle avoidance; Provable correctness; theorem proving","Collision avoidance; Compliance control; Controllers; Formal verification; Hybrid systems; Navigation; Theorem proving; Differential dynamic logic; Ground robot; Hybrid system models; Liveness properties; Physical capabilities; Provable correctness; Sensor uncertainty; Stationary obstacles; Robots",2-s2.0-85032432340

Although a variety of robots have been proposed as possible therapeutic tools, the physical appearances of humanoid robots currently used in therapy with these patients are highly varied. Very little is known about how these varied designs are experienced by individuals with ASD. In this study, we systematically evaluated preferences regarding robot appearance in a group of 16 individuals with ASD (ages 10–17). Our data suggest that there may be important differences in preference for different types of robots that vary according to interaction type for individuals with ASD. Specifically, within our pilot sample, children with higher-levels of reported ASD symptomatology reported a preference for specific humanoid robots to those perceived as more mechanical or mascot-like. The findings of this pilot study suggest that preferences and reactions to robotic interactions may vary tremendously across individuals with ASD. Future work should evaluate how such differences may be systematically measured and potentially harnessed to facilitate meaningful interactive and intervention paradigms. © 2017 Kumazaki et al.

However, the failure rate of system development is notoriously high. Even when development efforts do succeed, they often do so with cost overruns and compromises in system performance. As a result, large amounts of money are wasted in defense acquisition, leaving the nation both poorer and less secure than it could be. Though this problem is certainly multi-faceted, one way to approach the problem is to provide better systems engineering education to engineers. Systems engineering skills, generally considered to be key to the successful development of large scale systems, often require many years to acquire. However, recent research investigates the theory that these years can be reduced through the use of simulation software. This paper describes Project Robot, a defense systems engineering simulator designed to facilitate the acquisition of systems engineering skills at an increased rate. Project Robot was the co-winner of the 2010 Experience Accelerator international systems engineering simulator competition held at Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ. The development of this simulator is a first step towards the design and development of experience accelerating simulations and software games that push the boundaries of engineering education to the next level using modern computer software techniques. The paper introduces the concepts of systems engineering and systems thinking, then discusses the Project Robot game concept, design, theory, and implementation, including detailed screen captures. The paper concludes with a discussion of the future of Project Robot and related research efforts to improve systems engineering education through simulation. © ACPIL.","Educational games; Experience accelerator; Experiential learning; Game-based learning; Simulation; System analysis and design; System dynamics; Systems approach; Systems engineering; Systems engineering and theory; Systems engineering education; Systems thinking; Systems thinking assessment",,2-s2.0-85032017490

In order to gain verisimilitude and flexibility, the robotic tongue is simplified from a biological tongue and is made of soft materials, including silicone rubber forming the extensible layer and polydimethylsiloxane composing the less extensible layer. The robotic tongue can deform when pressurized in a series of embedded chambers due to the difference in strain of the two layers. General deformation results are obtained through finite-element method simulations and initial parameters of the structural design are improved. The robotic tongue is fabricated with 3-D printed molds by curing the silicone rubber at room temperature. The pneumatic actuation system is mainly composed of solenoid directional valves and pressure sensors. Five types of basic deformation are achieved including roll-up, roll-down, elongation, groove, and twist. Furthermore, a surface reconstruction method based on multisurface merging is proposed to describe the deformed surface of the robotic tongue quantitatively, which will be used in the surface-based motion control in the future. Motion tracking is carried out to verify the reconstruction results. The results of verification indicate that the proposed method is qualified to reconstruct the surface of the robotic tongue. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Motion tracking; pneumatic actuation; robotic tongue; soft robotics; surface reconstruction","3D printers; Biological materials; Deformation; Elastomers; Human robot interaction; Motion analysis; Muscle; Pneumatics; Pressure sensors; Robotics; Robots; Rubber; Silicones; Solenoid valves; Structural design; Valves (mechanical); Motion tracking; Pneumatic actuation; Pneumatic system; Soft robotics; Tongue; Surface reconstruction",2-s2.0-85028969803

Methods: Between July 2009 and October 2016, 31 patients were enrolled in this clinical trial. Results: The primary lesions were located in the tonsils of 27 patients and in the base of the tongue of 4 patients. Of the 31 patients, 16 (51.6%) were classified as T3 and 15 patients (48.4%) as T4a. Three patients (9.7%) had stage 3 disease, and 28 (90.3%) had stage 4 disease. The 5-year overall survival rate was 78.7%; the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 85%; and the 5-year disease-free survival rate was 80.8%. At the final follow-up visit, 26 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, and 1 was alive with disease. Four patients died during the study: two of tumor-node-metastasis (TNM)-related disease and two of another condition. All the patients tolerated an oral diet at an average of 7.4 days postoperatively. At the subjective swallowing evaluation using the Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale score, 83.9% of the patients exhibited favorable outcomes. No patient was permanently dependent on a feeding tube. All the patients breathed and phonated in the absence of a permanent tracheotomy at the final follow-up evaluation.

Unlike recent previous multi-scale place recognition systems that use manually pre-fixed scales, we present a system that adaptively selects the spatial scales. This approach differs from previous multi-scale methods, where place recognition is performed through a non-optimized distance metric in a fixed and pre-determined scale space. Instead, we learn an optimized distance metric which creates a new recognition space for clustering images with similar features while separating those with different features. Consequently, the method exploits the natural spatial scales present in the operating environment. With these adaptive scales, a hierarchical recognition mechanism with multiple parallel channels is then proposed. Each channel performs place recognition from a coarse match to a fine match. We present specific techniques for training each channel to recognize places at varying spatial scales and for combining the place recognition hypotheses from these parallel channels. We also conduct a systematic series of experiments and parameter studies that determine the effect on performance of using different numbers of combined recognition channels. The results demonstrate that the adaptive multi-scale approach outperforms the previous fixed multi-scale approach and is capable of producing better than state of the art performance compared to existing robotic navigation algorithms. The system complexity is linear in the number of places in the reference static map and can realize the online place recognition in mobile robotics on typical dataset sizes We analyze the results and provide theoretical analysis of the performance improvements.

J. Gibson’s concept of affordance, one of the central pillars of ecological psychology, is a truly remarkable idea that provides a concise theory of animal perception predicated on environmental interaction. It is thus not surprising that this idea has also found its way into robotics research as one of the underlying theories for action perception. The success of the theory in this regard has meant that existing research is both abundant and diffuse by virtue of the pursuit of multiple different paths and techniques with the common goal of enabling robots to learn, perceive, and act upon affordances. Up until now, there has existed no systematic investigation of existing work in this field. Motivated by this circumstance, in this article, we begin by defining a taxonomy for computational models of affordances rooted in a comprehensive analysis of the most prominent theoretical ideas of import in the field. Subsequently, after performing a systematic literature review, we provide a classification of existing research within our proposed taxonomy. Finally, by both quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the data resulting from the classification process, we highlight gaps in the research terrain and outline open questions for the investigation of affordances in robotics that we believe will help inform future work, prioritize research goals, and potentially advance the field toward greater robot autonomy. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Affordances; computational models; robotics",,2-s2.0-85029620198

Nevertheless, most are only compatible with a single type of sample holder and puck. Recent work aimed at reducing sample-handling efforts and crystal-alignment times at beamlines has resulted in a new generation of compact and precise sample holders for cryocrystallography: miniSPINE and NewPin [see the companion paper by Papp et al. (2017, Acta Cryst., D73, 829-840)]. With full data collection now possible within seconds at most advanced beamlines, and future fourth-generation synchrotron sources promising to extract data in a few tens of milliseconds, the time taken to mount and centre a sample is rate-limiting. In this context, a versatile and fast sample changer, FlexED8, has been developed that is compatible with the highly successful SPINE sample holder and with the miniSPINE and NewPin sample holders. Based on a six-axis industrial robot, FlexED8 is equipped with a tool changer and includes a novel open sample-storage dewar with a built-in ice-filtering system. With seven versatile puck slots, it can hold up to 112 SPINE sample holders in uni-pucks, or 252 miniSPINE or NewPin sample holders, with 36 samples per puck. Additionally, a double gripper, compatible with the SPINE sample holders and uni-pucks, allows a reduction in the sample-exchange time from 40 s, the typical time with a standard single gripper, to less than 5 s. Computer vision-based sample-transfer monitoring, sophisticated error handling and automatic error-recovery procedures ensure high reliability.

Two testing conditions were compared: walking with the exosuit powered versus walking with the exosuit unpowered. Each condition was 8 minutes in duration.RESULTS: Compared with walking with the exosuit unpowered, walking with the exosuit powered resulted in reductions in hip hiking (27 [6%], P = 0.004) and circumduction (20 [5%], P = 0.004). A relationship between changes in knee flexion and changes in hip hiking was observed (Pearson r = -0.913, P < 0.001).

Space Manipulator Systems (SMSs) are robotic systems made of a platform (which has its own actuators such as thrusters and reaction wheels) equipped with one or more deployable arms. The present paper focuses on the issue of maintaining a stable first contact between the arms terminal parts (i.e. the end-effectors) and a target satellite, before the actual grasp is performed. The selected approach is a modified version of the Impedance Control algorithm, in which the end-effector is controlled in order to make it behave like a mass-spring-damper system regardless of the reaction motion of the base, so to absorb the impact energy. The usual approach consists in considering a point mass target and one-dimensional contact dynamics; however, the contact between the chaser and the target could generate a perturbation on the attitude of the target. On account of this, in the present work a more realistic scenario, consisting in a 2D rigid target and a relevant 2D contact dynamics, is considered. A two-arm configuration of the SMS is modelled and its effectiveness analyzed. The performance of the proposed control architecture is evaluated by means of a co-simulation involving the MSC Adams multibody code (for describing the dynamics of the space robot and target) together with Simulink (for the determination of the control actions). The co-simulation is a particularly useful tool to implement robust control applied to detailed dynamic systems.

This has now become a limiting factor at high-throughput beamlines, where data collection can be performed in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, this lack of precision limits the potential benefits emerging from automated harvesting systems that could provide crystal-position information which would further enhance alignment at beamlines. This situation provided the motivation for the development of a compact and precise sample holder with corresponding pucks, handling tools and robotic transfer protocols. The development process included four main phases: design, prototype manufacture, testing with a robotic sample changer and validation under real conditions on a beamline. Two sample-holder designs are proposed: NewPin and miniSPINE. They share the same robot gripper and allow the storage of 36 sample holders in uni-puck footprint-style pucks, which represents 252 samples in a dry-shipping dewar commonly used in the field. The pucks are identified with human- and machine-readable codes, as well as with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. NewPin offers a crystal-repositioning precision of up to 10 μm but requires a specific goniometer socket. The storage density could reach 64 samples using a special puck designed for fully robotic handling. miniSPINE is less precise but uses a goniometer mount compatible with the current SPINE standard. miniSPINE is proposed for the first implementation of the new standard, since it is easier to integrate at beamlines. An upgraded version of the SPINE sample holder with a corresponding puck named SPINEplus is also proposed in order to offer a homogenous and interoperable system. The project involved several European synchrotrons and industrial companies in the fields of consumables and sample-changer robotics.

The basic target is to generate a collision-free trajectory for each robot from its initial position to the target position. In this paper, we study the trajectory planning for the multirobot systems operating in unstructured and changing environments. Each robot is equipped with some sensors of limited sensing ranges. We propose a fully distributed approach to planning trajectories for such systems. It combines the model predictive control (MPC) strategy and the incremental sequential convex programming (iSCP) method. The MPC framework is applied to detect the local running environment real-timely with the concept of receding horizon. For each robot, a nonlinear programming is built in its current prediction horizon. To construct its own optimization problem, a robot first needs to communicate with its neighbors to retrieve their current states. Then, the robot predicts the neighbors' future positions in the current horizon and constructs the problem without waiting for the prediction information from its neighbors. At last, each robot solves its problem independently via the iSCP method such that the robot can move autonomously. The proposed method is polynomial in its computational complexity.

Therefore, in this study, we selected a topic called ‘Ladybug is going to find a way’ that is familiar to young children and appropriate for learning computational thinking. Based on the an activity-based learning strategy for young children, the activity-based program for computational thinking is consisted through the game using ladybug toys, the robot ladybug and concrete expressive activities. The studies progressed with three young children who were 5 years old and nine young children who were 6 years old. As a result, young children who participated in the computational thinking learning program using an activity-based learning strategy learned the subject with high interest in the class, and we found that this class could help improve the young children’s computational thinking. © 2005 - Ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Activity based learning; Computational thinking; Manipulation; Preschooler; Young children",,2-s2.0-85030316503

Haptic illusions, especially the Size-Weight Illusion (SWI), where the smaller of two equally weighted objects is perceived to be heavier, can have malicious, disturbing or to some extent useful influence on system stability and usability. A within-subjects experiment was conducted with 40 participants and three within-factors (size weight, and movement type), to investigate the occurrence and influence of SWI in bimanual fast-imprecise and slow-precise planar manipulation tasks. The illusion was replicated and an influence on usability was found. Further, different control strategies according to object size and mass (static, compensatory, and mismatch) were analyzed and did not show significant effects on task performance. It appears that either no change in assistance or a change according to object size is advisable.

To generate the alternating motion of the robot bio-inspired thruster, namely a plane fin, a transmission system was designed to replace the direct drive widely adopted in underwater biomimetic vehicles. The mechanical efficiency of two alternative mechanisms capable to actuate the fin were computed according to a preliminary sizing of the robot and its targeted swimming performances. Therefore, the more suitable solution was manufactured and installed aboard. At the same time, a proper navigation, guidance and control architecture (NGC) was designed and then integrated in the robot main controller.

Methods: Inspired by the workflow of the manual FLA therapy, we developed an MRI-conditional robot with two degrees of freedom (DoF) to provide the guidance for laser ablation catheter. This robot is powered by pneumatic turbine motors and encoded with the custom-designed optical encoder. The needle could be inserted manually through the designed robotic system, which keeps the patients inside MRI bore throughout the procedure. The robot hardware is integrated with the custom ablation planning and monitoring software (OncoNav) to provide an iterative treatment plan to cover the whole ablation zone. Virtual tumors were selected in three canine cadavers as targets to validate the performance of the proposed hardware and software system. Results: Phantom studies show that the average targeting error is less than 2mm and the workflow of the entire procedure lasts for 100 minutes. Canine cadaver experiment results show that all the targets were successfully ablated in no more than three administrations.

Allegations of racism and sexism have permeated the conversation as stories surface about search engines delivering job postings for well-paying technical jobs to men and not women, or providing arrest mugshots when keywords such as “black teenagers” are entered. Learning algorithms are evolving; they are often created from parsing through large datasets of online information while having truth labels bestowed on them by crowd-sourced masses. These specialized AI algorithms have been liberated from the minds of researchers and startups, and released onto the public. Yet intelligent though they may be, these algorithms maintain some of the same biases that permeate society. They find patterns within datasets that reflect implicit biases and, in so doing, emphasize and reinforce these biases as global truth. This paper describes specific examples of how bias has infused itself into current AI and robotic systems, and how it may affect the future design of such systems. More specifically, we draw attention to how bias may affect the functioning of (1) a robot peacekeeper, (2) a self-driving car, and (3) a medical robot.

However, biological molecular machines routinely position rather less reactive substrates in order to direct chemical reaction sequences, from sequence-specific synthesis by the ribosome to polyketide synthases, where tethered molecules are passed from active site to active site in multi-enzyme complexes. Artificial molecular machines have been developed for tasks that include sequence-specific oligomer synthesis and the switching of product chirality, a photo-responsive host molecule has been described that is able to mechanically twist a bound molecular guest, and molecular fragments have been selectively transported in either direction between sites on a molecular platform through a ratchet mechanism. Here we detail an artificial molecular machine that moves a substrate between different activating sites to achieve different product outcomes from chemical synthesis. This molecular robot can be programmed to stereoselectively produce, in a sequential one-pot operation, an excess of any one of four possible diastereoisomers from the addition of a thiol and an alkene to an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde in a tandem reaction process. The stereodivergent synthesis includes diastereoisomers that cannot be selectively synthesized through conventional iminium-enamine organocatalysis.

Benefits of robotic training courses have already been acknowledged by the community since manipulation of such systems requires dedicated training. However, robotic surgical simulators remain expensive and require a dedicated human–machine interface. Methods: We present a low-cost contactless optical sensor, the Leap Motion, as a novel control device to manipulate the RAVEN-II robot. We compare peg manipulations during a training task with a contact-based device, the electro-mechanical Sigma.7. We perform two complementary analyses to quantitatively assess the performance of each control method: a metric-based comparison and a novel unsupervised spatiotemporal trajectory clustering. Results: We show that contactless control does not offer as good manipulability as the contact-based. Where part of the metric-based evaluation presents the mechanical control better than the contactless one, the unsupervised spatiotemporal trajectory clustering from the surgical tool motions highlights specific signature inferred by the human–machine interfaces. Conclusions: Even if the current implementation of contactless control does not overtake manipulation with high-standard mechanical interface, we demonstrate that using the optical sensor complete control of the surgical instruments is feasible.

They are slightly larger than regular oral capsules, made up of a biocompatible case and have electronic circuitry and mechanisms to capture and transmit images. In addition, robots with diagnostic features such as in vivo body temperature detection and pH monitoring have also been launched in the market. However, a multi-functional unit that will diagnose and cure diseases inside the body has not yet been realized. A remote controlled capsule that will undertake drug delivery and surgical treatment has not been successfully launched in the market. High cost, inadequate power supply, lack of control over drug release, limited space for drug storage on the capsule, inadequate safety and no mechanisms for active locomotion and anchoring have prevented their entry in the market.

We envisage that engineering-inspired, model-based approaches will help to deal with the high complexity of the human posture control system. Since the methods of system identification and parameter estimation are limited to systems with only a few DoF, our laboratory proposes a heuristic approach that step-by-step increases complexity when creating a hypothetical human-derived control systems in humanoid robots. This system is then compared with the human control in the same test bed, a posture control laboratory. The human-derived control builds upon the identified disturbance estimation and compensation (DEC) mechanism, whose main principle is to support execution of commanded poses or movements by compensating for external or self-produced disturbances such as gravity effects. In previous robotic implementation, up to 3 interconnected DEC control modules were used in modular control architectures separately for the sagittal plane or the frontal body plane and successfully passed balancing and movement tests. In this study we hypothesized that conflict-free movement coordination between the robot's sagittal and frontal body planes emerges simply from the physical embodiment, not necessarily requiring a full body control. Experiments were performed in the 14 DoF robot Lucy Posturob (i) demonstrating that the mechanical coupling from the robot's body suffices to coordinate the controls in the two planes when the robot produces movements and balancing responses in the intermediate plane, (ii) providing quantitative characterization of the interaction dynamics between body planes including frequency response functions (FRFs), as they are used in human postural control analysis, and (iii) witnessing postural and control stability when all DoFs are challenged together with the emergence of inter-segmental coordination in squatting movements. These findings represent an important step toward controlling in the robot in future more complex sensorimotor functions such as walking. © 2017 Lippi and Mergner.","Humanoid robot experiments; Humans; Modular control architecture; Neuromechanical modeling; Sensory-motor system","Anthropomorphic robots; Closed loop control systems; Control systems; Diagnosis; Flight control systems; Frequency response; Heuristic methods; Identification (control systems); Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Robots; Structural analysis; Disturbance estimation; Frequency-response functions; Humanoid robot; Humans; Inter-segmental coordination; Modular control; Quantitative characterization; Sensory-motor systems; Human robot interaction; body position; compensation; controlled study; coordination; gravity sensing; human; human experiment; motor system; quantitative analysis; robotics; walking",2-s2.0-85030163519

The robot workspace, defined by admissible wrist rotation angles, fully includes a circle with a 20 deg radius.

However, the highly interdisciplinary nature of research in this field means that results are disseminated across a broad variety of publications. This review paper aggregates these studies in an effort to distill the state of the art in inspection robotics, as well as to assess outstanding challenges in the field and possibilities for the future.

Establishment of these networks in culture chambers containing multi-electrode arrays allows recording of synaptic activity as well as stimulation. Method: This article describes the embodiment of ex vivo neuronal networks neurons in a closed-loop cybernetic system, consisting of digitized video signals as sensory input and a robot arm as motor output. Results: In this system, the neuronal network essentially functions as a simple central nervous system. This embodied network displays the ability to track a target in a naturalistic environment. These findings underscore that ex vivo neuronal networks can respond to sensory input and direct motor output. Conclusion: These analyses may contribute to optimization of neuronal-computer interfaces for perceptive and locomotive prosthetic applications. Ex vivo networks display critical alterations in signal patterns following treatment with subcytotoxic concentrations of amyloid-beta. Future studies including comparison of tracking accuracy of embodied networks prepared from mice harboring key mutations with those from normal mice, accompanied with exposure to Abeta and/or other neurotoxins, may provide a useful model system for monitoring subtle impairment of neuronal function as well as normal and abnormal development. © 2017 Shultz et al.","Cortical neuronal culture; Cybernetics; Learning; Manus robot arm; Multi-electrode array; Neuronal network; Plasticity; Sensory input",,2-s2.0-85032728600

Principal contributions of the paper are: wavelet descriptor has been applied to extracting moment invariant shape future of hand gestures and possibility theory (PT) has been used for classification of gestures. Preprocessing and extraction of overlapping frames (start and end point of each gesture) are the other major events which have been solved using background modeling and novel gradient method. We have shown that the overlapping frames are helpful for fragmenting a continuous ISL gesture into isolated gestures. These isolated gestures are further processed and classified. During the segmentation process some of the geometrical features like shape and orientation of hand are deformed, which has been overcome by extracting a new moment invariant feature through wavelet descriptor. These features are then combined with the other two features (orientation and speed) and are classified using PT. Here we use PT in place of probability theory because possibility deals with the problem of uncertainty and impression whereas probability handles only uncertainty issues. Experiments have been performed on 20 sentences of continuous ISL gestures having 4000 samples where each sentence having 20 instances. In this dataset 50% samples have been used for training and 50% have been used for testing. From analysis of results we found that the proposed approach gives 92% classification accuracy with 20 subjects on continuous ISL gestures. This result has been compared with the results obtained with other classifiers like Hidden Markov Model and KNN and found 10% increment in the classification rate with proposed approach. These classified gestures are then combined for generating a sentence in the text format which is being matched with the knowledge database of NAO robot which has also increased the classification accuracy. These sentences are further converted in the form of speech or gesture using NAO robot. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Gesture recognition; ISL; NAO robot; Wavelet descriptor","Anthropomorphic robots; Audition; Classification (of information); Gesture recognition; Gradient methods; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Probability; Robots; Statistical tests; Text processing; Classification accuracy; Classification rates; Descriptors; Geometrical features; Hearing-impaired persons; Indian sign languages; Indian sign languages (ISL); Segmentation process; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85028322194

The software simulates translations and rotations of both spacecraft, with the visco-elastic tether being simulated as a lumped-mass model. Thanks to this last feature, tether longitudinal and lateral modes of vibration and tether tension can be accurately assessed. Also, the way the spacecraft motion responds to sudden tether tension spikes can be studied in detail. The code enables the simulation of different scenarios, including space tug missions for deorbit maneuvers in a debris mitigation context and general-purpose tethered formation flight missions. This study aims to validate the software through a representative test campaign performed with the MIT Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) planar air bearing system.

Here we mix robotic setups and natural plants in order to steer the motion behavior of plants while growing. The robotic setup uses a camera to observe the plant and uses a pair of light sources to trigger phototropic response, steering the plant to user-defined targets. An evolutionary robotic approach is used to design a controller for the setup. Initially, preliminary experiments are performed with a simple predetermined controller and a growing bean plant. The plant behavior in response to the simple controller is captured by image processing, and a model of the plant tip dynamics is developed. The model is used in simulation to evolve a robot controller that steers the plant tip such that it follows a number of randomly generated target points. Finally, we test the simulation-evolved controller in the real setup controlling a natural bean plant. The results demonstrate a successful crossing of the reality gap in the setup. The success of the approach allows for future extensions to more complex tasks including control of the shape of plants and pattern formation in multiple plant setups. 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

A definition of what constitutes a robotic thoracic operation and a nomenclature to detail the technique used is needed to accurately compare outcomes. Methods The American Association of Thoracic Surgeons Guideline Committee appointed an expert consensus writing committee to construct definitions and nomenclature for robotic thoracic surgery. A PubMed search was generated and after vetting and review of the literature a consensus statement was reached. Results The proposed definition is: “A robotic thoracic operation is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that does not spread, lift or remove any part of the chest or abdominal wall and is characterized by: the surgeon and the assistant's vision of the operative field is via a monitor only and the patient's tissue is manipulated by robotic instruments that follow a slave like mimic of human hands or thoughts via a computerized system.” In addition, a flexible nomenclature is proposed that should be applicable to current and future robotic systems that details the number of robotic arms used, the types of ports and/or incisions made, the use of insufflation, and the operation performed. Conclusions The American Association of Thoracic Surgeons writing committee proposes a definition and nomenclature for robotic thoracic surgery. Definitions are needed to ensure that future studies accurately compare results and outcomes and nomenclatures allow surgeons and scientists from diverse countries and cultures to use the same language to allow accurate communication. © 2017 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery","lung mediastinal tumor; robotic; surgery technique","aeration; Article; consensus; human; incision; lung lobectomy; lung resection; mediastinum disease; nomenclature; outcome assessment; priority journal; robot assisted surgery; segmentectomy; thorax surgery; wedge resection",2-s2.0-85020683239

Current implementations of the mental simulation paradigm, taken together, computationally address many aspects suggested by cognitive science research. Agents are able to find solutions to nontrivial scenarios in virtual or physical environments. Existing systems also learn new behavior by imitation of others similar to them and model the behavior of different others with the help of specialized models, culminating with the collaboration between agents and humans. Approaches that use self models are able to mentally simulate interaction and to learn about their own physical properties. Multiple mental simulations are used to find solutions to tasks, for truth maintenance, and contradiction detection. However, individual approaches do not cover all of the contexts of mental simulation and most rely on techniques which are only suitable for subsets of obtainable functionality. This review spans through four perspectives on the functionality of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence applications, while linking them to cognitive science research results.

Traditional ionic electroactive polymer actuators for example, ionic-polymer metal composites have a problem with durability in open air due to the evaporation of water contained in the polymer electrolytes, resulting in a corresponding loss of performance. Electrolysis of the water at relatively low operating voltages may cause deterioration of these materials. Ionic liquids are more thermally and electrochemically stable than water, with unique advantages including negligible volatility, low melting point and high ionic conductivity, therefore they can be used in the application of ionic electroactive polymer actuators. In this work, a new ionic electroactive polymer actuator based on ionogel is developed, which can be operated at low driving voltage with high electrochemical stability. In order to investigate the actuation mechanism of the actuator, a general model consisting of an equivalent electrical circuit, an electromechanical coupling term and a mechanical beam model is built up to characterize its interrelated electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties. This model explains the relationship between input voltage and bending displacement of the actuator. Theoretical and experimental results are demonstrated and documented to validate the conclusion that the model can effectively predict the actuation response of the material. The geometric scalability of the model is also investigated, giving support to the design of the soft mechanism based on ionogel. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","electromechanical model; Lonogel based actuator; parameter identification; soft robot","Actuators; Conducting polymers; Electromechanical actuators; Electromechanical coupling; Energy utilization; Identification (control systems); Ionic liquids; Mechanical actuators; Polyelectrolytes; Polymers; Electrochemical stabilities; Electromechanical modeling; Equivalent electrical circuits; Ionic Electroactive polymers; Ionic polymer metal composites; Low energy consumption; Low operating voltage; Soft robot; Electroactive polymer actuators",2-s2.0-85027333005

Recent findings: Technological advancements in imaging modalities have shifted diagnosis from simply demonstrating the fistula to providing anatomic and pathologic information. Furthermore, continued improvement in endoscopic and laparoscopic tools may allow for treatment of fistulas with durable results. Summary: Management of the underlying disease process is key to management of VEF. Enhanced imaging techniques and improved medical therapies have allowed for better optimization prior to surgical therapy improving success rates. Additionally, endoscopic and laparoscopic treatments have allowed for more minimally invasive treatments, challenging the accepted practice of excision and repair of VEF.

Eight pediatric patients who were treated with TORS for TBMs between January 2010 and January 2016 at a tertiary hospital included in the study. All pathologies were congenital lesions: four were lingual thyroglossal ductus cysts (LTGDCs), one was a minor salivary gland tumor, one was a vallecular cyst, one was a bronchogenic cyst, and one was an ectopic thyroid tissue. TORS was performed successfully in all cases. The mean robotic set-up and exposure time was 13.0 ± 2.1 min (range 10–16 min) and the mean robotic surgery time was 8.8 ± 6.9 min (range 4–25 min). Estimated blood loss was lower than 5 ml for one patient and lower than 50 ml for another one. The remaining patients’ estimated blood loss was lower than 10 ml. No patient required tracheostomy intra- or post-operatively. Only one minor complication occurred on day 10 after surgery (minor bleeding), which was resolved without intervention. No major complications or recurrence were observed. Better visualization and small, flexible arms allow surgeons to treat TBM faster and easily using TORS. This leads to decreased morbidity compared to open and transoral endoscopic/microscopic surgical methods. In the future, we believe that TORS may become the gold standard method for the treatment of pediatric TBM with continued development of robotic technology. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Pediatric; Tongue base; Transoral robotic surgery","Article; camera; cancer surgery; child; clinical article; cyst; dissector; female; follow up; human; infant; intraoperative period; laparoscopic surgical instrument; length of stay; lingual thyroid; lung cyst; male; minor saliva gland; mouth gag; needle driver; operation duration; operative blood loss; oral surgery; otorhinolaryngology retractor; pediatric surgery; pleomorphic adenoma; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative period; preschool child; priority journal; recurrence risk; retrospective study; robot assisted surgery; salivary gland tumor; surgeon; surgical equipment; surgical patient; tertiary care center; thyroglossal duct cyst; tongue base mass; tongue disease; tracheostomy; transoral robotic surgery; vallecular cyst",2-s2.0-85020514709

Results: Eighteen articles were identified, providing data on outcomes in 1238 patients. All studies reported only on laparoscopic approaches. Length of procedures ranged between 1.5 to 3.5 h, and length of stay between 4 to 5 days. Data on harms were inconsistently reported and heterogeneous, making estimates of harm tentative and imprecise. Morbidity rates ranged between 5–15%, with mesh complications accounting for 0.5% of patients overall. No mortality was reported after any procedures in a total of 1044 patients. Although inconsistently reported, good or satisfactory outcome occurred in 83% (74–91%) of patients; 86% (20–97%) of patients reported improvements in constipation after laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR). About 2–7% of patients developed anatomical recurrence. Patient selection was inconsistently documented.

Over the following days, first responders spend a significant amount of time locating survivors. Despite having the assistance of life-detection tools and techniques, these first responders are still hampered by certain limitations in searching for survivors and pinpointing their exact location deep within the rubble. Current methods involving dogs and relatively large robots and machinery can assist only with surface-level surveying of the disaster area and removal of rubble. In contrast, a swarm of centimeter-scale robots could be employed for under-rubble mapping and surveying in these scenarios. In fact, progress has been made in developing centimeter-scale robotics that could assist first responders in the future. However, these prototypes still require improvements in the efficiency of the mechanical parts and control systems deployed in real-life scenarios. © 2010-2012 IEEE.",,"Machinery; Surveying; Surveys; Centimeter-scale; Disaster areas; First responders; Life detection; Mechanical parts; Natural disasters; Residential building; Disasters",2-s2.0-85031036843

To study how descending commands from brain centers produce coordinated, goal-directed motion in distributed nervous systems, we have constructed a conductance-based neural system for our robot MantisBot, a 29 degree-of-freedom, 13.3:1 scale praying mantis robot. Using the literature on mantis prey tracking and insect locomotion, we designed a hierarchical, distributed neural controller that establishes the goal, coordinates different joints, and executes prey-tracking motion. In our controller, brain networks perceive the location of prey and predict its future location, store this location in memory, and formulate descending commands for ballistic saccades like those seen in the animal. The descending commands are simple, indicating only 1) whether the robot should walk or stand still, and 2) the intended direction of motion. Each joint's controller uses the descending commands differently to alter sensory-motor interactions, changing the sensory pathways that coordinate the joints' central pattern generators into one cohesive motion. Experiments with one leg of MantisBot show that visual input produces simple descending commands that alter walking kinematics, change the walking direction in a predictable manner, enact reflex reversals when necessary, and can control both static posture and locomotion with the same network. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computational neuroscience; Descending commands; Locomotion; Praying mantis; Robotics","body posture; brain; central pattern generator; conductance; controlled study; human; human experiment; joint; kinematics; leg; Mantodea; memory; model; motion; neuroscience; nonhuman; reflex; robotics; saccadic eye movement; walking; animal; biological model; Mantodea; motor activity; physiology; vision; walking; Animals; Mantodea; Models, Biological; Motor Activity; Robotics; Vision, Ocular; Walking",2-s2.0-85016774218

This astonishing function has inspired scientists to replicate the color changing abilities of animals with artificial skin. Recently, some studies have focused on the smart materials and devices with reversible color changing or light-emitting properties for instantaneous strain visualization. However, most of these works only show eye-detectable appearance change when subjected to large mechanical deformation (100%–500% strain), and conspicuous color change at small strain remains rarely explored. In the present study, we developed a user-interactive electronic skin with human-readable optical output by assembling a highly sensitive resistive strain sensor with a stretchable organic electrochromic device (ECD) together. We explored the substrate effect on the electromechanical behavior of graphene and designed a strategy of modulus-gradient structure to employ graphene as both the highly sensitive strain sensing element and the insensitive stretchable electrode of the ECD layer. Subtle strain (0–10%) was enough to evoke an obvious color change, and the RGB value of the color quantified the magnitude of the applied strain.

Common drone applications in medicine include the provision disaster assessments when other means of access are severely restricted; delivering aid packages, medicines, vaccines, blood and other medical supplies to remote areas; providing safe transport of disease test samples and test kits in areas with high contagion; and potential for providing rapid access to automated external defibrillators for patients in cardiac arrest. Drones are also showing early potential to benefit geriatric medicine by providing mobility assistance to elderly populations using robot-like technology. Looking further to the future, drones with diagnostic imaging capabilities may have a role in assessing health in remote communities using telemedicine technology.

These agencies oversee all technical, safety, security and administrative issues related to drones. It is important that drones continue to meet or exceed the requirements specified in each of these regulatory areas.

Methods: The system consists of a SOMATOM Definition AS CT scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) and a CyberKnife M6 FIM (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Additional movement programs were implemented in the robotic treatment table (RoboCouch, Accuray Inc.) to move between CT and treatment position. Acceptance testing was performed on the CT scanner according to AAPM83 guidelines, as well as safety tests for collision avoidance and electromagnetic (EM) compatibility. For the first clinical application of the system, daily dose was evaluated in five pancreas SBRT patients. A second envisioned use is the optimal alignment of the treatment beams to soft-tissue targets without the use of implanted fiducials. To this end, an offset vector feature has been implemented, which shifts the treatment center according to the daily position of the tumor relative to the spine (established by a CT scan). This offset can be applied by either moving the treatment couch (physical couch shift) or by moving the CyberKnife robot (virtual couch shift). An End-to-End (E2E) test was specifically designed to evaluate the accuracy of this feature using the Xsight Lung Tracking Phantom (Computerized Imaging Reference Systems, Inc., Norfolk, VA, USA). The position of the tumor with respect to the spine was varied by moving the insert inside the phantom and a CT scan was made for each position. The treatment plan was subsequently delivered to the phantom employing spine tracking. The test was repeated four times for a physical couch shift and four times for a virtual couch shift. Results: All acceptance, safety and EM compatibility testing was successful. For the first pancreas SBRT patients treated using daily CT imaging, the volume of stomach, duodenum, or small bowel receiving >35 Gy was found to increase or remain constant during treatment; however, the clinical constraint of 5 cc was not violated. For the offset vector E2E test, the reference accuracy (without any tumor shift) was (0.74, -0.61, -0.33) mm in the inferior, left, and anterior direction respectively. The difference in deviation with respect to the reference was (-0.1 ± 0.15, 0.01 ± 0.16, -0.17 ± 0.25) mm, when applying a physical couch shift. With a virtual couch shift, the deviations were (0.02 ± 0.15, 0.06 ± 0.23, -0.4 ± 0.31) mm. Conclusions: The first combination of a CyberKnife treatment unit with a sliding-gantry CT scanner is operational in our department enabling future developments toward image-guided online-adaptive SBRT supported by diagnostic-quality CT imaging. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","adaptive radiotherapy; CT-on-rails; IGRT; pancreatic cancer; SBRT","Article; cancer radiotherapy; case report; clinical article; computed tomography scanner; CyberKnife; duodenum; fiducial marker; human; intestine; linear accelerator; pancreas cancer; small intestine; stereotactic body radiation therapy; stomach; time; x-ray computed tomography",2-s2.0-85026633731

A global utility function that depends on the realized state of the environment and actions of all the agents determines the system's optimal behavior. We define the asymptotically optimal action profile as a Nash equilibrium of the potential game defined by considering the expected utility with respect to the asymptotic belief. At finite time, however, agents have not entirely congruous beliefs about the state of the environment and may select conflicting actions. This paper proposes a variation of the fictitious play algorithm which is proven to converge to equilibrium actions if the state beliefs converge to a common distribution at a rate that is at least linear. In conventional fictitious play, agents infer about others' future behavior by computing histograms of past actions and best respond to their expected payoffs integrated with respect to these histograms. In the variations developed here histograms are built using knowledge of actions taken by nearby nodes and best responses are further integrated with respect to the local beliefs on the state of the environment. We exemplify the use of the algorithm in coordination and target covering games.

A major limitation for hand prosthetics lies in the challenges of reliably decoding user intention from muscle signals when controlling complex robotic hands. Most of the commercially available prosthetic hands use muscle-related signals to decode a finite number of predefined motions and some offer proportional control of open/close movements of the whole hand. Here, in contrast, we aim to offer users flexible control of individual joints of their artificial hand. We propose a novel framework for decoding neural information that enables a user to independently control 11 joints of the hand in a continuous manner - much like we control our natural hands. Toward this end, we instructed six able-bodied subjects to perform everyday object manipulation tasks combining both dynamic, free movements (e.g., grasping) and isometric force tasks (e.g., squeezing). We recorded the electromyographic and mechanomyographic activities of five extrinsic muscles of the hand in the forearm, while simultaneously monitoring 11 joints of hand and fingers using a sensorized data glove that tracked the joints of the hand. Instead of learning just a direct mapping from current muscle activity to intended hand movement, we formulated a novel autoregressive approach that combines the context of previous hand movements with instantaneous muscle activity to predict future hand movements. Specifically, we evaluated a linear vector autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs and a novel Gaussian process ( $\mathcal {GP}$ ) autoregressive framework to learn the continuous mapping from hand joint dynamics and muscle activity to decode intended hand movement. Our $\mathcal {GP}$ approach achieves high levels of performance (RMSE of 8°/s and $\rho =0.79$ ). Crucially, we use a small set of sensors that allows us to control a larger set of independently actuated degrees of freedom of a hand. This novel undersensored control is enabled through the combination of nonlinear autoregressive continuous mapping between muscle activity and joint angles. The system evaluates the muscle signals in the context of previous natural hand movements. This enables us to resolve ambiguities in situations, where muscle signals alone cannot determine the correct action as we evaluate the muscle signals in their context of natural hand movements. $\mathcal {GP}$ autoregression is a particularly powerful approach which makes not only a prediction based on the context but also represents the associated uncertainty of its predictions, thus enabling the novel notion of risk-based control in neuroprosthetics. Our results suggest that $\mathcal {GP}$ autoregressive approaches with exogenous inputs lend themselves for natural, intuitive, and continuous control in neurotechnology, with the particular focus on prosthetic restoration of natural limb function, where high dexterity is required for complex movements. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","autoregression; decoding; EMG; Gaussian process; MMG; Neuroprosthetics; neurotechnology; proportional control; robotic hand","Biomimetics; Decoding; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electromyography; End effectors; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Joints (anatomy); Mapping; Muscle; Neural prostheses; Prosthetics; Regression analysis; Robotic arms; Robotics; Robots; Sensors; Autoregression; Gaussian Processes; Neuroprosthetics; Neurotechnology; Proportional control; Joint prostheses",2-s2.0-85029154913

The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions, and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent’s decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human–robot interaction community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses (1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g. homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, (2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and (3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL.

Optimality of data exchange and further processing is a desired feature in such scenarios, especially in outdoor disaster situations where availability of the back-end cloud infrastructure can not be guaranteed. In this paper, we demonstrate a real life robotic data exchange model based on Resource Description Framework (RDF). We further perform a comparative analysis of network performance between TCP in Robot Operating System (ROS) and block-wise extension to Constrained Application Layer Protocol (CoAP) for bidirectional exchange of such RDF data in a disaster situation where robotic entities accomplish search and rescue missions in collaboration with fog devices. The causal analysis presented in this paper puts a stepping stone for potential future enhancement of CoAP. © 2017 IEEE.","Collaborative robot; fog computing; semantic web of robot","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Distributed computer systems; Electronic data interchange; Fog; Internet of things; Network security; Robotics; Robots; Search engines; Application layer protocols; Cloud infrastructures; Collaborative robots; Communication modeling; Data exchange models; Resource description framework; Robot operating systems (ROS); Warehouse automation; Semantic Web",2-s2.0-85029287611

Methods: The set of methods includes phantom and in vivo experiments to measure the effect of a progressively broader set of noise sources potentially introduced by the device. Phantom experiments measure the radio-frequency (RF) noise and temporal noise-to-signal ratio (tNSR) introduced by the device. The in vivo experiment assesses the effect of the device on measured brain activation for a human subject performing a representative sensorimotor task. The proposed protocol was validated via experiments using a 3T MRI scanner operated under nominal conditions and with the inclusion of an electrically-active mechatronic device &#x2014; the MR-SoftWrist &#x2014; as the equipment under test (EUT). Results: Quantitative analysis of RF noise data allows detection of active RF noise sources both in controlled RF noise conditions, and in conditions resembling improper filtering of the EUT&#x0027;s electrical signals. In conditions where no RF noise was detectable, the presence and operation of the EUT did not introduce any significant increase in tNSR. A quantitative analysis conducted on in vivo measurements of the number of active voxels in visual and motor areas further showed no significant difference between EUT and baseline conditions. Conclusion and significance: The proposed set of quantitative methods supports the development and troubleshooting of electrically-active mechatronic devices for use in sensorimotor protocols with fMRI, and may be used for future testing of such devices.

We present a method for mission and motion planning that applies to small teams of robots performing a task in an environment with moving obstacles, such as humans. Given a mission specification written in linear temporal logic, such as patrolling a set of rooms, we synthesize an automaton from which the robots can extract valid strategies. This centralized automaton is executed by the robots in the team at runtime, and in conjunction with a distributed motion planner that guarantees avoidance of moving obstacles. Our contribution is a correct-by-construction synthesis approach to multi-robot mission planning that guarantees collision avoidance with respect to moving obstacles, guarantees satisfaction of the mission specification and resolves encountered deadlocks, where a moving obstacle blocks the robot temporally. Our method provides conditions under which deadlock will be avoided by identifying environment behaviors that, when encountered at runtime, may prevent the robot team from achieving its goals. In particular, (1) it identifies deadlock conditions; (2) it is able to check whether they can be resolved; and (3) the robots implement the deadlock resolution policy locally in a distributed manner. The approach is capable of synthesizing and executing plans even with a high density of dynamic obstacles. In contrast to many existing approaches to mission and motion planning, it is scalable with the number of moving obstacles. We demonstrate the approach in physical experiments with walking humanoids moving in 2D environments and in simulation with aerial vehicles (quadrotors) navigating in 2D and 3D environments. © 2017 The Author(s)","Deadlock resolution; Dynamic environments; Formal methods; Mission specification; Motion planning; Multi-robot systems","Air navigation; Collision avoidance; Formal methods; Formal specification; Industrial robots; Manipulators; Motion planning; Multipurpose robots; Robots; Specifications; Correct-by-construction; Deadlock condition; Dynamic environments; Linear temporal logic; Mobile manipulator; Multi-robot missions; Multi-robot systems; Physical experiments; Robot programming",2-s2.0-85027359209

The robot’s goal in an autonomous exploration task is to create a complete, high-quality map of an unknown environment as quickly as possible. This implicitly requires the robot to maintain an accurate estimate of its pose as it explores both unknown and previously observed terrain in order to correctly incorporate new information into the map. Our utility function simultaneously considers uncertainty in both the robot pose and the map in a novel way and is computed as the difference between the Shannon and the Rényi entropy of the current distribution over maps. Rényi’s entropy is a family of functions parameterized by a scalar, with Shannon’s entropy being the limit as this scalar approaches unity. We link the value of this scalar parameter to the predicted future uncertainty in the robot’s pose after taking an exploratory action. This effectively decreases the expected information gain of the action, with higher uncertainty in the robot’s pose leading to a smaller expected information gain. Our objective function allows the robot to automatically trade off between exploration and exploitation in a way that does not require manually tuning parameter values, a significant advantage over many competing methods that only use Shannon’s definition of entropy. We use simulated experiments to compare the performance of our proposed utility function to these state-of-the-art utility functions. We show that robots that use our proposed utility function generate maps with less uncertainty and fewer visible artifacts and that the robots have less uncertainty in their pose during exploration. Finally, we demonstrate that a real-world robot using our proposed utility function is able to successfully create a high-quality map of an indoor office environment. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Autonomous exploration; Entropy; Graph SLAM","Economic and social effects; Entropy; Information theory; Optical variables measurement; Robotics; Autonomous exploration; Current distribution; Expected informations; Exploration and exploitation; Graph SLAM; Office environments; Simulated experiments; Unknown environments; Robots",2-s2.0-85027296033

Self-organized delegate multi-agent systems (D-MASs) have proven to be effective decentralized coordination mechanisms for coordination and control (C&C) applications. However, the use of such coordination mechanisms becomes more challenging, compared to the previous studies, in which the coordinated entities are one-directional automated guided vehicles (AGVs), with restricted movement, situated in a highly dynamic production environment. To address these challenges, there were several problematic situations identified dealing with issues such as the originally proposed functionalities of D-MASs, restricted movement, priority parameter settings, and simulated failures of AGVs. Solutions (coordination rules) to these situations were proposed, also described examples were provided and, finally, the approach was verified by simulation in the 3D environment, involving five AGV agents (AGVAs). Simple indicators of such intralogistics system were proposed to outline the system performance. Simulations were performed with as well as without simulated failure states.

Most smart manufacturing systems focus on activities directly related to the management of robots, conveyor belts, maintenance logs, and others that ensure the process runs smoothly. An initial step to support such smart manufacturing systems is an awareness process for estimating current situations and predicting future situations in manufacturing, called Predictive Manufacturing Situation Awareness (MSAW). Our research addresses developing an MSAW system with the goal of enhancing industrial competitiveness (e.g., lower cost in shorter time with higher quality) for the manufacturing industry. This requires constant monitoring of market conditions, prices of manufacturing assets, and other inputs that would help to define how the production line behaves. This input is highly stochastic, which makes fusing the data from the diverse sources a challenge.

These approaches are subsumed under the term Interactive Perception (IP). This view of perception provides the following benefits. First, interaction with the environment creates a rich sensory signal that would otherwise not be present. Second, knowledge of the regularity in the combined space of sensory data and action parameters facilitates the prediction and interpretation of the sensory signal. In this survey, we postulate this as a principle for robot perception and collect evidence in its support by analyzing and categorizing existing work in this area. We also provide an overview of the most important applications of IP. We close this survey by discussing remaining open questions. With this survey, we hope to help define the field of Interactive Perception and to provide a valuable resource for future research.

However, before timely and orderly integration into the national airspace system, NAS, it is essential that challenges at least in the areas of design for autonomy, navigation, robust and fault-tolerant control, sense-detect-and-avoid/see-and-avoid systems for mid-air collision avoidance, UAV safety and reliability, reaches maturity before complete UAS integration into the national airspace system occurs.

The mathematical model of the omni-directional mobile robot is derived to facilitate the control design.

This study investigates whether a more physiologically appropriate model could improve the performance of human-robot cooperation control for an ankle power-assist exoskeleton robot. To achieve the goal, an EMG-driven Hill-type neuromusculoskeletal model (HNM) and a linear proportional model (LPM) were developed and calibrated through maximum isometric voluntary dorsiflexion (MIVD). The two control models could estimate the real-time ankle joint torque, and HNM is more accurate and can account for the change of the joint angle and muscle dynamics. Then, eight healthy volunteers were recruited to wear the ankle exoskeleton robot and complete a series of sinusoidal tracking tasks in the vertical plane. With the various levels of assist based on the two calibrated models, the subjects were instructed to track the target displayed on the screen as accurately as possible by performing ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Two measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) and root mean square jerk (RMSJ), were derived from the assistant torque and kinematic signals to characterize the movement performances, whereas the amplitudes of the recorded EMG signals from the tibialis anterior (TA) and the gastrocnemius (GAS) were obtained to reflect the muscular efforts. The results demonstrated that the muscular effort and smoothness of tracking movements decreased with an increase in the assistant ratio. Compared with LPM, subjects made lower physical efforts and generated smoother movements when using HNM, which implied that a more physiologically appropriate model could enable more natural and human-like human-robot cooperation and has potential value for improvement of human-exoskeleton interaction in future applications. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Ankle tracking; EMG-based neuromusculoskeletal model; exoskeleton robots; human-exoskeleton interface","Electromyography; End effectors; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Human robot interaction; Mean square error; Physiological models; Physiology; Appropriate models; Exoskeleton robots; Future applications; Human-robot cooperation; Movement performance; Neuromusculoskeletal models; Proportional models; Root mean square errors; Robots; adult; ankle dorsiflexion; ankle joint angle; ankle joint torque; ankle plantarflexion; ankle power; Article; controlled study; elbow flexion; electromyography; female; gastrocnemius muscle; human; male; muscle contraction; muscle function; muscle length; muscle strength; musculoskeletal system parameters; normal human; robotic exoskeleton; robotics; root mean square error; root mean square jerk; tibialis anterior muscle; young adult; ankle; biofeedback; biological model; computer simulation; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; evaluation study; exoskeleton (rehabilitation); limb prosthesis; man machine interaction; muscle isometric contraction; neurorehabilitation; physiological feedback; physiology; power supply; procedures; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; robotics; sensitivity and specificity; skeletal muscle; torque; Adult; Ankle Joint; Artificial Limbs; Biofeedback, Psychology; Computer Simulation; Electric Power Supplies; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Exoskeleton Device; Feedback, Physiological; Female; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Male; Man-Machine Systems; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Neurological Rehabilitation; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Robotics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Torque",2-s2.0-85029155507

The spectral model can represent arbitrary timescales of environment dynamics with low memory requirements. Transformation of the spectral model to the time domain allows for the prediction of the future environment states, which improves the robot's long-term performance in changing environments.

Every two thrusters nozzles formed an angle of 90°in one plane.

Sometimes further surgery is performed, such as phalloplasty. Colpectomy may be performed to overcome gender dysphoria and disturbing vaginal discharge; furthermore, it may be important in reducing the risk of fistulas due to the phalloplasty procedure with urethral elongation. Colpectomy prior to the reconstruction of the neourethra seems to reduce fistula rates on the very first anastomosis. Therefore, at our center, colpectomy has become a standard procedure prior to phalloplasty and metoidioplasty with urethral elongation. Colpectomy is known as a procedure with potentially serious complications, e.g., extensive bloodloss, vesicovaginal fistula or rectovaginal fistula. Colpectomy performed via the vaginal route can be a challenging procedure due to lack of exposure of the surgical field, as many patients are virginal. Therefore, we investigated whether robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TLH–BSO) followed by robot-assisted laparoscopic colpectomy (RaLC) is an alternative for the vaginal approach. Methods: Robot TLH/BSO and RaLC as a single-step procedure was performed in 36 FtM patients in a prospective cohort study. Results: Median length of the procedure was 230 min (197–278), which reduced in the second half of the patients, median blood loss was 75 mL (30–200), and median discharge was 3 days (2–3) postoperatively. One patient with a major complication (postoperative bleeding with readmission and transfusion) was reported. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of RaLC.

After performing a simulation of circular, annular, X-shaped, and improved X-shaped feet, all with the same cross-sectional area, the end resistance, side resistance, and distribution of contact pressure along the radial direction were analyzed. The simulation results showed that the soil arching area caused by the hole at the bottom of a rigid foot can effectively increase the end resistance and that the side resistance increases with an increase in the side perimeter. The end resistance and side resistance of the improved X-shaped robot foot were higher than those of the X-shaped robot foot during the sinking process. The effects of the improved geometric parameters of the X-shaped robot foot on its sinkage were analyzed through orthogonal experiments.

Methods: We analyzed 2619 men treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy (n = 2005) or robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (n = 614) from 1993 to 2013 from six Veterans Affairs Hospitals in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database. Age, body mass index, race, biopsy Gleason, prostate weight, undergoing a nerve-sparing procedure or lymph node dissection, and hospital surgical volume were analyzed in multivariable linear regression to identify predictors of operative time and to quantify the increase/decrease observed. Results: In men undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy, body mass index, black race, prostate weight and a lymph node dissection all predicted longer operative times (all P ≤ 0.004). In men undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, biopsy Gleason score and a lymph node dissection were associated with increased operative time (P ≤ 0.048). In both surgical methods, a lymph node dissection added 25–40 min to the operation. Also, in both, each additional operation per year per center predicted a 0.80–0.89-min decrease in operative time (P ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: Overall, several factors seem to be associated with quantifiable changes in operative time. If confirmed in future studies, these findings can allow for a more precise estimate of operative time, which could decrease the overall cost to the patient and hospital by aiding in operating room time management. © 2017 The Japanese Urological Association","lymph node excision; operative time; prostate; prostatectomy; robotic","adult; aged; Article; Black person; body mass; controlled study; Gleason score; human; human tissue; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; operation duration; priority journal; prostate biopsy; prostate weight; radical retropubic prostatectomy; robot-assisted prostatectomy",2-s2.0-85026416269

It aims to replicate the oncological outcomes of open radical cystectomy (ORC), while providing a shorter recovery period. Despite this, previous RCTs have failed to show a benefit for RARC over ORC. These trials have compared extracorporeal RARC (eRARC) with ORC, which requires a further incision to mobilise the bowel for urinary reconstruction with an open technique. For intracorporeal RARC (iRARC), this urinary reconstruction is performed robotically without further incisions. There are theoretical benefits to this approach such as reduced recovery time for the bowel and reduced ileus rates, but no level 1 evidence currently exists to support this. While there has been an improvement in patient outcomes since the adoption of RARC, various other factors, such as enhanced recovery programmes and surgical learning curve, have made it difficult to attribute this solely to the robotic approach as many centres performing ORC have also shown similar improvements. In this review, we will discuss implementation of RARC as well as perioperative measures that have helped improve outcomes, offer a comparison of outcomes between ORC and RARC and highlight upcoming RCTs that may offer new evidence for or against a paradigm shift in the future of bladder cancer surgery. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bladder cancer; Enhanced recovery; Extracorporeal; Intracorporeal; Robotic cystectomy","cefuroxime; gentamicin; metronidazole; anesthesia induction; antibiotic therapy; bladder cancer; cystectomy; extracorporeal robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy; functional assessment; human; intermethod comparison; intracorporeal robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy; invasive procedure; outcome assessment; patient positioning; peroperative care; postoperative complication; postoperative infection; preoperative period; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy; robot assisted radical cystectomy; robot assisted surgery; treatment outcome; treatment planning; treatment response; adverse effects; clinical pathway; cystectomy; perioperative period; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; trends; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Critical Pathways; Cystectomy; Humans; Perioperative Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85021214868

Existing field approaches typically require intensive, event-based experiments involving dense arrays of instruments. These devices are often cumbersome and logistically difficult to set up and maintain, especially near steep or vegetated dune surfaces. Significant advances in instrumentation are needed to provide the datasets that are required to validate and improve mechanistic models of aeolian sediment transport. Recent advances in robotics show great promise for assisting and amplifying scientists’ efforts to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of many environmental measurements governing sediment transport. The emergence of cheap, agile, human-scale robotic platforms endowed with increasingly sophisticated sensor and motor suites opens up the prospect of deploying programmable, reactive sensor payloads across complex terrain in the service of aeolian science. This paper surveys the need and assesses the opportunities and challenges for amassing novel, highly resolved spatiotemporal datasets for aeolian research using partially-automated ground mobility. We review the limitations of existing measurement approaches for aeolian processes, and discuss how they may be transformed by ground-based robotic platforms, using examples from our initial field experiments. We then review how the need to traverse challenging aeolian terrains and simultaneously make high-resolution measurements of critical variables requires enhanced robotic capability. Finally, we conclude with a look to the future, in which robotic platforms may operate with increasing autonomy in harsh conditions. Besides expanding the completeness of terrestrial datasets, bringing ground-based robots to the aeolian research community may lead to unexpected discoveries that generate new hypotheses to expand the science itself. © 2017 The Authors","Aeolian processes; Dust emission; Field measurements; Instrumentation; Legged robot; Reactive planning; Sand transport; Shear stress partitioning","dust; eolian deposit; eolian process; instrumentation; measurement method; robotics; sand; sediment transport; shear stress",2-s2.0-85019072369

The purpose of this study was to present the report of our initial experience using a retroauricular approach for thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. Methods: This is a prospective study that was conducted under institutional review board approval and all surgeries were performed by a single surgeon at a North American academic institution. Some patients underwent an additional concomitant neck lift surgery in addition to the thyroid surgery. Some cases were performed without the use of the robot and they have been evaluated compared with the robotic cases. Clinical characteristics, total operative time, blood loss, surgical outcome, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. Results: Forty cases representing thirty-eight female patients were included in this study, which includes 37 thyroid lobectomies and 3 parathyroid surgeries. Mean age was 44 ± 13 years, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.9 ± 5.31. Mean thyroid nodule size was 2.01 ± 0.94 cm. All cases were completed successfully via a single retroauricular incision. There was no conversion to an open approach. Six of 38 patients underwent additional neck lift surgery with a mean total operative time of 189 ± 45 minutes. The mean operative time for the remaining 34 patients who underwent retroauricular robotic-assisted hemithyroidectomy without neck lift surgery was 156 ± 39 minutes. Five patients underwent an endoscopic, retroauricular approach to the thyroid and parathyroid without using the robot. Two of 38 patients developed postoperative hematoma, in whom one of them needed a surgical evacuation. There were no cases of permanent vocal cord paralysis or permanent hypoparathyroidism. However, 2 patients developed transient hoarseness, which resolved 9 weeks and 10 weeks postoperatively, respectively. Mean blood loss was 19.0 ± 30.93 mL. Twenty-one patients were discharged on the same day of surgery, 17 patients were discharged after an overnight stay, and the remaining 2 patients were discharged after 2 days. Conclusion: Single-incision retroauricular robotic hemithyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy can be safe and feasible and concomitant neck lift surgery can be offered in a select group of patients. In addition, the nonrobotic retroauricular approach can be performed safely; however, future studies are warranted to further evaluate the benefits and limitations of this novel robotic retroauricular surgical approach. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","endoscopic thyroidectomy; minimally invasive surgery; retroauricular thyroidectomy; robotic thyroidectomy; transaxillary","adult; Article; body mass; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical outcome; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; endoscopic surgery; female; fine needle aspiration biopsy; hematoma; hoarseness; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; human tissue; incision; length of stay; male; operation duration; operative blood loss; parathyroidectomy; postoperative complication; postoperative hematoma; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; prospective study; retroauricular surgical approach; robot assisted surgery; subtotal thyroidectomy; surgical approach; thyroid nodule; thyroidectomy",2-s2.0-85018754786

Many patients can be effectively treated with dietary modifications and drug therapy. The most widely used drug is diethyl carbamazine. The recurrences are common after such treatment. Such patients would benefit from sclerotherapy to obliterate the lympatico-renal fistulae located mainly in the renal pelvicalyceal system. The commonly used sclerosing agent is a combination of 5% povidone-iodine and 50% dextrose instilled through a ureteric catheter. A small percentage of patients who recur after sclerotherapy and those with systemic complications, such as hypoproteinemia and edema, might require surgery in the form of renal hilar lymphatic disconnection. Although it is a major operation, the success rates are >90%. Laparoscopic and robotic techniques have minimized the morbidity related to such surgery. With the advent of the global program for eradication of filariasis initiated by the World Health Organization, the incidence of the disease is decreasing. Mass chemotherapy with diethyl carbamazine is the mainstay of this global program.

From this perspective, the diverse behavior of animals and its spontaneous transitions lead to a complex coupled dynamical system, including a physical body and a brain. Herein, a series of simulations using different types of non-linear oscillator networks (i.e., regular, small-world, scale-free, random) with a musculoskeletal model (i.e., a snake-like robot) as a physical body are conducted to understand how the chaotic itinerancy of bodily behavior emerges from the coupled dynamics between the body and the brain. A behavior analysis (behavior clustering) and network analysis for the classified behavior are then applied. The former consists of feature vector extraction from the motions and classification of the movement patterns that emerged from the coupled dynamics. The network structures behind the classified movement patterns are revealed by estimating the “information networks” different from the given non-linear oscillator networks based on the transfer entropy which finds the information flow among neurons. The experimental results show that: (1) the number of movement patterns and their duration depend on the sensor ratio to control the balance of strength between the body and the brain dynamics and on the type of the given non-linear oscillator networks; and (2) two kinds of information networks are found behind two kinds movement patterns with different durations by utilizing the complex network measures, clustering coefficient and the shortest path length with a negative and a positive relationship with the duration periods of movement patterns. The current results seem promising for a future extension of the method to a more complicated body and environment. Several requirements are also discussed. © 2017 Park et al.

Studies evaluating ways to improve timing post stroke are scarce. The goal of the study was to evaluate the impact of a single session of haptic guidance (HG) and error amplification (EA) robotic training interventions on the improvement of post-stroke timing accuracy. Materials and methods: Thirty-four survivors post-chronic stroke were randomly assigned to HG or EA. Participants played a computerized pinball-like game with their affected hand positioned in a robot that either helped them perform better (HG) or worse (EA) during the task. A baseline and retention phase preceded and followed HG and EA, respectively, in order to assess their efficiency at improving absolute timing errors. The impact of the side of the stroke lesion on the participants’ performance during the timing task was also explored for each training group. Results: An improvement in timing performance was only noted following HG (8.9 ± 4.9 ms versus 7.8 ± 5.3 ms, p = 0.032). Moreover, for the EA group only, participants with a left-sided stroke lesion showed a worsening in performance as compared to those with a right-sided stroke lesion (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Helping survivors post-chronic stroke perform a timing-based task is beneficial to learning. Future studies should explore longer and more frequent HG training sessions in order to further promote post stroke motor recovery.Implications for Rehabilitation Timing is crucial for the accomplishment of daily tasks.

Therefore, the chatter phenomenon is a difficult technical problem which needs to be solved in the robot machining technology. In the paper, a review on the research of domestic and foreign advanced robot machining systems was presented. Focusing on the analysis of the main characteristics of robot machining systems and cutting chatter behaviors, it is expected to reveal the cutting chatter mechanism of robot machining systems based on the robot machining system stiffness model and dynamic model taken as the theoretical basis. In order to improve the machining precision of robot processing systems and the static and dynamic performances, it is expected to develop more suitable active devices for cutting chatter suppression.

In order to capture the experience of living with a robot at home, a multi-perspective evaluation was conducted. Methods: Older adults (n = 10) were invited to execute an actual interaction scenario with the Care-O-bot® robot in a home-like environment and were questioned about their experiences. Additionally, interviews were conducted with the elderly participants, informal carers (n = 7) and professional caregivers (n = 11). Results: Seniors showed to be more keen to accept the robot than their caregivers and relatives. However, the robot in its current form was found to be too limited and participants wished the robot could perform more complex tasks. In order to be acceptable a future robot should execute these complex tasks based on the personal preferences of the user which would require the robot to be flexible and extremely smart, comparable to the care that is delivered by a human carer. Conclusions: Developing the functional features to perform activities is not the only challenge in robot development that deserves the attention of robot developers. The development of social behaviour and skills should be addressed as well.

Passive assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses are often prescribed to increase function and independence after stroke; however, walking remains highly impaired despite-and perhaps because of-their use. We sought to determine whether a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to supplement the paretic limb's residual ability to generate both forward propulsion and ground clearance could facilitate more normal walking after stroke. Exosuits transmit mechanical power generated by actuators to a wearer through the interaction of garment-like, functional textile anchors and cable-based transmissions. We evaluated the immediate effects of an exosuit actively assisting the paretic limb of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery during treadmill and overground walking. Using controlled, treadmill-based biomechanical investigation, we demonstrate that exosuits can function in synchrony with a wearer's paretic limb to facilitate an immediate 5.33 ± 0.91° increase in the paretic ankle's swing phase dorsiflexion and 11 ± 3% increase in the paretic limb's generation of forward propulsion (P < 0.05). These improvements in paretic limb function contributed to a 20 ± 4% reduction in forward propulsion interlimb asymmetry and a 10 ± 3% reduction in the energy cost of walking, which is equivalent to a 32 ± 9% reduction in the metabolic burden associated with poststroke walking. Relatively low assistance (~12% of biological torques) delivered with a lightweight and nonrestrictive exosuit was sufficient to facilitate more normal walking in ambulatory individuals after stroke. Future work will focus on understanding how exosuit-induced improvements in walking performance may be leveraged to improve mobility after stroke. © 2017 The Authors.",,"achilles reflex; adult; Article; biomechanics; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; controlled study; disease classification; dorsiflexion; energy cost; flexor reflex; gait orthosis; human; lightweight; mechanical stimulation; metabolism; middle aged; nonrestrictive exosuit; paresis; patient mobility; priority journal; propulsion interlimb asymmetry; soft robotic exosuit; time; treadmill; treatment response; walking",2-s2.0-85026198983

Although modern robotic systems have become safe and reliable enough to operate close to human workers on a day-to-day basis, the workload is still skewed in favor of a limited contribution from the robot's side, and a significant cognitive load is allotted to the human. We believe the transition from robots as recipients of human instruction to robots as capable collaborators hinges around the implementation of transparent systems, where mental models about the task are shared between peers, and the human partner is freed from the responsibility of taking care of both actors. In this work, we implement a transparent task planner able to be deployed in realistic, near-future applications. The proposed framework is capable of basic reasoning capabilities for what concerns role assignment and task allocation, and it interfaces with the human partner at the level of abstraction he is most comfortable with.

Thus, this metric is independent of any choice of controller and expresses only physical abilities of robots. This important property makes the proposed metric a proper tool to study, analyse and design current and future robots. The outcome of the CoM dynamic manipulability analysis in this paper is an ellipsoid in the CoM acceleration space which graphically shows accessible points due to the unit weighted norm of joint torques. Physical meanings and concepts of two reasonable choices for the weighting matrix, which is used in the weighted norm of joint torques, are discussed and illustrative examples are presented.

The user scans the robot near to the desired painting location, the single movement axis moves the spray head to achieve the required paint distribution. A simultaneous simulation of the spraying procedure is performed, giving an open loop approximation of the current state of the painting. An online prediction of the best path for the spray nozzle actuation is calculated in a receding horizon fashion. This is calculated by producing a map of the paint required in the 2D space defined by nozzle position on the gantry and the time into the future. A directed graph then extracts its edge weights from this paint density map and Dijkstra's algorithm is then used to find the candidate for the most effective path. Due to the heavy parallelisation of this approach and the majority of the calculations taking place on a GPU we can run the prediction loop in 32.6ms for a prediction horizon of 1 second, this approach is computationally efficient, outperforming a greedy algorithm. The path chosen by the proposed method on average chooses a path in the top 15% of all paths as calculated by exhaustive testing.

This algorithm thus has built-in robustness to uncertainty, since the bound can be regarded as a certificate for guaranteed future performance. The approach is evaluated on two challenging robot control scenarios in simulation: a car with side slip and a quadrotor navigating through obstacle-ridden environments.

A crucial requirement towards that goal is to be able to take advantage of external elements as tools to perform tasks for which their own manipulators are insufficient; the ability to autonomously learn how to use tools will render robots far more versatile and simpler to design. Motivated by this prospect, this paper proposes and evaluates an approach to allow robots to learn tool affordances based on their 3D geometry. To this end, we apply tool-pose descriptors to represent tools combined with the way in which they are grasped, and affordance vectors to represent the effect tool-poses achieve in function of the action performed. This way, tool affordance learning consists in determining the mapping between these 2 representations, which is achieved in 2 steps. First, the dimensionality of both representations is reduced by unsupervisedly mapping them onto respective Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). Then, the mapping between the neurons in the tool-pose SOM and the neurons in the affordance SOM for pairs of tool-poses and their corresponding affordance vectors, respectively, is learned with a neural based regression model.

Hence, the policy will typically only capture a single solution of a task. However, many motor tasks have a large variety of solutions and the knowledge about these solutions can have several advantages. For example, in an adversarial setting such as robot table tennis, the lack of diversity renders the behavior predictable and hence easy to counter for the opponent. In an interactive setting such as learning from human feedback, an emphasis on diversity gives the human more opportunity for guiding the robot and to avoid the latter to be stuck in local optima of the task. In order to increase diversity of the learned behaviors, we leverage prior work on intrinsic motivation and empowerment. We derive a new intrinsic motivation signal by enriching the description of a task with an outcome space, representing interesting aspects of a sensorimotor stream. For example, in table tennis, the outcome space could be given by the return position and return ball speed. The intrinsic motivation is now given by the diversity of future outcomes, a concept also known as empowerment. We derive a new policy search algorithm that maximizes a trade-off between the extrinsic reward and this intrinsic motivation criterion.

The sagittal and lateral gait control needs to be treated differently, hence, we proposed two types of suitable nonlinear models, which allow forward simulations to look ahead, and thus, predict accurately the future trajectory/state at the end of the current step. Subsequently, by performing multiple forward simulations in a similar manner for the next step and using the gradient descent method, an appropriate foot placement can be found to achieve precise walking speed. By doing this two-step lookahead, all trajectories of the support and the swing leg can be generated. Our proposed controller can plan trajectories at the beginning of each step or actively re-plan according to task state errors. It is validated effectively in simulations performed in both ADAMS and Open Dynamic Engine.

Electing the best plan depends on sampling initial conditions with influential (very high costs) outcomes. Discovering these configurations through random sampling may require drawing many samples, which becomes a performance bottleneck. In this paper, we describe a risk-aware approach which augments this sampling with an optimization process that helps discover those influential outcomes.

Many robots have been developed to administer movement therapies or provide physical assistance to stroke survivors suffering from movement deficits. One effective approach has been to support the weight of the arm, offloading shoulder abductor muscles that have become coupled to elbow muscles. However, patients have limited access to such robots due to the robots' complexity, cost, and bulk. To counter this problem, we developed a lightweight (350 g), inexpensive external actuator, which we call an exomuscle. We constructed a prototype exomuscle by reinforcing a plastic bladder with a fabric bag that is sewn to supporting straps. The bladder can then be inflated with pressurized air to provide expansive forces between the user's torso and arm, supporting shoulder abduction. A seam acting as a hinge joint connects the exomuscle to the torso. We demonstrate that our exomuscle reduces muscular effort by 74% in isometric tasks and 72% in dynamic reaching tasks while minimally affecting the range of motion of the shoulder and elbow (average 4% reduction) on three users ranging from 165 to 188 cm tall. Future studies will evaluate the exomuscle with users who have post-stroke motor impairments. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Muscle; Robotics; Effective approaches; External actuators; Inflatable devices; Motor impairments; Movement therapy; Plastic bladders; Shoulder abductions; Stroke survivors; Robots",2-s2.0-85027992689

Likewise, many biological systems use fluidic actuators implemented with tissue for a wealth of tasks and performances. Spiders for example apply a hybrid mechanism of hydraulically actuated joint extension and muscle-based joint flexion to produce movement in two of their seven leg joints. Here, we present a novel spider-inspired joint mechanism employing both pneumatics and electrically-actuated tendons capable of strong, dynamic, and rapid joint movement. The implementation of the joint is closely inspired by those seen in real spiders, with a foldable structured membrane that effectively transfers all the energy from pressure to torque as the leg unfolds. To evaluate the mechanism we derived static joint models and a simple jumping model, and conducted equivalent experimental tests with a prototype of a single jumping leg robot. Besides applications in robot locomotion, the implementation and modeling of the spider-inspired joint mechanism can be utilized to further explore dynamics and functional biomechanics in spiders. In the future, we hope to use this platform to answer questions related to the impressive jumping and locomotion performances of real arachnids, and explore what morphological traits lie behind efficient spider locomotion at different size scales. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Actuators; Automation; Pneumatics; Actuated joint; Different sizes; Experimental test; Fluidic actuators; Hybrid mechanisms; Joint mechanism; Morphological traits; Robot locomotion; Robotics",2-s2.0-85027996981

Such a hard commitment in data association attenuates the optical flow quality and causes shorter flow tracks. In this paper, we introduce a novel soft data association modeled with probabilities. The association probabilities are computed in an intertwined EM scheme with the optical flow computation that maximizes the expectation (marginalization) over all associations. In addition, to enable longer tracks we compute the affine deformation with respect to the initial point and use the resulting residual as a measure of persistence.

As the intent model becomes increasingly confident, the action set is adapted in order to reduce the error between the intended and actual performance.

In order to optimize maintenance costs, nuclear waste must be sorted, segregated and stored according to its radiation level. Towards this end, in [1] we have recently proposed a visual-based shared control architecture meant to facilitate a human operator in controlling two remote robotic arms (one equipped with a gripper and another with a camera) during remote manipulation tasks of nuclear waste via a master device. The operator could then receive force cues informative of the feasibility of her/his motion commands during the task execution. The strategy presented in [1], albeit effective, suffers however from a locality issue since the operator can only provide instantaneous velocity commands (in a suitable task space), and receive instantaneous force feedback cues. On the other hand, the ability to 'steer' a whole future trajectory in task space, and to receive a corresponding integral force feedback along the whole planned trajectory (because of any constraint of the considered system), could significantly enhance the operator's performance, especially when dealing with complex manipulation tasks. The aim of this work is to then extend [1] towards a planning-based shared control architecture able to take into account the mentioned requirements.

[3], which defines an information-theoretic analogon to thermodynamic (Helmholtz) free energy. This free energy is basically an error in the predictions that our brain makes about our environment. Evolution is related by the rationale that minimal prediction errors are achieved by limiting an agent's reactions to sensory input.

Protocols where parameters are held constant for multiple minutes have traditionally been used for evaluating responses to parameter changes such as metabolic rate or walking symmetry. However, these discrete protocols are time-consuming. Recently, protocols have been proposed where a parameter is changed in a continuous way. The aim of the present study was to compare effects of continuously varying assistance magnitude with a soft exosuit against discrete step conditions. Methods: Seven participants walked on a treadmill wearing a soft exosuit that assists plantarflexion and hip flexion. In Continuous-up, peak exosuit ankle moment linearly increased from approximately 0 to 38% of biological moment over 10 min. Continuous-down was the opposite. In Discrete, participants underwent five periods of 5 min with steady peak moment levels distributed over the same range as Continuous-up and Continuous-down. We calculated metabolic rate for the entire Continuous-up and Continuous-down conditions and the last 2 min of each Discrete force level. We compared kinematics, kinetics and metabolic rate between conditions by curve fitting versus peak moment. Results: Reduction in metabolic rate compared to Powered-off was smaller in Continuous-up than in Continuous-down at most peak moment levels, due to physiological dynamics causing metabolic measurements in Continuous-up and Continuous-down to lag behind the values expected during steady-state testing. When evaluating the average slope of metabolic reduction over the entire peak moment range there was no significant difference between Continuous-down and Discrete. Attempting to correct the lag in metabolics by taking the average of Continuous-up and Continuous-down removed all significant differences versus Discrete. For kinematic and kinetic parameters, there were no differences between all conditions. Conclusions: The finding that there were no differences in biomechanical parameters between all conditions suggests that biomechanical parameters can be recorded with the shortest protocol condition (i.e. single Continuous directions). The shorter time and higher resolution data of continuous sweep protocols hold promise for the future study of human interaction with wearable robots. © 2017 The Author(s).","Exosuit; Kinematics; Metabolic; Parameter sweep; Protocol","adult; Article; biomechanics; clinical protocol; continuous sweep protocol; discrete step protocol; flexor reflex; hip flexion; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; intermethod comparison; kinematics; kinetics; metabolic rate; plantarflexion; priority journal; robot assistance magnitude; robotics; steady state; treadmill exercise",2-s2.0-85023179326

However, it can be assumed that this transition will not be instantaneous, suggesting that autonomous vehicles will have to be capable of driving in a mixed environment, with both humans and autonomous vehicles. To guarantee smooth integration and maintain the nuanced social interactions on the road, a shared mental model must be developed. This means that the behaviors of human-driven vehicles and their typical interactions in collaborative maneuvers must be modeled and understood in an accurate and precise manner. Then, by integrating such models into autonomous planning, we can develop control frameworks that mimic this shared understanding. We present a driver modeling framework that estimates an empirical reachable set to capture typical lane changing behaviors. This method can predict driver behaviors with up to 90&#x0025; accuracy and cumulative errors less than 1 m. Leveraging this driver model in an optimization-based trajectory planning framework, we can generate trajectories that are similar to those performed by humans. By using this modeling and planning framework, we can improve understanding and integration of nuanced interactions to improve collaboration between humans and autonomy.

Moreover, they have been shown to be more efficient when actively choosing the learning samples, e.g. which object they want to learn. Implementing such abilities on robots can be performed by latenttopic learning models such as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization or Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

This work presents the use of computer vision techniques to improve the positioning of a quadrotor UAV in the landing moment, adding security and precision, overcoming intrinsic errors of other positioning sensors, such as GPS. A landmark was built to be detected by the camera with contour detection, image thresholding and other mathematical techniques in order to obtain fast, simple and robust processing and results. A GoPro camera model was used with a developed algorithm to remove the image distortion. With this set up, the vehicle can be programmed to develop any mission, with this works control algorithm taking part with the vision aided positioning in the landing moment.

This algorithm was developed in Python language, and is in charge of image characteristics segmentation, extracting distances and altitude from the data. The control commands are sent to the quadrotor using the mentioned protocol. The system is structured with a remote laptop connected with a serial port to the quadrotor, and a router transmits messages back and forth among the GCS (Ground Control Station, on the laptop) and the high-level control algorithm (mission planning and vision based control) through TCP ports to the quadrotor itself.

Material and methods: Information was derived from patients participating in the LAPAroscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open (LAPPRO) trial, Sweden. We analyzed the association between self-assessed emotional shock upon diagnosis and psychological well-being by calculating odds ratios (ORs). Results: A total of 2426 patients (75%) reported self-assessed emotional shock by the prostate cancer diagnosis. Median age of study participants was 63. There was an association between emotional shock and low psychological well-being after surgery: adjusted OR 1.7: (95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.4–2.1 at 3 months; adjusted OR 1.3: CI, 1.1–1.7 at 12 months, and adjusted OR 1.4: CI, 1.1–1.8 at 24 months. Among self-assessed emotionally shocked patients, low self-esteem, anxiety, and having no one to confide in were factors more strongly related with low psychological well-being over time. Conclusion: Experiencing self-assessed emotional shock by prostate cancer diagnosis may be associated with low psychological well-being for up to two years after surgery.

The robotic system with virtual assistance was clinically validated to be significantly more effective, compared to both unassisted and typical approaches, by increasing the hand controllability, reducing the physical load and increasing the easiness of maintaining movements within the lines.

In this paper, we treat the ethical case for driverless vehicles seriously and show that it has radical implications for the future of transport. After briefly discussing the current state of driverless vehicle technology, we suggest that systems that rely upon human supervision are likely to be dangerous when used by ordinary people in real-world driving conditions and are unlikely to satisfy the desires of consumers. We then argue that the invention of fully autonomous vehicles that pose a lower risk to third parties than human drivers will establish a compelling case against the moral permissibility of manual driving. As long as driverless vehicles aren't safer than human drivers, it will be unethical to sell them. Once they are safer than human drivers when it comes to risks to 3rd parties, then it should be illegal to drive them: at that point human drivers will be the moral equivalent of drunk robots. We also describe two plausible mechanisms whereby this ethical argument may generate political pressure to have it reflected in legislation. Freeing people from the necessity of driving, though, will transform the relationship people have with their cars, which will in turn open up new possibilities for the transport uses of the automobile. The ethical challenge posed by driverless vehicles for transport policy is therefore to ensure that the most socially and environmentally beneficial of these possibilities is realised. We highlight several key policy choices that will determine how likely it is that this challenge will be met. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous cars; Driverless vehicles; Ethics; Safety; Transport policy; Urban planning","Accident prevention; Philosophical aspects; Transportation; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Autonomous car; Driverless; Ethics; Fully-autonomous vehicles; Plausible mechanisms; Political pressures; Real-world drivings; Transport policy; Vehicles; automobile; ethics; robotics; transportation policy; transportation safety; urban planning; urban transport",2-s2.0-85019039667

Robots have been shown to generate a number of social and behavioral benefits in children with ASD including heightened engagement, increased attention, and decreased social anxiety. Although social robots appear to be effective social reinforcement tools in assistive therapies, the perceptual mechanism underlying these benefits remains unknown. To date, social robot studies have primarily relied on expertise in fields such as engineering and clinical psychology, with measures of social robot efficacy principally limited to qualitative observational assessments of children's interactions with robots. In this review, we examine a range of socially interactive robots that currently have the most widespread use as well as the utility of these robots and their therapeutic effects. In addition, given that social interactions rely on audiovisual communication, we discuss how enhanced sensory processing and integration of robotic social cues may underlie the perceptual and behavioral benefits that social robots confer. Although overall multisensory processing (including audiovisual integration) is impaired in individuals with ASD, social robot interactions may provide therapeutic benefits by allowing audiovisual social cues to be experienced through a simplified version of a human interaction. By applying systems neuroscience tools to identify, analyze, and extend the multisensory perceptual substrates that may underlie the therapeutic benefits of social robots, future studies have the potential to strengthen the clinical utility of social robots for individuals with ASD. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Communication; Cross-modal; Multisensory; Social robot; Socially assistive robot (SAR); Speech","animal; association; autism; cartoonish robot; clinical assessment; communication disorder; communication skill; human; humanoid robot; information processing; neurobiology; neuroscience; perception; priority journal; Review; robotics; sensorimotor integration; social adaptation; social interaction; socially assistive robot; therapy effect; treatment outcome",2-s2.0-85012924178

If an unexpected collision occurs during the motion of a mobile robot, the position of the mobile robot deviates from the initially planned navigation path. In this case, the mobile robot needs a robust controller that enables the mobile robot to accurately navigate toward the goal. This research tries to address the issues related to self-location of the mobile robot.

However, lots of problems may arise in the Tethered Space Robots (TSRs) system from the approaching, capturing, postcapturing and towing phases. The postcapture combination attitude takeover control by the TSR is studied in this paper. Taking control constraints, tether oscillations and external disturbances into consideration, a fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) methodology with dual closed loops for the flexible combination attitude takeover control is designed. The unknown upper bounds of the uncertainties, external disturbances are estimated through adaptive techniques. Stability of the dual closed loop control system and finite time convergence of system states are proved via Lyapunov stability theory. Besides, null space intersection control allocation was adopted to distribute the required control moment over TSR's redundant thrusters.

For this combined pre- and intraoperative SN identification was realized using the hybrid SN tracer, indocyanine green-99mTc-nanocolloid. Combining this dedicated SN tracer with a lymphangiographic tracer such as fluorescein may further enhance the accuracy of SN biopsy. Objective Clinical evaluation of a multispectral fluorescence guided surgery approach using the dedicated SN tracer ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid, the lymphangiographic tracer fluorescein, and a commercially available fluorescence laparoscope. Design, setting, and participants Pilot study in ten patients with prostate cancer. Following ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid administration and preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomograpy imaging, the number and location of SNs were determined. Fluorescein was injected intraprostatically immediately after the patient was anesthetized. A multispectral fluorescence laparoscope was used intraoperatively to identify both fluorescent signatures. Surgical procedure Multispectral fluorescence imaging during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection and SN biopsy. Measurements (1) Number and location of preoperatively identified SNs. (2) Number and location of SNs intraoperatively identified via ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid imaging. (3) Rate of intraoperative lymphatic duct identification via fluorescein imaging. (4) Tumor status of excised (sentinel) lymph node(s). (5) Postoperative complications and follow-up. Results and limitations Near-infrared fluorescence imaging of ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid visualized 85.3% of the SNs. In 8/10 patients, fluorescein imaging allowed bright and accurate identification of lymphatic ducts, although higher background staining and tracer washout were observed. The main limitation is the small patient population. Conclusion Our findings indicate that a lymphangiographic tracer can provide additional information during SN biopsy based on ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid. The study suggests that multispectral fluorescence image–guided surgery is clinically feasible.

Among them, modular robots are presented as a Distributed Control System (DCS), in which the data supply and the flow rates must be ensured to guarantee a proper execution. Although ROS network architecture provides a solution for distributed communication, it entails some disadvantages. Real-time constraints assurance and large networks management are some of the main problems. Therefore, this works introduces a ROS-compatible solution for Smart Resource services decoupling on modular robots. Smart Resources are defined as cyber-physical systems that provide high-level operation services. The design and analysis of a new distributed communication architecture for accessing Smart Resource services is addressed along this document. This architecture is called ROS Multi-Peer Architecture (RMPA) and features real-time communication, fully decoupled ROS device execution, and device discovery. So, the integration of RMPA in ROS based developments provides realtime access to the high-level supplied by the Smart Resources. This integration promotes the development of ROS-compatible robot modules based on the Smart Resource design. Next, a set of tests is presented to compare RMPA and ROS communication performance. Moreover, a detailed study of the RMPA performance is also addressed. Finally, as a result of these experiments main advantages and withdrawals of this solution are discussed leading to the establishment of future work and enhancements. © 2017","Decoupled subsystems; Distributed computer control systems; Mobile robots; Real-time communications",,2-s2.0-85031806289

Recent findings Kinematics of end-effector trajectories, as well as cognitive state features of surgeon trainees and mentors have recently been studied as modalities to objectively evaluate the expertise level of trainees and to shorten the learning process. Virtual reality and haptics also have shown promising in research results in improving the surgical learning process by providing feedback to the trainee. Summary 'Cognitive training' is a novel approach to enhance training and surgical performance. The utility of cognitive training in improving motor skills in other fields, including sports and rehabilitation, is promising enough to justify its utilization to improve surgical performance. However, some surgical procedures, especially ones performed during human-robot interaction in robot-assisted surgery, are much more complicated than sport and rehabilitation. Cognitive training has shown promising results in surgical skills-acquisition in complicated environments such as surgery. However, these methods are mostly developed in research groups using limited individuals. Transferring this research into the clinical applications is a demanding challenge. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current status of these novel cognitive training approaches in surgery and to investigate the potential role of cognitive training in surgical education.

Much work has focused on instantiating learning or evolution in robots, but relatively little on development. Although many theories have been forwarded as to how development can aid evolution, it is difficult to isolate each such proposed mechanism. Thus, here we introduce a minimal yet embodied model of development: the body of the robot changes over its lifetime, yet growth is not influenced by the environment. We show that even this simple developmental model confers evolvability because it allows evolution to sweep over a larger range of body plans than an equivalent non-developmental system, and subsequent heterochronic mutations 'lock in' this body plan in more morphologically-static descendants. Future work will involve gradually complexifying the developmental model to determine when and how such added complexity increases evolvability. © 2017 ACM.","Artificial life; Development; Evolutionary robotics; Heterochrony; Morphogenesis; Soft robotics","Education; Robotics; Robots; Artificial Life; Development; Evolutionary robotics; Heterochrony; Morphogenesis; Soft robotics; Biology",2-s2.0-85026357851

Although age per se is not a good predictor for ICU survival it frequently comes along with several comorbidities influencing not only ICU but also one to five year survival as well as quality of life compared to a matched non-post-ICU population. Therefore, risk stratification among others seeking for signs of frailty in addition to the development of instruments in order to estimate the post-ICU quality of life are important in order to perform a sound risk-benefit analysis. For patients at risk scheduled for a major intervention pre-interventional interdisciplinary case analysis and discussion including patient and next of kin is warranted. Moreover, aged patients are at risk for under and overtreatment why clear written strategies adapted to the individual case have to be established. With regard to the development of more and more advanced treatment options in patients who finally cannot be cured a change of paradigm concerning palliative care is urgently needed. In these situations palliative care should not be seen as treatment option in the last days only but as accompanying support as soon as it is recognized that cure is not possible. This allows the patient to discuss and establish an advanced care planning together with the care givers. Major challenges in the very near future result from advances in personalized medicine (including genetic analysis) and from digital transformations of our societies. Both are closely connected and will change modern medicine within the next 15 years entirely. Expert systems with artificial intelligence and robots will support but also confront health care professionals with their limitations and hopefully remind them that medicine is not only science but also art and that the digital world at least for a while cannot provide clinical judgment, empathy and humanity as good as human beings. © 2017 Hogrefe.",,,2-s2.0-85022041303

Here, we describe a pilot study assessing the relationships between robotic surgery simulator performance and 3 categories of activities, namely, videogames, musical instruments, and athletics. Design A questionnaire was administered to preclinical medical students for general demographic information and prior experiences in surgery, videogames, musical instruments, and athletics. For follow-up performance studies, we used the Matchboard Level 1 and 2 modules on the da Vinci Skills Simulator, and recorded overall score, time to complete, economy of motion, workspace range, instrument collisions, instruments out of view, and drops. Task 1 was run once, whereas task 2 was run 3 times. Setting All performance studies on the da Vinci Surgical Skills Simulator took place in the Simulation Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Participants All participants were medical students at the Geisel School of Medicine. After excluding students with prior hands-on experience in surgery, a total of 30 students completed the study. Results We found a significant correlation between athletic skill level and performance for both task 1 (p = 0.0002) and task 2 (p = 0.0009). No significant correlations were found for videogame or musical instrument skill level. Students with experience in certain athletics (e.g., volleyball, tennis, and baseball) tended to perform better than students with experience in other athletics (e.g., track and field). For task 2, which was run 3 times, this association did not persist after the third repetition due to significant improvements in students with low-level athletic skill (levels 0-2). Conclusions Our study suggests that prior experience in high-level athletics, but not videogames or musical instruments, significantly influences surgical proficiency in robot-naive students. Furthermore, our study suggests that practice through task repetition can overcome initial differences that may be related to a background in athletics. These novel relationships may have broader implications for the future recruitment and training of robotic surgeons and may warrant further investigation. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; robotic surgery; simulation; surgical education; surgical skills training","adult; Article; athletics; experience; eye hand coordination; female; follow up; human; information; male; medical student; pilot study; priority journal; questionnaire; robot assisted surgery; robotic surgical procedure; simulator; skill; surgeon; task performance; video game",2-s2.0-85009212202

But well-known challenges and pitfalls of minimal invasive rectal surgery have not been evaluated by a prospective, multicenter setting so far. Aim of this study was to analyze the perioperative outcome of patients following RRS especially in regard to the pitfalls such as obesity, male patients and low tumors by a European multicenter setting. Methods This prospective study included 348 patients undergoing robotic surgery due to rectal cancer in six major European centers. Clinicopathological parameters, morbidity, perioperative recovery and short-term outcome were analyzed. Results A total of 283 restorative surgeries and 65 abdominoperineal resections were carried out. The conversion rate was 4.3%, mean blood loss was 191 ml, and mean operative time was 315 min. Postoperative complications with a Clavien-Dindo score >2 were observed in 13.5%. Obesity and low rectal tumors showed no significant higher rates of major complications or impaired oncological parameters.

Then we use the mean function of the Gaussian process to infer the multiple RSS source locations. The inferred source locations are modelled as the probability distribution using Gaussian mixture-probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter. This modelling enables nonparametric approximation of mutual information between source locations and future robot positions. We combine the variance function of the Gaussian process and the mutual information to design an informative and noise-robust planning algorithm for multiple robots.

Contemporary developments suggest that the future of warfare will not be 'robots' as technological, individualised substitutions for idealised (masculine) warfighters, but warfighters understood as swarms: Insect metaphors for non-centrally organised problem-solvers that will become technologies of racialisation. As such, contemporary feminist analysis requires an analysis of the politics of life and death in the insect and the swarm, which, following Braidotti (2002), cannot be assumed to be a mere metaphor or representation of political life, but an animating materialist logic. The swarm is not only a metaphor but also a central mode of biopolitical and necropolitical war, with the 'terrorist' enemy represented as swarm-like as well. In analysing the relations of assemblage and antagonism in the war ontologies of the drone swarm, I seek inspiration from what Hayles (1999, p. 47) describes as a double vision that 'looks simultaneously at the power of simulation and at the materialities that produce it'. I discuss various representations and manifestations of swarms and insect life in science/speculative fiction, from various presentations of the 'Borg' in Star Trek (1987-1994, 1995-2001, 1996), Alien (1979) and The Fly (1958, 1986) to more positive representations of the 'becoming-insect' as possible feminist utopia in Gilman's Herland (2015 [1915]) and Tiptree's Houston, Houston, Do You Read? (1989 [1976]). Posthuman warfare also contains the possibilities of both appropriating and rewriting antagonisms of masculine and feminine in the embodiment of the subject of war in the swarm. This piece seeks to analyse new ways of feminist theorising of the relations of power and violence in the embodiment of war as the swarm. © 2017 The Feminist Review Collective.","drone; insect; queer; swarm",,2-s2.0-85031699106

In addition, we consider state and input constraints as well as a set of possible disturbances. While previous optimal control techniques typically ignore the fact that the current state of a system is not exactly known, future safety-critical systems demand that all uncertainties including the initial state are considered; this is required for e.g. automated vehicles, surgical robots, or human-robot interaction. We present a new method that obtains optimal control inputs by finding optimal weights for generators that span the space reachable by the considered system. This solution routine can be used not only for a single initial state but also for a set of initial states - this is not possible using classical optimization techniques. We ensure that all constraints are met by using reachability analysis, which provides formal bounds for all possible system trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with an example from automated driving; for this example, the result is obtained within a few seconds and outperforms a classical LQR approach. © 2017","Control of Constrained Systems; Nonlinear Control; Optimal Control; Reach-Avoid Problems; Reachability Analysis; Robust Control; Zonotopes",,2-s2.0-85027060763

They have increasingly become the choice of intervention for a number of thoracic surgical operations. Minimally invasive surgery decreases postoperative pain, hospital stay and leads to a faster recovery in comparison with conventional open methods. Minimally invasive techniques to perform a thymectomy include video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). In this study, we aim to systematically review and interrogate the literature on minimally invasive thymectomy and draw a meta-analysis on the outcomes between the two approaches. Methods An extensive electronic health database search was performed on all articles published from inception to May 2015 for studies describing outcomes in VATS and RATS thymectomy. Results A total of 350 patients were included in this study, for which 182 and 168 patients underwent RATS and VATS thymectomy, respectively. There were no recorded in-hospital deaths for either procedure. There was no statistical difference in conversion to open, length of hospital stay, or postoperative pneumonia. Operational times for RATS thymectomy were longer. Conclusions The VATS and RATS thymectomy offer good and safe operative and perioperative outcomes. There is little difference between the two groups. However, there is poor evidence basis for the long-term outcomes in minimally invasive procedures for thymectomy. It is imperative that future studies evaluate oncological outcomes both short and long term as well as those related to safety. © 2017 by the International Society for Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery.","Minimally invasive thoracic surgery; Myasthenia gravis; Robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Thymectomy; Thymoma; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery",,2-s2.0-85032342510

We therefore systematically manipulated the visual presentation (i.e., scaling factor and optical flow density) of a visuomotor tracking task without changing the task itself, and investigated the effect on performance, effort, motor control strategy (i.e., anticipatory or corrective steering) and underlying neuromechanical parameters (i.e., intrinsic muscle stiffness and damping, and proprioceptive and visual feedback). Twenty healthy participants controlled the left-right position of a virtual car (by means of wrist rotations in a haptic robot) to track a slightly curved virtual road (presented on a 60” LED screen), while small torque perturbations were applied to the wrist (1.25–20 Hz multisine) for quantification of the neuromechanical parameters. This visuomotor tracking task was performed in conditions with low/medium/high scaling factor and low/high optical flow density. Task performance was high in all conditions (tracking accuracy 96.6%–100%); a higher scaling factor was associated with slightly better performance. As expected, participants did adapt their control strategy and the use of proprioceptive and visual feedback in response to changes in the visual presentation.

The use of DARS to accomplish tasks within a complex environment with limited resources requires strategies that can leverage the inherent redundancies within these systems. In fact, different DARS strategies produce differents DARS architectures, and the practical level of DARS design is reflected by reliability of DARS architectures. However, there are still some challenges, which contain communication, control, perception and energy management, in reliability evaluation of DARS architectures design. Therefore, considering these challenges, reliability evaluation model study of DARS architectures is needed in engineering. In order to evaluate reliability of DARS architectures systematically, and guide DARS architectures design effectively, this paper provides a reliability evaluation model of DARS architectures. There are five factors in this model, such as communication ability, adaptation ability, information integration, task allocation, and destination achievement. This model will evaluate these factors separately and provide a combined evaluation result together. Additionally, this paper explains a case to demonstrate how this model could be used in projects. The case indicates that the model could take advantage of reliability factors together, and gives a reasonable reliability evaluation in engineering.

The results indicate that of the 784 pedestrians observed, 63.5&#x0025; took time to observe the robot, 30.6&#x0025; ignored the robot, and 5.9&#x0025; stopped and interacted with the robot.

Pedestrians traveling in groups were also more likely to stop and interact with the robot than those traveling alone. The results from this field research will be used in the near future to inform the development of a pedestrian model to include responses to robots that may be in the environment, and could also be used to inform design features for UGVs.

A problem that faces autonomous robots is dealing with novel situations. One of the recent technologies that has proven its ability to deal with such situation is Brain-Based Device(BBD). However, the large computational power needed to simulate its nervous system is a major limitation. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a hybrid system that consists of neuronal and non-neuronal areas. In non-neuronal areas, computer vision algorithms are used to extract some features from images. While neuronal-areas are connected together based on a detailed neuroanatomical structure to mimic the human learning process. OpenCV is used for extracting features and obtaining invariant object-recognition.

Dynamic finite element analysis was specially done to simulate the complicate response of its flexible tower-cable-cabin suspension system under a kind of catastrophic accident that was caused by sudden rupture of the high-speed shaft of the motor within one certain cable-driven machine of the robot. As a result, the overbalanced steel cable began to fall and it in turn triggered the safety brake to function on the low-speed shaft of the cable drum and finally to stop the falling of the cable. The whole process was accompanied by the cable falling of the cable drum and then the following shock vibration of the flexible suspension system. The simulation was carried on three stages: first finding the equilibrium shape of the suspension system, then computing the cable falling on the drum, finally analyzing the shock vibration of the flexible suspension system with the input of time curve of the cable falling. Meanwhile a few simplified models were applied in the simulation, such as the model of mass-spring vibrator for the tower structure, the simplified force-time curve of the safety brake, the model of the rope-block sliding system, and so on. The simulation result shows that the overbalance shock by high-speed shaft rupture induces large scale vibration of the flexible suspension system, which should be considered seriously in the future design. © 2017, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

However, for detecting human motions that include both subtle and large motions, these strain sensors can't meet the diverse demands simultaneously. Here, we come up with laser patterned graphene strain sensors with self-adapted and tunable performance for the first time. A series of strain sensors with either an ultrahigh gauge factor or a preferable strain range can be fabricated simultaneously via one-step laser patterning, and are suitable for detecting all human motions. The strain sensors have a GF of up to 457 with a strain range of 35%, or have a strain range of up to 100% with a GF of 268. Most importantly, the performance of the strain sensors can be easily tuned by adjusting the patterns of the graphene, so that the sensors can meet diverse demands in both subtle and large motion situations. The graphene strain sensors show significant potential in applications such as wearable electronics, health monitoring and intelligent robots.

Methods: Subjects grasped the handle of a horizontal planar robot, with their arm and the robot hidden from view. The robot applied graded force perturbations, which produced small displacements of the handle. The AMD test required subjects to respond verbally to queries regarding whether or not they detected arm motions. Each participant completed ten, 60s trials; in five of the trials, force perturbations were increased in small increments until the participant detected motion while in the others, perturbations were decreased until the participant could no longer detect motion. The mean and standard deviation of the 10 movement detection thresholds were used to compute a Proprioceptive Acuity Score (PAS). Based on the sensitivity and consistency of the estimated thresholds, the PAS quantifies the likelihood that proprioception is intact. Lower PAS scores correspond to higher proprioceptive acuity. Thirty-nine participants completed the AMD test, consisting of 25 neurologically intact control participants (NIC), seven survivors of stroke with intact proprioception in the more affected limb (HSS+P), and seven survivors of stroke with impaired or absent proprioception in the more affected limb (HSS-P). Results: Significant group differences were found, with the NIC and HSS+P groups having lower (i.e., better) PAS scores than the HSS-P group. A subset of the participants completed the AMD test multiple times and the AMD test was found to be reliable across repetitions. Conclusions: The AMD test required less than 15 min to complete and provided an objective, ratio-scaled measure of proprioceptive acuity in the upper limb. In the future, this test could be utilized to evaluate the contributions of sensory deficits to motor recovery following stroke. © 2017 The Author(s).","Aging; Displacement; Force; Proprioception; Stroke; Threshold; Uncertainty","adaptation; adult; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Arm Movement Detection test; Article; bleeding disorder; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease severity; female; hemiparesis; human; male; middle aged; motor control; motor dysfunction assessment; myasthenia gravis; neuromuscular function; priority journal; proprioception; Proprioceptive Acuity Score; range of motion; robotics; scoring system; sensorimotor function; survival rate",2-s2.0-85021390387

Specifically, the paper discusses results of introducing faculty on-going research in the areas of human and protein kinematics into a junior mechanical engineering Kinematics of Mechanisms course, with the main goal of preparing the students to be critical thinkers, cross-disciplinary problem solvers and life-long learners. In the paper the term ""integrated research"" is used to refer to all categories of research involving integrated multiple disciplines. The Kinematics of Mechanisms is a lecture course which presents knowledge on the analysis, design and construction of mechanical systems, such as serial and parallel linkages, cams and gear systems and robot manipulators, to name a few. During the Fall 2016 semester, new experiences in the form of interactive activities, including research projects were developed and incorporated within the course. These activities were specifically designed to enhance the students' knowledge of how the above-mentioned mechanical systems appear in other domains, such as Biomechanics and Biochemistry with the goal of giving the students the opportunity to not only cross boundaries, but also integrate and use current knowledge in their own area to solve research problems in other disciplines. Results related to the three desired learning outcomes (critical thinking, intellectual maturity, and responsibility for own learning) were assessed through anonymous surveys. The results were based on students' as well as faculty perception. Part of the assessment was indirect and required the students to outline questions that they were asking themselves while working on each project. A comparison between the results from two sections of the class, both taught during the Fall 2016 semester, one with and one without the incorporated new activities, showed that presenting a series of multidisciplinary projects designed specifically to complement each other, improves students' critical thinking, intellectual maturity, and responsibility for their own learning. The intellectual growth was the category that improved the most, based on students' and faculty perception. In addition, the difference in students' performance on the project content and presentation between the two sections resulted in a difference of about 20%. This shows that the developed methods prove efficient not only for learning new material, but also in transferring learned skills to tasks of greater difficulty, i.e. interdisciplinary activities that are not necessarily within the typical mechanical engineering kinematics of mechanisms domain. The idea of enhancing a junior mechanism kinematics course with research activities related to application of gained knowledge in different domains is novel and provides interesting and promising perspectives, showing that such activities increase the students' knowledge and interest in learning, and at the same time enhance their critical thinking and intellectual growth. Although the new projects and lectures were developed specifically for mechanical engineering students, with sufficient changes the activities could be adopted in Health and Kinesiology, Biology, Biochemistry or Biotechnology courses in future. This will allow for continued data collection to assist our efforts in the development of curricula specifically designed to challenge students to cross boundaries and solve research problems in other disciplines. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.","Biochemistry; Biomechanics; Kinematics of Mechanisms; Protein kinematics","Associative storage; Biochemistry; Biomechanics; Curricula; Engineering education; Gears; Kinematics; Machine design; Manipulators; Mechanics; Mechanisms; Problem solving; Proteins; Robot applications; Students; Teaching; Design and construction; Faculty perceptions; Interactive activities; Interdisciplinary activities; Mechanical engineering students; Multidisciplinary projects; Multiple disciplines; Research activities; Education",2-s2.0-85030554735

With the release of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), engineering design is raised to the level of scientific inquiry. Both pre-service teachers and inservice teachers should be exposed to engineering design through professional development programs and modification of existing science teacher education courses before they are asked to integrate engineering design to their science teaching. The aim of this paper is to document to what extent pre-service elementary teachers improve their nature of engineering (NOE) views after taking an undergraduate level elementary science teaching methods course. This course was modified to make it more compatible with the Next Generation Science Standards. The course in its modified form includes engineering design component. Specifically, the engineering design component was addressed with the use of educational robotics. The pre-service elementary teachers, with no earlier educational robotics experience, were introduced to the engineering design through educational robotics challenges. Pre-service teachers' NOE views were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the methods course to determine whether they improved their NOE views. NGSS aligned challenges with the Mindstorms EV3 educational robotics kit were used to explicitly teach pre-service elementary teachers about NOE. Because of the popularity of First Lego League (FLL) competition in engaging elementary students to engineering fields, researchers used materials associated with this successful program during the course. Simultaneously, pre-service teachers reflected on how these lessons could apply to their future students' understanding of NOE views. In this study, we conceptualized NOE views as engineering design ideas are tentative, subjective, socially and culturally embedded, depends on human imagination and creativity, requires social collaboration and, subject to empirical tests. We found that pre-service elementary teachers improved their NOE views across these NOE aspects.

Typically, PBL has been employed most effectively with junior- and senior-level bachelor of science (B.S.) engineering and computer science students. Some of the more effective PBL techniques employed by colleges and universities include robotics, unmanned air vehicles (drones), and computer science-based technologies for modeling and simulation (M&S).

It should be obvious to even the casual observer that today's automobiles have never been as intelligent or technologically sophisticated as they presently are. In fact, automobiles are in the process of morphing into super-computers/robots on wheels. It is widely predicted that in a few short years autonomous cars will be in mass production. As they become an appreciable fraction of the automotive fleet, many believe that automotive transportation will forever change for the better. The most important change will involve vehicle safety but many have predicted a whole multitude of other sociological changes to human behavior involving automotive transportation. Today, the automobile manufacturers advertise advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) like self-braking or collision avoidance systems. Enabled by networked embedded controllers and complex sensors and actuators, ADAS systems are becoming standard equipment on an automakers fleet and not just the high-end models. In the near future, using these enabling technologies, even more sophisticated sensors, and emerging wireless networking technologies the automobile will become a true cyber-physical system aware of its surroundings and eventually capable of autonomous operation. Presently, formal education of these advanced technology enablers is woefully lacking at vocational (K-12), post-secondary technical schools, and two-year colleges that teach automotive technology. Furthermore, most colleges that offer electrical/electronic engineering technology (EET) education at the two-year college level, as of yet, do not have educational courses or programs to teach this new technology if they were called upon to fulfill the need. The enabling technologies for these ADAS systems are inter-disciplinary in nature. Computer networking for automobiles, embedded controllers, wireless networking, radar and LiDAR are not common topics found in typical EET programs, let alone automotive technology programs that still tend to focus on traditional mechanical technologies. Truly autonomous automobiles will also need an additional support infrastructure that will allow vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, as well as, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) wireless networking. There will need to be an effort made to supply technicians with the skill sets needed to install, evaluate, maintain, and up-grade these advanced automotive systems and support infrastructure as they are presently being manufactured and envisioned for the future. This paper will attempt to present a ""road map"" to a future curriculum that will satisfy the needs of this rapidly emerging transformation in automotive transportation technology. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Advanced driver assistance systems; Automobile drivers; Automobile manufacture; Automobile safety devices; Automobiles; Behavioral research; Education; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Fleet operations; Optical radar; Societies and institutions; Taxicabs; Teaching; Vehicle to roadside communications; Vehicles; Automobile manufacturers; Automotive technology; Automotive transportation; Autonomous operations; Collision avoidance systems; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Vehicle to infrastructure (V2I); Wireless networking technology; Vehicle to vehicle communications",2-s2.0-85030548852

Each year, the Japanese university selected a few students, who self-financed their travel and a weeklong stay in India, and participated in the program. Based on the background and profile of participating Japanese students, the Japanese and Indian program directors identified projects, and the Indian program director selected appropriate Indian students. In the first year, the teams executed an Indian cultural portal and water rocket projects; in the second year, it was an augmented reality project, and in the third year, a health robot project. Typically, in December, the program directors identified projects. In January and February, students worked on their projects by interacting with their counterparts from the other country over the Skype. In late Feb and early March, the Japanese students visited India for a week and along with the Indian students completed their projects. The paper discusses experience of the Japanese students. They maintained a journal during the India trip and filled in a feedback form indicating their satisfaction with the program using the net promoter concept, expectations and learning from the program, and suggestions for future program iterations.

Therefore, engineering education has been extending from theoretical education towards hands-on, challenging projectbased education. The aim is to teach students real-life problem-solving skills along with communication and teamwork skills, which are also essential in the future working environment after graduation. Tracking this learning experience efficiently is one of the critical steps for improving it. And industry around the world is increasingly interested and has incentives in measuring the effectiveness of the design process and the design team, as commercial product development and R&D are expensive, risky, and time-consuming. In the experiment conducted in January 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland, the participants were from four different European countries and from several different study backgrounds. Most of them were participating the experiment as an elective part of their postgraduate studies. The teams were challenged with a task to build a robot which communicates with the user, is easy to use, moves independently, and should be able to express four distinct emotions. The challenge lasted for 4 days and 4 hours. Data was collected and analyzed by using three different research methods; time-lapse images, time-tracking software operated by the coaches individually, and written coach notes. The teams were tracked with eight time-lapse cameras and time tracker data was collected with software installed to coaches' mobile phones. Coaches also made handwritten notes after each student interaction to elaborate details about the encountered issues. To synchronize with other methods, the notes also included a timestamp when the coach had helped the team. Time-tracking data from coaches showed in detail, how much time the coaches had spent with the teams. There were only a few times when a coach made a mistake by forgetting to start or stop the timer. Without the alternative methods, this information would be quite hard to analyze since one could only see the duration of the session and time when it happened. Handwritten notes, on the other hand, did give an enormous amount of additional qualitative information about what kind of problems the teams were facing in their challenge. The outcome of the study is that none of the three methods proved to be superior, but each one of them brings up useful data for future studies when combined. The paper will introduce detailed recommendations in building and updating such a measurement setup in a dedicated working space and analyze the gathered data in more detail. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85030557339

Each certificate can be completed within a year. The final semester is dedicated to a paid industry internship where students are supervised by both company and faculty advisors while learning on the job skills at a partnering company. The internship is mandatory for the students to graduate. Students may work up to 40 hours a week and are paid up to $15/hour. These internships can often lead to fulltime employment. Sometimes it is difficult for students to secure paid internships. This paper describes an innovative model where a partnering company can provide a project for the students to work on inhouse at the college campus. In turn, the Community College compensates the students for 80 hours @ $15/hour, the minimum number of hours to fulfill the internship requirement for the certificate. The Community College faculty advisor of the project, acts as a liaison between the company and the students. Moreover, as part of the NSF funded project, the Community College works collaboratively with a local major University. Thus, the Community College faculty advisor is aided by a Ph.D. graduate student from the University. As a result of these collaborations, the team consists of three or four Community College students, a Community College faculty advisor, an industry advisor from the sponsoring company that provides the project, and a Ph.D. graduate student. All stakeholders work together during the semester to complete an industry project. The partnering company initially provided multiple projects and after careful consideration, the students ultimately selected one of them. The project goal was to design robot safety cages around some manufacturing equipment to safeguard the machine operator from moving robotic equipment traveling at abovehead level. The company provided the project specs. The students set to design and simulate cages design using SolidWorks CAD/CAM software. Students, the faculty advisor, and the graduate student visited the company during the project execution and had regular contact with the company advisor, during the semester, to seek feedback and test their designs. By the end of the project, the students were able to successfully design new cages to meet the company requirements. This paper describes the project in more detail, how team members worked together, the company's feedback, guidance to students, and the company's plans to implement the final design and build the cages.

With the advancement of technologies, the current and incoming tech-savvy learners grow up with the digital world. Such technology advancement makes learning more accessible. As one of the examples, mobile learning has become a commonly accepted and embraced concept among the younger generations. Effective learning occurs when the teaching styles align well with the learning styles. To better serve the need of the next-generation learners in a more accessible way, a standalone mobile learning module was developed for an undergraduate upper division class, Mechanical and Structural Vibration, at San Francisco State University (SFSU). The developed mobile learning module consisted of three interconnected components, namely Analysis, Simulation and Experiment, representing the three important elements in a good engineering learning environment - theory, practical example and physical experimentation. Besides delivering the theoretical knowledge and important concepts, the learning module also allows students further examine the gained knowledge through animated simulations in the interactive Apps. In addition, the module includes a mobile remote shake table laboratory (RSTLab) which provides students the opportunity to remotely participate and conduct physical shake table experiments in real-time through smart mobile devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets). Through these physical experiments, students may easily use scaled physical models to test theories and implement their own innovations to observe how structures behave under different ground excitations. A telepresence robot is innovatively adopted and integrated with the mobile RSTLab to actively engage students and provide them a real sense of in-person participation without the need of being physically present in the laboratory. The learning module was implemented in Fall 2016 at SFSU as a ""flipped laboratory"". Pre- and post-surveys were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the mobile learning module to fulfil course learning outcomes. Survey results demonstrated the readiness of the mobile learning and improvement in participants' knowledge competence after using the module.

It then reviews research in developmental robotics that has attempted to retrace parts of the developmental trajectory of the self. This should be of interest to developmental psychologists, and researchers in developmental robotics. As a point of departure, one of the most characteristic aspects of human social interaction is cooperation-the process of entering into a joint enterprise to achieve a common goal. Fundamental to this ability to cooperate is the underlying ability to enter into, and engage in, a self-other relation. This suggests that if we intend for robots to cooperate with humans, then to some extent robots must engage in these self-other relations, and hence they must have some aspect of a self. Decades of research in human cognitive development indicate that the self is not fully present from the outset, but rather that it is developed in a usage-based fashion, that is, through engaging with the world, including the physical world and the social world of animate intentional agents. In an effort to characterize the self, Ulric Neisser noted that self is not unitary, and he thus proposed five types of self-knowledge that correspond to five distinct components of self: ecological, interpersonal, conceptual, temporally extended, and private. He emphasized the ecological nature of each of these levels, how they are developed through the engagement of the developing child with the physical and interpersonal worlds. Crucially, development of the self has been shown to rely on the child's autobiographical memory. From the developmental robotics perspective, this suggests that in principal it would be possible to develop certain aspects of self in a robot cognitive system where the robot is engaged in the physical and social world, equipped with an autobiographical memory system. We review a series of developmental robotics studies that make progress in this enterprise. We conclude with a summary of the properties that are required for the development of these different levels of self, and we identify topics for future research.","Autobiographical memory; Human-robot interaction; Self","Cognitive systems; Ecology; Robotics; Robots; Autobiographical memory; Cognitive development; Developmental robotics; Human social interactions; Intentional agents; Joint enterprise; Point of departures; Self; Human robot interaction; autobiographical memory; child; cognitive development; human; human experiment; joint; male; psychologist; robotics; scientist; social interaction",2-s2.0-85021122703

The human body is composed of joints and links, suiting approximation by a kinematic chain, but the control strategy of the human is completely unknown, meaning the potential occupancy grows very fast and it is difficult to compute tightly in real time. As such, most previous work considers only specific, known, or probable movements, and usually does not account for a range of human dimensions. Focusing on the human arm, we analyze archetypal movements performed by test subjects to create a dynamic model. Motion-capture data of subjects are fitted, for modeling purposes, to two abstractions: a 4-degree of freedom (DOF) model and a 3-DOF model, to obtain dynamic parameters. We validate our approach on movements from a publicly available database. The prediction is shown to be computationally fast, and reachable sets of the abstraction are shown to enclose all possible future occupancies of the arm for different subjects, tightly but overapproximatively. The 3-DOF model has advantages over the 4-DOF in terms of speed, though the 4-DOF model is tighter at smaller time horizons. Such an overapproximative representation is intended for certifiable safety-guaranteed collision avoidance algorithms for robots.

Our objective is to enable human–robot interaction by allowing a robot to follow behind a human moving in (up to) six degrees of freedom. In particular, we have developed a system to allow a robot to detect, track and follow a scuba diver by using frequency-domain detection of biological motion patterns. The motion of biological entities is characterized by combinations of periodic motions which are inherently distinctive. This is especially true of human swimmers. By using the frequency-space response of spatial signals over a number of video frames, we attempt to identify signatures pertaining to biological motion. This technique is applied to track scuba divers in underwater domains, typically with the robot swimming behind the diver. The algorithm is able to detect a range of motions, which includes motion directly away from or towards the camera. Once detected, the motion of the diver relative to the vehicle is then tracked using an Unscented Kalman Filter, an approach for non-linear estimation. The efficiency of our approach makes it attractive for real-time applications on-board our underwater vehicle, and in future applications we intend to track scuba divers in real-time with the robot.

A 3-axis gantry robot with rodless pneumatic cylinders for actuation and proportional flow control valves was modified to enable experiments on the polishing of steel sheet. An air motor with a buffing wheel was mounted on the Z-axis to provide the polishing action, with the Z-axis cylinder controlling the applied buffing force. Based upon past experience, the FLC for X and Y-axis trajectory control. was supplemented by both system time lag and friction compensators with velocity feedback. In this application, performance is measured by the controller's ability to track a two dimensional shape as well as its ability to minimize the absolute tracking error. Details of the FLC controller including the nature of the membership functions and the rule base are given. Experimental results show that: a) FLC tracks better than a traditional proportional-velocity-differential pressure (PVdP) controller, b) lag and friction compensators are effective and c) the zig-zag trajectory needed for polishing is possible. Future work includes confirming that FLC is more robust than PVdP, in that it should be able to maintain tracking performance as the polishing wheel is applied to the sheet steel, which will generate a variable load. © 2017 IEEE.","Fuzzy logic; Pneumatics; Polishing; Tracking","Buffing; Computer circuits; Cylinders (shapes); Friction; Fuzzy logic; Membership functions; Pneumatics; Polishing; Robots; Stiction; Surface discharges; Wheels; Differential pressures; Friction compensator; Fuzzy logic controllers; Pneumatic Cylinders; Proportional flow control valves; Tracking performance; Trajectory control; Velocity feedback; Controllers",2-s2.0-85021807598

This paper presents a working prototype of an active Velcro based stiffness controllable fastening mechanism inspired from micro active hooks found in some species of plants and animals. In contrast to conventional passive Velcro, this active Velcro mechanism can vary the stiffness level of its hooks to adapt to external forces and to maintain the structure of its supported layer. The active hooks are fabricated using Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires which can be actuated using Lenz-Joule heating technique via thermo-electric manipulation. In this paper, we show experimental results for the effects of active SMA Velcro temperature, density and number on the attachment resisting force profile in dynamic displacement.

Typical ways to address this problem are based on swarm intelligence and very especially using the so-called response threshold method. In the aforementioned method a robot has a certain probability of executing a task which depends on a task threshold response and a task stimulus. Nevertheless, response threshold method cannot be extended in a natural way to allocate more than two tasks when the theoretical basis is provided by probability theory. Motivated by this fact, this paper leaves the probabilistic approach to the problem and provides a first theoretical framework towards a possibilistic approach. Thus, task allocation problem is addressed using fuzzy Markov chains instead of probabilistic processes. This paper demonstrates that fuzzy Markov chains associated to a task allocation problem can converge to a stationary stage in a finite number of steps. In contrast, the probabilistic processes only can converge asymptotically, i.e. the number of steps is not bounded in general. Moreover, fuzzy Markov chains predicts in a better way the future behavior of the system in the presence of vagueness when measuring distances. The simulations performed confirm the theoretical results and show how the number of steps needed to get a stable state with fuzzy Markov chains is reduced more than 10 times and the system’s behavior prediction can be improved more than a 60% compared to probabilistic approaches. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Multi-robot; Possibility theory; Swarm intelligence; Task allocation","Artificial intelligence; Chains; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Markov processes; Multipurpose robots; Probability; Robot applications; Robots; Multi-robot task allocation; Multirobots; Possibilistic approach; Possibility theory; Probabilistic approaches; Probabilistic process; Task allocation; Theoretical framework; Swarm intelligence",2-s2.0-85020446805

However, for soft robots to become mass-producible in future days, rapid design and modeling tools are indispensable.

An analysis of the optimum placement of two vertically collinear reflectors suggests that placement atop a 300m deployable support structure would be sufficient to provide year round illumination to points of interest in the crater below. In order to provide the 300W/m2 of sunlight necessary for the robots to operate, each solar reflector must unfold to over 1000m2 of reflective surface area, have over 95% long term directional reflectivity in the visible regime, and be flat within 1mm/m of deviation. Each reflector must also stow to less than 1m3 in volume, have less than 100kg of mass, and be less than 1mm thick. Two classes of origami crease patterns have been developed that will allow a 25μm thick aluminized biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate solar reflector with 95% visible reflectivity, to be stowed within a cylinder 1m tall, 1m in diameter, with a mass of 35kg, and with up to 0.71m3 volume to spare in the center for other components. Each class of origami crease pattern can be deployed from their perimeter by an attached inflatable thermoplastic torus that heats up during deployment to maintain flexibility and cools to maintain rigidity afterward. The remainder of the 1m3 volume will be allocated to the inflatable deployment mechanism, electronics, and the déployable support structure. In order to maintain flatness, carbon fiber fabric tapes would run along the load bearing paths opposite of the reflective surface. Simulations of an elliptic solar reflector under lunar gravity show that a single carbon fiber fabric tape 40cm wide that spans the length of the reflector is sufficient to maintain the required flatness. Future work includes simulating the deployment of the solar reflectors with their support structure, building and testing larger scale prototypes, and performing field tests in relevant environments. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Carbon fibers; Ground supports; Lunar missions; Moon; Carbon fiber fabrics; Deployment mechanisms; Extreme environment; Optimum placement; Points of interest; Reflective surfaces; Robotic explorations; Support structures; Reflection",2-s2.0-85021251439

In this context, the difficulty level of the game was adapted to each patient's performance, and this individualized adaptation was addressed as the main challenge of the game development. The game was implemented on the REAplan end-effector rehabilitation robot, which was used in continuous interaction with the game. A preliminary feasibility study of a target pointing game was run in order to validate the game features and parameters. Results showed that the game was perceived as enjoyable, and that patients reported a desire to play the game again. Most of the targets included in the game design were realistic, and they were well perceived by the patients. Results also suggested that the cognitive help strategy could include one visual prompting cue, possibly combined with an auditory cue. It was observed that the motor assistance provided by the robot was well adapted for each patient's impairments, but the study results led to a suggestion that the triggering conditions should be reviewed. Patients and therapists reported the desire to receive more feedback on the patient's performances. Nevertheless, more patients and therapists are needed to play the game in order to give further and more comprehensive feedback that will allow for improvements of the serious game.

The authors present a hominid robotic system that is equipped with multi-point-contact feet and an active artificial spine to incorporate extended sensing and locomotion capabilities for walking robots. In the proposed robotic system, the front and rear part are connected via an actuated spinal structure with six degrees of freedom. To increase the robustness of the system's locomotion in terms of traction and stability, a footlike structure equipped with various sensors has been developed. Altogether, the robot embodies more than 330 sensors. In terms of distributed local control, the structures feature their own local intelligence and are as autonomous as possible regarding sensing, sensor preprocessing, control, and communication. This allows the robot to respond to external disturbances with minor latency. Within this paper, the proposed robotic system and its distributed and hierarchical control method are presented.

The results show that the presented approach is viable and improves the flexibility of the locomotor system. A hominid design was chosen in order to perform various types of locomotion. To demonstrate the entire functionality of the developed hardware, two different motion modes (quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion) are investigated. This also includes a stable transition from a four-legged posture to an upright posture and vice versa. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Body sensor networks; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Machine design; Mobile robots; Musculoskeletal system; Point contacts; Robots; Bipedal locomotion; External disturbances; Future applications; Hierarchical control; Multi-point contacts; Six degrees of freedom; Software approach; Various substrates; Robotics",2-s2.0-84979520389

It is imperative that a systematic approach be taken to evaluate the factors that each modality contributes to the user’s ability to perform successfully and safely. This paper addresses the effects of unidirectional speech and gesture methods of communication on perceived workload, usability preferences, and expectations of robot behavior while commanding a robot teammate to perform a spatial-navigation task. Each type of communication was performed alone or simultaneously. Results reveal that although the speech-alone condition elicited the lowest level of perceived workload, the usability preference and expectations of robot behavior after interacting through each communication condition was the same. Further, workload ratings between the gesture and speech-gesture conditions were similar indicating systems that employ gesture communication could also support speech communication with little to no additional subjectively perceived cognitive burden on the user. Findings also reveal that workload alone should not be used as a sole determining factor of communication preference during system and task evaluation and design. Additionally, perceived workload did not seem to negatively impact the level of expectations regarding the robot’s behavior. Recommendations for future human–robot communication evaluation are provided. © 2017, SIP.","Human–robot interaction; Human–robot teams; Mental workload; Multimodal communication; Multimodal interface; Usability","Cognitive systems; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Speech communication; Usability engineering; Mental workload; Multi-modal interfaces; Multimodal communications; Robot interactions; Robot teams; Usability; Robots",2-s2.0-85011587192

This study focuses on the evaluation of a long-term autonomous robot that was deployed in a real-world scenario at a care facility for older adults with severe multimorbidity and dementia. Social acceptance and user experience were assessed using a mixed-method design consisting of observations (12 h), ten interviews and 70 questionnaires with members of staff. Findings show that the interacting modalities have to meet the very needs of specific end-user groups and that the perceived utility of a robot is very much tied to its tasks and proper functioning. Social acceptance was ambivalent. On one hand the robot was integrated into daily routines, but on the other hand staff was not willing to share their work space with a robotic aid and saw the introduction of robots in eldercare as an inevitable development.

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open-source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio)–a common model species in ecotoxicology—to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water. © 2017 Steffens et al.

Acceleration is computed or estimated continuously at each step to guide the interceptor. However, computation of acceleration is time consuming and often leads to inaccuracy, especially when the target is high maneuvering. Keeping this in view, a proportional navigation based guidance law for the interception of a high maneuvering target is presented that does not require estimation of the target’s acceleration to generate guidance command. The method is based on anticipating target’s trajectory using simple linear extrapolation and rotational correction. The interceptor predicts next position of the target and continuously adjusts its acceleration command to move towards the future position of the target. This simple modification not only helps in improving the time to intercept but also reduces number of target misses. Further, it is easier to implement for real time applications due to computational convenience. Performance of the method is compared with some of the most efficient navigation guidance laws with respect to the time taken in interception, distance traversed and the path followed by the interceptor. In addition, proof of convergence is provided. Simulation results are further verified through hardware implementation on wheeled mobile robots and results are quite encouraging. © 2017, Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems and The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Proportional navigation; robot motion planning; target tracking; wheeled mobile robot","Acceleration; Clutter (information theory); Electronic guidance systems; Hardware; Mobile robots; Motion planning; Navigation; Robot programming; Robots; Tracking (position); Hardware implementations; Navigation guidance laws; Proportional navigation; Proportional navigation guidance; Proportional navigation guidance laws; Real-time application; Robot motion planning; Wheeled mobile robot; Target tracking",2-s2.0-85016505342

This survey provides a systematic review of existing techniques for the basic perceptual tasks of grasp point localization, state estimation and classification of cloth items, from the perspective of their manipulation by robots. This choice is grounded on the fact that any manipulative action requires to instruct the robot where to grasp, and most garment handling activities depend on the correct recognition of the type to which the particular cloth item belongs and its state. The high inter- and intraclass variability of garments, the continuous nature of the possible deformations of cloth and the evident difficulties in predicting their localization and extension on the garment piece are challenges that have encouraged the researchers to provide a plethora of methods to confront such problems, with some promising results.

The dynamic modeling approaches are presented first for the geometric nonlinearities of coupled overall motions and large deformations of a soft component, the physical nonlinearities of a soft component made of hyperelastic or elastoplastic materials, and the frictional contacts/impacts of soft components, respectively. Then the computation approach is outlined for the dynamic simulation of soft machines governed by a set of differential-algebraic equations of very high dimensions, with an emphasis on the efficient computations of the nonlinear elastic force vector of finite elements. The validations of the proposed approaches are given via three case studies, including the locomotion of a soft quadrupedal robot, the spinning deployment of a solar sail of a spacecraft, and the deployment of a mesh reflector of a satellite antenna, as well as the corresponding experimental studies.

Recent improvements in laparoscopic experience, minimally invasive surgical techniques and instruments make now the minimally invasive approach a real “triumph.” There is no doubt that minimally invasive surgery has replaced with great success conventional surgery in many fields, including surgical oncology. Methods and Results: However, its progress in pancreatic resection for adenocarcinoma has been dramatically slow. Recent evidence supports the notion that minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy is safe and feasible and that is becoming the procedure of choice mainly for benign or low-grade malignant lesions in the distal pancreas. On the other side, minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy has not yet been widely accepted and there is enormous skepticism when applied for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the potential applications of minimally invasive surgical approaches for this aggressive, heterogeneous, and enigmatic type of cancer.

Our objective was to compare early postoperative outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic colectomy in a nationally representative sample. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Colectomy Targeted Dataset from 2012 to 2014 was used for this study. Adult patients undergoing elective colectomy with an anastomosis were included. Patients were stratified based on location of colorectal resection (low anterior resection (LAR), left-sided resection, or right-sided resection). Bivariate data analysis was performed, and logistic regression modeling was conducted to calculate risk-adjusted 30-day outcomes. Results: There were a total of 25,998 laparoscopic colectomies (30 % LAR’s, 45 % left-sided, and 25 % right-sided) and 1484 robotic colectomies (54 % LAR’s, 28 % left-sided, and 18 % right-sided). The risk-adjusted overall morbidity, serious morbidity, and mortality were similar between laparoscopic and robotic approaches in all anastomotic groups. Patients undergoing robotic LAR had a lower conversion rate (OR 0.47, 95 % CI 1.20–1.76) and postoperative sepsis rate (OR 0.49, 95 % CI 0.29–0.85) but a higher rate of diverting ostomies (OR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.20–1.76). Robotic right-sided colectomies had significantly lower conversion rates (OR 0.58, 95 % CI 0.34–0.96). Robotic colectomy in all groups was associated with a longer operative time (by 40 min) and a decreased length of stay (by 0.5 days). Conclusions: In a nationally representative sample comparing laparoscopic and robotic colectomies, the overall morbidity, serious morbidity, and mortality between groups are similar while length of stay was shorter by 0.5 days in the robotic colectomy group. Robotic LAR was associated with lower conversion rates and lower septic complications. However, robotic LAR is also associated with a significantly higher rate of diverting ostomy. The reason for this relationship is unclear. Surgeon factors, patient factors, and technical factors should be considered in future studies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ACS-NSQIP; Colorectal surgery; Laparoscopic surgery; Robotic surgery","adult; aged; anastomosis; Article; colon resection; colorectal surgery; elective surgery; female; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; major clinical study; male; morbidity; operation duration; ostomy; outcome assessment; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; quality control; rectum anterior resection; retrospective study; robot assisted surgery; sepsis; surgical approach; surgical mortality",2-s2.0-84988589117

Knowledge about and awareness of patient safety risk factors are crucial in order to improve and enhance the surgical team, the environment, and finally surgical performance. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify patient safety risk factors in laparoscopic hysterectomy and to determine their influence on surgical outcomes. Methods: A prospective multicenter study was conducted from April 2014 to January 2016, participating gynecologists registered their performed laparoscopic hysterectomies (LHs). If deemed necessary, gynecologists could fill out a checklist with validated patient safety risk factors. Association between procedures with and without an occurred risk factor(s) and the surgical outcomes (blood loss, operative time, and complications) were assessed, using multivariate logistic regression and generalized estimation equations. Results: Eighty-five gynecologists participated in the study, registering a total of 2237 LHs. For 627(28 %) procedures, the checklist was entered (in total 920 items). The most reported risk factors were related to the surgeon (19.6 %), the surgical team (14.4 %), technology (16.6 %), and the patient (26.8 %). The procedures where a risk factor was registered had significantly less favorable outcomes, higher complication rate (10.5 vs. 4.8 % (p = 0.002), longer operative time [114 vs. 95 min (p < 0.001)], and more blood loss [110 vs. 168 mL (p = 0.047)], which was mainly due to the technological and patient-related risk factors. Conclusion: Technological incidents are the most important and clinically relevant risk factors affecting surgical outcomes of LH. Future improvements of MIS need to focus on this. As awareness of safety risk factors in MIS is important, embedding of a safety risk factor checklist in registration systems will help surgeons to evaluate and improve their individual performance. This will inherently improve the surgical outcomes and thus patient safety. © 2016, The Author(s).","Hysterectomy; Laparoscopy; Patient safety; Risk factor; Safety","adult; Article; bladder injury; blood vessel injury; checklist; female; gynecologist; human; hysterectomy; ileus; intestine injury; laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy; laparoscopic surgery; laparotomy; major clinical study; middle aged; minimally invasive surgery; multicenter study; multivariate logistic regression analysis; operation duration; operative blood loss; patient safety; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; robot assisted surgery; robotic assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy; supracervical laparoscopic hysterectomy; surgical risk; thromboembolism; total laparoscopic hysterectomy; ureter injury; urine incontinence; urine retention; vaginal hysterectomy; wound dehiscence",2-s2.0-84992702443

Methods: This prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in compliance with the revised CONSORT statement (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT02112370). Patients were randomized into the ropivacaine-epinephrine arm or control (normal saline) arm. Results: From January 2014 to May 2016, 148 patients participated. The primary endpoint was site-specific pain, as measured by numeric rating scale 12hours after surgery. The ropivacaine-epinephrine group exhibited significantly less swallowing difficulty (P=.008), anterior neck pain (P=.016), and right (P=.019) and left (P=.035) chest pain. Secondary endpoints were systolic (P=.402), diastolic (P=.827) blood pressure, and pulse rate (P=.397) after injection before incision and during surgery. The vital signs of the groups just after injection did not differ. During surgery, the ropivacaine-epinephrine patients had higher pulse rates (99±13.3 vs 88±16.1, P<.001) but within normal range. There were no adverse events such as postoperative nausea and vomiting. There was no significant difference in pain scores in either patient group between patients who underwent robotic or endoscopic interventions. Conclusion: BABA flap-site injection with ropivacaine and epinephrine mix before incision effectively and safely reduced postoperative pain.

Reinforcement learning acquires a control policy through exploratory interaction with the system, while nonlinear model predictive control exploits an explicitly given mathematical model of the system. In this article, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the performance of reinforcement learning and nonlinear model predictive control for an ideal system as well as for a system with parametric and structural uncertainties. The comparison is based on two different criteria, namely the similarity of trajectories and the resulting rewards. The evaluation of both methods is performed on a standard benchmark problem: a cart–pendulum swing-up and balance task. We first find suitable mathematical formulations and discuss the effect of the differences in the problem formulations. Then, we investigate the robustness of reinforcement learning and nonlinear model predictive control against uncertainties. The results demonstrate that nonlinear model predictive control has advantages over reinforcement learning if uncertainties can be eliminated through identification of the system parameters. Otherwise, there exists a break-even point after which model-free reinforcement learning performs better than nonlinear model predictive control with an inaccurate model. These findings suggest that benefits can be obtained by combining these methods for real systems being subject to such uncertainties. In the future, we plan to develop a hybrid controller and evaluate its performance on a real seven-degree-of-freedom walking robot. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Nonlinear model predictive control; Optimal control; Parametric uncertainties; Reinforcement learning; Structural uncertainties","Benchmarking; Cost functions; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Model predictive control; Nonlinear systems; Predictive control systems; Bench-mark problems; Benchmarking models; Comprehensive comparisons; Mathematical formulation; Nonlinear model predictive control; Optimal controls; Parametric uncertainties; Structural uncertainty; Reinforcement learning",2-s2.0-85018666588

Photos and aerial film recordings have become standard. In addition to amateur photographers, various companies have established themselves on the market, offering professional documentation and monitoring tasks with UAVs. Regular inspections of buildings which are difficult in access, for example bridges and high building constructions, are often focused by different suppliers. The scope of building inspections depends on the specific structure. For example, there is no need for special test requirements for conventional buildings, structural engineering along roads and paths are to be checked at regular intervals in accordance to local rules such as DIN 1076 in Germany. UAVs can be used to take pictures and measurements of damages or changes of different structures. The integration of these monitoring processes can change the inspection processes itself and the workload.

Toward this end, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals provide an overarching context for modern map development, drawing upon a vast wealth of maps and mapping experience that couples appropriate data with spatial analyses. At the same time, there is an overarching need for more compelling map design to help effectively communicate results and future predictions across a wide variety of research areas.

Recently the amoeba-like transformations of LM on the graphite surface are discovered, which present a promising future for the design and assemble of self-fueled actuators with dendritically deformable body. It appears that the surface tension of the LM can be significantly reduced when it contacts graphite surface in alkaline solution. Clearly, the specific surface should play a vital role in inducing these intriguing behaviors, which is valuable and inspiring in soft robot design. However, the information regarding varied materials functions underlying these behaviors remains unknown. To explore the generalized effects of surface materials in those intriguing behavior, several materials including glass, graphite, nickel and copper oxides (CuO) were comparatively investigated as substrate surfaces. Important results were obtained that only LM amoeba transformations were observed on graphite and CuO surfaces. In order to identify the proper surface condition for LM transformation, the intrinsic properties of substrate surfaces, such as the surface charge and roughness, as well as the specific interaction with LM like wetting behavior and mutual locomotion etc., were characterized. The integrated results revealed that LM droplet appears more likely to deform on surfaces with higher positive surface charge density, higher roughness and less bubble generation on them. In addition, another surface material, CuOx, is identified to own similar ability to graphite, which is valuable in achieving amoeba-like transformation. Moreover, this study offers a fundamental understanding of the surface properties in realizing LM amoeba transformations, which would shed light on packing and structure design of liquid metal-based soft device within multi-material system. © 2017","Liquid metal amoeba; Substrate materials; Surface effect; Surface tension","Copper oxides; Gallium; Graphite; Indium; Liquid metals; Liquids; Machine design; Metals; Protozoa; Surface tension; Wetting; Alkaline solutions; Functional liquid; Intrinsic property; Positive surface charge; Specific interaction; Substrate material; Surface conditions; Surface effect; Surface roughness",2-s2.0-85019943943

The main challenge for creating long term maps of dynamic environments is to identify changes and adapt the map continuously. Changes can occur abruptly, gradually, or even periodically. In this work, we investigate how dense mapping data of several epochs can be used to identify the temporal behavior of the environment. This approach anticipates possible future scenarios where a large fleet of vehicles is equipped with sensors which continuously capture the environment. This data is then being sent to a cloud based infrastructure, which aligns all datasets geometrically and subsequently runs scene analysis on it, among these being the analysis for temporal changes of the environment. Our experiments are based on a LiDAR mobile mapping dataset which consists of 150 scan strips (a total of about 1 billion points), which were obtained in multiple epochs. Parts of the scene are covered by up to 28 scan strips. The time difference between the first and last epoch is about one year. In order to process the data, the scan strips are aligned using an overall bundle adjustment, which estimates the surface (about one billion surface element unknowns) as well as 270,000 unknowns for the adjustment of the exterior orientation parameters. After this, the surface misalignment is usually below one centimeter. In the next step, we perform a segmentation of the point clouds using a region growing algorithm. The segmented objects and the aligned data are then used to compute an occupancy grid which is filled by tracing each individual LiDAR ray from the scan head to every point of a segment. As a result, we can assess the behavior of each segment in the scene and remove voxels from temporal objects from the global occupancy grid.","Alignment; Change detection; LiDAR; Mobile mapping; Strip adjustment","Alignment; Fleet operations; Image segmentation; Mapping; Three dimensional computer graphics; Change detection; Changing environment; Dynamic environments; Exterior orientation parameters; Lidar point clouds; Mobile mapping; Region growing algorithm; Strip adjustment; Optical radar",2-s2.0-85021163022

The basic idea for implementing visual tracking is composed of finding the target object in a video or sequence of images, then determining its exact position in the next successive frames and finally generating the corresponding trajectory of this object. Visual tracking, however, is still a challenging problem in practice while taking into account the abrupt appearance changes of the target objects induced by their non-rigid transformation, the sophisticated lighting variation, the obstruction by the block or similar objects in the background and the camera jitter. Motivated by the successful applications in target detection and recognition in recent years, plenty of deep learning models have been integrated in the visual tracking and better performance over traditional methods was achieved in a series of data evaluations, which opens a new door in the field of visual tracking. In this paper, the overview and progress on visual tracking were summarized.

In addition, the development of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has also demonstrated the capability of modulating brain excitability thus increasing motor performance.

These are: (a) there must be a self to self-determine (b) there must be a non-zero probability of more than one option being enacted; (c) there must be an internal means of choosing among options (which is not merely random, since randomness is not a choice). For (a) to be fulfilled, the agent of self-determination must be organisationally closed (a ""Kantian whole""). For (c) to be fulfilled: (d) options must be generated from an internal model of the self which can calculate future states contingent on possible responses; (e) choosing among these options requires their evaluation using an internally generated goal defined on an objective function representing the overall ""master function"" of the agent and (f) for ""deep free-will"", at least two nested levels of choice and goal (d-e) must be enacted by the agent.

In this review, we enumerated the existing apple picking robots. Some information, such as type of visual sensors, hardware of vision system, success rate of harvesting and run time, was illustrated in details. Meanwhile, on the basis of discussing the vision system of apple picking robot, we focused on summarizing hardware structure of existing vision systems and apple image segmentation methods as well as apple recognition and localization methods applied in vision systems. The vision system of apple picking robot mainly includes machine vision system, laser vision system, three-dimensional vision system and vision system formed by machine vision and other vision system. And the machine vision system can be classified into 3 types according to the number of image sensors used, that is, monocular vision system, binocular vision system and multi vision system. The recognition and localization of apple target is the first step of the implementation of the picking task for picking robot. The currently used apple segmentation and recognition methods include threshold segmentation algorithm, chromatic aberration based algorithm, K-mean clustering algorithm, region growing algorithm, segmentation method combining 2 or more algorithms, and so on. There are 4 methods that are commonly used in the localization of apple target. They are the methods based on centroid, fitting circle, symmetry axes, and three-dimensional coordinates, respectively. In natural scene, the recognition and localization of apple target may be affected by many factors. Hence, recognition and localization of apple target under different conditions, such as color nonuniformity, different illumination, shadow on the surface, oscillation, overlapping and occlusion, was reviewed and analyzed. Among all these conditions, occlusion can be regarded as the most serious factor. The condition of occlusion can be roughly divided into 4 kinds, i.e. apple target blocked by other apple, by branches, by leaves and by branches, leaves and other apple simultaneously. As for apple targets blocked by branches, one apple may be separated by branches, thus causing that an apple may be recognized as several apples. For the apple targets blocked by leaves, the symmetry of apple can be utilized to localize apple targets. The apple targets blocked by other apple can be considered as overlapping. There are overlapped apples with series connection, parallel connection, and blend connection. Because of the complexity of overlapping, the recognition and localization of apple targets blocked by other apple target is a little more difficult. In addition, the detection of obstacles like tree trunk and branches in apple orchard is important for apple picking robots to avoid obstacles, and thus obstacles detection methods were summarized in this review. In the process of target recognition and localization, binocular vision technology was commonly used in vision system. The key point of binocular vision technology is stereo matching. Therefore, stereo matching was then reviewed, and the image matching methods in existence can generally be divided into 2 categories, i.e. region-based image matching method and feature-based image matching method. What's more, the problems exist in recognition and localization methods used in the vision system of apple picking robot, including accuracy, effectiveness, character of real-time and universal applicability, were analyzed. Further study will concentrate on optimizing the structure of vision system, optimizing the intelligent algorithms used in the vision system, improving the real-time capability, recognizing and locating apple targets when the apple targets and vision systems are influenced by oscillation, and improving cost performance. The paper has summarized and analyzed vision system of apple picking robot comprehensively, which can provide reference for future research. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

While load cells are accurate and suitable for the stationary end-point robots used in rehabilitation hospitals, their cost and inability to conform to the shape of the body hinder their application in developing affordable and wearable robotic orthoses for assisting individuals in the activities of daily living. This exploratory work investigates the possibility of using an alternative technology, namely compliant polymeric air cushions, to measure interaction forces between the user and a wearable rigid structure. Methods: A polymeric air cushion was designed, analyzed using a finite element model (FEM), and tested using a bench-top characterization system. The cushions underwent repeatability testing, and signal delay testing from a step response while increasing the length of the cushion's tubes. Subsequently, a 3D printed wrist brace prototype was integrated with six polymeric air cushions and tested in static conditions where a volunteer exerted isometric pronation/supination torque and forces in vertical and horizontal directions. The load measured by integrating data recorded by the six sensors was compared with force data measured by a high quality load cell and torque sensor. Results: The FEM and experimental data comparison was within the error bounds of the external differential pressure sensor used to monitor the pressure inside the cushion. The ratio obtained experimentally between the pressure inside the pressure cushion and the 8 N applied load deviated by only 1.28% from the FEM. A drift smaller than 1% was observed over 10 cycles. The rise times of the cushion under an 8 N step response for a 0.46, 1.03, and 2.02 m length tube was 0.45, 0.39, and 0.37 s. Tests with the wrist brace showed a moderate root mean square error (RMSE) between the force estimated by the pressure cushions and the external load cells. Specifically, the RMSE was 13 mNm, 500 mN, and 1.24 N for forearm pronation/supination torque, vertical force, and horizontal force, respectively. Conclusions: The use of compliant pressure cushions was shown to be promising for monitoring interaction forces between the forearm and a rigid brace. This work lays the foundation for the future design of an array of pressure cushions for robotic orthoses. Future research should also investigate the compatibility of these polymeric cushions for data acquisition during functional magnetic resonance imaging in shielded rooms. © 2017 The Author(s).","Air; Exoskeleton; Force; Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS); Polymer; Rehabilitation; Sensors; Wearable","3D printers; Air; Air cushioning; Data acquisition; Error analysis; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Finite element method; Human robot interaction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mean square error; Orthotics; Patient rehabilitation; Polydimethylsiloxane; Polymers; Rigid structures; Robotics; Robots; Sensors; Silicones; Step response; Wearable sensors; Wearable technology; Weighing; Activities of Daily Living; Alternative technologies; Differential pressure sensor; Force; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Polydimethylsiloxane PDMS; Rehabilitation hospitals; Wearable; Loads (forces); dimeticone; polymer; Article; brace; finite element analysis; forearm; isometrics; mathematical analysis; orthosis; pressure measurement; priority journal; pronation; reproducibility; robotics; sensor; signal processing; supination; torque; weight bearing",2-s2.0-85019164801

Furthermore, a hierarchical motion controller is proposed by dividing the controller into multiple sub-controllers using a mixture-of-experts framework to further alleviate the computational cost. We also derive an efficient method to approximate the upper bound of the learning curve of Gaussian process regression, which can be used to determine the required number of training samples for the desired performance.

It allows robots to grow their leg size to simulate ontogenetic morphological changes, and this is the first time that such an experiment has been performed in the physical world. To test diverse robot morphologies, robot legs of variable shapes were generated during the evolutionary process and autonomously built using additive fabrication. We present two cases with evo-devo experiments and one with evolution, and we hypothesize that the addition of a developmental stage can be used within robotics to improve performance.

Manipulation in an unknown environment, however, has been proven to be NP-Hard and the risk of unexpected human - robot collision hampers the dawning of the era of human - robot coexistence. We propose a non-contact-based sensitive skin as a means to provide safe manipulation hardware and interleaving planning between the workspace and the configuration space as software to solve manipulation problems in unknown, crowded environments. Novelty of the paper resides in demonstration of real time and yet complete path planning in an uncertain and crowded environment. To that end, we introduce the framework of the sensor-based interleaving planner (SBIP) whereby search completeness and safe manipulation are both guaranteed in cluttered environments. We study an interleaving mechanism between sensation in a workspace and execution in the corresponding configuration space for real-time planning in uncertain environments, thus the name interleaving planner implies. Applications of the proposed system include manipulators of a humanoid robot, surgical manipulators, and robotic manipulators working in hazardous and uncertain environments such as underwater, unexplored planets, and unstructured indoor spaces. © Cambridge University Press 2016.","collision avoidance; point cloud; Sensor-based planning; unknown environment motion planning","Anthropomorphic robots; Collision avoidance; Hardware; Motion planning; Reconfigurable hardware; Robotics; Robots; Wave functions; Cluttered environments; Configuration space; Point cloud; Robotic manipulators; Sensor-based planning; Surgical manipulators; Uncertain environments; Unknown environments; Manipulators",2-s2.0-84957805018

Background: The role of minimally invasive proctectomy in rectal cancer is controversial. In the era of value-based medicine, costs must be considered along with outcomes. Methods: Primary rectal cancer patients undergoing curative intent proctectomy at our institution between 2010 and 2014 were included. Patients were grouped by approach [open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and robotic surgery (RS)] on an intent-to-treat basis. Groups were compared by direct costs of hospitalization for the primary resection, 30-day readmissions, and ileostomy closure and for short-term outcomes. Results: A total of 488 patients were evaluated; 327 were men (67%), median age was 59 (27-93) years, and restorative procedures were performed in 333 (68.2%). Groups were similar in demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment details. Significant outcome differences between groups were found in operative and anesthesia times (longer in the RS group), and in estimated blood loss, intraoperative transfusion, length of stay, and postoperative complications (all higher in the open surgery group). No significant differences were found in short-term oncologic outcomes. Direct cost of the hospitalization for primary resection and total direct cost (including readmission/ileostomy closure hospitalizations) were significantly greater in the RS group. Conclusions: The laparoscopic and open approaches to proctectomy in patients with rectal cancer provide similar value.

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios. © 2017 The Authors","Agriculture; Business modelling; Data; Data infrastructure; Governance; Information and communication technology","agricultural land; agricultural modeling; artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; data acquisition; data set; decision making; food production; food supply; governance approach; literature review; power relations; stakeholder; supply chain management",2-s2.0-85011824717

The state of the art solutions in robotics are full state feedback controllers. For human hip-ankle coordination, a more parsimonious and theoretically stable alternative to the robotics solution has been suggested in terms of the Eigenmovement (EM) control. Eigenmovements are kinematic synergies designed to describe the multi DoF system, and its control, with a set of independent, and hence coupling-free, scalar equations. This paper investigates whether the EM alternative shows ""real-world robustness"" against noisy and inaccurate sensors, mechanical non-linearities such as dead zones, and human-like feedback time delays when controlling hip-ankle movements of a balancing humanoid robot. The EM concept and the EM controller are introduced, the robot's dynamics are identified using a biomechanical approach, and robot tests are performed in a human posture control laboratory. The tests show that the EM controller provides stable control of the robot with proactive (""voluntary"") movements and reactive balancing of stance during support surface tilts and translations. Although a preliminary robot-human comparison reveals similarities and differences, we conclude (i) the Eigenmovement concept is a valid candidate when different concepts of human sensorimotor control are considered, and (ii) that human-inspired robot experiments may help to decide in future the choice among the candidates and to improve the design of humanoid robots and robotic rehabilitation devices. © 2017 Alexandrov, Lippi, Mergner, Frolov, Hettich and Husek.","Biorobotics; Eigenmovements; Human sensorimotor system; Motor control; Neuromechanics","Anthropomorphic robots; Controllers; Machine design; Robotics; Robots; State feedback; Time delay; Bio-robotics; Eigenmovements; Human sensorimotor; Motor control; Neuromechanics; Feedback; ankle; Article; biomechanics; body equilibrium; body position; eigenmovement; feedback system; knee function; motor control; motor coordination; robotics; sensorimotor function; standing; voluntary movement",2-s2.0-85018398281

Utilizing adjustable stiffness joints in these robots allows us to control their stable configurations and their mode of interaction with the environment. In this paper, we present the design of tendon-driven robotic origami (robogami) joints with adjustable stiffness. The proposed designs allow us to place joints along any direction in the plane of the robot and in the normal direction to the plane. The layer-by-layer manufacturing of robogamis facilitates the design and manufacturing of robots with different arrangement of joints for different applications. We use thermally activated shape memory polymer to control the joint stiffness. The manufacturing of the polymer layer is compatible with the layer-by-layer manufacturing process of the robogamis which results in scalable and customizable robots. To demonstrate, we prototyped an under-actuated gripper with three fingers and only one input actuation. The grasp mode of the gripper is set by adjusting the configuration of the locked joints and modulating the stiffness of the active joints.

These materials are playing an increasingly important role in a wide variety of applications, especially in the biological and biomedical fields. However, the design and engineering of intriguing bioresponsive materials with adequate biocompatibility and biodegradability have proven to be a great challenge. DNA, on the other hand, possesses many unique and fascinating properties, including its indispensable genetic function, broad biocompatibility, precise molecular recognition capability, tunable multifunctionality, and convenient programmability. Therefore, DNA has provided crucial prerequisites for the exploration of novel bioresponsive hydrogels and has since become an ideal building block for the construction of novel materials. In this Account, we describe our efforts over more than a decade to develop DNA-based materials including bioresponsive hydrogels. These DNA hydrogels were created through either chemical cross-linking or physical entanglement among DNA chains. We further divided them into two categories: pure DNA-based and hybrid DNA-based hydrogels. For the pure DNA-based hydrogels, we developed the first bulk DNA hydrogel entirely from branched DNA by using enzymatic ligation. Certain drugs were encapsulated in such hydrogels in situ and released in a controllable manner under the stimulation of environmental factors such as nucleases and/or changes in ionic strength. Furthermore, we prepared a protein-producing hydrogel (termed a “P-gel”) by ligating X-shaped DNA (X-DNA) and linear plasmids. Following the central dogma of molecular biology, this hydrogel responded to enzymes and substrate and converted them into proteins. This was the first example showing that a hydrogel could be employed to produce proteins without the involvement of live cells. This might also be the first attempt to create cell-like hydrogels that will be ultimately bioresponsive. In addition, we also constructed a DNA physical hydrogel via entanglement of DNA chains elongated by a special polymerase: Phi29. This hydrogel (termed a “meta-hydrogel”) exhibited a ""meta"" property: freely reversible change between liquidlike and solidlike states through stimulation by water molecules. Besides these pure DNA-based hydrogels, we also created a hybrid DNA-based hydrogel: a DNA-clay hybrid hydrogel utilizing electrostatic interactions between DNA and clay nanocrystals. We discovered a synergistic responsiveness in biochemical reaction in this hydrogel, suggesting that a DNA-clay hydrogel might be the environment for the origination of life and that DNA and clay might have been coevolving during early evolution. In summary, DNA links the nonbiological world with biological processes by virtue of its bioresponsiveness. We envision that bioresponsive DNA hydrogels will play an irreplaceable part in the development of future evolvable materials such as soft robots and artificial cells. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,2-s2.0-85018490144

In recent times, computer-assisted surgical tools have emerged and are growing in their use. The Puma 560 emerged in 1985 for brain biopsies and laparoscopic surgery. Prostatic surgery was performed by the Probot in 1988. In 1992, fittings in the femur were placed using the ROBODOC. These early robotic endeavors gave rise to AESOP, ZEUS and the relatively intuitive da Vinci® Surgical System. These advances reflect the rapid growth of knowledge in the technology sector. These ever increasingly complex robotic-driven procedures are favored because this surgery provides a less invasive and therefore more tolerable “surgical” procedure for patients. In turn, these less invasive experiences may also allow for faster recovery times, reducing hospital stays and potentially costs. Importantly, this technology is accompanied by the development of more targeted surgical interventions. On the negative side, these technologies are initially expensive. However, as is always the case, there is hope that future devices will be more economical as more institutions invest. Another trend which may reduce costs is in the design of the robotic devices to incorporate a common central core of technology, to which other sub-devices can be attached, offering additional cost savings while enhancing flexibility. Telemedicine, using this robotic technology as its core, may also reduce the costs associated with today’s robotic expenses, providing expertise outside the performing operating room and reducing personnel presence in the operating theater. Telemedicine, by its very nature, must be done in real time, with zero latency in the procedure. Latency is an important issue at present, as is the chance for human error, which always exists. Human skill is an essential component of these systems, since a running program may not be able to adjust to a dynamically changing procedure. It is easy to predict that this trend toward robotic-assisted surgery will only increase, in both its ease of learning and sophistication, a phenomenon that must be monitored for patient safety and outcome. Bioinformatic pattern-recognition algorithms from past saved procedures, will be incorporated into new programming in a rapid manner, further enhancing automated surgical procedures. Importantly, deciding when to allow the technology to “move” on its own sensors will be essential to its future usefulness in medicine. We may be developing the “driver-less” car. © Med Sci Monit.","Distant surgery; Economic surgery; Future surgery; Medical robotics; Medicine; Surgery; Telemedicine","bioinformatics; Editorial; hospitalization; human; patient safety; robot assisted surgery; telemedicine",2-s2.0-85018510989

To be capable of efficient, long-term learning, RL agents should be able to apply knowledge gained in the past to new tasks they may encounter in the future. The ability to predict actions' consequences may facilitate such knowledge transfer. We consider here domains where an RL agent has access to two kinds of information: agent-centric information with constant semantics across tasks, and environment-centric information, which is necessary to solve the task, but with semantics that differ between tasks. For example, in robot navigation, environment-centric information may include the robot's geographic location, while agent-centric information may include sensor readings of various nearby obstacles. We propose that these situations provide an opportunity for a very natural style of knowledge transfer, in which the agent learns to predict actions' environmental consequences using agent-centric information. These predictions contain important information about the affordances and dangers present in a novel environment, and can effectively transfer knowledge from agent-centric to environment-centric learning systems. Using several example problems including spatial navigation and network routing, we show that our knowledge transfer approach can allow faster and lower cost learning than existing alternatives.",,"Air navigation; Forecasting; Information management; Knowledge management; Robots; Semantics; Environmental consequences; Geographic location; Knowledge transfer; Long-term learning; Robot navigation; Sensor readings; Spatial navigation; Trial and error learning; Reinforcement learning",2-s2.0-85018651558

The overall objective of anaesthesia is to minimize perioperative risk and discomfort for patients both during and after surgery. Anaesthesia for patients undergoing robotic assisted surgery is different from anaesthesia for patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery; new anaesthetic concerns accompany robotic assisted surgery. Objectives: To assess outcomes related to the choice of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) or inhalational anaesthesia for adults undergoing transabdominal robotic assisted laparoscopic gynaecological, urological or gastroenterological surgery. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016 Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase via OvidSP (1982 to May 2016), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost (1982 to May 2016) and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1956 to May 2016). We also searched the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry and Clinical trials gov for ongoing trials (May 2016). Selection criteria: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults, aged 18 years and older, of both genders, treated with transabdominal robotic assisted laparoscopic gynaecological, urological or gastroenterological surgery and focusing on outcomes of TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures of Cochrane. Study findings were not suitable for meta-analysis. Main results: We included three single-centre, two-arm RCTs involving 170 participants. We found one ongoing trial. All included participants were male and were undergoing radical robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP). The men were between 50 and 75 years of age and met criteria for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification scores (ASA) I, ll and III. We found evidence showing no clinically meaningful differences in postoperative pain between the two types of anaesthetics (mean difference (MD) in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at one to six hours was -2.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.62 to 6.22; P = 0.61) in a sample of 62 participants from one study. Low-quality evidence suggests that propofol reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) over the short term (one to six hours after surgery) after RALRP compared with inhalational anaesthesia (sevoflurane, desflurane) (MD -1.70, 95% CI -2.59 to -0.81; P = 0.0002). We found low-quality evidence suggesting that propofol may prevent an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) after pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg positioning compared with sevoflurane (MD -3.90, 95% CI -6.34 to -1.46; P = 0.002) with increased IOP from baseline to 30 minutes in steep Trendelenburg. However, it is unclear whether this surrogate outcome translates directly to clinical avoidance of ocular complications during surgery. No studies addressed the secondary outcomes of adverse effects, all-cause mortality, respiratory or circulatory complications, cognitive dysfunction, length of stay or costs. Overall the quality of evidence was low to very low, as all studies were small, single-centre trials providing unclear descriptions of methods. Authors' conclusions: It is unclear which anaesthetic technique is superior - TIVA or inhalational - for transabdominal robotic assisted surgery in urology, gynaecology and gastroenterology, as existing evidence is scarce, is of low quality and has been generated from exclusively male patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy. An ongoing trial, which includes participants of both genders with a focus on quality of recovery, might have an impact on future evidence related to this topic. © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This commentary proposes that this assumes, all too easily, that we know the boundary conditions of future robotics development, and argues that progress towards a more useful set of principles could begin by thinking carefully about the ontological status of robots. Whilst most robots are currently little more than tools, we are entering an era where there will be new kinds of entities that combine some of the properties of tools with psychological capacities that we had previously thought were reserved for complex biological organisms such as humans. The ontological status of robots might be best described as liminal–neither living nor simply mechanical. There is also evidence that people will treat robots as more than just tools regardless of the extent to which their machine nature is transparent. Ethical principles need to be developed that recognise these ontological and psychological issues around the nature of robots and how they are perceived. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","machine intelligence; ontological status of robots; perceptions of robots; principles of robotics; Robot ethics","Ontology; Philosophical aspects; Robotics; Robots; Biological organisms; Ethical principles; Machine intelligence; Ontological status; Real intelligence; Robot ethics; Intelligent robots",2-s2.0-85018653811

Despite the medical benefits, patients undergoing this procedure often complain about the associated pain and discomfort. This discomfort is mostly due to the rough handling of the tube and the creation of loops during the insertion. The overall goal of this work is to minimise the invasiveness of traditional colonoscopy. In pursuit of this goal, this work presents the development of a semi-autonomous colonoscopic robot with minimally invasive locomotion. The proposed robotic approach allows physicians to concentrate mainly on the diagnosis rather than the mechanics of the procedure. In this paper, an innovative locomotion approach for robotic colonoscopy is addressed. Our locomotion approach takes advantage of longitudinal expansion of a latex tube to propel the robot’s tip along the colon. This soft and compliant propulsion mechanism, in contrast to minimally invasive mechanisms used in, for example, inchworm-like robots, has shown promising potential. In the preliminary ex vivo experiments, the robot successfully advanced 1.5 metres inside an excised curvilinear porcine colon with average speed of 28 mm/s, and was capable of traversing bends up to 150 degrees. The robot creates less than 6 N of normal force at its tip when it is pressurised with 90 kPa. This maximum force generates pressure of 44.17 mmHg at the tip, which is significantly lower than safe intraluminal human colonic pressure of 80 mmHg. The robot design inherently prevents loop formation in the colon, which is recognised as the main cause of post procedural pain in patients. Overall, the robot has shown great promise in an ex vivo experimental setup. The design of an autonomous control system and in vivo experiments are left as future work. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Fluid power; minimally invasive therapy; robotic colonoscopy; semi-autonomous navigation","Compliant mechanisms; Diagnosis; Endoscopy; Machine design; Robotics; Autonomous control systems; Autonomous navigation; Diagnostic procedure; Fluid power; Longitudinal expansions; Minimally invasive therapy; Propulsion mechanisms; Robotic colonoscopy; Robots; latex; animal tissue; Article; balloon; balloon rupture; body temperature; colon perforation; colonoscope; colonoscopy; compressed air; controlled study; device safety; emergency surgery; equipment design; evaluation study; flow rate; force; friction; human; intestine pressure; nonhuman; pressure regulator; pressure transducer; priority journal; robotics; rupture; thermal injury; colonoscopy; equipment design; locomotion; physiology; procedures; robotics; Colonoscopy; Equipment Design; Humans; Locomotion; Robotics",2-s2.0-85010680205

Six areas of engagement are offered that outline the richness and nuance of social and cultural geographical analysis related to the ‘rise of the robots’ at a time where much of the popular discourse around robotics is characterized by the extremities of either dystopian angst or positive boosterism.

These comments highlight the fact that, while the principles may address to a good extent the present technological challenges, they appear to be less immediately suited for future technological and conceptual dares. The first part of the paper is dedicated to the search of the definition of what a robot is. Such a definition should offer the basic conceptual platform on which a normative endeavour, aiming to regulate robots in society, should be based. Concluding that the Principles offer no clear yet flexible insight into such a (meta-) definition, which would allow one to take into account the parameters of informed technological imagination and of envisaged social transformation, the second half of the paper highlights a number of regulatory points of tension. Such tensions, it is argued, stem largely from the absence of an appropriate conceptual platform, influencing negatively the extent to which the principles can be effective in guiding social, ethical, legal and scientific conduct. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial intelligence; human rights and technology; human–robot interaction; Principles of Robotics; technology and regulation","Artificial intelligence; Intelligent robots; Laws and legislation; Robotics; Robots; Human rights; Robot interactions; Social transformation; Technological challenges; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85018625669

AI is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology—up to and including today's “omics”. AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application. © 2017","Artificial intelligence; Avatars; Future of medicine; Robots","Article; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; classification algorithm; clinical effectiveness; computer prediction; electronic medical record; human; human computer interaction; learning algorithm; medical device; medicine; priority journal; reinforcement; robotics; treatment outcome; artificial intelligence; decision support system; drug delivery system; electronic health record; ethics; history; interdisciplinary communication; nomenclature; personalized medicine; trends; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; Drug Delivery Systems; Electronic Health Records; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Precision Medicine; Robotics; Terminology as Topic",2-s2.0-85009988949

A potential way to meet this need is through interacting with pet-type robots such as the seal robot, PARO. There was a need to extend research on PARO's potential benefits beyond cognitively impaired and dependently living older adults. Because independently living, cognitively intact older adults may also have socio-emotional needs, the primary goal of this study was to investigate their attitudes, emotions, and engagement with PARO to identify its potential applicability to this demographic. Thirty older adults participated in an interaction period with PARO, and their attitudes and emotions toward PARO were assessed before and after using a multi-method approach. Video of the interaction was coded to determine the types and frequency of engagements participants initiated with PARO. Overall, there were no pre-post interaction differences on these measures. However, semi-structured interviews suggested that these older adults had positive attitudes towards PARO's attributes, thought it would be easy to use, and perceived potential uses for both themselves and others. Participants varied in their frequency of engagement with PARO. A novel finding is that this active engagement frequency uniquely predicted post-interaction period positive affect.

The system maps the decision making capability of a human (navigation) expert to solve the path planning problem for a ship in a complex navigation environment. It can be further developed to provide automatic control of a ship. It utilizes a new, fast and effective, deterministic method, called the Trajectory Base Algorithm, to calculate a safe, optimal path for a ship. The system structure, a detailed explanation of a new method, followed by results of simulation tests are all presented in the paper. The results proof a successful application of the method to solve a path planning problem for ships with the consideration of both static and dynamic obstacles in the environment, marine traffic regulations and dynamic properties of a ship, what makes this approach applicable in commercial systems. The approach can also be adapted for application in mobile robots path planning.

An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions. © 2017 ACM.","Deep learning; Feature representations; Imitation learning; Intelligent agents; Learning from demonstrations; Learning from experience; Reinforcement learning; Robotics; Self-improvement","Anthropomorphic robots; Behavioral research; Computer games; Crashworthiness; Deep learning; Demonstrations; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Intelligent agents; Reinforcement learning; Robotics; Surveys; Feature representation; Imitation learning; Learning from demonstration; Learning from experiences; Self-improvement; Learning systems",2-s2.0-85017424752

Air-to-air refueling (AAR) is an example of the type of system that can benefit from this development approach. The work in this paper concerns the on-ground validation and preflight verification of probe-drogue contact-impact scenarios in AAR maneuvers using off-the-shelf multiaxis industrial robots as part of a hybrid test to interface the refueling hardware with numerical models of the flight environment. While industrial manipulators present a cost-effective solution, bandwidth and power limitations inevitably cause practical problems for real-time hybrid testing. These deficiencies typically manifest themselves as significant tracking inaccuracies or instabilities when sharp nonlinearities or discontinuities are encountered as part of a contact phase. Here, the novel robotic pseudodynamic testing (RPsDT) method is employed to circumvent the contact-response speed limitations of industrial robots. This paper presents and discusses the application of RPsDT to contact-impact problems, outlines the challenges and limitations of the technique in an easily reproducible validation experiment, and details the first RPsDT hybrid simulation of an AAR maneuver using scaled refueling hardware. It is concluded that RPsDT provides a useful tool for the investigation of a particular subclass of multibody contact-impact problems including AAR, where the response of the contacting structures does not possess significant rate-of-loading effects. Future work will comprise tests with full-scale AAR hardware. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Air-to-air refueling; contact dynamics; hybrid testing; robotic pseudodynamic testing (RPsDT)","Aircraft fuels; Cost effectiveness; Hardware; Industrial manipulators; Industrial robots; Numerical models; Robotics; Air-to-air refueling; Contact dynamics; Cost-effective solutions; Development approach; Flight environment; Hybrid testing; Pseudo-dynamic testing; Tracking inaccuracy; Air refueling",2-s2.0-85018464247

Here, a novel needle steering strategy is proposed that enhances accuracy of needle steering. In our approach the surgeon is in charge of needle insertion to ensure the safety of operation, while the needle tip bevel location is robotically controlled to minimize the targeting error. The system has two main components: (1) a real-time predictor for estimating future needle deflection as it is steered inside soft tissue, and (2) an online motion planner that calculates control decisions and steers the needle toward the target by iterative optimization of the needle deflection predictions. The predictor uses the ultrasound-based curvature information to estimate the needle deflection. Given the specification of anatomical obstacles and a target from preoperative images, the motion planner uses the deflection predictions to estimate control actions, i.e., the depth(s) at which the needle should be rotated to reach the target. Ex-vivo needle insertions are performed with and without obstacle to validate our approach.

Methods Based on Medline, the Cochrane library, Embase, and the Journal of Robotic Surgery prior to December 30st, 2015, we searched for controlled trials and observational studies. A systematic review with meta-analyses was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy between the da Vinci robotic surgery, open surgery, and laparoscopic surgery for cervical cancer. Data were pooled using the random effects meta-analysis. Results Compared with the open surgery, the robotic surgery for cervical cancer would be advantageous in terms of the length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, volume of blood loss and blood transfusion. The operative time of robotic surgery was longer than that of the open surgery, but the prediction intervals indicated that they could be shorter in future studies. Meanwhile, compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, the robotic surgery could offer more benefits in terms of the length of hospital stay, while no difference was found in terms of the incidence of complications and the volume of blood loss.

More systems of the kind and even fully autonomous vehicles in regular traffic are expected by OEMs in Europe around year 2025. Driving is highly multitasking activity and human errors emerge in situations, when he is unable to process and understand the essential amount of information. Future autonomous systems very often rely on some type of inter-vehicular communication. This shall provide the vehicle with higher amount of information, than driver uses in his decision making process. Therefore, currently used 1-D quantity TTC (time-to-collision) will become inadequate. Regardless the vehicle is driven by human or robot, it's always necessary to know, whether and which reaction is necessary to perform. Adaptable autonomous vehicle systems will need to analyze the driver's situation awareness level. Such knowledge can be enhanced by 2-D quantity, so called reaction space, and its entropy. The new approach defines a limit space, where ego vehicle or other vehicles can be present in the future specified by an amount of time. This enables the option of counting not only with braking time, but mitigation by changing direction is feasible. Opposed to TTC, considering time as an input is appreciated especially when switching from autonomous to manual driving. For such situation we observe two kinds of reaction spaces - one, connected with the requirements of autopilot, and second, resulting from the expected human reaction.

In addition, robotic hysterectomy is invariably associated with increased costs. Nevertheless, this surgical approach has been widely adopted by gynecologic surgeons. The aim of this review is to describe specific indications and patients who may benefit from robotic-assisted hysterectomy. These include hysterectomy for benign conditions in cases with high surgical complexity (such as pelvic adhesive disease and endometriosis), hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy for treatment of endometrial carcinoma, and obese patients. In the future, additional evidence regarding the benefits of single-site robotic hysterectomy may further modify the indications for robotic-assisted hysterectomy. © 2017 Smorgick.","Minimally invasive hysterectomy; Robotic-assisted hysterectomy; Single-site laparoscopy","endometriosis; endometrium carcinoma; female; human; hysterectomy; laparoscopic surgery; laparotomy; learning curve; lymph node dissection; minimally invasive surgery; obesity; outcome assessment; patient selection; Review; robot assisted surgery; surgical approach; treatment indication",2-s2.0-85016166035

We demonstrate here by a set of experiments that a swarm of 10 e-puck robots is capable to choose a global optimum over a local optimum and we compare those dynamics to real honeybee behaviors.

This paper looks at how ROS metadata, Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), Semantic Robot Description Format (SRDF), and its message description language, can be used to identify key robot characteristics to inform User Interface (UI) design for the teleoperation of heterogeneous robot teams. Logical relationships between UI components and robot characteristics are defined by a set of relationship rules created using relevant and available information including developer expertise and ROS metadata. This provides a significant opportunity to move towards a rule-driven approach for generating the designs of teleoperation UIs; in particular the reduction of the number of different UI configurations required to teleoperate each individual robot within a heterogeneous robot team. This approach is based on using an underlying rule set identifying robots that can be teleoperated using the same UI configuration due to having the same or similar robot characteristics. Aside from reducing the number of different UI configurations an operator needs to be familiar with, this approach also supports consistency in UI configurations when a teleoperator is periodically switching between different robots. To achieve this aim, a Matlab toolbox is developed providing users with the ability to define rules specifying the relationship between robot characteristics and UI components. Once rules are defined, selections that best describe the characteristics of the robot type within a particular heterogeneous robot team can be made. A main advantage of this approach is that rather than specifying discrete robots comprising the team, the user can specify characteristics of the team more generally allowing the system to deal with slight variations that may occur in the future. In fact, by using the defined relationship rules and characteristic selections, the toolbox can automatically identify a reduced set of UI configurations required to control possible robot team configurations, as opposed to the traditional ad-hoc approach to teleoperation UI design. In the results section, three test cases are presented to demonstrate how the selection of different robot characteristics builds a number of robot characteristic combinations, and how the relationship rules are used to determine a reduced set of required UI configurations needed to control each individual robot in the robot team. © 2017 by the authors.

This study is a sub analysis of observational data collected from 89 procedures utilising the da Vinci systems. Previous analyses had demonstrated interactions between flow disruptions and contextual factors. This study sought a more granular analysis to provide better insight for improvement. Raters sub-classified disruptions, based upon the original notes, grouped according to four operative phases (pre-robot; docking; surgeon on console; undocking; and finish). The need for repeated utterances; additional supplies retrieval; fogging or matter on the endoscope and procedure-specific training were particularly disruptive. Variations across phases reflect differing demands across the operative course. Combined qualitative and quantitative observational methodologies can identify otherwise undocumented sources of process variation and potential failure. Future observational frameworks should attempt to merge human reliability analysis, a priori modelling, and post hoc analyses of observational data.

This, in turn, contributes to an imbalance in the representation of men and women in particular professions: In educational contexts, female teachers predominantly teach stereotypically female areas of study like social sciences and humanities, whereas male teachers are mainly represented in stereotypically male domains like mathematics. Research further provides evidence for the fact that this gender-stereotyped division of labor in education significantly impacts students' learning and motivation. Would gender-related stereotypes also bias learning processes with robots? This is plausible in light of the fact that social robots become more and more popular in learning settings. Thus, should the next generation of educational robots be 'gendered' and what impact would robot gender have on task performance, particularly in the context of a gender-stereotypical human-robot interaction (HRI) task? To investigate these issues, we examined the influence of robot gender on learning when completing either stereotypically female or stereotypically male learning tasks. 120 university students (60 females and 60 males) completed either stereotypically female or stereotypically male tasks with the support of a male vs. female instructor robot. The manipulation check indicated that participants recognized the robot's alleged gender correctly. Importantly, our results suggest that prevailing gender stereotypes associated with learning do not apply to robots that perform gender-stereotypical tasks. Interestingly, our findings indicated that a mismatch of robot gender and gender typicality of the respective task led to increased willingness to engage in prospective learning processes with the robot. We discuss these results with respect to future research on HRI and learning, and with regard to practical implications associated with the introduction of robots into higher education. © 2017 ACM.","educational robots; gender stereotypes; human-robot interaction; learning; robot evaluation","Education; Educational robots; Man machine systems; Robots; Social sciences; Students; Teaching; Division of labor; Education research; Educational context; Gender stereotypes; Human robot Interaction (HRI); learning; Learning settings; University students; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85021784557

While these studies may be antagonistic, they are designed to be ethical; when conducting a study, IRB (Institutional Review Board) processes are in place to assess the study design for potential risk to participants, and to ultimately protect the public.

This makes it hard to assess the true functional positioning of robots, how this is likely to move forward and whether the outcome of progress could be detrimental to human society.

Robot-assisted surgery has become more widespread in gynecological oncology. The purpose of this systematic review is to present current knowledge on robot-assisted surgery, and to clarify and discuss controversies that have arisen alongside the development and deployment. Material and methods. A database search in PubMed and EMBASE was performed up until 4 March 2016. The search strategy was developed in collaboration with an information specialist, and by application of the PRISMA guidelines. Human participants and English language were the only restrictive filters applied. Selection was performed by screening of titles and abstracts, and by full text scrutiny. From 2001 to 2016, a total of 76 references were included. Results. Robot-assisted surgery in gynecological oncology has increased, and current knowledge supports that the oncological safety is similar, compared with previous surgical methods. Controversies arise because current knowledge does not clearly document the benefit of robot-assisted surgery, on perioperative outcome compared with the increased costs of the acquisition and application. Conclusions. The rapid development in robot-assisted surgery calls for long-term detailed prospective cohorts or randomized controlled trials. The costs associated with acquisition, application, and maintenance have an unfavorable impact on cost–benefit evaluations, especially when compared with laparoscopy. Future developments in robot-assisted surgery will hopefully lead to competition in the market, which will decrease costs. © 2016 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Cervical cancer; Costs; Endometrial cancer; Ergonomics; Gynecological oncology; Ovarian cancer; Robot-assisted surgery; Robotic surgery; Training","cancer surgery; Embase; endometrium cancer; ergonomics; female; health care cost; human; Medline; ovary cancer; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; robot assisted surgery; surgeon; surgical training; systematic review; uterine cervix cancer; cost benefit analysis; devices; economics; education; Genital Neoplasms, Female; gynecologic surgery; health service; hysterectomy; robotics; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures; Humans; Hysterectomy; Robotics; Women's Health Services",2-s2.0-85012884164

Up to this present time, a major focus of technologies in the school curriculum has in many countries been on applications of existing technologies into subject practice (both software such as office applications, and hardware such as robots and sensors). Through uses of these applications, information and communications technologies (ICT) have focused on activities to support subject and topic learning (across wide age and subject ranges). Very recently, discussions for including computers in the curriculum have shifted to a much greater focus on computing and CS, more concerned with uses of and development of programming, together with fundamental principles of problem-solving and creativity. This paper takes a policy analysis approach; it considers evidence of current implementation of CSE in school curricula, the six main arguments for wider-scale introduction of the subject, the implications for researchers, schools, teachers and learners, the state of current discussions in a range of countries, and evidence of outcomes of CSE in compulsory curricula.

It involves swallowing a small disposable video capsule that takes photographic images as it passes through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. WCE allows physicians to visualize and diagnose disorders covering the full length of the GI tract. Although WCE can provide useful images of the internal GI tract, the identification of the exact location of the detected disease remains unclear. Location information is very crucial for the subsequent treatment of the detected disease either through surgery or through local drug delivery. The huge potential of WCE in future endoscopic practice relies on the successful tracking of the wireless capsule. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review on the recent developments in WCE localization techniques that have been reported in credible sources, namely, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Google Scholar. Detailed analysis and systematic comparison are provided to highlight the achievement and future direction of WCE localization.

These systems still lack force-feedback, where such a capability is believed to be beneficial to the surgeon and can improve safety. Method: In this paper a force-feedback enabled surgical robotic system is described in which the developed force-sensing surgical tool is discussed in detail. The developed surgical tool makes use of a proximally located force/torque sensor, which, in contrast to a distally located sensor, requires no miniaturization or sterilizability. Results: Experimental results are presented, and indicate high force sensing accuracies with errors <0.09 N. Conclusions: It is shown that developing a force-sensing surgical tool utilizing a proximally located force/torque sensor is feasible, where a tool outer diameter of 12 mm can be achieved. For future work it is desired to decrease the current tool outer diameter to 10 mm. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

What if these sex robots are deliberately designed and used to replicate acts of rape and child sexual abuse? Should the creation and use of such robots be criminalised, even if no person is harmed by the acts performed? I offer an argument for thinking that they should be. The argument consists of two premises. The first claims that it can be a proper object of the criminal law to regulate wrongful conduct with no extrinsically harmful effects on others (the moralistic premise). The second claims that the use (and possibly the manufacture) of robots that replicate acts of rape and child sexual abuse would be wrongful, even if such usage had no extrinsically harmful effects on others. I defend both premises of this argument and consider its implications for the criminal law.

Methods A systematic review of the literature was performed and best-evidence presented at a State-of-the-Art conference on Minimally Invasive Pancreatic Resection. Expert panel discussion and audience response activity was used to assess perceived value and future direction. Results From 582 studies, 26 comparative trials of MIPD and open pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD) were assessed for perioperative outcomes. There were no randomized controlled trials and all available comparative studies were determined of low quality. Several observational and case-matched studies demonstrate longer operative times, but less estimated blood loss and shorter length of hospital stay for MIPD. Registry-based studies demonstrate increased mortality rates after MIPD in low-volume centers. Oncologic assessment demonstrates comparable outcomes of MIPD. Expert opinion supports ongoing evaluation of MIPD.

We assessed the content presented online for robotic prostatectomy. Methods A Web search was performed on Google, Yahoo and Bing using the search term “robotic prostatectomy.” The first 50 Web sites found on each engine were evaluated for authorship, content and validity. The Fisher-Freeman-Halton test was used to compare differences between search engines. A second search using a more technical search term, “robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy,” was then performed on Google. Differences between search terms were compared using the Fisher exact test. Results Most Web sites mention benefits of robotic prostatectomy (78%) and allow readers to schedule appointments (72.7%). However, a minority reference peer-reviewed literature (16.7%) or mention risks (34%). Overall 43.3% of Web sites mention faster return of continence and potency as benefits of robotic surgery.

The system consists of an array of hydrostatically coupled dielectric elastomer actuators (HCDEAs). Due to the electrostriction property of dielectric elastomers, the handling system can be controlled by electric voltage rather than the cumbersome pneumatic system. To study the working performance of the Wave-Handling system and how the performance can be improved, the basic properties of HCDEA are investigated through experiments. We find that the HCDEA exhibits some delay and hysteretic characteristics when activated by periodic voltage and the characteristics are influenced by the frequency and external force also. All this will affect the performance of the Wave-Handling system. However, the electric control, simple structure, light weight, and low cost of the soft handling system show great potential to move from laboratory to practical application. As a proof of design concept, a simply made prototype of the handling system is controlled to generate a parallel moving wave to manipulate a ball. Based on the experimental results, the improvements and future work are discussed and we believe this work will provide inspiration for soft robotic engineering. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","dielectric elastomer actuator; soft handling system; soft robot; sorting machine",,2-s2.0-85015083626

This review compares its short-term outcomes with conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy by a meta-analysis. Methods A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases (January 1990–October 2015). Studies identified were appraised with standard selection criteria. Data were extracted and a meta-analysis performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. Results Thirteen studies, 12 retrospective trials and one randomized controlled trial comprising 1,589 patients (laparoscopic cholecystectomy, n = 921; robotic cholecystectomy, n = 668) were examined. There was a trend of a greater median total operative time (115.3 min vs 128.0 min; pooled MD = 31.22, 95% confidence interval = −2.48 to 59.96; Z = 2.13; P = .03) and preoperative time (32.4 min vs 53.4 min; pooled MD = 20.98, 95% confidence interval = 15.74 to 26.23; Z = 7.84; P < .001) in the robotic cholecystectomy group. Intraoperative complications (P = .52), conversion rate (P = .06), estimated blood loss (P = .55), postoperative complications (P = .28), duration of hospital stay (P = .36), and readmission rate (P = .85) were similar between both groups. Conclusion Robotic cholecystectomy is associated with greater operative times related primarily to the preparatory phase of the operation but with similar safety and perioperative outcome as conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Previous researches have focused on the control design of teleoperation machine systems to deal with obstacles such as time-delayed stability and transparency. Recent researches have shown that the inclusion of human closed-loop dynamics in control design can improve the performance of robot telemanipulation. The complexity of human behavior arises from the uncertainty of both human physiology and psychology; hence, the investigation can benefit from empirical studies. This study develops a type of statistical learning method to model and evaluate human stochastic closed-loop behavior, which is considered as a hand motion during the direct incremental control process of master-slave teleoperation. The hand trajectory is empirically considered as having a binary linear regression relationship with the error and error rate between the demanded and simulated teleoperator trajectories, while random movements with zero error and error rate are discovered. Hand movement tracking is achieved using a multi-leap-motion sensor (MLM), which is a markerless and natural infrared vision-based manner for motion capture. The established behavior model and statistical learning results reveal certain human properties of operational activities including visual perception, decision making, and robot telemanipulation. The properties indicate some probable system enhancements for future work. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","human behavior; leap motion; statistical learning; teleoperation","Closed loop control systems; Decision making; Errors; Machine design; Manipulators; Physiology; Remote control; Social sciences; Statistical process control; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time delay; Visual servoing; Binary linear regression; Closed loop dynamic; Closed-loop behavior; Human behaviors; leap motion; Operational activity; Statistical learning; Statistical learning methods; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85009833950

Heterogeneity in MIPR terminology, leads to confusion and inconsistency. The Organizing Committee of the State of the Art Conference on MIPR collaborated to standardize MIPR terminology. Methods After formal literature review for “minimally invasive pancreatic surgery” term, key terminology elements were identified. A questionnaire was created assessing the type of resection, the approach, completion, and conversion. Delphi process was used to identify the level of agreement among the experts. Results A systematic terminology template was developed based on combining the approach and resection taking into account the completion. For a solitary approach the term should combine “approach + resection” (e.g. “laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy); for combined approaches the term must combine “first approach + resection” with “second approach + reconstruction” (e.g. “laparoscopic central pancreatectomy” with “open pancreaticojejunostomy”) and where conversion has resulted the recommended term is “first approach” + “converted to” + “second approach” + “resection” (e.g. “robot-assisted” “converted to open” “pancreatoduodenectomy”) Conclusions The guidelines presented are geared towards standardizing terminology for MIPR, establishing a basis for comparative analyses and registries and allow incorporating future surgical and technological advances in MIPR. © 2017 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Inc.",,"Delphi study; human; nomenclature; pancreas resection; pancreaticoduodenectomy; practice guideline; questionnaire; register; surgery",2-s2.0-85015421941

Because postoperative complications may lead to longer hospital stays and higher costs overall, analysis of risk factors for postoperative surgical complications in this subset of patients is clinically relevant. The goal of this study was to identify risk factors for postoperative morbidity after robotic surgical procedures in general surgery. We performed an observational monocentric retrospective study. All consecutive robotic surgical procedures from November 2001 to December 2013 were included. One thousand consecutive general surgery patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean overall postoperative morbidity and major postoperative morbidity (Clavien >III) rates were 20.4 and 6 %, respectively. This included a conversion rate of 4.4 %, reoperation rate of 4.5 %, and mortality rate of 0.2 %. Multivariate analysis showed that ASA score >3 [OR 1.7; 95 % CI (1.2–2.4)], hematocrit value <38 [OR 1.6; 95 % CI (1.1–2.2)], previous abdominal surgery [OR 1.5; 95 % CI (1–2)], advanced dissection [OR 5.8; 95 % CI (3.1–10.6)], and multiquadrant surgery [OR 2.5; 95 % CI (1.7–3.8)] remained independent risk factors for overall postoperative morbidity. It also showed that advanced dissection [OR 4.4; 95 % CI (1.9–9.6)] and multiquadrant surgery [OR 4.4; 95 % CI (2.3–8.5)] remained independent risk factors for major postoperative morbidity (Clavien >III). This study identifies independent risk factors for postoperative overall and major morbidity in robotic general surgery. Because these factors independently impacted postoperative complications, we believe they could be taken into account in future studies comparing conventional versus robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures in general surgery. © 2016, Italian Society of Surgery (SIC).","Laparoscopy; Morbidity; Mortality; Postoperative complications; Risk factors; Robotics",,2-s2.0-85015743238

Using a smart system in detection of the exact size of periapical lesions, we have responded to this problem, in this work. The purpose of this paper is detection of the size of periapical lesions with processing image using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in the X-Ray Digital (XRD) images that facilitate conducting a more accurate diagnosis. Methods: Particle swarm optimization, in principle, is a computing evolutionary technique and an optimization population- based method. This algorithm is based on examination of the color changes around the tooth roots in the XRD images. The color of the periapical lesions around unhealthy tooth root is darker (Lucent) compared with that of the healthy tooth root (Opaque). Methodology of this algorithm on XRD image is to investigate the color changes around tooth root and to show the size of periapical lesions. The difference between this study and previous ones is computation of the color changes by image processing algorithm for diagnosis of the size of periapical lesions. Results: After running the algorithm, if the lesion is apical root around, PSO algorithm can recognize size of periapical lesions and identify its location. Conclusions: This algorithm provides useful and successful results for the presented tests and experiments. Using this algorithm, it is possible to save time, reduce errors, and have a more accurate diagnosis. Among the potential applications of this algorithm is to intelligently help dentist robots, which will be used in the future. © 2017 Edizioni Minerva Medica.","Algorithms; Computer-assisted; Image processing; Lesions","algorithm; Article; computer analysis; human; image processing; jaw; mathematical model; odontometry; particle swarm optimization algorithm; radiography; tooth periapical disease; tooth root",2-s2.0-85014577961

I discuss the movie Ex Machina by director Alex Garland. The robot Ava, played by Alicia Vikander, is a rare portrait of what could be interpreted as a feminist robot (and there are spoilers ahead for any readers unfamiliar with this movie). Though she apparently is created as the dream of the ‘perfect woman’, sexy and beautiful, she also develops and urges to free herself from the slavery of her creator, Nathan Bateman. She is a robot created along the perfect dimensions as a Vitruvian robot but is also a creature which could be interpreted as a human being. However, the point I want to raise is not whether Ava’s reaction to robot slavery is justified or not but how her portrait raises questions about the blurred lines between reality and fiction when we discuss our robotic future. A real version of Ava would not last long in a human world because she is basically a solipsist, who does not really care about humans. She cannot co-create the line humans walk along. The robots created as ‘perfect women’ (sex robots) today are very far from the ideal image of Ava. They are sexist, primitively normative and clearly ‘wax-doll machines’. So though Ava’s dimensions are perfect she, like the Vitruvian Man, remains a fiction. In real life, however, we may have to deal with an increasing solipsism stemming from people engaging with machines like sex robots. In this case, it is human and not robotic solipsism we need to worry about. © 2017 Springer-Verlag London","Ex machina; Robot feminism; Robotics; Science fiction; Sex robots; Solipsism; Vitruvian man","Robotics; Ex machina; Human being; Ideal images; Science fictions; Solipsism; Vitruvian man; Robots",2-s2.0-85014021351

We found that when the robot played cooperatively, children cooperated and helped the robot more than when the robot played selfishly.

The resulting maps are detailed since they have a high resolution. Based on these maps robots navigate through rough terrain, fulfil advanced manipulation, and inspection tasks. In case of specular reflective and transparent objects, e.g., mirrors, windows, shiny metals, the laser measurements get corrupted. Based on the type of object and the incident angle of the incoming laser beam there are three results possible: a measurement point on the object plane, a measurement behind the object plane, and a measurement of a reflected object. It is important to detect such situations to be able to handle these corrupted points. This paper describes why it is difficult to distinguish between specular reflective and transparent surfaces. It presents a 3D-Reflection-Pre-Filter Approach to identify specular reflective and transparent objects in point clouds of a multi-echo laser scanner. Furthermore, it filters point clouds from influences of such objects and extract the object properties for further investigations. Based on an Iterative-Closest-Point-algorithm reflective objects are identified. Object surfaces and points behind surfaces are masked according to their location. Finally, the processed point cloud is forwarded to a mapping module. Furthermore, the object surface corners and the type of the surface is broadcasted. Four experiments demonstrate the usability of the 3D-Reflection-Pre-Filter. The first experiment was made in a empty room containing a mirror, the second experiment was made in a stairway containing a glass door, the third experiment was made in a empty room containing two mirrors, the fourth experiment was made in an office room containing a mirror. This paper demonstrate that for single scans the detection of specular reflective and transparent objects in 3D is possible. It is more reliable in 3D as in 2D. Nevertheless, collect the data of multiple scans and post-filter them as soon as the object was bypassed should pursued. This is why future work concentrates on implementing a post-filter module. Besides, it is the aim to improve the discrimination between specular reflective and transparent objects.","3D laser scanning; Algorithms; Correction; Detection; Error; Measurement; Robotics; Segmentation","Algorithms; Electric power factor correction; Error detection; Errors; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Laser applications; Laser windows; Mapping; Measurements; Mirrors; Object detection; Robotics; Scanning; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D Laser scanning; Iterative closest point algorithm; Laser measurements; Measurement points; Precise measurements; Reflective objects; Transparent objects; Transparent surfaces; Laser mirrors",2-s2.0-85021753621

Modern sensors and sophisticated perception algorithms extract rich 3D textured information, but are limited to the data that are collected from a given location or path. We are interested in closing the loop around perception and planning, in particular to plan paths for better perceptual data, and focus on the problem of planning scanning sequences to improve object classification from range data. We formulate a novel time-constrained active classification problem and propose solution algorithms that employ a variation of Monte Carlo tree search to plan non-myopically. Our algorithms use a particle filter combined with Gaussian process regression to estimate joint distributions of object class and pose. This estimator is used in planning to generate a probabilistic belief about the state of objects in a scene, and also to generate beliefs for predicted sensor observations from future viewpoints. These predictions consider occlusions arising from predicted object positions and shapes. We evaluate our algorithms in simulation, in comparison to passive and greedy strategies. We also describe similar experiments where the algorithms are implemented online, using a mobile ground robot in a farm environment. Results indicate that our non-myopic approach outperforms both passive and myopic strategies, and clearly show the benefit of active perception for outdoor object classification. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Active classification; Monte Carlo tree Search; Object classification; Sequential Monte Carlo","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Monte Carlo methods; Active perceptions; Gaussian process regression; Joint distributions; Monte-Carlo tree searches; Object classification; Probabilistic belief; Sequential Monte Carlo; Solution algorithms; Data mining",2-s2.0-85013149266

Humanoid robot reaching, as an essential ability which forms the foundation of grasping and manipulation, is also possible to take advantages from human. For human infants, reaching is emerging around 3-5 months of age, which is also a fundamental skill for the development and refinement of future high level motion or cognitive behaviors. The issue of how infant reaching is developed has been investigated for decades and several views were established and discussed. Recently, Corbetta et al. proposed that the emergence of reaching is the product of a deeply embodied process, in which infants first learn how to direct their movement in space using proprioceptive and haptic feedback and then map the visual attention onto these bodily centered experiences. With this new sight, this paper addresses the problem of how a robot develops its reaching ability autonomously, and a novel infant-inspired model is proposed. The model is composed of several blocks so that to closely capture the inherent mechanisms of infants in the process of developing the reaching skill. To evaluate the proposed model, a child-sized physical humanoid robot PKU-HR6.0 is employed. Just like an early infant, the robot is assumed without any other abilities. It is only equipped with the proposed model with random initialized parameters. The reaching ability is expected to be developed all by the robot itself. Through iteratively babbling arm motions in its workspace, the robot firstly acquire a reliable sense of its body and movement in space, and then map the sense of the vision onto the proprioception when contingencies happen. Experimental results show that the robot equipped with the proposed model achieves the reaching ability effectively and successfully in a completely autonomous style. The robot is able to reach the objects in different real environments with a high performance, and can even grasp the objects with an average successful rate of 82.50%. Our experimental results also verify that the movement of one joint may induce another, and some sepecific joint may play dominant role in certain category of movements. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Anthropomorphic robots; Behavioral research; Robotics; Sensory perception; Cognitive behavior; Essential abilities; Grasping and manipulation; Haptic feedbacks; High-level motion; Human development; Real environments; Visual Attention; Robots",2-s2.0-85015292830

Biological agents start with a flexible cognitive architecture but limited abilities, and acquire competences by different combinations of maturation, growth and experience (both social and individual), and some designers of artificial systems try to emulate such processes. By examining the processes leading to the construction of competence in biological agents we hope to inspire and support ideas relevant to the design of intelligent agents in the future. Here we report a study of the emergence of physical problem-solving in human infants aged 15 to 24 months and in both tool-using and non-tool-using corvids. One goal is to examine whether tool-using competence was indicative of general physical intelligence, in which case tool using agents should show greater competence both in tool-related and non-tool related tasks. Another is to test whether in these disparate organisms, experience with combining objects in contexts other than functional tool use (e.g. play) can causally facilitate the emergence of tool use competence. We used a battery of tasks including tool vs. non-tool dependent extractions of target objects. All subjects were initially exposed to a mixture of objects and allowed to interact freely with them. Preliminary results show that while there are strong inter-species differences in tool-related competence, we found no major differences in tasks where tools were not involved. There were strong individual differences within each species, but age effects were only found in human infants, reflecting differences in life-history: Although crows can live for several decades, they reach adulthood (including asymptotic competence in many indices) much faster than humans.

Manual tuning of the aforementioned parameters can be cumbersome. Automated controller parameter tuning requires repetitive experimental tests with non-optimal parameters leading to a rapid wear and tear of the robot. Use of dynamics simulator instead of a robot may alleviate this issue to some extent. However, reality gap may exist between a physical system and corresponding simulator. This paper reports an optimization based approach for determining environment parameters (added mass, added inertia and drag) from physical experiments followed by an optimization based automated parameter tuning utilizing the determined environment parameters via developed dynamics simulator. We report numerical simulations of waypoint following on different test paths using the identified environment parameters and optimized controller parameters determined using the developed approach. We found a reduction of up to 36% in travel time in our experiments. The developed approach can lead to a match between dynamics simulation and physical experiments and thereby can help in automated parameter tuning. In future, we would like to improve the performance of the optimization and to incorporate the sensing noise and environmental disturbance like current into the dynamics simulator. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Controllers; Cybernetics; Dynamics; Robots; Simulators; Travel time; Controller parameter; Dynamics simulation; Dynamics simulator; Environmental disturbances; Locomotion parameters; Low-level controllers; Optimized controllers; Physical experiments; Automation",2-s2.0-85015742489

The study presented here investigates different methods of displaying information about the swarm state to operators, and asks them to make predictions about the swarm's future state. In the study, participants are shown swarms performing one of three different behaviors, and are asked to use the information available from the display to make their predictions. Results show that summarizing the swarm's current state to just an average position and bounding ellipse allowed predictions as accurate as those made when full state information was shown. Furthermore, two leader-based methods were used, whereby the operators were shown only a small subset of the swarm. However, such display methods were inferior for prediction than either the summary center and ellipse or full information methods.

The aerodynamic origin of the elevated performance of flying animals remains, however, poorly understood. In this themed issue, animal flight research and aerial robot development coalesce to offer a broader perspective on the current advances and future directions in these coevolving fields of research. Together, four reviews summarize and 14 reports contribute to our understanding of low Reynolds number flight. This area of applied aerodynamics research is challenging to dissect due to the complicated flow phenomena that include laminar– turbulent flow transition, laminar separation bubbles, delayed stall and nonlinear vortex dynamics. Our mechanistic understanding of low Reynolds number flight has perhaps been advanced most by the development of dynamically scaled robot models and new specialized wind tunnel facilities: in particular, the tiltable Lund flight tunnel for animal migration research and the recently developed AFAR hypobaric wind tunnel for high-altitude animal flight studies. These world-class facilities are now complemented with a specialized low Reynolds number wind tunnel for studying the effect of turbulence on animal and robot flight in much greater detail than previously possible. This is particular timely, because the study of flight in extremely laminar versus turbulent flow opens a new frontier in our understanding of animal flight.

The use of simulators as an alternative to real-world robots is often employed to reduce the time required to develop effective controllers in the ER process. However, the development of adequate simulators is often time-consuming and complex. Simulators are usually constructed from physics models and/or are based on empirically collected data. The vast majority of simulation approaches are based on physics models which can become complex and require specialised knowledge. Alternative simulation approaches that simplify and automate the modelling of real-world phenomena can provide certain advantages over traditional approaches. An alternative simulation approach, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that model the real-world phenomena based on empirical data are relatively simple to construct and requires little specialised knowledge. ANN-based simulators are traditionally constructed before the ER process can begin and require the sampling of real-world experimental data. Disadvantages to the traditional approach to ANN-based simulator construction are that the simulator must be created before the ER process can be initiated and a large amount of behavioural data must be collected in order to accurately predict future behaviours. Previous research has successfully demonstrated that ANN-based simulators and controllers can be developed concurrently during the ER process for a simple differentially-steered wheeled robot, while the current research has demonstrated the concurrent approach using a complex snake-like robot. The viability of the concurrent approach was demonstrated on a real-world snake-like robot by performing trajectory planning tasks. Influential factors related to the success of the concurrent approach were also studied by investigating the effects various parameter settings had on success. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial Neural Networks; Coevolution; Evolutionary Robotics; Simulator; Snake robot","Behavioral research; Complex networks; Concurrency control; Controllers; Neural networks; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Simulators; Co-evolution; Evolutionary robotics; Influential factors; Robotic controllers; Simulator construction; Snake robots; Traditional approaches; Trajectory Planning; Process control",2-s2.0-85007143903

A rectangular beam with an isotropic coefficient of friction of its contact surface with the flat ground can move forward or backward when actuated by a periodic traveling sinusoidal wave. The Poisson's ratio of the beam plays an important role in the slithering locomotion speed and direction, particularly when it is negative. A theoretical model is proposed to elucidate the slithering locomotion mechanism, which is analogous to the rolling of a wheel on ground. There are two key factors of slithering locomotion: a rotational velocity field and a corresponding local contact region between the beam and ground. During wriggling motion of the rectangular beam, a rotational velocity field is observed near the maximum curvature point of the beam. If the beam has a negative Poisson's ratio, the axial tension will cause a lateral expansion so that the contact region between the beam and ground is located at the outer edge of the maximum curvature (the largest lateral expansion point). The direction of the beam's velocity at this outer edge is usually opposite to the traveling wave direction, so the friction force propels the beam in the direction of the traveling wave. A similar scenario is found for the relatively large amplitude of wriggling motion when the beam's Poisson's ratio is positive. Finite element method (FEM) simulation was conducted to verify the slithering locomotion mechanism, and good agreement was found between the FEM simulation results and theoretical predictions. The insights obtained here present a simple, novel and straightforward mechanism for slithering locomotion and are helpful for future designs of snake-like soft robots. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Poisson's ratio; Rotational velocity field; Slithering locomotion; Snake-like soft robot; Traveling wave","Friction; Machine design; Poisson ratio; Robots; Velocity; Coefficient of frictions; Finite element method simulation; Locomotion mechanism; Negative poisson's ratios; Rotational velocity; Soft robot; Theoretical modeling; Traveling wave; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85006427651

Materials and Methods: A deidentified survey measured utilization of the robot, perception on the utility of the robot, and its incorporation in training among the program directors of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) pediatric surgery fellowships in the United States. Results: Forty-one of the 47 fellowship programs (87%) responded to the survey. While 67% of respondents indicated the presence of a robot in their facility, only 26% reported its utilizing in their surgical practice. Among programs not utilizing the robot, most common reasons provided were lack of clear supportive evidence, increased intraoperative time, and incompatibility of instrument size to pediatric patients. While 58% of program directors believe that there is a future role for robotic surgery in children, only 18% indicated that robotic training should play a part in pediatric surgery education. Consequently, while over 66% of survey respondents received training in robot-assisted surgical technique, only 29% of fellows receive robot-assisted training during their fellowship.

Objective To identify training methods available for robot-assisted surgical (RAS) training in urology, evaluate their effectiveness in terms of validation, educational impact, acceptability, and cost effectiveness, and assess their effect on learning curves (LCs). Evidence acquisition A systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines searched Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. Results were screened to include appropriate studies. Quality was evaluated. Each method was evaluated, and conclusions were drawn regarding LCs. Evidence synthesis Of 359 records, 24 were included (521 participants). Training methods included dry-lab training (n = 7), wet-lab training (n = 7), mentored training (n = 7), and nonstructured pathways (n = 5). Dry-lab training demonstrated educational impact by reducing console time and was acceptable in a study; 100% of participants confirmed face validity. Wet-lab training principally uses human cadaveric material; effectiveness is well rated, although dry-lab training and observation were rated as equally useful. Mentored programmes combine lectures, tutorials, observation, simulation, and proctoring. Minifellowships were linked to greater practice of RAS 1 yr later. LCs vary according to experience. One study found that surgeons from robot-related fellowships demonstrated fewer positive surgical margins than surgeons from laparoscopic-related fellowships (24% vs 34.6%; p = 0.05) and reduced time (132 vs 152 min; p = 0.0003). Five studies examined nonstructured training pathways (clinical practice). Experience correlated with fewer complications (p = 0.007), improved continence (p = 0.049), and reduced time (p = 0.002). Conclusions RAS training methods include dry and wet lab, mentored training, and nonstructured pathways. Limited available evidence suggests that they affect LCs differently and are rarely used alone. The different methods of training appear effective when combined. Their benefits must be explored to facilitate validated acceptable training with educational impact.

Although open surgery remains the gold standard, minimally invasive approaches have recently been applied in transplant kidney surgery. Despite growing enthusiasm and potential benefits of robotic kidney transplant, many aspects of this novel technique remain controversial. Aim of this study was to analyze the current status and future developments in robotic-assisted surgery for kidney transplantation. Evidence Acquisition: A systematic PubMed search for peer-reviewed studies was performed using keywords such as ""Minimally invasive surgery"" or ""Robotic"" or ""Robot assisted"" AND ""Kidney transplantation"". Eligible articles were reviewed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Evidence Synthesis: Eleven studies evaluated reported the feasibility, safety and reproducibility of robotic kidney transplantation using either a transperitoneal or an extraperitoneal approach. The graft kidney is usually introduced via a periumbilical or Gibson incision. The functional outcomes of the robotic approach are equivalent to those of open kidney transplantation in terms of mean serum creatinine at 6 month and delayed graft function. The benefits of robotic kidney transplantation include easier vascular anastomosis, better cosmetic results, and a lower complication rate, including in the obese population. Many concerns remain over the potential impairment of graft function due to pneumoperitoneum and warm ischemia and the technical difficulties related to the vascular anastomosis. Refinement of the robotic tactile feedback and development of a cold ischemia device may lead to further improvement in this novel technique.

Current laparoscopic instrumentation, however, has its limitations especially in the performance of rectal cancer resections. Robotic surgery for colorectal cancers is an important addition to the technologies available to the surgeon. We review the literature and draw on our own experience to examine the advantages and disadvantages of robot-assisted surgery for the treatment of colorectal cancers and the evidence for the superior outcomes frequently cited and to identify subsets that may benefit the most. Recent Findings: Most of the evidence for robotic surgery emanates from nonrandomized studies. These studies show acceptable perioperative and oncologic outcomes, with lower conversion rates and circumferential margin positivity than with laparoscopy. The only randomized trial, the ROLARR, did not show any significant difference between the two modalities regarding conversion rates or pathologic outcomes. Summary: Current evidence does not conclusively support robotic surgery over laparoscopy or vice versa. Robotics is an emerging field and innovations including the current da Vinci Xi system, single port, and TAMIS platforms may all enable more complex surgeries going forward. Robotic surgery has a short learning curve. Patients undergoing surgery for low rectal cancers, who have any combination of male gender, obesity, and T3 cancers, as well as the need for complete mesocolic excision in right colon cancers, may be considered for the robotic approach with appreciable benefits and no detriment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Colon cancer; Laparoscopic surgery; Oncologic outcomes; Rectal cancer; Robotic surgery; Total mesorectal excision","colon cancer; colon resection; evidence based practice; health care cost; human; laparoscopic surgery; learning curve; patient positioning; randomized controlled trial (topic); rectum cancer; Review; robot assisted surgery; surgical approach; surgical equipment; surgical technique; surgical training; total mesorectal excision; treatment outcome",2-s2.0-85011552275

Therefore we are interested in designing controllers of fast rovers which improve mobile robot capacity in natural environment. When designing autonomous path tracking systems for fast rovers, a major problem is the dynamic effect and the non-linearity of the model. Several control laws have been designed to resolve the problem by separating the dynamic of the robot at the problem of trajectory tracking. This paper presents a path tracking controller for a fast rover with independent front and rear steering. In the first step, a dynamic model of a vehicle that moves on a horizontal plane was developed. Next, the projection of the position of the vehicle in the absolute reference frame was used to define the kinematics non-linear model. We present a new approach to solving a tracking path problem by applying Non-linear Continuous-time Generalized Predictive Control (NCGPC). The controller is based on the dynamic model of a bicycle like vehicle which considers the lateral slippage of the wheels. The prediction model allows anticipation of future changes in setpoints in accordance with the dynamic constraints of the system. Experimental results, show a good control accuracy and appears to be robust with respect to environmental and robot state changes. © 2016, Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems and The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Mobile robot; modeling; nonlinear continuous-time generalized predictive control; path tracking","Continuous time systems; Dynamic models; Mobile robots; Models; Predictive control systems; Robots; Vehicles; Control accuracy; Dynamic constraints; Explicit dynamics; Generalized predictive control; Natural environments; Outdoor mobile robots; Path tracking; Trajectory tracking; Controllers",2-s2.0-85007015528

It argues that a preemptive ban on AWS is irrelevant at this point and urges the appropriate authorities to develop a modern legal framework that is tailored to embrace these state-of-the-art weapons as the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) develops. First, this paper explores the myriad of laws designed to govern the potential future development and deployment of artificial intelligence and AWS in the context of International Humanitarian Law or LAOC.

For this purpose, we present here a semantic mapping framework featuring geometrical and semasiological attributes that reveal the relationships between objects and places in a real-life environment. The geometrical component consists of a 3D metric map, onto which a topological map is deployed. The semasiological part is realized by putting together a place recognition algorithm and an object recognition one. The categorization of the different places relies on the resolution of appearance-based consistency histograms, while for the recognition of objects in the scene, a hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) network boosted by a saliency attentional model, is utilized. These semantic attributes are then deposited on the topological map to augment it with the belief distributions regarding the visited places, enabling thus the agent to act in an intelligent manner in human populated environments. Thus, the proposed framework outlines a proficient system in the construction of human conceivable environment representations, which has been successfully assessed on real-world scenarios, proving its ability to provide a consistent solution to the emerging problem of the human-robot cohabitation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","3D object map; 3D topological map; Object recognition; Place classification; Semantic map; SLAM","Object recognition; Robots; Topology; 3D object; Environment representations; Hierarchical temporal memory (htm); Industrial environments; Perceptual representations; Semantic map; SLAM; Topological map; Semantics",2-s2.0-84992515777

A detailed description of the mechanical device, including its innovative features and first experimental results, is provided. During operation, BMI-decoded position and velocity are directly mapped onto the bipedal exoskeleton's motions, which then move the monkey's legs as the monkey remains physicallypassive. To meet the unique requirements of such an application, the exoskeleton's features include: high output torque with backdrivable actuation, size adjustability, and safe user-robot interface. In addition, a novel rope transmission is introduced and implemented. To test the performance of the exoskeleton, a mechanical assessment was conducted, which yielded quantifiable results for transparency, efficiency, stiffness, and tracking performance.

We further discuss the drawbacks of current solutions and underline promising technologies for future development. Methods: A systematic literature search of scientific papers that deal with touchless control of medical software in the immediate environment of the operation room and interventional radiology suite was performed. This includes methods for touchless gesture interaction, voice control and eye tracking. Results: Fifty-five research papers were identified and analyzed in detail including 33 journal publications. Most of the identified literature (62 %) deals with the control of medical image viewers. The others present interaction techniques for laparoscopic assistance (13 %), telerobotic assistance and operating room control (9 % each) as well as for robotic operating room assistance and intraoperative registration (3.5 % each). Only 8 systems (14.5 %) were tested in a real clinical environment, and 7 (12.7 %) were not evaluated at all. Conclusion: In the last 10 years, many advancements have led to robust touchless interaction approaches. However, only a few have been systematically evaluated in real operating room settings. Further research is required to cope with current limitations of touchless software interfaces in clinical environments. The main challenges for future research are the improvement and evaluation of usability and intuitiveness of touchless human–computer interaction and the full integration into productive systems as well as the reduction of necessary interaction steps and further development of hands-free interaction. © 2016, CARS.","Eye tracking; Gestures; Human–computer interaction; Operating rooms; Robotics; Speech recognition software; Touchless interaction","body movement; clinical evaluation; eye tracking; gesture; human; human computer interaction; image analysis; interventional radiology; laparoscopic assistance; laparoscopic surgery; meta analysis (topic); operating room; outcome assessment; priority journal; Review; robot assisted surgery; robotic assistance; robotics; software; systematic review; telerobotic assistance; voice; computer interface; gesture; interventional radiology; laparoscopy; operating room; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; surgery; Gestures; Humans; Laparoscopy; Operating Rooms; Radiology, Interventional; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Robotics; Software; Surgical Procedures, Operative; User-Computer Interface; Voice",2-s2.0-84988430923

During the past decade, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) flourished in the field of general surgery, and it has emerged as a new concept of minimally invasive surgery. NOTES yields access to the abdominal cavity without any incisions on the abdominal wall (scarless surgery), and the natural orifices of the body surface, such as the mouth and the vagina, serve as the gateway to the peritoneal cavity. In gynecology, the vagina of a woman can be considered as an additional route for surgery. Recently, clinical application of transvaginal NOTES has broadened significantly in gynecology. Using transvaginal NOTES by applying the method of single-incision laparoscopic surgery via the vaginal route, not only adnexal surgery and hysterectomy, but also myomectomy and oncologic surgery could be performed safely and effectively in selected patients. In future, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the true clinical feasibility and safety of transvaginal NOTES. © 2017","laparoendoscopic single-site surgery; minimally invasive surgery; natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery; single-incision laparoscopic surgery","clinical practice; colpotomy; cystectomy; endometrium cancer; feasibility study; gynecology; human; hysterectomy; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; minimally invasive surgery; myomectomy; natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery; operation duration; Review; robot assisted surgery; safety; salpingooophorectomy; surgical approach; transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery; uterus surgery",2-s2.0-85009799686

Surgeons with awkward and static working postures are no exception. Robotic-assisted laparoscopy has been postulated to be superior to conventional laparoscopy regarding the ergonomic strain for surgeons. In this review, we aimed to systematically evaluate the existing literature comparing the two surgical modalities. Methods: A systematic literature search was employed in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library in spring 2015. Inclusion criteria were as follows: English language, full text available, original data, and comparative data on surgeons’ physical workload with robotic-assisted laparoscopy and conventional laparoscopy. Studies only describing a single surgical modality were excluded. We applied the checklist, STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE), to assess the quality of reporting of the included studies. Semi-quantitative comparisons were made. Results: In total, 2685 records were screened and 15 articles were included in the analysis. All studies were observational with sample sizes ranging from one single surgeon to 250 questionnaire responses. None of the studies fully fulfilled the criteria of STROBE, with an average score of 13 (range 10–16) out of 18. Discussion: Results, mainly self-reported measures, suggest that robotic-assisted laparoscopy is less strenuous compared with conventional laparoscopy. However, results are limited by the large methodological heterogeneity and a high risk of bias. We advocate for further high-quality exposure studies to assess the potential ergonomic deficits related to different minimally invasive surgical techniques. In addition, future intervention studies should evaluate possible means to alleviate and prevent musculoskeletal pain among surgeons. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Conventional laparoscopy; Physical work demands; Physical work environment; Robotic surgery; Surgeons’ health","Article; checklist; clinical evaluation; Cochrane Library; comparative study; conventional laparoscopy; electromyography; Embase; evidence based practice; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgery; manual labor; Medline; minimally invasive surgery; musculoskeletal pain; observational study; occupational disease; potential difference; priority journal; questionnaire; robot assisted surgery; robotic assisted laparoscopy; sample size; self report; surgical approach; systematic review; workload; laparoscopy; musculoskeletal pain; Occupational Diseases; robotic surgical procedure; surgeon; Humans; Laparoscopy; Musculoskeletal Pain; Occupational Diseases; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Surgeons; Workload",2-s2.0-84975303624

While a shallow wound may heal over time, deep wounds often require clinical interventions such as suturing to ensure the wound closure and timely healing. To date, suturing practices are based on a surgeon's experience and there is no benchmark to what is right or wrong. In the literature, there have been few attempts to characterize wound closure and suture mechanics using simple 2D computational models. In our current work, for the first time, a realistic three-dimensional (3D) computational model of the skin with the two layers, namely the epidermis and dermis, have been developed. A 3D diamond shaped wound with a varying cross-section has been modeled, and interrupted sutures have been placed numerically in multiple steps to close the wound. Nonlinear hyperelastic material properties have been adopted for the skin and a skin pre-stress was applied bi-axially. The force requirements for each suture were estimated numerically using a novel suture pulling technique. The suture forces were found to lie in the range of 0-5 N with a maximum value at the center. Also, the center suture was observed to require an approximately four times pull force compared to the first end suture. All these findings provide important guidelines for suturing. Additionally, the suture force can be approximated as a polynomial function of the displacement. Given a wound geometry, wound depth, skin material properties, skin pre-stress, suture wire material and cross-sectional area, using our computational model, such a relationship can be used to estimate and characterize the suture force requirements accurately. To our knowledge, such a 3D computational model of skin wound closure with interrupted sutures have not been developed till date, and would be indispensable for planning robotic surgeries and improving clinical suturing practices in the future. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","finite element model; robotic surgery; Skin; suture; wound closure","Computation theory; Computational geometry; Computational methods; Finite element method; Robot programming; Robotic surgery; Robotics; Skin; Surgery; Clinical interventions; Cross sectional area; Hyperelastic materials; Polynomial functions; suture; Threedimensional (3-d); Varying cross section; Wound closure; Knowledge based systems",2-s2.0-84978997748

However, these methods might not be accurate according to computational and robot-based studies of flapping wings. Here we test this hypothesis for the first time for a slowly flying Pacific parrotlet in still air using stereo particle image velocimetry recorded at 1000 Hz. The bird was trained to fly between two perches through a laser sheet wearing laser safety goggles. We found that the wingtip vortices generated during mid-downstroke advected down and broke up quickly, contradicting the frozen turbulence hypothesis typically assumed in animal flight experiments. The quasi-steady lift at mid-downstroke was estimated based on the velocity field by applying the widely used Kutta-Joukowski theorem, vortex ring model, and actuator disk model. The calculated lift was found to be sensitive to the applied model and its different parameters, including vortex span and distance between the bird and laser sheet - rendering these three accepted ways of calculating weight support inconsistent. The three models predict different aerodynamic force values mid-downstroke compared to independent direct measurements with an aerodynamic force platform that we had available for the same species flying over a similar distance. Whereas the lift predictions of the Kutta-Joukowski theorem and the vortex ring model stayed relatively constant despite vortex breakdown, their values were too low. In contrast, the actuator disk model predicted lift reasonably accurately before vortex breakdown, but predicted almost no lift during and after vortex breakdown. Some of these limitations might be better understood, and partially reconciled, if future animal flight studies report lift calculations based on all three quasi-steady lift models instead. This would also enable much needed meta studies of animal flight to derive bioinspired design principles for quasi-steady lift generation with flapping wings. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","animal flight; flapping wing; model; quasi-steady lift; stereo particle image velocimetry; valida; vortex wake","Actuator disks; Actuators; Aerodynamics; Animals; Birds; Computation theory; Flow visualization; Laser safety; Lift; Models; Protective clothing; Stereo image processing; Turbulent flow; Velocimeters; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Wakes; Wings; Aerodynamic forces; Bio-inspired designs; Flapping wing; Flight experiments; Frozen-turbulence hypothesis; Stereo particle image velocimetry; valida; Vortex wakes; Vortex flow",2-s2.0-85012924983

The communication architecture of such systems has a huge impact on the performance and power of the whole system. Architects need to explore many design possibilities by using performance estimation techniques at early stages of design to make design decisions earlier in the design cycle. While software developers need to develop and test applications for the target architecture and gather performance measurements as early in the design cycle as possible. Full system simulation techniques provide accurate performance values but are extremely time consuming. Static analysis techniques are fast but cannot capture the dynamic behavior associated with shared resource contention and arbitration. Moreover, synthetic traffic patterns have been used to analyze the communication architecture however, such patterns are not realistic enough. We propose a statistical based model to predict the dynamic cost of bus arbitration on the performance of a bus architecture. The proposed model uses workload trace of the actual applications and benchmarks to capture the real application traffic behavior. Statistics on the traffic patterns are collected and input to the analytical model which calculates performance values for the communication architecture under consideration. By knowing the performance measures, designers can avoid over and under-design of the communication architecture. This paper builds up on a previously developed performance estimation model. The previous work modeled single and burst bus-transfers, however only one interfering bus master at a time for each blocked bus request was considered. The proposed, improved accuracy model considers multiple interfering masters for each blocked request hence improving the estimation accuracy especially for traffic intensive applications and many PE architectures. Experiments are performed for two different architectures i.e., 4 processing elements connected via a shared bus and 8 processing elements connected via a shared bus. Results show no significant difference in accuracy compared to previously developed model, for low traffic applications SPARSE and ROBOT however notable accuracy improvement for traffic intensive applications. Maximum estimation error is reduced from 1.75% to 0.6% for FPPPP and from maximum 13.91% to 8.8% for FFT on the 4PE architecture. On the 8PE architecture, maximum estimation error is reduced from 11.8% to 2.7% for the FPPP benchmark. Moreover simulation speed-up for the proposed technique over simulation method is reported. © 2017 Information Processing Society of Japan.","Bus contention model; MPSoC shared bus; Multiple bus masters; Performance estimation; Statistical model","Application programs; Buses; Computer architecture; Estimation; Integrated circuit design; Memory architecture; Multiprocessing systems; Software testing; Static analysis; System-on-chip; Systems analysis; Transportation; Bus contentions; Multiple bus masters; Performance estimation; Shared bus; Statistical modeling; Benchmarking",2-s2.0-85012180648

Inferring future agent motion is useful not only for improving tracking accuracy, but also for planning in an interactive motion task. Despite rapid advances in the area of activity forecasting, many state-of-the-art methods are still cumbersome for use in realistic robots. This is due to the requirement of having good semantic scene and map labelling, as well as assumptions made regarding possible goals and types of motion. Many emerging applications require robots with modest sensory and computational ability to robustly perform such activity forecasting in high density and dynamic environments. We address this by combining a novel multi-camera tracking method, efficient multi-resolution representations of state and a standard Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique, to demonstrate performance that is better than the state-of-the-art in the literature. In this framework, the IRL method uses agent trajectories from a distributed tracker and estimates a reward function within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model. This reward function can then be used to estimate the agent's motion in future novel task instances. We present empirical experiments using data gathered in our own lab and external corpora (VIRAT), based on which we find that our algorithm is not only efficiently implementable on a resource constrained platform but is also competitive in terms of accuracy with state-of-the-art alternatives (e.g., up to 20% better than the results reported in [1]). © 2016 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Computational ability; Emerging applications; Empirical experiments; Inverse reinforcement learning; Markov Decision Processes; Multi resolution representation; Multi-camera tracking; State-of-the-art methods; Inverse problems",2-s2.0-85015386109

In the face of defense spending cuts and reductions in military manpower after prolonged campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. is turning once again to developing key technologies to offset its quantitative inferiority in conventional forces. The U.S. has pursued this offset strategy twice before-the first time was in the 1950s with nuclear deterrence countering the numerically superior armament and fighting forces of the Warsaw Pact, and the second time was in the 1970s with DARPA-led efforts to gain technological superiority from enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, precision-guided weapons, stealth technology, and space-based communications and navigation. The current Third Offset Strategy targets many promising innovations including robotics and autonomous systems, miniaturization, big data, and advanced manufacturing. The U.S. military has even created a number of new organizations such as the Army Cyber Institute to explore high-tech innovation and the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental to expedite the transfer of cuttingedge technology to warfighters. Nonetheless, some critics believe the U.S. military is such an unwieldy bureaucracy that it lacks the nimbleness to transform into a force that can win tomorrow's wars-particularly in cyberspace. These critics also note that most of the innovation the U.S. currently seeks come from groundbreaking research-the type of innovation that is expensive to develop. This paper proposes that by adding disruptive innovations-the type of innovation that tends to be cheaper and less technologically complex-into its R&D portfolio mix, the U.S. military will not only strengthen its offset strategy, it will also better protect itself from future threats by reducing the likelihood of strategic surprise.

The research community has been actively developing belief space planning approaches that account for the different sources of uncertainty within planning, recently also considering uncertainty in the environment observed by planning time. We further advance the state of the art by reasoning about future observations of environments that are unknown at planning time. The key idea is to incorporate within the belief indirect multi-robot constraints that correspond to these future observations. Such a formulation facilitates a framework for active collaborative state estimation while operating in unknown environments. In particular, it can be used to identify best robot actions or trajectories among given candidates generated by existing motion planning approaches, or to refine nominal trajectories into locally optimal paths using direct trajectory optimization techniques. We demonstrate our approach in a multi-robot autonomous navigation scenario and consider its applicability for autonomous navigation in unknown obstacle-free and obstacle-populated environments.

A simulation model representing the fundamental mechanics of a wire robot is created. Special focus lies on creating collision-free motion profiles which can be exported to the robot control system. BIM models can be used to set-up the simulation model and to prepare the required input data.

Thus a state of art of the most common middleware is given; ROS, RT-middleware and Orocos are detailed. Strong points and weak points are highlighted to justify the need to develop a new middleware. Based on this statement, the specifications of a new middleware are given with an important issue: develop a middleware that will meet complex research issues and also industrial issues for the future of robotics.

In order to improve the effectiveness of the surgery and release the burden of surgeons, a mandible plastic surgery assisting robot, based on an augmented reality technique, was developed. Material and methods: Augmented reality assists surgeons to realize positioning. Fuzzy control theory was used for the control of the motor. During the process of bone drilling, both the drill bit position and the force were measured by a force sensor which was used to estimate the position of the drilling procedure. Results: An animal experiment was performed to verify the effectiveness of the robotic system. The position error was 1.07 ± 0.27 mm and the angle error was 5.59 ± 3.15°. The results show that the system provides a sufficient accuracy with which a precise drilling procedure can be performed.

Despite the scientific evidence, there is still a strong scepticism against the use of robots in the fields of education and care of people. Here we present a study on the acceptance of robots by experienced practitioners (specialized in the treatment of intellectual disabilities) and university students in psychology and education sciences (as future professionals). The aim is to examine the factors, through the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, that may influence the decision to use a robot as an instrument in the practice. The overall results confirm the applicability of the model in the context of education and care of children, and suggest a positive attitude towards the use of the robot. The comparison highlights some scepticism among the practitioners, who perceive the robot as an expensive and limited tool, while students show a positive perception and a significantly higher willingness to use the robot. From this experience, we formulate the hypothesis that robots may be accepted if more integrated with standard rehabilitation protocols in a way that benefits can outweigh the costs. © 2016, The Author(s).","Practitioners acceptance; Rehabilitation and therapeutic tools; Socially assistive robotics; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)","Decision theory; Education computing; Educational robots; Patient rehabilitation; Robotics; Robots; Students; Assistive robotics; Developmental disability; Intellectual disability; Learning difficulties; Practitioners acceptance; Rehabilitation protocols; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Therapeutic tools; Education",2-s2.0-85011954540

Considering the narrow load space, the limited power resource and the specialized application scenarios of the robot, a heterogeneous computing architecture combining advanced Reduced Instruction-Set Computer (RISC) machine and field programmable gate array was proposed on the basis of Zynq-7000 system on chip. Under the architecture, main parts of the vision algorithms were implemented as software programs running on the advanced RISC machine-Linux subsystem. And customized image accelerators were deployed on the field programmable gate array subsystem to speed up the timeconsuming processes of visual algorithms. Moreover, dynamic reconfiguration was used to switch accelerators online for reducing resource consumption and improving system adaptability. The word length of accelerators was optimized with simulated annealing algorithm to make a compromise between calculation accuracy and resource consumption. Experimental results confirmed the feasibility of the proposed architecture. The single board tracking system was able to provide an image processing rate of up to 89.2 frames per second at the resolution of 320 240, which could meet future demands of our robot in biological monitoring and multi-target tracking. © The Author(s) 2017.","Amphibious spherical robot; Detection and tracking system; Heterogeneous computing; System on chip (SoC)","Controllers; Electric current carrying capacity (cables); Kinematics; Mechanisms; Mobile robots; Robot programming; Robots; Experiment research; Human-carrying walking; Kinematics analysis; Kinematics equation; Parallel leg mechanisms; Parallel mechanisms; Quadruped walking robot; Trajectory-based; Position control",2-s2.0-85027469560

This paper identifies problems related to in-motion data acquisition in a legged robot and evaluates the particular building blocks and concepts applied in contemporary SLAM systems against these problems. The SLAM systems are evaluated on two independent experimental set-ups, applying a well-established methodology and performance metrics. Design/methodology/approach: Four feature-based SLAM architectures are evaluated with respect to their suitability for localization of multi-legged walking robots. The evaluation methodology is based on the computation of the absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE), which are performance metrics well-established in the robotics community. Four sequences of RGB-D frames acquired in two independent experiments using two different six-legged walking robots are used in the evaluation process. Findings: The experiments revealed that the predominant problem characteristics of the legged robots as platforms for SLAM are the abrupt and unpredictable sensor motions, as well as oscillations and vibrations, which corrupt the images captured in-motion. The tested adaptive gait allowed the evaluated SLAM systems to reconstruct proper trajectories. The bundle adjustment-based SLAM systems produced best results, thanks to the use of a map, which enables to establish a large number of constraints for the estimated trajectory. Research limitations/implications: The evaluation was performed using indoor mockups of terrain. Experiments in more natural and challenging environments are envisioned as part of future research. Practical implications: The lack of accurate self-localization methods is considered as one of the most important limitations of walking robots. Thus, the evaluation of the state-of-the-art SLAM methods on legged platforms may be useful for all researchers working on walking robots' autonomy and their use in various applications, such as search, security, agriculture and mining. Originality/value: The main contribution lies in the integration of the state-of-the-art SLAM methods on walking robots and their thorough experimental evaluation using a well-established methodology.

The CAAR tubes are designed to have non- central, offset neutral axes, and they are fixed together at their distal ends. Axial base translations then induce bending in the device. A CAAR segment can be created by selectively cutting asymmetric notches into the profile of two stock tubes, which relocates the neutral bending plane away from the center of the inner lumen. Like conventional concentric-tube robots (CTRs) based on counter-rotating precurved tubes, a CAAR can be made at very small scales and contain a large, open lumen. In contrast with CTRs, the CAAR concept has no elastic stability issues, offers a larger range of motion, and has lower overall stiffness. Furthermore, by varying the position of the neutral axes along the length of each tube, arbitrary, variable curvature actuation modes can be achieved. Precurving the tubes can additionally increase the workspace of a single segment. A single two-tube assembly can be used to create 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot segments, and multiple segments can be deployed concentrically. Both additive manufacturing and traditional machining of stock tubes can create and customize the geometry and performance of the CAAR. In this paper, we explore the CAAR concept, provide kinematic and static models, and experimentally evaluate the model with a both a straight and a precurved CAAR. We conclude with a discussion of the significance and our plans for future work. © 2017 SPIE.","Concentric tube robot; Continuum robot; Flexible robot; Minimally invasive surgery","Bending (forming); Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Machine design; Medical imaging; Robotics; Robots; Surgery; Surgical equipment; Tubes (components); 3 degrees of freedom; Asymmetric notches; Concentric tube; Continuum robot; Flexible robots; Minimally invasive surgery; Overall stiffness; Variable curvature; Robotic surgery",2-s2.0-85020408764

However, this is important for robots of the future, that are expected to operate in harmony with humans. This study proposes a method of estimating emotion using involuntary biological information. To be able to estimate emotion and feeling, a lot of work has been done in the field of artificial intelligence and robot engineering that focuses on human robot communications, especially where it applies to therapy. Generally, estimating emotions of people is based on expressed information such as facial expression, eye-gazing direction and behaviors that are observable by the robot. However, sometimes this information would not be suitable, as some people do not express themselves with observable information. In this case, it is difficult to estimate the emotion even if the analysis technologies are sophisticated. The main idea of our proposal is to use biological information, brain waves and heart rate for estimating the actual emotion of people that is the result or the nonconscious brain. The first experiment shows that our suggested method will outperform the traditional method, for the people who cannot express emotion directly. And, after changing the technique that measures the degree of joy for each scene and compared it with the subjective evaluation, the second experiment was performed. In the second experiment, accuracy did not change, but accuracy differed greatly for different people. In the analysis, we have found that there is a correlation between parts of the personality and the accuracy of results. © 2017 The Authors.

This has opened up the research area of tight human-robot collaboration, where humans and robots work directly interconnected rather than in separate cells. The manufacturing industry is in constant need of developing new products. This means that operators are in constant need of learning new ways of manufacturing. If instructions to operators and interaction between operators and robots can be virtualized this has the potential of being more modifiable and available to the operators. Augmented Reality has previously shown to be effective in giving operators instructions in assembly, but there are still knowledge gaps regarding evaluation and general design guidelines. This paper has two aims. Firstly it aims to assess if demonstrators can be used to simulate human-robot collaboration. Secondly it aims to assess if Augmented Reality-based interfaces can be used to guide test-persons through a previously unknown assembly procedure. The long-term goal of the demonstrator is to function as a test-module for how to efficiently instruct operators collaborating with a robot. Pilot-tests have shown that Augmented Reality instructions can give enough information for untrained workers to perform simple assembly-tasks where parts of the steps are done with direct collaboration with a robot.

For physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) or autonomous manipulation, a high spatial sensor density is required, typically driven by the skin location on the robot. In our previous study, a 4x4 flexible array of strain sensors were printed and packaged onto Kapton sheets and silicone encapsulants. In this paper, we are extending the surface area of the patch to larger arrays with up to 128 tactel elements. To address scalability, sensitivity, and calibration challenges, a novel electronic module, free of the traditional signal conditioning circuitry was created. The electronic design relies on a software-based calibration scheme using high-resolution analog-to-digital converters with internal programmable gain amplifiers. In this paper, we first show the efficacy of the proposed method with a 4x4 skin array using controlled pressure tests, and then perform procedures to evaluate each sensor's characteristics such as dynamic force-to-strain property, repeatability, and signal-to-noise-ratio. In order to handle larger sensor surfaces, an automated force-controlled test cycle was carried out.

The first step is the planning, where the typical problem is to find a geometric path that allows the robot to reach the desired configuration starting from the current position while ensuring obstacle avoidance and enforcing the satisfaction of kinematic constraints. Motion planning lays its grounding on the decidability properties of this classic geometrical problem. Moreover, the traditional approaches that are used to find solutions rely on the global probabilistic certainty of the convergence of path construction stochastically sampled in the configuration-space. The second step of motion generation is the control, where the robot has to perform the planned motion while ensuring the respect of dynamical constraints. Motion control seeks primarily for local controllability or at least the stability of the motion. The basic instances of this problems have long been tackled using local state-space control. However, the typical nonlinearity of the dynamics, together with the non controllability of its linearization, lead more and more solutions to resort to model predictive control. These methods make it possible to predict the outcome of a control strategy in a future horizon and to improve it accordingly, commonly by using numerical optimizations which take into account the safety constraints and efficiency intents. However, since few years, the improvement of computational capabilities and numerical algorithms allows more and more to deal with complex dynamical systems and for longer horizons. This allows then these approaches to untighten the local nature of their applications and progressively start wider explorations of their reachable space. This evolution brings us to the question of the rising overlap between planning and control. Today, most planning problems would take too much time to be solved online with numerical approaches. Does that imply that the generation of motion will theoretically never be free of the necessity of a prior planning? Or on the contrary, is planning only a numerical issue? © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"Constraint satisfaction problems; Dynamical systems; Large scale systems; Model predictive control; Motion planning; Numerical methods; Robots; Complex dynamical systems; Computational capability; Decidability properties; Kinematic constraints; Local controllability; Numerical optimizations; Robot motion planning; Traditional approaches; Robot programming",2-s2.0-85018453187

The goal of this study was to examine neurophysiological responses to movement, communication, and usability with a robot assistant, in comparison to human assistant, in a real-world setting. OSHbot (robot assistants designed by Fellow Robots) were utilized as mobile store clerks to identify and locate merchandise in order to assist customers in finding items within a hardware store. By acquiring neurophysiological measures (electroencephalogram; EEG and electrocardiogram; ECG) of human perception and interaction with robots, we found evidence of Mirror Neuron System (MNS) elicitation and motor imagery processing, which is consistent with other studies examining human-robot interactions. Multiple analyses were conducted to assess differences between human-human interaction and human-robot interaction.

This study aims to establish a steady-state visual evoked potential- (SSVEP-) based passive training protocol on an ankle rehabilitation robot and validate its feasibility. Method. This paper combines SSVEP signals and the virtual reality circumstance through constructing information transmission loops between brains and ankle robots. The robot can judge motion intentions of subjects and trigger the training when subjects pay their attention on one of the four flickering circles. The virtual reality training circumstance provides real-time visual feedback of ankle rotation. Result. All five subjects succeeded in conducting ankle training based on the SSVEP-triggered training strategy following their motion intentions. The lowest success rate is 80%, and the highest one is 100%. The lowest information transfer rate (ITR) is 11.5 bits/min when the biggest one of the robots for this proposed training is set as 24 bits/min. Conclusion.

This paper reports a systematic review of the roll of Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) in elderly wellbeing, based on Cochrane principles. Relevant publications from diverse databases, including healthcare, engineering, and robotics were sourced and screened. Ninety-five studies in forty-two study groups have been synthesized. The reported outcomes have been categorized based on five PERMA constructs (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement) in addition to a sixth category (other effects). The findings indicate that SAR has the potential to enhance elderly wellbeing and decrease the workload of caregivers. Based on concerns that emerged during the quality appraisal process, several significant recommendations are made to improve future research and its applicability. Furthermore, acknowledging individuals’ needs, expectations, and preferences alongside multi-modal interaction and data collection translates into improvement of personalization of care. The development of new approaches such as web-based interfaces and cloud computing are highly recommended as the means of overcoming the constraints of the limited computing and storage capabilities of SAR.

These stakeholders need a principled, generalizable approach to analyze these teams in an operational context to design effective team configurations and human-system interfaces. To meet this need, we have developed a theoretical framework and software simulation that supports analysis to understand and predict the type and number of human-RAS and human-human interaction task demands imposed by the mission and operational context. We extend previous research to include multi-human multi-RAS teams, and emphasize generalizability across a wide range of current and future RAS technologies and military and commercial applications. To ensure that our framework is grounded in mission and operational realities, we validated the framework structure with domain experts. The framework characterizes Operational Context, Team Configuration, and Interaction Task Demands, and defines relationships between these constructs. These relationships are complex, and prediction of Interaction Task Demands quickly becomes difficult even for small teams. Therefore, to support analysis, we developed a software simulation (Beer, Rieth, Tran, & Cook, 2016) that predicts these demands and allows testing and validation of the framework.

Knowing that the child's brain is much more plastic than an adult's, it is reasonable to expect that the clinical gains observed in the adult population during the last two decades would be followed up by even greater gains in children. Nonetheless, and despite the multitude of adult studies, in children we are just getting started: There is scarcity of pediatric robotic rehabilitation devices that are currently available and the number of clinical studies that employ them is also very limited. PURPOSE: We have recently developed the MIT's pedi-Anklebot, an adaptive habilitation robotic device that continuously motivates physically impaired children to do their best by tracking the child's performance and modifying their therapy accordingly. The robot's design is based on a multitude of studies we conducted focusing on the ankle sensorimotor control. In this paper, we briefly describe the device and the adaptive environment we built around the impaired children, present the initial clinical results and discuss how they could steer future trends in pediatric robotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the potential for future interventions to account for the differences in the sensorimotor control of the targeted limbs and their functional use (rhythmic vs. discrete movements and mechanical impedance training) and explore how the new technological advancements such as the augmented reality would employ new knowledge from neuroscience.","Adaptive robotic therapy; Cerebral palsy; Pediatric; Rehabilitation robotics; Robot-aided neurorehabilitation; Robot-aided therapy","Article; childhood disease; computer; human; kinematics; motor dysfunction; neurorehabilitation; pediatric rehabilitation; physical disease; robotic exoskeleton; robotics; sensory dysfunction; software design",2-s2.0-85025822898

Human-machine interaction technology has greatly evolved during the last decades, but manual and speech modalities remain single output channels with their typical constraints imposed by the motor system's information transfer limits. Will braincomputer interfaces (BCIs) and gaze-based control be able to convey human commands or even intentions to machines in the near future? We provide an overview of basic approaches in this new area of applied cognitive research. Objective. We test the hypothesis that the use of communication paradigms and a combination of eye tracking with unobtrusive forms of registering brain activity can improve human-machine interaction. Methods and Results. Three groups of ongoing experiments at the Kurchatov Institute are reported. First, we discuss the communicative nature of human-robot interaction, and approaches to building a more efficient technology. Specifically, ""communicative"" patterns of interaction can be based on joint attention paradigms from developmental psychology, including a mutual ""eye-to-eye"" exchange of looks between human and robot. Further, we provide an example of ""eye mouse"" superiority over the computer mouse, here in emulating the task of selecting a moving robot from a swarm. Finally, we demonstrate a passive, noninvasive BCI that uses EEG correlates of expectation. This may become an important filter to separate intentional gaze dwells from non-intentional ones. Conclusion. The current noninvasive BCIs are not well suited for human-robot interaction, and their performance, when they are employed by healthy users, is critically dependent on the impact of the gaze on selection of spatial locations. The new approaches discussed show a high potential for creating alternative output pathways for the human brain. When support from passive BCIs becomes mature, the hybrid technology of the eye-brain-computer (EBCI) interface will have a chance to enable natural, fluent, and effortless interaction with machines in various fields of application. © Russian Psychological Society, 2017.","Attention; Brain output pathways; Brain-computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalography (EEG); Expectancy wave (E-wave); Eye movements; Eye-brain-computer interface (EBCI); Eye-to-eye contact; Human-robot interaction",,2-s2.0-85031994403

The number of these so-called social robots will increase significantly especially in production spaces forming hybrid human-robot-teams. This expected increasing integration of robots in production environments raises questions on how to design an ideal robot for hybrid collaboration. While most of the research focuses on the technical aspects of human-machine interactions, there is still a strong need for research on the psychological and social aspects that influence the cooperation within hybrid teams. In addition to existing research work, the present research project investigates how the appearance and accuracy of a robot influences the outcomes of a collaborative task (i.e. performance, perceived team functionality and trust) within a Wizard-of-Oz experiment, which was set in a virtual reality setting. One major finding was that the accuracy of the robot influenced the level of trust, faulty robots were perceived as less trustworthy. Furthermore, the appearance of the robots influenced the perceived team functionality and the collaborative performance. Industrial robots led to a higher task reflexivity and performance.

To demonstrate and test for the kind of reasoning required in strategic deception, we use a modified form of the social strategy game ""Mafia"" as a testing ground. In the game, the townsfolk, who can be seen as an uninformed majority, must determine who amongst themselves are members of the informed minority (the Mafia) via social cues before the Mafia eliminate all the townsfolk. First, we talk about how strategic deception applies to Mafia. We then present simplified rules for the game which can be formalized into a logic-based language.

Trust is essential in HRI, as inappropriate levels of trust result in misuse, abuse, or disuse of that robot. Some measures of trust specifically target automation, while others specifically target HRI. Although robots are a type of automation, it is unclear which of the broader factors that define automation are shared by robots. However, measurements of trust in automation and trust in robots should theoretically still yield similar results. We examined an HRI scenario using (1) an automation trust scale and (2) a robotic trust scale. Findings indicated conflicting results coming from these respective trust scales. It may well be that these two trust scales examine separate constructs and are therefore not interchangeable. This discord shows us that future evaluations are required to identify scale appropriate context applications for either automation or robotic operations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Human–robot interaction; Trust; Trust measures; Trust scale","Automation; Human engineering; Robotics; Robots; Measurements of; Robot interactions; Trust; Trust measures; Trust scale; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-84986294214

For intuitive, safe, and reliable physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), sensorized robot skins for tactile measurements of contact are necessary. In a previous study, we presented skins consisting of strain gauge arrays encased in silicone encapsulants. Although these structures could measure normal forces applied directly onto the sensing elements, they also exhibited blind spots and response asymmetry to certain loading patterns. This study presents a parametric investigation of piezoresistive polymeric strain gauge that exhibits a symmetric omniaxial response thanks to its novel star-shaped structure. This strain gauge relies on the use of gold micro-patterned star-shaped structures with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS which is a flexible polymer with piezoresistive properties. In this paper, the sensor is first modeled and comprehensively analyzed in the finite-element simulation environment COMSOL. Simulations include stress-strain loading for a variety of structure parameters such as gauge lengths, widths, and spacing, as well as multiple load locations relative to the gauge. Subsequently, sensors with optimized configurations obtained through simulations were fabricated using cleanroom photolithographic and spin-coating processes, and then experimentally tested. Results show a trend-wise agreement between experiments and simulations. © 2017 SPIE.","COMSOL; Finite-element analysis; PEDOT:PSS; PHRI; Piezoresistive; Robot skin; Strain gauge","Conducting polymers; Finite element method; Physiology; Polymers; Robots; Silicones; Stars; Strain gages; Stress analysis; COMSOL; PEDOT:PSS; PHRI; Piezo-resistive; Robot skin; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85025132292

This study explored perspectives of older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers on robots that provide stepwise prompting to complete activities in the home. Methods: Ten dyads participated: Older adults with mild-to-moderate AD and difficulty completing activity steps, and their family caregivers. Older adults were prompted by a tele-operated robot to wash their hands in the bathroom and make a cup of tea in the kitchen. Caregivers observed interactions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted individually. Transcribed interviews were thematically analyzed. Results: Three themes summarized responses to robot interactions: contemplating a future with assistive robots, considering opportunities with assistive robots, and reflecting on implications for social relationships. Older adults expressed opportunities for robots to help in daily activities, were open to the idea of robotic assistance, but did not want a robot. Caregivers identified numerous opportunities and were more open to robots. Several wanted a robot, if available. Positive consequences of robots in caregiving scenarios could include decreased frustration, stress, and relationship strain, and increased social interaction via the robot. A negative consequence could be decreased interaction with caregivers. Conclusions: Few studies have investigated in-depth perspectives of older adults with dementia and their caregivers following direct interaction with an assistive prompting robot.

(2) Are there any differences between the surgical specialties in robot training and robot use? (3) What is their opinion about multidisciplinary basic skills training? Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to 91 robot professionals in The Netherlands. The questionnaire contained 21 multiple-choice questions focusing on demographics, received robot training, and their opinion on basic skills training in robotic surgery. Results: The response rate was 62 % (n = 56): 13 general surgeons, 16 gynecologists, and 27 urologists. The urologists performed significantly more robotic procedures than surgeons and gynecologists.

So far, many different structural designs and materials had been created to build a flexible and compliant robot. Here, we demonstrate a series of highly deformable locomotions overcoming sharp corner or small gap via EGaIn liquid metal materials, which we dubbed “liquid metal worm.” The worm can be controlled by exterior voltages and can veer in a loop channel. Besides, it can narrow and fit through a highly confined gap five times thinner than its own size and return to its original shape and movability. The size of the worm can also be adjusted with different volumes of liquid metal, which varies from ∼0.1 mL to ∼1 mL. In addition, other solid functional structures or modified particles can be mounted according to previous research. Several phenomena regarding reconfigurational reversing of the moving direction due to metal droplet morphology were disclosed with the interpreted mechanism.

With the gaits, AmphiHex-I will have a strong locomotion ability in an amphibious environment, which is motivated by a novel public health application to detect the amphibious snail, Oncomelania hupensis, the snail intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, as an amphibious robot-based tool for schistosomiasis surveillance and response in the future. Design/methodology/approach - First, the basis neural network was built by adopting six Hopf nonlinear oscillators which corresponded to six legs. Then, the correlation between the self-excited harmonic output signals generated from CPGs and various gaits was established. In view of requirements on its field application, the authors added a telecontrol system and an on-board battery to support the real-life remote control and a high-definition camera and a global positioning system module to acquire images and position information. Finally, the authors conducted the testing experiments on several tasks, e.g. detecting the distribution of Oncomelania hupensis snails. Findings - The results demonstrate that the CPG is effective in controlling the robot's diversified locomotion gaits. In addition, the robot is capable of fulfilling several testing tasks in the experiments. Originality/value - The research provides a method based on CPG to control a hexapod robot with multiple motion patterns, which can effectively overcome the difficulty of motion control simply by changing certain mathematical parameters of a nonlinear equation, such as frequency, phase difference and offset angle, so as to realize the gait transitions.

As machine learning's use expands across all facets of society, anxiety has emerged about the intrusion of algorithmic machines into facets of life previously dependent on human judgment. Alarm bells sounding over the diffusion of artificial intelligence throughout the private sector only portend greater anxiety about digital robots replacing humans in the governmental sphere. A few administrative agencies have already begun to adopt this technology, while others have clear potential in the near term to use algorithms to shape official decisions over both rulemaking and adjudication. It is no longer fanciful to envision a future in which government agencies could effectively make law by robot, a prospect that understandably conjures up dystopian images of individuals surrendering their liberty to the control of computerized overlords. Should society be alarmed by governmental use of machine-learning applications? We examine this question by considering whether the use of robotic decision tools by government agencies can pass muster under core, time-honored doctrines of administrative and constitutional law. At first glance, the idea of algorithmic regulation might appear to offend one or more traditional doctrines, such as the nondelegation doctrine, procedural due process, equal protection, or principles of reason-giving and transparency. We conclude, however, that when machine-learning technology is properly understood, its use by government agencies can comfortably fit within these conventional legal parameters. We recognize, of course, that the legality of regulation by robot is only one criterion by which its use should be assessed. Agencies should not apply algorithms cavalierly, even if doing so might not run afoul of the law; in some cases, safeguards may be needed for machine learning to satisfy broader, good-governance aspirations. Yet, in contrast with the emerging alarmism, we resist any categorical dismissal of a future administrative state in which algorithmic automation guides, and even at times makes, key decisions. Instead, we urge that governmental reliance on machine learning should be approached with measured optimism about the potential benefits such technology can offer society by making government smarter and its decisions more efficient and just.",,,2-s2.0-85025587354

Inasmuch as future wheel-terrain interactions are unpredictable and unobservable, high performance autonomous vehicles must ultimately learn the terrain by feel and extrapolate, just as humans do. We present an approach to the automatic calibration of dynamic models of arbitrary wheeled mobile robots on arbitrary terrain. Inputs beyond our control (disturbances) are assumed to be responsible for observed differences between what the vehicle was initially predicted to do and what it was subsequently observed to do. In departure from much previous work, and in order to directly support adaptive and predictive controllers, we concentrate on the problem of predicting candidate trajectories rather than measuring the current slip. The approach linearizes the nominal vehicle model and then calibrates the perturbative dynamics to explain the observed prediction residuals. Both systematic and stochastic disturbances are used, and we model these disturbances as functions over the terrain, the velocities, and the applied inertial and gravitational forces. In this way, we produce a model which can be used to predict behavior across all of state space for arbitrary terrain geometry. Results demonstrate that the approach converges quickly and produces marked improvements in the prediction of trajectories for multiple vehicle classes throughout the performance envelope of the platform, including during aggressive maneuvering. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",,"Forecasting; Gravitation; Landforms; Maneuverability; Mobile robots; Robotics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vehicles; Wheels; Automatic calibration; Autonomous Vehicles; Candidate trajectories; Gravitational forces; Predictive controller; Stochastic disturbances; Terrain geometry; Wheeled mobile robot; Vehicle performance",2-s2.0-84984843649

Multifingered hand contacts the object at some arbitrary locations during the object manipulation and applies the gripping force to hold and manipulate the object without slip. It is desirable to use the optimum gripping force during the grasp manipulation for two reasons; firstly, to prevent the object from damages, secondly, to decrease the cost of the manipulation. With these objectives in mind, a threefingered soft hand is designed, and gripping force and stability analysis are done experimentally. DC motors are used to actuate the joints of fingers and force sensors are used to measure the internal force at contact points. PID controller is used to controlling the internal force exerted at the contact points, and the control parameters are tweaked until a satisfactory response is achieved. The minimum gripping force required to handle the object with / without external disturbances is measured. The position variables and frictional coefficients are evaluated from the contact forces at the contact points.

This paper serves to illustrate the application of M and S to UAxS development and highlight initiatives made by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) M and S Centre of Excellence (CoE) to facilitate interoperability. The NATO M and S CoE collaborates with other NATO and Nations bodies in order to develop UAxS projects such as the Allied Command for Transformation Counter Unmanned Autonomous Systems (CUAxS) project or the work of Science and Technology Organization (STO) panels.

Conventional approaches to acoustic tracking acquire time-of-arrival-difference signals from multi-microphone arrays and localise the acoustic signal using Kalman or particle filtering, generalised cross-correlation or steered response power techniques. The authors have previously developed a biologically-inspired mechanism that utilises two microphones to reactively track an acoustic signal in motion. The mechanism leverages the directional response of an mathematical model of the lizard peripheral auditory system to extract information regarding sound direction. This information is utilised by a neural machinery to learn the acoustic signal's velocity through fast and unsupervised correlation-based learning adapted from differential Hebbian learning. This approach has previously been validated in simulation and via robotic trials to track a continuous pure tone acoustic signal with a semi-circular motion trajectory and a constant but unknown angular velocity. The neural machinery has been shown to be able to learn different target angular velocities in independent trials. Here we extend our previous work by demonstrating that an identical instance of the mechanism can be used to successfully predict the future spatial location of an acoustic signal with an identical semi-circular motion trajectory and a constant but unknown angular velocity.

In autonomous or composite semi-autonomous exploration of planetary land surfaces, rover localization is such an issue. The rovers of these missions (e.g., the MER and MSL) navigate relatively to their landing spot, ignoring their exact position on the coordinate system defined for the celestial body they explore. However, future advanced missions, like the Mars Sample Return, will require the localization of rovers on a global frame rather than the arbitrarily defined landing frame. In this paper we attempt to retrieve the absolute rover's location by identifying matching Regions of Interest (ROIs) between orbital and land images. In particular, we propose a system comprising two parts, an offline and an onboard one, which functions as follows: in advance of the mission a Global ROI Network (GN) is built offline by investigating the satellite images near the predicted touchdown ellipse, while during the mission a Local ROI Network (LN) is constructed counting on the images acquired by the vision system of the rover along its traverse. The last procedure relies on the accurate VO-based relative rover localization. The LN is then paired with the GN through a modified 2D DARCES algorithm. The system has been assessed on real data collected by the ESA at the Atacama desert. The results demonstrate the system's potential to perform absolute localization, on condition that the area includes discriminative ROIs.

This method does not require feedbacks from force, electromyography (EMG) or acceleration signals or even their estimated values. Design/methodology/approach: The presented controller uses feedbacks from position and velocity of the output link of series elastic actuators (SEAs) to increase the apparent integral admittance of the assisted systems. Optimal controller coefficients are obtained by maximizing the assistance ratio subjected to constraints of stability, coupled stability and a newly defined comfort measure. Findings: The results confirm the effectiveness of using the inherent properties of SEAs for removing the need for extra controversial sensors in assistive control of 1 degree of freedom (1-DOF) SEA powered exoskeletons. The results also clearly indicate the successful performance of the OFAC method in reducing the external forces required for moving the assisted systems. Practical implications: As the provided experiments indicate, the proposed method can be easily applied to single DOF compliantly actuated exoskeletons to provide a more reliable assistance with lower costs. This is achieved by removing the need for extra controversial sensors. Originality/value: This paper proposes a novel assistive controller for SEA-powered exoskeletons with a simple model-free structure and independent of any information about interaction forces and future paths of the system. It also removes the requirement for the extra sensors and transforms the assistive control of the compliantly actuated systems into a simpler problem of position control of the SEA motor. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Compliant mechanisms; Exoskeletons; Integral admittance shaping; Output feedback assistive control; Rehabilitation robots; Series elastic actuators","Actuators; Compliance control; Compliant mechanisms; Controllers; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electromyography; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Mechanisms; Position control; 1 Degree of freedom; Acceleration signals; Assistive; Design/methodology/approach; Integral admittance shaping; Interaction forces; Rehabilitation robot; Series elastic actuators; Feedback",2-s2.0-85019553277

Materials and Methods: A non-systematic literature review was performed using PubMed/Medline search electronic engines. Existing patents for robotic devices were researched using the Google search engine. Findings were also critically analysed taking into account the personal experience of the authors. Results: The relevant patents for the first generation of the da Vinci platform will expire in 2019. New robotic systems are coming onto the stage. These can be classified according to type of console, arrangement of robotic arms, handles and instruments, and other specific features (haptic feedback, eye-tracking). The Telelap ALF-X robot uses an open console with eye-tracking, laparoscopy-like handles with haptic feedback, and arms mounted on separate carts; first clinical trials with this system were reported in 2016. The Medtronic robot provides an open console using three-dimensional high-definition video technology and three arms. The Avatera robot features a closed console with microscope-like oculars, four arms arranged on one cart, and 5-mm instruments with six degrees of freedom. The REVO-I consists of an open console and a four-arm arrangement on one cart; the first experiments with this system were published in 2016. Medicaroid uses a semi-open console and three robot arms attached to the operating table. Clinical trials of the SP 1098-platform using the da Vinci Xi for console-based single-port surgery were reported in 2015. The SPORT robot has been tested in animal experiments for single-port surgery. The SurgiBot represents a bedside solution for single-port surgery providing flexible tube-guided instruments. The Avicenna Roboflex has been developed for robotic flexible ureteroscopy, with promising early clinical results. Conclusions: Several console-based robots for laparoscopic multi- and single-port surgery are expected to come to market within the next 5 years. Future developments in the field of robotic surgery are likely to focus on the specific features of robotic arms, instruments, console, and video technology. The high technical standards of four da Vinci generations have set a high bar for upcoming devices. Ultimately, the implementation of these upcoming systems will depend on their clinical applicability and costs. How these technical developments will facilitate surgery and whether their use will translate into better outcomes for our patients remains to be determined. © 2017 BJU International.","Laparoscopy; Patents; Robotics; Single-port surgery; Video technology",,2-s2.0-85018621348

As such, the ultimate expression of machine technologies in nursing turns out to be autonomous robots (ARs) with future potentials of functions comparable to human persons. While theory-based nursing practice is essential to nursing care practice, quality human care, particularly with technologies assuming indispensable practice process mechanisms is critical. Some practice-based questions informing ARs and human person engagements in nursing care practice include, “Will ARs which are imbued with artificial intelligence replace nurses in their practice?” “What contributions to quality human health care will autonomous and artificially intelligent robots provide?” While these questions may reflect far-reaching ramifications of technologies in health care, it must also be acknowledged that these technologies are fundamental to the delivery of quality human health care now, and in the future. © 2017, University of Tokushima.

In this work, based on the kinematics and dynamics of two representative locomotion modes (i.e., worm-like crawling and snake-like slithering), we propose a broad set of innovative designs for soft mobile robots through simple mechanical principles. Inspired by and going beyond the existing biological systems, these designs include 1-D (dimensional), 2-D, and 3-D robotic locomotion patterns enabled by the simple actuation of continuous beams. We report herein over 20 locomotion modes achieving various locomotion functions, including crawling, rising, running, creeping, squirming, slithering, swimming, jumping, turning, turning over, helix rolling, wheeling, etc. Some are able to reach high speed, high efficiency, and overcome obstacles. All these locomotion strategies and functions can be integrated into a simple beam model. The proposed simple and robust models are adaptive for severe and complex environments.

Over the past decade, robot-assisted laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation (RALUR) has become a viable minimally invasive surgical option for pediatric vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). However, higher-thanexpected complication rates and suboptimal reflux resolution rates at some centers have also been reported. The heterogeneity of surgical outcomes may arise from the inherent and underestimated complexity of the RALUR procedure that may justify its reclassification as a complex reconstructive procedure and especially for robotic surgeons early in their learning curve. Currently, no consensus exists on the role of RALUR for the surgical management of VUR. High success rates and low major complication rates are the expected norm for the current gold standard surgical option of open ureteral reimplantation. Similar to how robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has gradually replaced open surgery as the most utilized option for prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients, RALUR may become a higher utilized surgical option in children with VUR if the adoption of standardized surgical techniques that have been associated with optimal outcomes can be adopted during the second decade of RALUR. A future standard of RALUR for children with VUR whose parents seek a minimally invasive surgical option can arise if widespread achievement of high success rates and low major complication rates can be obtained, similar to the replacement of open surgery with robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostectomy as the new strandard for men with prostate cancer. © The Korean Urological Association, 2017.","Child; Laparoscopy; Robotics; Urologic surgical procedures; Vesico-ureteral reflux","ergonomics; human; outcome assessment; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; pyeloplasty; reimplantation; Review; robot assisted surgery; ureter obstruction; ureteral reimplantation; urine retention; vesicoureteral reflux",2-s2.0-85009971392

While robotic procedures in adults continue to struggle to prove measurable advantages compared with open or classical laparoscopic ones, the use of the robotic platform (RP) in pediatric urology is steadily increasing. Objective: To review the contemporary literature regarding the use of robotic-assisted (RA) urologic interventions in children. Evidence acquisition: A nonsystematic review of the literature was conducted through PubMed database between 2002 and 2017, with an emphasis on large series. Evidence synthesis: A few major challenges must be considered before using the RP in children: anesthesia, placement of trocars, and technical difficulties related to small space. To date, only the robot-assisted pyeloplasty is recognized as safe and efficient with an equivalent outcome compared to the open or classical laparoscopy; this was supported by large multicentric studies, which are not available for most of the other procedures. Conclusions: RA procedure in children has been proven safe and effective. Still in its infancy, further data over time is likely to prove different RA procedures to be equivalent to open or laparoscopy in terms of outcome. Patient summary: The advent of the robotic platform means an evolution towards minimizing surgical trauma for the child. Currently, the available platforms designed for adults are adapted to work in children. However, it might be expected in the future that new technologies will improve the technical possibilities to improve the robotic platform for minimally invasive surgery in children. To date, a few applications are considered safe and efficient (in experienced hands), considering that the team has to be aware of some challenges to overcome regarding anesthesia, material, and technique adaptation to the patient. The most accepted robotic applications in children comprises of the robot-assisted pyeloplasty, hemi-nephrectomy, and ureteric reimplantation. Robot-assisted procedures in children have been proven safe and effective. Still in its infancy, further data over time is likely to prove different robot-assisted procedures to be equivalent in term of outcomes to open or laparoscopy. © 2017 European Association of Urology.","Minimally invasive surgery; Pediatric urology; Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery",,2-s2.0-85031765086

This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic value of SLN in the assessment of lymph nodal involvement in endometrial cancer. Forty-four studies including 2,236 cases were identified. The pooled overall detection rate was 83% (95% CI: 80-86%). The pooled sensitivity was 91% (95% CI: 87-95%). The bilateral pelvic node detection rate was 56% (95% CI: 48-64%). Use of indocyanine green (ICG) increased the overall detection rate to 93% (95% CI: 89-96%) and robotic-assisted surgery also increased the overall detection rate to 86% (95% CI: 79-93%). In summary, our meta-analysis provides strong evidence that sentinel node mapping is an accurate and feasible method that performs well diagnostically for the assessment of lymph nodal involvement in endometrial cancer. Cervical injection, robot-assisted surgery, as well as using ICG, optimized the sensitivity and detection rate of the technique.

This privileging of technology and its engagement with gendered labor are examined in Wei Yahua’s short story, “Conjugal Happiness in the Arms of Morpheus,” which uses the feminine performativity of a robot wife to engage with the intertwined role of affective labor and the legal status of objects. Such a performance decenters the human subject while simultaneously subjugating the laboring technological materials, such that Lili—the robot wife in question—is only capable of acquiring legal subjecthood through her appeal to a law that binds human actors. The historical context in which this story was written is as important an artifact as the language it uses and the subject matter it treats, raising the specter of a possible ethics of consciousness unconnected to humanistic social mores at a time when technology was being touted as the way towards a collective future emancipated from labor as a whole. In 1980s China, labor and technology were both equally privileged as sites of socialist revolution, with a restructuring of the imaginaries of both free and controlled labor. By raising the question of differential relationships in a supposedly egalitarian society through characters that explore their various relationships to artificial life, “Conjugal Happiness in the Arms of Morpheus” offers a critical look into what kinds of labor (and laboring bodies) are replaceable and which are privileged—and, in doing so, directly critiques the legal framework regarding women in the country, as well as how a subject is defined in the first place. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Affective labor; Artificial intelligence; Chinese science fiction; Gender theory and performance; Roboethics","Artificial intelligence; Robots; Artificial Life; Cultural value; Gender theory and performance; Legal frameworks; Performativity; Roboethics; Science fictions; Subject matters; Laws and legislation",2-s2.0-85018662602

The ability to collaborate is also a key challenge for today's robotics, which could benefit from the design of computational models supporting the understanding of social intelligence for the future of humanrobot interaction. Our research focuses on these topics from the perspective of computational vision. In particular we aim at understanding how social intelligence develops in presence of the very limited sensory-motor skills and prior knowledge common to babies. As a starting point we consider the natural predisposition of newborns to notice potential interacting partners in their surroundings, which is manifested by a preference for biological motion over other types of motion. To model this skill, we propose a video-based computational method for biological motion detection inspired by the Two-Thirds Power Law, a well-known invariant of human movements. In particular, we address the problem by recruiting machine learning framework, leveraging a binary classification to discriminate biological from non-biological stimuli from rather coarse motion models extracted from video measurements. After evaluating the performance of the method and its generalization power to complex scenarios in an offline test, the method is engineered to work online on a robot, the humanoid iCub. The integration with the attentional module of the robot enables it to direct its gaze toward human activity in the scene. We posit that the possibility for a robotic system to orient the attention toward potential interacting agents, as a human infant would, represents one of the first stages of social intelligence, on top of which more complex skills, as action and intention understanding, could emerge. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

UAVs have been used to tackle critical tasks in a more efficient and safer way than ground robots in many situations. Since UAVs are often operating in complex environments such as forest, mountain, urban area, etc., in order to protect surrounding properties and people, a model based dynamic geofence system UAV control is studied. To ensure that UAV stays inside the operating area and protect surroundings, an advanced safety system featured with dynamic soft geofence, fixed hard geofence. Dynamic soft geofence is developed in the outer loop controller and used to calculate the distance between future possible position of the UAV to the hard geofence boundary after a fixed time duration. Dynamic soft geofence is generated based on current location and the dynamics of the UAV. A model predictive control (MPC) approach is applied to design a controller for braking without breaching the hard geofence boundary. A simulator is created to simulate and visualize the quadcopter control mechanisms as well as path flying performance with the implemented geofence system.

The consequence is children with poor academic performance and discipline that has negative impact on their future. Current treatment for ADD uses powerful psycho-stimulant drugs, to reduce aggression and enhance concentration. However, there are always risk factors and adverse effects with these drugs. Moreover, drugs do not alter the dysfunctional condition. Forefront research in biomedical engineering unveils neurofeedback, which presents an exciting alternative approach to neural related disorders. Our ultimate goal is to develop a neurofeedback system to enable anyone with attention deficit to practice regulating their brain to reach an attentive state of mind, with reduced dependency on drug related intervention. Relying on neuroplasticity, neurofeedback focuses on the training of brain through activities to circumvent the dysfunctional condition. In this paper, such a system has been developed and applied on normal healthy subjects, to establish the protocol on EEG subband and electrode placement as well as system functional testing. It consists of a wireless EEG acquisition module, a feature extraction module, an IoT database module, an Intel Edison microcontroller board and a feedback activity center, the humanoid robot.

HAL training effects on walking speed and capacity have not been clarified in subacute stroke. OBJECTIVES: To determine improvement in walking ability by HAL and the most effective improvement measure for use in future large-scale trials. METHODS: Sixteen first-ever hemiplegic stroke patients completed at least 20 sessions over 5 weeks. Per session, the experimental group received no more than 20min of gait training with HAL (HT) and 40min of conventional physiotherapy, whereas the control group received at least 60min of conventional physiotherapy. Primary outcome was maximum walking speed (MWS). RESULTS: The change in MWS from baseline at week 5 was 11.6±10.6m/min (HAL group) and 2.2±4.1m/min (control group) (adjusted mean difference=9.24m/min, 95 confidence interval 0.48-18.01, P=0.040). In HAL subjects there were significant increases in Self-selected walking speed (SWS; a secondary outcome) and in step length (a secondary outcome) at MWS and SWS compared with controls.

For the hierarchical relationship we suggest three delegation modes (team-, intent-, and task-based). The agent in heterarchical relationship, i.e. the assistant system, adapts the operator-assistant system cooperation and the guidance of UCAVs according to the named delegation modes. The adaptation is shaped by the assessment of the operator’s mental state and external situation features. Thereby, we aim at balancing the operator’s activity and work demands.

Background: As designers, human factor experts, and healthcare professionals continue to work to integrate assistive human–robot technologies in healthcare, it is imperative to understand how the technology affects patient care from clinicians’ perspectives. Method: Fourteen clinical H-SMEs rated a subset of conceptual ART design ideas; participated in the iterative design process of ART; and evaluated a final cardboard prototype, the rehabilitation hospital’s current over-the-bed table (OBT), an ART built with true materials, and two therapy surface prototypes. Four RD-SMEs conducted a heuristic evaluation on the ART built with true materials. Data were analyzed by frequency and content analysis.

Methods: Fluid was collected from the pancreas, common bile duct, and proximal jejunum from 50 PD patients. Postoperative fecal samples were also collected. The microbial burden within samples was quantified with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. Data from fecal samples were compared with publicly available data obtained from volunteers. Results: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of bacteria in all sample types, including pancreatic fluid. Relative to samples from the American Gut Project, fecal samples from PD patients were enriched with Klebsiella and Bacteroides and were depleted of anaerobic taxa (eg, Roseburia and Faecalibacterium). Similar patterns were observed within PD pancreas, bile, and jejunal samples. Postoperative fecal samples from patients with a pancreatic fistula contained increased abundance of Klebsiella and decreased abundance of commensal anaerobes, for example, Ruminococcus.

The present article outlines primary operative techniques for RALUR, summarizes the current literature with respect to surgical outcomes and costs, and discusses early applications of RALUR to complex and reoperative cases. Recent findings: Intravesical and extravesical techniques for RALUR have been described. Published outcomes vary with respect to operational definitions of surgical success and reporting of complications. Several studies have directly compared RALUR and open reimplant, suggesting equivalent efficacy and safety. Recent noncomparative studies have reported lower VUR resolution rates and higher complication rates for RALUR, particularly in bilateral cases. The application of RALUR to reoperative surgery and cases requiring tapering and dismemberment is under very early investigation. RALUR is consistently associated with lower postoperative analgesic requirements and decreased hospital stay, but longer operative times and higher costs compared to open reimplant. Summary: Published outcomes after RALUR show mixed results that, on average, may be inferior to open reimplant. Future investigations should seek to identify patient-related and intraoperative factors associated with successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Here we review computational models of use-dependent neuromotor recovery and their implications for treatment. Some of these models focus on the ""central"" level (cortical and subcortical), in terms of synaptic changes and/or structural rewiring mechanisms such as axonal outgrowth. Other models address learning or re-learning of functional behaviors. Only few models address both levels of description. Most models provide qualitative predictions on the recovery process. Very few models provide quantitative predictions on an individual patient basis.

Methods: We queried our institutional RPN database for consecutive patients treated between 2011 and 2015. The primary outcome was poor discharge quality, defined as length of stay >3 days and/or unplanned readmission. The association between patient, disease, and provider factors and overall discharge quality was assessed using univariate and multivariable analyses. Results: Of 791 cases, 219 (27.7 %) had poor discharge quality. On univariate analysis, factors associated with poor discharge quality were older age (p < .01), black race (p = .01), social insurance (p < .01), higher ASA score (p < .01), chronic kidney disease (p < .01), increased tumor size (p < .01), and higher tumor complexity (p = .01). Surgeon case volume did not predict discharge quality (p = .63). After adjustment for covariates on multivariable analysis, race (p = .01), ASA (p = .02), CKD (p < .01), tumor size (p = .02), and tumor complexity (p = .03) still predicted poor discharge quality. In particular, the odds of poor discharge quality were highest in the setting of CKD (OR 2.62, 95 % CI 1.72–4.01), black race (OR 2.17, 95 % CI 1.32–3.57), and higher ASA (OR 1.49, 95 % CI 1.07–2.08). Conclusions: Non-modifiable patient and disease factors predict poor discharge quality after RPN. Risk adjustment for these factors will be important for determining future reimbursement for RPN providers. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Length of stay; Nephrectomy; Patient discharge; Patient readmission; Robotic surgical procedures","adult; age distribution; aged; American Society of Anesthesiologists score; Article; Black person; bleeding; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; controlled study; discharge quality; ethnic difference; factual database; female; gastrointestinal symptom; general aspects of disease; health care quality; hematuria; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; partial nephrectomy; predictive value; risk assessment; robot assisted surgery; robotic partial nephrectomy; scoring system; social insurance; tumor complexity; tumor volume; urine incontinence; urinoma; African American; age; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Caucasian; complication; health status indicator; hospital readmission; Kidney Neoplasms; length of stay; medicaid; medicare; middle aged; nephrectomy; pathology; procedures; risk factor; robotic surgical procedure; United States; African Americans; Age Factors; Aged; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Length of Stay; Male; Medicaid; Medicare; Middle Aged; Nephrectomy; Patient Readmission; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Tumor Burden; United States",2-s2.0-84991373447

Robotics engineers are routinely required to choose the number of DOF in a robot in the early design stages, potentially limiting the robot's future uses. We theoretically motivate the definition of ""mechanical versatility"" as the ability of a mechanical system to express distinct static configurations and switch among them rapidly. Requiring versatility and assuming that the systems are power and force limited, and must furthermore resist finite energy environmental disturbances to their state, we show that such multiuse 1 mechanical systems have a lower bound on the number of DOF they require. For bio-mechanics, this suggests which organs and organisms will be driven to become more complex mechanically by indicating domains where higher DOF systems would intrinsically out-compete lower DOF systems. © 2017 The Authors.","biomechanics; robotics; versatility","Biomechanics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electric drives; Machine design; Robotics; Early design stages; Environmental disturbances; Finite energy; Human hands; Lower bounds; Mechanical systems; versatility; Mechanics",2-s2.0-85029758997

The potential for distributed coordination, as observed in nature in many different animal species, has caused an increased interest in collective behaviour research in recent years because of its applicability to a broad spectrum of technical systems requiring robust multi-agent control. One of the main problems is understanding the mechanisms driving the emergence of collective behaviour of social animals. With the aim of deepening the knowledge in this field, we have designed a multi-robot system capable of interacting with honeybees within an experimental arena. The final product, stationary autonomous robot units, designed by specificaly considering the physical, sensorimotor and behavioral characteristics of the honeybees (lat. Apis mallifera), are equipped with sensing, actuating, computation, and communication capabilities that enable the measurement of relevant environmental states, such as honeybee presence, and adequate response to the measurements by generating heat, vibration and airflow. The coordination among robots in the developed system is established using distributed controllers. The cooperation between the two different types of collective systems is realized by means of a consensus algorithm, enabling the honeybees and the robots to achieve a common objective.

This has resulted in the expansion of the field of robotics for rehabilitation. Studies in patients with stroke-related upper-limb paresis have shown that robotic rehabilitation can improve motor capacity. However, few other applications have been evaluated (e.g. tremor, peripheral nerve injuries or other neurological diseases). PURPOSE: This paper presents an overview of the current use of upper limb robotic systems for neurorehabilitation, and highlights the rationale behind their use for the assessment and treatment of common neurological disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation robots are little integrated in clinical practice, except after stroke. Although few studies have been carried out to evaluate their effectiveness, evidence from the neurosciences and indications from pilot studies suggests that upper limb robotic rehabilitation can be applied safely in various other neurological conditions. Rehabilitation robots provide an intensity, quality and dose of treatment that exceeds therapist-mediated rehabilitation. Moreover, the use of force fields, multi-sensory environments, feedback etc. renders such rehabilitation engaging and motivating. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation robots in neurological pathologies other than stroke.","Hemiparesis; Motor learning; Multiple sclerosis; Neglect; Neurorehabilitation; Parkinson disease; Robotics; Spinal cord injury; Stroke","cerebrovascular accident; clinical practice; feedback system; human; multiple sclerosis; nerve cell plasticity; neurorehabilitation; Parkinson disease; peripheral nerve injury; peripheral neuropathy; pilot study; Review; robotics; spinal cord injury; stroke rehabilitation; upper limb",2-s2.0-85025813697

Although surgery history dates back from more than 2000 years, the last two decades of the twentieth century have shown a marked revolution in medicine, due to all the changes it has caused in the way of doing, teaching and practicing surgery. Objective: To present general and current aspects of robotics applied to medicine and especially to surgery, as well as the impact of robotic surgery in medical teaching. Methods: A systematic review was carried out based on the consultation of indexed scientific articles related to the topic. The sources of information consulted were PubMed, Ebsco and Scielo. The information was analyzed and chosen in correspondence with the topic and objectives. Results: Robotic surgery has evolved into a separate field with enormous potential for its present and future development. The robots used for this type of surgeries have had a great acceptance among the scientific community, for the significant advantages, such as the possibility to arrive at body areas a human could not arrive and act on. Conclusions: This review shows that robotic technology is able to offer patients satisfactory outcomes and adequate treatment. This guarantees a much lower intervention risk and an optimum recovery in the shortest possible time, creating very effective programs for their learning. © 2017, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

Here we report a partially transparent, highly flexible and stretchable pressure sensor array (8 x 8 sensor cells) based on piezoresistive principle. The AgNWs/PDMS conductors are used as stretchable interconnects and electrodes, and the pressure-sensitive rubber (PSR) serves as the sensing material. Our e-skin operating at 5 V, is responsive to the pressure with a high repeating frequency (3 Hz) or irregular profile, and can be stretched up to 30%. Not only can it cover a PDMS cylinder (20 mm in diameter), it can also conform to the varied three-dimensional surface of a cylinder during the bending process. The e-skin can detect the contact pressure even under the stretched state.

We present an approach to grounding natural language utterances in the context of factual information gathered through natural-language interactions and past visual observations. A probabilistic model estimates, from a natural language utterance, the objects, relations, and actions that the utterance refers to, the objectives for future robotic actions it implies, and generates a plan to execute those actions while updating a state representation to include newly acquired knowledge from the visual-linguistic context. Grounding a command necessitates a representation for past observations and interactions; however, maintaining the full context consisting of all possible observed objects, attributes, spatial relations, actions, etc., over time is intractable. Instead, our model, Temporal Grounding Graphs, maintains a learned state representation for a belief over factual groundings, those derived from natural-language interactions, and lazily infers new groundings from visual observations using the context implied by the utterance. This work significantly expands the range of language that a robot can understand by incorporating factual knowledge and observations of its workspace in its inference about the meaning and grounding of natural-language utterances.",,"Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Speech recognition; Factual information; Language understanding; Natural language interaction; Natural languages; Probabilistic modeling; Spatial relations; State representation; Visual observations; Visual languages",2-s2.0-85031936211

Physico-chemical characterizations such as X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and elemental mapping were used to understand the crystallinity, bonding nature, morphology and distribution of the ZnO/CuSA2 coatings. Superhydrophobic nature of the bare CuSA2 coating measured through goniometer was found to be more than 151°, further it was enhanced to around 161° by increasing the weight percentage of ZnO. The ZnO/CuSA2 superhydrophobic coatings showed excellent super buoyancy characteristic as evidenced by their floating nature in water over a prolonged time. Further, experiments on maximum load bearing capacity of the ZnO/CuSA2 coatings were examined by placing stapler pins on their surface and the effect of deposition time on the load bearing capacity has been investigated in detail.

The study provides insight into the so-called 'oughtopia' model, proposing a possible way to organize the society of the future. By portraying the community of Wonder Kiddy, where humans, aliens (elves) and robots of all kinds coexist as one social organism, the author carries out judgments about a technological civilization of the future and analyzes concerns associated with the technophobia of modern people. The first concern is the fear that intelligent machines could start living according to their own rules of self-evolution, imitating the governing principles typical of human society. Secondly, Wonder Kiddy reflects the fear of the collapse of modern humanity and the death of the human race, followed by a shift to a posthuman society. Thirdly, it presents concerns about how mythological value, an essential component of humans' spiritual richness, might collapse if a technological civilization's speed and sense of direction get out of hand. Finally, it questions the belief about the historical progress of the human race, which rests on the concept of linear time. On the other hand, Wonder Kiddy presents the model of an ideal solution for preserving all ecological, natural and scenic values.

At the same time, robotic cardiac surgery requires that the anesthesiologist employs several subspecialty skillsets in order to provide optimal care for these patients. Multiple different regional anesthesia techniques may be used to improve analgesia, reduce opioid dosages, and facilitate rapid extubation at the conclusion of the case. Several peripheral cannulation strategies for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) exist and the anesthesia team may assist with percutaneous cannulation of the superior vena cava (SVC) or positioning of an endo-pulmonary vent. Similarly the anesthesiologist may be asked to percutaneously cannulate the coronary sinus for retrograde cardioplegia delivery.

Robotics in spine surgery, however, remains in its infancy. Here, the authors systematically review the evidence behind robotic applications in spinal instrumentation. METHODS This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant studies (through October 2016) that reported the use of robotics in spinal instrumentation were identified from a search of the PubMed database. Data regarding the accuracy of screw placement, surgeon learning curve, radiation exposure, and reasons for robotic failure were extracted. RESULTS Twenty-five studies describing 2 unique robots met inclusion criteria. Of these, 22 studies evaluated accuracy of spinal instrumentation. Although grading of pedicle screw accuracy was variable, the most commonly used method was the Gertzbein and Robbins system of classification. In the studies using the Gertzbein and Robbins system, accuracy (Grades A and B) ranged from 85% to 100%. Ten studies evaluated radiation exposure during the procedure. In studies that detailed fluoroscopy usage, overall fluoroscopy times ranged from 1.3 to 34 seconds per screw. Nine studies examined the learning curve for the surgeon, and 12 studies described causes of robotic failure, which included registration failure, soft-tissue hindrance, and lateral skiving of the drill guide. CONCLUSIONS Robotics in spine surgery is an emerging technology that holds promise for future applications. Surgical accuracy in instrumentation implanted using robotics appears to be high.

Successful incorporation of such ionic and capacitive actuators into soft robots demands highly repeatable and scalable fabrication techniques. As a novel approach in fabrication of ionic and capacitive laminates, the electroactive layers are deposited layer-by-layer around a woven fabric substrate, which is pertained as the centermost layer of the laminate. The electromechanical performance of the actuators having the textile reinforcement layer was on a par with similar actuators without the reinforcement layer; however, the reinforcement layer significantly simplifies the manufacturing process and increases repeatability of the actuators characteristics. More importantly, the reinforcement layer pertains its tensile strength, which gives new opportunities for incorporation of the soft ionic actuators directly onto fabric without compromising their excellent electromechanical performance. Fortunately, the same electroactive laminates, directly exposed to ambient air, have outstanding performance as electric double-layer capacitors for energy storage. Electromechanical characterization with a galvanostatic input was carried out on a large pool of actuators to identify the factors influencing the repeatability of their actuation.

The first line is the development of a high-precision cryotherapy dosing technique. The second line is related to the formation of prediction and result control techniques of establishing a predetermined cryonecrosis area, since practice requires a detailed calculation of a procedure to choose the modes of cryosurgical devices, which meet the dosing conditions.

This raises the possibility that computers will determine whether people will live or die. The possible use of autonomous weapons against humans in armed conflict clearly has potential right to life implications. This contribution argues that the right to dignity angle must also be brought into play. The first concern raised by autonomous weapons is ‘can they do it?': Can autonomus targeting conform with the requirements of international humanitarian law, in particular the rules of distinction and proportionality? If machines cannot do proper targeting, such use of force will be ‘arbitrary’ and thus violate the right to life. Moreover, the right to life requires accountability, but it is not clear who is to be held responsible when robots get it wrong. Secondly: ‘Should they do it?' Should robots have the power of life and death over humans? This may violate the rights to life as well as the right to dignity. The question whether there is ‘meaningful human control’ over the release of force is emerging as a helpful tool to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable autonomous targeting, and I argue that it also makes sense from a human rights perspective. The question that will haunt the debate in the future is: What if technology develops to the point where it is clear that fully autonomous weapons surpass human targeting, and can potentially save many lives? Would human rights considerations in such a case not militate for the use of autonomous weapons, instead of against it? I argue that the rights to life and dignity demand that even under such circumstances, full autonomy in force delivery should not be allowed. The article emphasises the importance placed on the concept of a ‘dignified life’ in the African human rights system. © 2017 South African Journal on Human Rights.","Autonomous weapons; Human rights; International humanitarian law; International law",,2-s2.0-85021728573

A cyber-physical domain is characterized by the presence of a cyber-physical system coordinating heterogeneous ICT components (PCs, smartphones, sensors, actuators) and involving real world entities (humans, machines, agents, robots, etc.) that perform complex tasks in the “physical” real world to achieve a common goal. The physical world, however, is not entirely predictable, and processes enacted in cyber-physical domains must be robust to unexpected conditions and adaptable to unanticipated exceptions. This demands a more flexible approach in process design and enactment, recognizing that in real-world environments it is not adequate to assume that all possible recovery activities can be predefined for dealing with the exceptions that can ensue.

Based on a review of that information stated above, an attempt has been made to overview the present situation and future trends of geo-disasters in the context of climate change and to present possible adaptive measures against disasters. Particularly, emphasis is assigned to the importance of the combined effects of plural events, which increases the probability of extreme events, sometimes triggering devastating consequences. Adaptive measures against climate change-associated geo-disasters are presented by classification into software and hardware. Special emphasis is devoted to the availability of information and communication technology (ICT) and information, communication and robot technology (ICRT) involving devices such as IC-sensors and Un-crewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV, drones), which are useful in early warning systems and in simple monitoring systems.","Adaptation; Climate change; Compound geo-disaster; ICT","Disasters; Earthquakes; Hurricanes; Monitoring; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Adaptation; Early Warning System; Information and Communication Technologies; Japan meteorological agencies; Present situation; Software and hardwares; Strong earthquakes; Torrential rainfalls; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; early warning system; earthquake; earthquake trigger; equipment; extreme event; hardware; information and communication technology; monitoring system; rainfall; software; typhoon; Japan",2-s2.0-85014034236

A key determinant of such operational models' viability is the competitiveness of their cost structures. Using a comprehensive analysis of the respective cost structures, this research shows that public transportation (in its current form) will only remain economically competitive where demand can be bundled to larger units. In particular, this applies to dense urban areas, where public transportation can be offered at lower prices than autonomous taxis (even if pooled) and private cars. Wherever substantial bundling is not possible, shared and pooled vehicles serve travel demand more efficiently. Yet, in contrast to current wisdom, shared fleets may not be the most efficient alternative. Higher costs and more effort for vehicle cleaning could change the equation. Moreover, the results suggest that a substantial share of vehicles may remain in private possession and use due to their low variable costs. Even more than today, high fixed costs of private vehicles will continue to be accepted, given the various benefits of a private mobility robot. © 2017 The Authors.",,,2-s2.0-85031932827

However, existing soft robots usually require multiple pneumatic/fluidic channels for pressurizing soft material segments in series or in parallel to achieve multiple mechanical degrees of freedom. In this study, we demonstrated a soft actuator embedded with Low-Melting-Point Alloy (LMPA), with which the mechanical degrees and stiffness can be selectively controlled. The LMPA was embedded in the bottom of the actuator, with the Ni-Cr wires serpentining under different positions of the LMPA layer. Through a reheating- recrystallizing circle, the actuator can self-heal and recover from the crack state. The melting process of the LMPA under different currents and different sections, the variable stiffness, the self-healing properties, and the programmable mechanical freedom of the actuator was explored through experiments. The results showed that the LMPA could be melted about 10, s under the current of 0.7, A. With the LMPA, the bending force and the elasticity modulus of the actuator could be enhanced up to 16 times and 4,000 times separately. Moreover, up to six motion patterns could be achieved under the same air pressure inflated to a typical single-chamber soft actuator. The combination of Low-Melting-Point Alloy and the soft actuators may open up a diversity of applications for future soft robotics. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Low-Melting-Point alloy; Programmable mechanical freedom; Soft actuator; Variable stiffness","Actuators; Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Melting point; Nickel alloys; Robotics; Stiffness; Wearable technology; Elasticity moduli; Low melting point alloy; Mechanical degrees; Programmable mechanical freedom; Robotic technologies; Self-healing properties; Soft actuators; Variable stiffness; Mechanical actuators",2-s2.0-85028458442

One format these maps can take is point clouds. However, when generating point clouds it is likely that voids, resulting from shadows created by features within the environment for example, will exist within them. Previous research studies have developed techniques which enable such voids to be interpolated. Unfortunately, for hazardous environments, this interpolation can be detrimental and have severe safety implications. This paper proposes a new algorithmic method for simplifying the detection of voids in point clouds. Once detected, the voids are validated, to make sure they exist within the scan-able part of the environment and if they do then they are marked for further investigation by the robot. This enables a more complete point cloud to be generated. To demonstrate the capabilities of the method, it was initially applied to a set of simplified scenes, where it was able to detect all the voids that were present, whilst also being compared to another algorithm. Following this the method was applied to a more realistic scenario. In this example, many, but not all of the voids were correctly identified. A discussion follows explaining why some voids were not detected and how future research aims to address this. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","clouds; Field robotics; Hazardous environments; Mapping; Point; Safety verification and validation","Clouds; Hazards; Mapping; Algorithmic approach; Algorithmic methods; Field robotics; Hazardous environment; Nuclear decommissioning; Point; Realistic scenario; Safety verification; Robotics",2-s2.0-85026751764

It will enable combining the printer with an engraving CNC machine, so that the effector head of the 3D printer will allow the head to be exchanged for printing with an engraver head, and it will allow fine engraving on printed circuit boards. The printer effector is equipped with a system that allows the insertion and locking of the head. The structure and control of the 3D printer is essentially the same as for any CNC machine. After replacing the head the electronics can be simply connected to it and for the process of engraving appropriate software can be used. In addition to the modification of the head it is also necessary to adjust the tooling table, namely to replace the heated pad of the printer for an engraving plate, which is equipped with clamps to fix the workpieces. Thus, it is possible to achieve more efficient production and savings, where one machine is capable of producing 3D parts, as well as printed circuits for electronics. In this time great emphasis has been placed on the easy production of prototypes.

Our work separates the effect of time of day on both feeding and lying patterns for cows outdoors to enable the alignment of feeding behavior with feed management. We determined the diurnal intake patterns and behavior of dairy cows when the nutritive value of feed remained constant throughout 24 h in an outdoor environment, and when feed access was restricted. Nine nonlactating Holstein-Friesian cows (live weight 626 ± 53 kg, age 96 ± 33 mo; mean ± SD) were split into 3 groups of 3 and offered lucerne hay cubes (cube volume 32 mm3) ad libitum according to 3 treatments: full access (FA, feed access 24 h), day access (DA, feed access between 0600 and 1800 h), and night access (NA, feed access between 1800 and 0600 h). Treatments were applied to individual cows in a crossover design with 7-d periods. During the last 4 d of each period, data were collected on feed intake, as well as feeding and lying behaviors. Total daily intake was greater for cows on the FA treatment (3.5% of BW) compared with the DA and NA treatments at 3.1 and 2.9% of BW, respectively. The cows with FA consumed 69% of their total intake during the day (0600-1800 h), with the greatest intake (39%) occurring during 1200 to 1800 h and only 12% of intake occurring during 2400 to 0600 h. Cows with DA consumed 56% of feed during 0600 to 1200 h and 44% during 1200 to 1800 h. In contrast, NA cows consumed more feed (74%) during the first 6 h period (1800-2400 h), thus maximizing lying time between 2400 and 0600 h. The time spent lying throughout daylight periods varied between treatments; however, total daily lying time was similar across the 3 treatments. This experiment shows the feeding and lying behaviors of cows when feed quality remains constant throughout 24 h, which will assist the formulation of variable feed allocation strategies for future testing in both robotic and conventional milking systems. Varying the quantity of feed offered throughout 24 h may benefit robot utilization at night in automatic milking systems through increased feeding activity, and as we observed, is likely to have little effect on lying time or DMI, with cows readily adapting to changes in feed management. Conversely, aligning feed on offer with preferred feeding time in conventional milking systems may increase the intake of high quality pasture. © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.","Ad libitum feeding; Dairy cow; Feeding behavior; Lying behavior",,2-s2.0-85031046498

The public actors securing the vital functions of society are engaged with global and local digital services provides. The culture of these private actors is typically built on business values. The aim of national security is to secure the future of a state. The ecosystems of public and private actors proving the citizen with digital services have to solve this possible conflict of interest between the actors. Digital security and digitalization have to be in balance for proving the state and its citizens with national security. The public actors have formed legislations and defined requirements for digital services for controlling the security of private actors and the digital services they provide.

Time delay existing in bilateral teleoperation easily destabilizes the system. Proper control strategies are able to make the system stable, but at the cost of compromised performance. Model-based bilateral teleoperation is designed to achieve enhanced performance of this time-delayed system, but an accurate model is required. Design/methodology/approach - Viscoelastic model has been used to describe the robot tool-soft tissue interaction behavior. Kevin-Boltzmann (K-B) model is selected to model the soft tissue behavior due to its good accuracy, transient and linearity properties among several viscoelastic models. In this work, the K-B model is designed at the master side to generate a virtual environment of remote robotic tool-soft tissue interaction. In order to obtain improved performance, a self perturbing recursive least square (SPRLS) algorithm is developed to on-line update the necessary parameters of the environment with varying dynamics. Findings - With fast and optimal on-line estimation of primary parameters of the K-B model, the reflected force of the model-based bilateral teleoperation at the master side is improved as well as the position/velocity tracking performance. This model-based design in the bilateral teleoperation avoids the stability issue caused by time delay in the communication channel since the exchanged information become position/velocity and estimated parameters of the used model. Even facing with big and varying time delay, the system keeps stably and enhanced tracking performance. Besides, the fast convergence of the SPRLS algorithm helps to track the time-varying dynamic of the environment, which satisfies the surgical applications as the soft tissue properties usually are not static. Originality/value - The originality of this work lies in that an enhanced perception of bilateral teleoperation structure under constant/varying time delay that benefits robotic assisted tele-palpation (time varying environment dynamic) tasks is developed. With SPRLS algorithm to on-line estimate the main parameters of environment, the feedback perception of system can be enhanced with stable velocity/position tracking. The superior velocity/position and force tracking performance of the developed method makes it possible for future robotic-assisted tasks with long-distance communication. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bilateral teleoperation; Force feedback; Robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery; Tele-palpation; Time-varying delay; Viscoelastic model","Feedback; Machine design; Parameter estimation; Remote control; Robotics; Surgery; Time delay; Tissue; Virtual reality; Viscoelasticity; Bilateral teleoperation; Force feedback; Minimally invasive surgery; Tele-palpation; Time varying- delays; Viscoelastic modeling; Robotic surgery",2-s2.0-85028909262

ICT's have influenced both our transport modes and infrastructure as well as our behaviour. In this paper we discuss the main features of these changes and investigate how they could put public values in the transport debate in a tight corner or lead to new policy challenges. Transport comes with benefits and burdens and often a unequal distribution of both. Moreover, there are tensions between short and long term interests, public and private interests and between efficiency and equity. Analysing how new developments impact public values that are considered relevant in the transport debate shows that there is a wide range of aspects to consider. We discuss four public values. Accessibility is concerned with providing access for all, making sure there are transport options available as well as taking care that people have the capabilities to access them. Affordability or (cost) efficiency is about spending public money wisely. Availability reflects the need for a reliable transport system, today and in the future, as this is crucial for economic performance and social interaction. Acceptability is a broad category including issues with regard to justice and solidarity, the impact on safety and other external effects, the impact on the market playing field and respect for privacy. ICT's change transport in very different ways. They have changed the world of travel and traffic information, bringing more options and alternatives under people's attention. Public transport information is widely available, GPS's guide our car trips and provide real time information on traffic conditions, and platforms enable us to find a shared car or a Uber taxi fast and easy. They have enabled new forms of transport, such as new services offered through internet platforms, and probably will enable other new modes like self-driving vehicles. ICT's change our need or desire to travel and our travel experience. They change the geography of our destinations. All in all, ICT's change our behaviour in many ways, making us more flexible leading to more fragmented patterns in space and time. And with all these changes, the transport system also becomes more complex. Assessment of new developments in the transport system as a result of ICT's leads us to four major challenges, requiring policy makers to adopt a more proactive approach in order to deal with these. First, the behavioural patterns in space and time are becoming more and more whimsical and less predictable, while infrastructure such as road or rail is inherently robust, inert and takes a long time to plan and build. Yet somehow, the mice and the elephant will have to (learn to) dance together., Second, social equity is a major concern when accessibility becomes more and more dependent on privately run platforms and transport service providers using unknown algorithms. Access can be limited in multiple ways. Physical access can be an issue (service provider may shun certain neighbourhoods). However, more and more it is a matter of skills and psychological flexibility to keep up with new things (for example smart ticketing in public transport or using apps for travel information) and not everyone can cope with that. Third, there appears to be a strong 'winner-takes-it-all' tendency in the ICT sector. Tech companies become rich, powerful and unassailable, while they profit from collectively financed infrastructure (e.g. Uber). The costs for development, maintenance, education, safety etcetera are left to the public domain, as are the consequences of monopolisation, unfair competition and loss of innovation power. The question is how to price public goods and external effects properly. And fourth, robots and algorithms are quickly becoming independent actors in the transport system, while our rules and regulations are primarily made for humans and organisations. We need to think about requirements for (self-learning) software and robots such as self-driving vehicles, reflecting what moral choices we prefer in critical situations, what we want them to do for us and what not and how to deal with the liability issues that arise. © 2015 The Authors.

For a biped robot to navigate safely in a crowd it must maintain balance and avoid collisions. In highly dynamic and unpredictable environments like crowds, collision avoidance is usually interpreted as passive safety, i.e. that the robot can stop before any collision occurs. We show that both balance preservation and passive safety can be analyzed, from the point of view of viability theory, as the ability of the robot to stop safely at some point in the future. This allows us to address both problems with a single model predictive controller with appropriate terminal constraints. We demonstrate that this controller predicts failures (falls and collisions) as early as the duration of the preview horizon. Finally, we propose a new strategy for safe navigation that relaxes the passive safety conditions to allow the robot to avoid a greater number of collisions. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Anthropomorphic robots; Biped robot walking; Passive safety; Safe navigations; Single models; Terminal constraint; Unpredictable environments; Viability theory; Working environment; Robots",2-s2.0-85010213745

Some of the most frequent tasks in this domain are related to wiping of surfaces, such as vacuuming the floor, sweeping dust, or cleaning windows. However, the performance for these tasks is not directly observable as small dirt particles, dust, and residual water are hardly perceivable by means of computer vision. In this work we propose to utilize haptic perception paired with a qualitative effect representation to reason about the task performance of robotic wiping motions despite poor visual information. In particular, we relate the desired contact force to the measured end-effector force in order to simulate the effect of previously executed wiping motions.

Insects are well-studied organisms with regard to odor tracking, and their behavioral strategies have been applied to mobile robots for evaluation. This ""bottom-up"" approach is a fundamental way to develop biomimetic robots; however, the biological analyses and the modeling of behavioral mechanisms are still ongoing. Therefore, it is still unknown how such a biological system actually works as the controller of a robotic platform. To answer this question, we have developed an insect-controlled robot in which a male adult silkmoth (Bombyx mori) drives a robot car in response to odor stimuli; this can be regarded as a prototype of a future insect-mimetic robot. In the cockpit of the robot, a tethered silkmoth walked on an air-supported ball and an optical sensor measured the ball rotations. These rotations were translated into the movement of the two-wheeled robot. The advantage of this ""hybrid"" approach is that experimenters can manipulate any parameter of the robot, which enables the evaluation of the odor-tracking capability of insects and provides useful suggestions for robotic odor-tracking. Furthermore, these manipulations are non-invasive ways to alter the sensory-motor relationship of a pilot insect and will be a useful technique for understanding adaptive behaviors. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.","Biomimetics; Insect; Insect-machine hybrid robot; Issue 118; Multisensory integration; Neuroscience; Odor-tracking; Pheromone; Silkmoth; Vision","fragrance; animal; biomimetics; Bombyx; chemotaxis; male; movement (physiology); odor; physiology; robotics; Animals; Biomimetics; Bombyx; Chemotaxis; Male; Movement; Odorants; Robotics; Smell",2-s2.0-85008675543

Using flying animals as inspiration, a behavior-based robotics approach is taken to implement and test their observed gap-aiming behavior in three dimensions.

The results of the simulation experiment show the implementation can successfully produce the desired gap-aiming behavior.

During learning, the robot uses its sensorial capabilities resembling a human operator to successfully accomplish the requested operation in assembly and welding.

The conventional ASV design has a limitation where it possesses large turning radius which is less suited for swarming purpose especially for a small area application. In this paper, a new ASV prototype is developed to accommodate swarming requirement and motion stability. Firstly, design requirements and the corresponding design methodology to achieve the aforementioned objectives are discussed. The practical aspects of the design are briefly presented and some related results from experiments related to the platform testing are presented.

Examples are real-time and/or safety-critical parallel applications. In particular for future many-core architectures, analysis tools for proving such properties to hold for a given application irrespective of other workload either suffer from computational complexity. Or, sound bounds are of no practical interest due to severe interferences of resources and software at multiple levels. In view of abundant computational and memory resources becoming available, we propose to apply the principles of invasive computing to avoid sharing of resources at run time as much as possible. We subsequently show that statically proven quality guarantees may be enforced on many multi-core architectures by a presented hybrid mapping approach. Rather than fixed resource mappings, this approach provides only constellations of resource allocations to the run-time system that searches for such constellations and assigns the invader a suitable claim of resources, if possible. We have implemented this hybrid approach and the interface to the language InvadeX10, a library-based extension of the X10 programming language. In this extension, so-called requirements on execution qualities such as deadlines (e.g., in the form of latency constraints) may be annotated to individual programs or even program segments. These are then translated into satisfying resource constellations that need to be found at run time prior to admitting a parallel application to start, respectively continue in view of required execution quality requirements. We give a real-world case study from the domain of heterogeneous robot vision to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach to guarantee statically analyzed best and worst-case timing requirements on latency and throughput. © 2016 IEEE.","analysis; dse; invasive computing; manycore; predictability; real time; simulation; x10","Computer vision; Embedded systems; Mapping; Safety engineering; System-on-chip; analysis; Invasive computing; Many-core; predictability; Real time; simulation; Computer architecture",2-s2.0-85010369454

Given that individuals will interact and even cooperate with these service robots, their design and development demand ethical attention. With this in mind I suggest the use of an approach for incorporating ethics into the design process of robots known as Care Centered Value Sensitive Design (CCVSD). Although this approach was originally and intentionally designed for the healthcare domain, the aim of this paper is to present a preliminary study of how personal and professional service robots might also be evaluated using the CCVSD approach. The normative foundations for CCVSD come from its reliance on the care ethics tradition and in particular the use of care practices for: (1) structuring the analysis and, (2) determining the values of ethical import. To apply CCVSD outside of healthcare one must show that the robot has been integrated into a care practice. Accordingly, the practice into which the robot is to be used must be assessed and shown to meet the conditions of a care practice. By investigating the foundations of the approach I hope to show why it may be applicable for service robots and further to give examples of current robot prototypes that can and cannot be evaluated using CCVSD. © 2016, The Author(s).","Applied ethics; Care ethics; Robot ethics; Service robots; Value-sensitive design","Design; Health care; Mobile robots; Philosophical aspects; Robots; Applied ethics; Care ethics; Robot ethics; Service robots; Value sensitive design; Machine design",2-s2.0-84983233456

The classical methods consist of cell decomposition, potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty.

Increasing the motion efficiency in terms of the forward speed by improving the locomotion methods is a key issue for underwater robots. Furthermore, the energy efficiency is one of the main challenges for long-term autonomy of these systems. In this study, we will consider both these aspects of efficiency, which in some cases can be conflicting. To this end, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize power consumption and maximize forward velocity. In particular, the optimal values of the gait parameters for different motion patterns are calculated in the presence of trade-offs between power consumption and velocity. As is the case with all multi-objective optimization problems, the solution is not a single point but rather a set of points. We present a weighted-sum method to combine power consumption and forward velocity optimization problems. Particle swarm optimization is applied to obtain optimal gait parameters for different weighting factors. Trade-off curves or Pareto fronts are illustrated in a power consumption–forward velocity plane for both lateral and eel-like motion pattern. They give information on objective trade-offs and can show how improving power consumption is related to deteriorating the forward velocity along the trade-off curve. Therefore, decision makers can specify the preferred Pareto optimal point along the trade-off curve. Moreover, we address some interesting questions regarding the optimal gait parameters, which is a significant issue for the control of underwater snake robots in the future. © 2016, ISAROB.","Energy efficiency; Multi-objective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Underwater snake robot","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Optimization; Pareto principle; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Robots; Time and motion study; Velocity; Forward velocity; Locomotion method; Multi-objective optimization problem; Snake robots; Underwater robotics; Underwater robots; Weighted sum method; Weighting factors; Multiobjective optimization",2-s2.0-84994358634

Therefore, a new element was introduced into the virtual environment - a device to simulate real objects. In the Virtual Environment (VE), user interacted with a simulated object, and the task of the Delta robot was moving into a position which enabled the interaction. In this way, VE has become more responsive because it corresponded to the behavior of the user, who can move and interact with digital objects and directly experience their physical properties (e.g. size, shape).

We present data on same-day discharge (SDD) for patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP). Methods: Patient data were gathered in an IRB-approved database. In April 2015, the surgeon (S.J.) began SDD. The SDD protocol for RALP includes multimodal anesthesia/analgesia and extended recovery. Interim analysis revealed that government insurance (CMS) refused hospital reimbursement for SDD. As of that time, only patients with commercial insurance were offered SDD. The demographic and peri-operative data were compared between the two cohorts (Group 1, SDD; Group 2, Admitted patients) by using Mann-Whitney U, chi-squared, or fisher exact tests, where appropriate. Results: During the study period, 21 patients had undergone RALP. Eleven of 21 patients were offered SDS, and nine (81.8%) were discharged. Both those who elected to stay were successfully discharged on the next day. Patient age, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen, operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), prostate weight, distance from home to hospital, margin status, marital status, and household income were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. The same is true between patients who underwent RALP both before and after initiation of the SDD protocol with the exception of EBL (greater in the SDD group). There have been no reported complications or readmissions for any of the patients in Group 1. Conclusion: Our novel pilot study reveals that SDS is safe and feasible. We are currently conducting a further evaluation of patient satisfaction. Future research is needed to verify these conclusions. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.","outcomes; prostate cancer; same-day surgery","Article; bleeding; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; estimated blood loss; feasibility study; government; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; household income; human; laparoscopic surgery; marriage; operation duration; patient care; patient satisfaction; pilot study; priority journal; prospective study; prostate weight; prostatectomy; retrospective study; robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy; robot assisted surgery; same day discharge; aged; anesthesia; blood; factual database; laparoscopy; length of stay; male; middle aged; patient safety; perioperative period; Prostatic Neoplasms; robotic surgical procedure; prostate specific antigen; Aged; Anesthesia; Body Mass Index; Databases, Factual; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Patient Discharge; Patient Safety; Patient Satisfaction; Perioperative Period; Pilot Projects; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures",2-s2.0-85002188838

The proposal covers the two key steps of (1) extracting descriptive features from the input image and (2) construction and evaluation of models, comparing the performance of BNCs technologies with SVMs solutions. The experimentation is performed over two different datasets, and the results, given in terms of accuracy, provide a quite appealing analysis where specialization versus generalization or model complexity are considered.

The robot is powered by electrical energy generated through bacterial respiration within a microbial fuel cell (MFC) stomach, and harvested using state-of-the-art voltage step-up electronics. Through innovative exploitation of compliant, biomimetic actuation, the soft robotic feeding mechanism enables the connection of multiple MFC stomachs in series configuration in an aquatic environment, previously a significant challenge.

Do the same rules apply when interacting with others who are radically different from ourselves, like other species or robots? We typically perceive other people and animals through their embodied behavior, as they dynamically engage various aspects of their affordance field. In second personal perception we also perceive social or interactional affordances of others. I discuss various aspects of perceptible agency, which might begin to give us some tools to understand interactions also with agents truly other than ourselves or “perhaps agents” like present and future social robots. Robots have various kinds of physical and behavioral presence and thus make their agency—if we want to call it that—perceptible in ways that computers and other forms of AI do not. The largely dualist assumptions pertaining to the hidden bodies of traditional Turing tests are discussed, as well as the social affordance effects of such indirect interactions as opposed to interactions in physically shared space. The question is what role various abilities to reveal, hide and dynamically control the body and broader behavior plays in heterogeneous tech or machine mediated interactions.

Instead of compensating errors in operation, this study designs a calibration table to obtain the error value for a designated path. This error is then used to adjust important parameters in the kinematic closed chain models of a manipulators via optimization. The proposed method reduces the cost and the dependence on the calibration process. Experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the manipulator is improved.

Rehabilitation robots might represent a cost-effective solution. The present technical means for rehabilitation don't match all the requirements for post-stroke recovery. This work describes the analysis of human motion ranges aiming at the design of a cost-oriented and user-friendly post stroke robotic rehabilitation solution. Materials and method: The study was performed on a group of 21 patients, 11 females and 10 males, matched with the ischemic stroke affected population from the point of view of age and comorbidities. The motion range measurements were made using a standard goniometer. Shoulder flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, elbow flexion, pronation, supination, wrist flexion and extension, metacarpal-phalangeal, proximal and distal inter-phalangeal flexion was measured, in a comparative fashion for the right and left side, for males and females and for elderly and young patients. Results: First, no significant side-dependent differences were identified. Sex seems to have an importance: female subjects having a significantly higher motion range for some of the measured joints. Age impacts the motion amplitude also, elderly having stiffer joints, lower motion ranges. Conclusion: The results of this preliminary analysis underline the necessity of developing an open ongoing database to refine the exact motion ranges, and the main effects influencing these intervals in order to get a feasible input for a biomechanical motion concept of a future rehabilitation robot. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","Range of motion; Rehabilitation; Robot; Stroke",,2-s2.0-85007441237

With the advent of shockwave lithotripsy, open stone surgery became less prevalent, but once ureteroscopy became more prevalent, open stone surgery became all but extinct. Advances in smaller, more flexible endoscopes and improvements in intracorporeal lithotripters, ureteroscopy has become a mainstay of therapy for kidney stones. The holmium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser can be utilized through flexible instruments and fragments any stone no matter what it is composed of. Digital image ureteroscopes with chip-on-the-tip technology has improved our visualization during ureteroscopy. What is nextfl We examine potential directions from current research. Pharmacologic manipulation for ureteral dilation may obviate the need for pre-stenting or balloon dilation. Advances in ureteroscope technology will likely see the biggest advances. Different ureteroscopic platforms and the user interface with the surgeon will progress. Robotic manipulation of the endoscope is an eventual reality with improved ergonomics and improved performance to reach all areas of the kidney. Single-use ureteroscopes are already a reality and offer a digital image with full deflection with every use and without having to worry about sterilization and costly repairs. Lastly, advancements in nanotechnology and robotics will see the potential for miniaturized robots that could be administered intravesically to identify the stone and to disintegrate it.

An overview of state of the art for these types of robots shows that there exists no solution for human robot collaboration. Here, we consider cyber physical systems, which are based on human worker participation as an integrated role in addition to its basic components. First, the paper identifies the collaborative schemes and a formal grading system is formulated based on four performance indicators. A detailed sensor catalog is established for one of the collaboration schemes, and performance indices are computed with various sensors. This study reveals an assessment of best and worst possible ranges of performance indices that are useful in the categorization of collaboration levels. To illustrate a possible solution, a hypothetical industrial scenario is discussed in a production environment. Generalizing this approach, a design methodology is developed for such human robot collaborative environments for various industrial scenarios to enable solution implementation. © 2016, The Author(s).","Collaborative robotics; Cyber physical system; Human robot collaboration",,2-s2.0-84994492990

One promising approach is interactive reinforcement learning (IRL) where an external trainer advises an apprentice on actions to speed up the learning process. In this paper we present an IRL approach for the domestic task of cleaning a table and compare three different learning methods using simulated robots: 1) reinforcement learning (RL); 2) RL with contextual affordances to avoid failed states; and 3) the previously trained robot serving as a trainer to a second apprentice robot. We then demonstrate that the use of IRL leads to different performance with various levels of interaction and consistency of feedback. Our results show that the simulated robot completes the task with RL, although working slowly and with a low rate of success. With RL and contextual affordances fewer actions are needed and can reach higher rates of success. For good performance with IRL it is essential to consider the level of consistency of feedback since inconsistencies can cause considerable delay in the learning process. In general, we demonstrate that interactive feedback provides an advantage for the robot in most of the learning cases. © 2016 IEEE.","Contextual affordances; developmental robotics; domestic cleaning scenario; interactive reinforcement learning (IRL); policy shaping","Apprentices; Learning systems; Robots; Affordances; Cross-modal interaction; Developmental robotics; domestic cleaning scenario; Interactive feedback; Interactive Reinforcement Learning; Learning methods; Level of consistencies; Reinforcement learning",2-s2.0-85006317995

Based on this robotic wing, the influence of flap amplitude, wind speed, flight frequency, downstroke ratio and stroke plane angle as well as the contributions of flap, elbow, sweep and wrist motions on the aerodynamic force and mechanical power were studied and analyzed. Results of wind tunnel experiments validated that higher lift would bring greater power consumption, and the flap motion would generate the most force and need more energy expenditure compared with other motions of bat.

Being analogous to a human arm, it is easy to imagine limitless possibilities the robotic arm. However, understanding and utilizing it for the purpose of construction requires more knowledge than just imagining it as prosthetic. Besides a fundamental understanding of the digital workflow from the initial design based data (3D modelling) to machine understandable data (proprietary output code), it requires the design and conception of the robot's physical environment from the tool at the end of its arm (end effector) to its physical surroundings(work cell). Contemporary software tools provide the capabilities for manufacturing purposes and allow for virtual simulations of the production process, ensuring higher rates of success for construction.

Understanding these differential responses is important to optimize patient care and safety. Toward this, characterizing how loads created by SMT relate to those created by typical motions is fundamental. Using robotic testing, it is now possible to make these comparisons to determine if SMT generates unique loading scenarios. In 12 porcine cadavers, SMT and passive motions were applied to the L3/L4 segment and the resulting kinematics tracked. The L3/L4 segment was removed, mounted in a parallel robot and kinematics of SMT and passive movements replayed robotically. The resulting forces experienced by L3/L4 were collected. Overall, SMT created both significantly greater and smaller loads compared to passive motions, with SMT generating greater anterioposterior peak force (the direction of force application) compared to all passive motions. In some comparisons, SMT did not create significantly different loads in the intact specimen, but did so in specific spinal tissues. Despite methodological differences between studies, SMT forces and loading rates fell below published injury values.

Results obtained were compared to those for the mainstream smoke from a Kentucky reference (3R4F) cigarette. Two different test matrices were assessed. Aerosol generated from the e-cigarette was trapped on a Cambridge filter pad, eluted in DMSO and compared to cigarette smoke total particulate matter (TPM), which was generated in the same manner for mutagenicity assessment in the Salmonella assay. Fresh e-cigarette and cigarette smoke aerosols were generated on the Vitrocell® VC 10 smoking robot and compared using a modified scaled-down 35 mm air agar interface (AAI) methodology. E-cigarette aerosol collected matter (ACM) was found to be non-mutagenic in the 85 mm plate incorporation Ames assay in strains TA98 and TA100 conducted in accordance with OECD 471, when tested up to 2400 μg/plate. Freshly generated e-cigarette aerosol was also found to be negative in both strains after an AAI aerosol exposure, when tested up to a 1 L/min dilution for up to 3 h. Positive control responses were observed in both strains, using benzo[a]pyrene, 2-nitrofluorene, sodium azide and 2-aminoanthracene in TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation respectively. In contrast, cigarette smoke TPM and aerosol from 3R4F reference cigarettes were found to be mutagenic in both tester strains, under comparable test conditions to that of e-cigarette exposure. Limited information exists on the mutagenic activity of captured e-cigarette particulates and whole aerosol AAI approaches. With the lower toxicant burden of e-cigarette aerosols compared to cigarette smoke, it is clear that a more comprehensive Ames package of data should be generated when assessing e-cigarettes, consisting of the standard OECD-five, TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 (or TA97) and E. coli (or TA102).

Autonomous mobile robots navigating in workspaces shared with human agents require motion planning techniques providing seamless integration and smooth navigation in such. Smooth integration in mixed scenarios calls for two abilities of the robot: predicting actions of others and acting predictably for them. The former requirement requests trainable models of agent behaviors in order to accurately forecast their actions in the future, taking into account their reaction on the robot's decisions. A human-like navigation style of the robot facilitates other agents-most likely not aware of the underlying planning technique applied- to predict the robot motion vice versa, resulting in smoother joint navigation. The approach presented in this paper is based on a feature-based maximum entropy model and is able to guide a robot in an unstructured, real-world environment. The model is trained to predict joint behavior of heterogeneous groups of agents from onboard data of a mobile platform. We evaluate the benefit of interaction-aware motion planning in a realistic public setting with a total distance traveled of over 4 km. Interestingly the motion models learned from human-human interaction did not hold for robot-human interaction, due to the high attention and interest of pedestrians in testing basic braking functionality of the robot. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Air navigation; Autonomous agents; Entropy; Forecasting; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Mobile agents; Mobile robots; Motion planning; Navigation; Robots; Autonomous Mobile Robot; Human-human interactions; Maximum entropy modeling; Maximum entropy models; Planning techniques; Real world environments; Robot-human interaction; Seamless integration; Robot programming",2-s2.0-85006369605

Trajectory planning methods, supported by models of typical human behavior and personal space, often produce reasonable behavior. However, they do not account for the future closedloop interactions of other agents with the trajectory being constructed. As a consequence, the trajectories are unable to anticipate cooperative interactions (such as a human yielding), or adverse interactions (such as the robot blocking the way). In this paper, we propose a new method for navigation amongst pedestrians in which the trajectory of the robot is not explicitly planned, but instead, a planning process selects one of a set of closed-loop behaviors whose utility can be predicted through forward simulation. In particular, we extend Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) [1] to this domain using the closed-loop behaviors Go-Solo, Follow-other, and Stop. By dynamically switching between these policies, we show that we can improve the performance of the robot as measured by utility functions that reward task completion and penalize inconvenience to other agents.

These predictions allow a collaborative robot to both provide appropriate assistance and plan its own motion so it does not interfere with the human. In the specific case of human reach intent prediction, prior work has divided the task into two pieces: recognition of human activities and prediction of reach intent. In this work, we propose a joint model for simultaneous recognition of human activities and prediction of reach intent based on skeletal pose. Since future reach intent is tightly linked to the action a person is performing at present, we hypothesize that this joint model will produce better performance on the recognition and prediction tasks than past approaches. In addition, our approach incorporates a simple human kinematic model which allows us to generate features that compactly capture the reachability of objects in the environment and the motion cost to reach those objects, which we anticipate will improve performance.

In order to address these complex applications, several methods have been developed. The most successful methods often predict future obstacle locations in order identify collision-free paths. Since prediction can be computationally expensive, offline computations are commonly used, and simplifications such as the inability to consider the dynamics of interacting obstacles or possible stochastic dynamics are often applied. Online methods can be preferable to simulate potential obstacle interactions, but recent methods have been restricted to Gaussian interaction processes and uncertainty. In this paper we present an online motion planning method, Runtime Stochastic Ensemble Simulation (Runtime SES) planning, an inexpensive method for predicting obstacle motion with generic stochastic dynamics while maintaining a high planning success rate despite the potential presence of obstacle position error. Runtime SES planning evaluates the likelihood of collision for any state-time coordinate around the robot by performing Monte Carlo simulations online. This prediction is used to construct a customized Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) in order to quickly identify paths that avoid obstacles while moving toward a goal. We demonstrate Runtime SES planning in problems that benefit from online predictions, environments with strongly-interacting obstacles with stochastic dynamics and positional error. Through experiments that explore the impact of various parametrizations, robot dynamics and obstacle interaction models, we show that real-time capable planning with a high success rate is achievable in several complex environments. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Collision avoidance; Crashworthiness; Dynamics; Forecasting; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Motion planning; Robots; Stochastic systems; Collision-free paths; Complex applications; Complex environments; Ensemble simulation; Gaussian interaction; Motion planning methods; Off-line computation; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Robot programming",2-s2.0-85006494233

This adaption is done in a self-organized fashion with a neural system that learns first the topology of the tactile map when we touch it and associates a torque vector to move the arm in the corresponding direction. The artificial skin is based on a large area piezoresistive tactile device (ungridded) that changes its electrical properties in the presence of the contact. Our results show the self-calibration of a robotic arm (2 degrees of freedom) controlled in the four directions and derived combination vectors, by the soft touch on all the tactile surface, even when the torque is not detectable (force applied near the joint). The neural system associates each tactile receptive field with one direction and the correct force.

Often, solving a particular problem becomes easier when more than one modality is used. However, while there are undeniable benefits to combine sensors of different modalities the process tends to be complicated. Segmenting scenes observed by the robot into a discrete set of classes is a central requirement for autonomy as understanding the scene is the first step to reason about future situations. Scene segmentation is commonly performed using either image data or 3D point cloud data. In computer vision many successful methods for scene segmentation are based on conditional random fields (CRF) where the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution to the segmentation can be obtained by inference. In this paper we devise a new CRF inference method for scene segmentation that incorporates global constraints, enforcing the sets of nodes are assigned the same class label. To do this efficiently, the CRF is formulated as a relaxed quadratic program whose MAP solution is found using a gradient-based optimisation approach. The proposed method is evaluated on images and 3D point cloud data gathered in urban environments where image data provides the appearance features needed by the CRF, while the 3D point cloud data provides global spatial constraints over sets of nodes.

However, it can be assumed that the transition will not be instantaneous, meaning they will have to be capable of driving well in a mixed environment, with both humans and other autonomous vehicles on the road. This leaves a number of concerns for autonomous vehicles in terms of dealing with human uncertainty and understanding of cooperation on the road. This work demonstrates the need for focusing on communication and collaboration between autonomy and human drivers. After analyzing how drivers perform cooperative maneuvers (e.g. lane changing), key cues were identified for conveying intent through nonverbal communication. It was found that human observers can predict lane changes with over two seconds in prior to the lane departure, without use of a turning signal. Building on this concept, an autonomous control scheme is proposed that aims to capture these subtle motions before executing a lane change. To compare the proposed human-inspired methods, three possible control schemes for autonomous vehicles are implemented for a validation study on human subjects to provide feedback on their experience. By properly conveying intent through nuanced trajectory planning, we show that drivers can predict the autonomous vehicle's actions with 40% increase in prediction time when compared to traditional control methods, both as a passenger and while observing the autonomous vehicle. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Control theory; Forecasting; Intelligent robots; Roads and streets; Transportation; Vehicles; Autonomous control; Autonomous Vehicles; Communication and collaborations; Control methods; Current capability; Non-verbal communications; Trajectory Planning; Validation study; Cooperative communication",2-s2.0-85006367880

This is partly due to lack of free flight data, in particular during manoeuvres. In this work, we present, for the first time, a comparison of free flight forces estimated using solely an on-board IMU with wind tunnel measurements. The IMU based estimation brings higher sampling rates and even lower variation among individual wingbeats, compared to what has been achieved with an external motion tracking system in the past. A good match was found in comparison to wind tunnel measurements; the slight differences observed are attributed to clamping effects. Further insight was gained from the on-board rpm sensor, which showed motor speed variation of °C 15% due to load variation over a wingbeat cycle. The IMU based force estimation represents an attractive solution for future studies of flapping wing MAVs as, unlike wind tunnel measurements, it allows force estimation at high temporal resolutions also during manoeuvres. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Flight dynamics; Intelligent robots; Wind tunnels; Wings; Attractive solutions; Clamping effects; Force estimation; High temporal resolution; Intensive research; Load variations; Motion tracking system; Wind tunnel measurements; Free flight",2-s2.0-85006489763

However, drill cuttings cannot be removed effectively with the increase of drilling depth by conventional ultrasonic drills that only driven by longitudinal vibration. To address this issue, a Rotary-Percussive Ultrasonic Drill (RPUD) is proposed, which employs one single PZT transducer to generate rotary-percussive motion for rock fracturing. RPUD is composed of a PZT transducer, a percussive unit, a rotary unit, and a drill tool. The percussive unit enlarges the longitudinal vibration of front part of PZT transducer, and provides a reciprocating percussion to the drill tool. The rotary unit transforms longitudinal vibration of rear part of PZT transducer into longitudinal-torsional vibration to drive the drill tool to rotate continuously. The rotary and percussive motions are independent of each other, and can be adjusted separately. To make the rotary and percussive motions move synchronously, finite element method is employed to tune the resonance frequencies of the rotary unit and percussive unit to be close by transient analysis. Experimental results show that RPUD can improve removal efficiency of the drill cuttings due to its rotary motion, compared with conventional ultrasonic drills. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Finite element method; Intelligent robots; Interplanetary flight; Piezoelectric transducers; Rock drills; Space flight; Space research; Transducers; Transient analysis; Vibrations (mechanical); Attractive solutions; Axial vibrations; Deep-space exploration; High frequency HF; Longitudinal vibrations; Longitudinal-torsional vibrations; Removal efficiencies; Resonance frequencies; Drills",2-s2.0-85006365226

The current design is intended to be a bench-test for future development towards applications in haptic teleoperation purposed exoskeletons. The main feature of the pVSJ is its capability of varying the stiffness with infinite range based on a simple mechanical system. Moreover, the joint can rotate freely at the zero stiffness case without any limitation. The stiffness varying mechanism consists of two torsional springs, mounted with an offset from the pVSJ rotation center and coupled with the joint shaft by an idle roller. The position of the roller between the pVSJ rotation center and the spring's center is controlled by a linear sliding actuator fitted on the chassis of the joint. The variation of the output stiffness is obtained by changing the distance from the roller-springs contact point to the joint rotation center (effective arm). If this effective arm is null, the stiffness of the joint will be zero. The stiffness increases to reach high stiffness values when the effective arm approaches its maximum value, bringing the roller close to the torsional springs' center. The experimental results matched with the physical-based modeling of the pVSJ in terms of stiffness variation curve, stiffness dependency upon the springs' elasticity, joint deflection and the spring's deflection. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Exoskeleton (Robotics); Intelligent robots; Rollers (machine components); Haptic teleoperation; Mechanical systems; Physical based modeling; Sliding actuators; Stiffness increase; Stiffness variations; Torsional springs; Variable stiffness; Stiffness",2-s2.0-85006507399

Up to date,stereopsis represents the state-of-the art method and can achieve short-distance planetary surface modelling. However,future space missions will require scene reconstruction at greater distance,fidelity and feature complexity,potentially using other sensors like Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR). LIDAR has been extensively exploited for target detection,identification,and depth estimation in terrestrial robotics,but is still under development to become a viable technology for space robotics. This paper will first review current methods for scene reconstruction and terrain modelling using cameras in planetary robotics and LIDARs in terrestrial robotics; then we will propose camera-LIDAR fusion as a feasible technique to overcome the limitations of either of these individual sensors for planetary exploration.

Understanding mimicry is important for building better robots, learning about human categorization of robots in social ingroups/outgroups, and understanding social contagion in human-robot interaction. We investigate the extent to which humans will mimic a robot during the task of describing paintings by comparing the time participants put their hands on their hips before and after observing a robot cue that behavior. We observed no significant difference in participants' hands on hips time before and after the robot's cue. However, we did find that some participants performed the behavior more after the robot's cue while others performed it less. Furthermore, the direction of this change was a function of whether or not a participant performed the specified behavior prior to the robot's cue. This was similarly observed both for frequency of behavior performance and for a second behavior (hands behind back). As such, this study informs future research on human-robot mimicry, particularly on the importance of prior behavior during a human-robot interaction.

Category estimation is a difficult task even if human, then each sentence were categorized by three annotator to 18 categories. In this research, we collected 13727 dialogue sentences from an experiment with ten elderly participants. As the result, 12783 sentences can be categorized (2 or 3 annotator categorized for the same category). We compare the categorized sentences and robot's estimated category. The robot categorized as same as human around 50%. This coincident ratio is depending on the category. 'Society' category is difficult to categorize, but 'go-out' and 'music' can be categorized as around 60% ratio.

To enable adaptive behavior, a robot needs to recognize touch gestures and/or the proximity to interacting individuals. Moreover, a robot interacting with two or more humans usually needs to distinguish between them. However, this remains both a configuration and cost intensive task. In this paper we utilize inexpensive Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and propose an easy and configurable technique to enhance the robot's capabilities to interact with surrounding people. In a noisy laboratory setting, a mobile spherical robot is utilized in three proof-of-concept experiments of the proposed system architecture. Firstly, we enhance the robot with proximity information about the individuals in the surrounding environment. Secondly, we exploit BLE to utilize it as a touch sensor. And lastly, we use BLE to distinguish between interacting individuals. Results show that observing the raw received signal strength (RSS) between BLE devices already enhances the robot's interaction capabilities and that the provided infrastructure can be facilitated to enable adaptive behavior in the future.

This is relevant to the field of human-robot interaction, where the user's intentions are indicated through spontaneous gesturing (one shot) to the robot. The novelty of this work consists of learning the process that leads to the creation of a gesture, rather on the gesture itself. In our case, the context involves the way in which humans produce the gestures - the kinematic and anthropometric characteristics and the users' proxemics (the use of the space around them). In the method presented, the strategy is to generate a dataset of realistic samples based on biomechanical features extracted from a single gesture sample. These features, called 'the gist of a gesture', are considered to represent what humans remember when seeing a gesture and the cognitive process involved when trying to replicate it. By adding meaningful variability to these features, a large training data set is created while preserving the fundamental structure of the original gesture. Having a large dataset of realistic samples enables training classifiers for future recognition. Three classifiers were trained and tested using a subset of ChaLearn dataset, resulting in all three classifiers showing rather similar performance around 80% recognition rate Our classification results show the feasibility and adaptability of the presented technique regardless of the classifier. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Gesture recognition; Human computer interaction; Robots; Classification results; Cognitive process; Fundamental structures; Large dataset; Training data sets; User's intentions; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85002644879

Robotic devices can help to investigate the psychological fundamentals of body schema integration. While the Rubber Hand Illusion experiment indicates how artifacts can be perceived as a part of the own body, it relies on a passive limb that does not perform motions during the examinations. Novel setups aim at Robotic Hand/Leg Illusions induced by robotic devices which imitate human motions. Although such devices distinctly extend experimental possibilities, their design is rather proprietary and unstructured up to now. This paper analyzes the requirements of robotic hand and leg illusion setups based on systematic discussion of a multidisciplinary team of researchers from engineering and psychology. In a comparative study, requirements are collected and structured, their similarities and differences are determined, and the most important ones are extracted yielding design implications. The requirements with the highest priority are setup characteristics that concern the occurrence and quality of the illusion, i.e., hiding the real limb, anatomical plausibility, visual appearance, temporal delay, and software-controlled experimental conditions.

The sights may have their own preference of robots. The real world workspace is first converted into a roadmap using the Probabilistic Roadmap algorithm. The adopted technique for roadmap generation uses a hybrid of narrow corridor sampler, obstacle based sampler and uniform sampler; with hybrid edge connection technique that aims to first connect disconnected roadmaps and then introduces redundant cycles and also ensures a good coverage of the configuration space. The roadmap is used to compute a cost matrix between every mission sight. This cost matrix is used by an optimization algorithm which deputes different mission sights to different robots as well as dictates the order of visit of the missions by each robot. Local optimization is used to quickly compute the optimal plan. The navigation of the robots is done using a Fuzzy Logic based navigator.

To realize the reactive behaviors, several task space motions, such as the translational motion of the swing foot and the vertical position of the support foot, could be relaxed in presence of obstacles. Therefore, the swing foot trajectory is modulated with respect to the references in real-time for preventing future collisions between the legs, or legs and obstacles in the environment. External obstacle negotiation in the proposed framework can also be addressed generically by treating the obstacle as an extended segment of the support foot. The allowable deviation of the relaxed degrees of freedom from their references could be further utilized to modify the foot placement to regenerate a reactive walking pattern.

From 2025, the LHC will be upgraded to allow it to achieve a factor of 10 higher luminosity, which increases the rate of collisions, essential for probing new physics phenomena in the future. The route to high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) involves various detector upgrades and requires significant infrastructure changes. Recent measurements by CERN Radiation Protection, verifying previous calculations by The University of Sheffield (UoS), has raised awareness about the need to restrict human activity in the HL-LHC experimental, construction and maintenance areas due to exposure from high levels of radiation. Examining the case of the ATLAS detector upgrade, the collaborative partnership between UoS and UK industry is developing state-of-the-art robotic instrumentation, capable of tolerating high radiation levels. The main object of this research is a feasibility study with a TRL (technology readiness level) of three, to determine how materials and sub components of dexterous robotic systems behave after exposure to high levels of radiation. This is evaluation uses novel robotic irradiation equipment, techniques and test methods housed in the Birmingham University (UK) Irradiation Facility. One finger of an unmodified Shadow Robot Company 'Hand', a highly dexterous robotic manipulator, was exposed to specific doses of high radiation in a temperature controlled thermal chamber. Cooled by a liquid nitrogen evaporative system, the irradiation system moves samples continuously through a homogeneous proton beam. Movement is provided by a radiation hard pre-configured XY-Axis Cartesian Robot. The methods and techniques developed as a result of this TRL3 research will further aid the application and deployment of robotic and autonomous systems into highly radioactive environments. Based on preliminary findings it has been concluded that finger materials and basic electrical components can tolerate hazardous radiation environments, with careful selection and substitution of a minimal amount of materials, radiation hardness is also possible. Further work is scheduled for the irradiation of a fully instrumented and powered robotic hand to determine working hour tolerance. © 2016 IEEE.","Irradiation; Material; Robot","Colliding beam accelerators; Factory automation; Flexible manipulators; Irradiation; Luminance; Manipulators; Materials; Particle accelerators; Radiation; Radiation protection; Radioactivity; Robots; Collaborative partnerships; European organization for nuclear researches; High radiation environment; Irradiation facilities; Large Hadron collider LHC; Radiation environments; Radioactive environment; Technology readiness levels; Robotics",2-s2.0-84996538682

However, wireless links are prone to errors due to shadowing and multi-path fading, which is even more severe in dynamic environments. These problems can be attenuated by using a mesh backbone to which mobile node connect to, using a hand-off algorithm. This solution is particularly important under real-time requirements typically found in factory automation. In this paper, we devise the Double-Threshold Hand-off (DoTHa) algorithm, a novel hand-off mechanism that triggers a hand-off in various environmental conditions. As a case study, we carry out the tele-operation of a mobile robot through a wireless mesh network in an indoor setting, using a wireless chain network protocol (WICKPro-SRT) that supports soft real-time traffic. We empirically compared DoTHa with two existing hand-off algorithms based on single and double hysteresis margin. The results revealed that DoTHa achieves Data Delivery Ratio (DDR) close to 100% whereas the single hysteresis-based hand-off suffers from frequent disconnections, dropping DDR to 88%. The double hysteresis-based hand-off shows higher ping-pong effect than DoTHa, doubling the number of hand-offs in some scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.","chain topology; hand-off; IEEE 802.11; mobility; soft real-time; token passing; Wireless mesh networks","Automation; Carrier mobility; Chains; Factory automation; Hysteresis; Mesh generation; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multipath fading; Network protocols; Standards; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Chain topology; Hand off; IEEE 802.11s; Soft real time; Token passing; MESH networking",2-s2.0-84996522079

In addition, the development of robot-assisted surgery brings with it the possibility of controlling these devices remotely. Surgeons could now use robotics to treat patients from across the world and even beyond, in the comfort of their own surgery using a remote console. This could allow experts to reach the patients who need them most, from a wounded soldier on the battlefield who without immediate surgical assistance would die, astronauts in space requiring medical assistance, to even overseeing and aiding other surgeons in locations that may lack the expertise to carry out difficult operations.

The article suggests an approach to evaluating care robots and ICT in health care which acknowledges and addresses a number of ethical problems raised by robotic care—for instance disengagement problems—while taking into account that some elderly people may need care that does not treat them as (empirically) autonomous, that many the elderly of the future are likely to be digital natives, and that the task of evaluating technologies in care is more complicated than the discussion of deception suggests. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","Capability approach; Care craftsmanship; Care robots; Deception; Disengagement; Elderly care; Information technology; Modernity; The social","Information technology; Capability approach; Care craftsmanship; Deception; Disengagement; Elderly care; Modernity; The social; Robots",2-s2.0-84945534588

Paying attention to the objective elements of welfare rather than to people’s happiness reveals the central importance of respect and recognition, which robots cannot provide, to the practice of aged care. A realistic appreciation of the current economics of the aged care sector suggests that the introduction of robots into an aged care setting will most likely threaten rather than enhance these goods. I argue that, as a result, robotics for aged care is likely to transform aged care in accordance with a trajectory that leads towards this dystopian future even when this is not the intention of the engineers involved. While an argument can be made for the use of robots in aged care where the people being cared for have chosen to allow robots in this role, I suggest that overemphasising this possibility risks rendering it a self-fulfilling prophecy, depriving those being cared for of valuable social recognition, and failing to provide respect for older persons by allowing the options available to them to be shaped by the design choices of others. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","Aged care; Ethics; Robotics; Robots; Social robotics; Society","Robotics; Robots; Aged care; Ethics; Most likely; Old age; Social recognition; Social robotics; Society; Machine design",2-s2.0-84946762475

In this way, the ease of movement obtained with open surgery is summated with the advantages of the minimally invasive technique. Since 2000, when the first robotic system for surgery was introduced, robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) has been adopted by an increasing number of centres around the world, and today is used in ∼10% of lobectomies in the US. Here, we review the characteristics and function of the robotic system available today (namely, Intuitive Surgical Inc.’s da Vinci Surgical System), outline the different techniques for major lung resection via RATS, compare RATS with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy, and speculate on future developments. To date, no randomized trials have reported comparative data on RATS vs. VATS/thoracotomy for lung cancer. Retrospective analysis comparing RATS vs. thoracotomy have revealed advantages for the former, especially shorter hospital stays and a lower complication rate, but RATS produces similar or only slightly better results to VATS, the two being minimally invasive techniques with no need for rib separation. A few studies have reported RATS to be safer than VATS, with less conversions for bleeding, less complications; in others, it was associated with lower postoperative consumption of pain killers and quicker return of patients to normal activity. In addition, lymphnode upstaging has been shown to be higher with RATS than with VATS, with a similar rate as thoracotomy. The main disadvantage of RATS is the higher costs of instrumentation. Nevertheless, the future will probably see reductions in the costs and improvements in the instrumentation, integration with 3D imaging to improve virtual reality, and more patients benefitting from minimally invasive procedures for lung malignancies. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Robot-assisted thoracic surgery; Surgical robot; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery RATS vs. VATS","cancer surgery; cost benefit analysis; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgical instrument; learning curve; length of stay; lung cancer; operative blood loss; postoperative complication; priority journal; Review; robot assisted surgery; surgical technique; surgical training; thoracotomy; treatment outcome; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; comparative study; devices; economics; Lung Neoplasms; minimally invasive surgery; pathology; procedures; retrospective study; robotic surgical procedure; survival rate; Humans; Length of Stay; Lung Neoplasms; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Survival Rate; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Thoracotomy",2-s2.0-84986575600

If the correct response to a challenge remains the same, robots can gather invaluable information from accidental successes and will easily defeat future challenges through heuristic learning. Introducing uncertainty to the challenges will fundamentally change the rules of image-based CAPTCHA systems. This new approach temporarily excludes some images from a challenge's results, assigning them a neutral role. However, future challenges might include these images. So, successful responses might differ between challenges even though the challenges use the same images, thereby eliminating the threat of heuristic attacks. To further reduce the chance of robots accidently passing a challenge, this approach analyzes the decisions made on neutral images. If the outcome would have been different had the challenge results included the neutral images, those images are added to a 'trap'' database and included in future challenges.

A mechanical-rotary impedance actuator (the MeRIA) is presented that is based on the controllable effective length of a mechanical bending bar, which can be implemented into an orthosis for future research on rehabilitation training. The actuator provides joint motion and variable stiffness, simultaneously. The control task can be decoupled to be a decentralized control structure for which the controller of the two motor power sources can be designed respectively. For the movement control-loop, a cascaded impedance controller with position-torque-velocity control-loops are designed to maintain a stable and safe working environment. Using an H∞ loop-shaping methodology, a robust stabilization torque controller is achieved. The trade-off between the actuators performance and stability is taken into account to obtain a desired shape as a precondition of an H∞ controller synthesis. The actuator is tested on a test bench using rapid control prototyping. A model reduction algorithm is implemented to simplify the controller, and a prefilter design reduces the control-loop overshoot, thereby improving the robust stability and tracking performance during application. Experiments show that the MeRIA meets all the requirements for a mechanical device attached to the body. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Human-robot interaction; Impedance control; Rehabilitation robotics; Robust control; Variable stiffness actuator","Actuators; Closed loop control systems; Decentralized control; Economic and social effects; Human robot interaction; Mechanical actuators; Robotics; Robots; Robust control; Robustness (control systems); Stiffness; Human-Robotic interaction; Impedance control; Impedance controllers; Rapid control prototyping; Rehabilitation robotics; Rehabilitation training; Robust stabilization; Variable stiffness; Controllers",2-s2.0-84994030717

The main reasons for this trend are the ever increasing new range of applications (e.g., human-robot interaction, gaming, sports performance analysis) which are driven by current technological advances. Although recent approaches have dealt with several challenges and have reported remarkable results, 3D pose estimation remains a largely unsolved problem because real-life applications impose several challenges which are not fully addressed by existing methods. For example, estimating the 3D pose of multiple people in an outdoor environment remains a largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we review the recent advances in 3D human pose estimation from RGB images or image sequences. We propose a taxonomy of the approaches based on the input (e.g., single image or video, monocular or multi-view) and in each case we categorize the methods according to their key characteristics. To provide an overview of the current capabilities, we conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches in a synthetic dataset created specifically for this task, which along with its ground truth is made publicly available for research purposes.

It arose from an interest in reducing patient trauma by operating through smaller incisions with videoscopic assistance. In the United States, following two clinical trials, the FDA approved the daVinci Surgical System in 2002 for intra-cardiac surgery. This device has undergone three iterations, eventuating in the current daVinci XI. At present it is the only robotic device approved for mitral valve surgery. Many larger centers have adopted its use as part of their routine mitral valve repair armamentarium. Although these operations have longer perfusion and arrest times, complications have been either similar or less than other traditional methods. Preoperative screening is paramount and leads to optimal patient selection and outcomes. There are clear contraindications, both relative and absolute, that must be considered. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic studies optimally guide surgeons in operative planning. Herein, we describe the selection criteria as well as our operative management during a robotic mitral valve repair. Major complications are detailed with tips to avoid their occurrence. Operative outcomes from the author's series as well as those from the largest experiences in the United States are described. They show that robotic mitral valve repair is safe and effective, as well as economically reasonable due to lower costs of hospitalization. Thus, the future of this operative technique is bright for centers adopting the ""heart team"" approach, adequate clinical volume and a dedicated and experienced mitral repair surgeon. © Annals of Cardiothoracic Surgery.","DaVinci system; Mitral valve; Repair; Robot; Robot-assisted",,2-s2.0-85020440997

However, at the moment of its development, the freshness of actor-network theory was more relevant to its focus on the meaning of what the hyphen signifies; not so much just a simple connection between two independent variables, but an ontological event itself, from which certain entities juxtaposed together become involved by exchanging stable influences each other thus settled down as the actors participating in a network being associated as the summing up of these settled influences. The aim of this paper is to refresh this bygone freshness of ANT from the recent development of the Internet of Things (IoT); which vividly exemplifies how a network and its actors are generated from a manifold technologically augmented entities—such as smart appliances in a house, migratory animals with RFID tags, and ensembles of neurons signaling beyond one's brain through a bundle of microwires—each of which is physiologically or algorithmically adaptable to the environmental signals from other entities thus able to be settled down together into “new sensor/processor/actuator affiliations.” Brain-Machine Interface (BMI), developed by Nicolelis Lab at Duke University as a prototype of the future neuroprosthetics, shows a specific example of these networks of things; in which mutual adaptations of the technologically augmented entities—namely neurons and robot limbs—associate artificial sensory-motor circuits, programming its human/animal users’ possible motor behaviors as well as their motor intentions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Actor-network; Brain-Machine Interface; Internet of things; Neuroprosthetics; Nicolelis","Brain; Internet; Internet of things; Networks (circuits); Neural prostheses; Robot programming; Social sciences computing; Actor-network; Brain machine interface; Brain machine interface (BMIs); Environmental signals; Independent variables; Internet of thing (IOT); Neuroprosthetics; Nicolelis; Brain computer interface; actor network theory; brain; Internet; technology adoption; Animalia",2-s2.0-84988375096

Methods: Three single-port robotic radical perineal prostatectomies and two pelvic lymph node dissections were performed on three male cadavers to assess the feasibility of the SP1098 da Vinci robotic platform. The steps in the procedure included division of the rectourethralis muscle, splitting of the levator ani muscles bilaterally, opening of Denonvilliers fascia with dissection of the seminal vesicles, apical dissection and urethral division, anterior and lateral dissection with ligation of prostatic pedicles, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and creation of the new vesico-urethral anastomosis. The main outcomes assessed were operating time per step, total operating time, intra-operative complications and need for conversion to conventional or open techniques. Results: No conversions were required. No intra-operative complications were seen. The median (range) operating time for performing single-port robotic radical perineal prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection was 210 (180–240) min. Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility and efficacy of a novel, purpose-built robotic system in performing single-port radical perineal prostatectomy and describe, for the first time, the feasibility of robotic perineal lymph node dissection. This single-port system will facilitate single-port applications and allow surgeons to perform major urological operations via a small, single incision while preserving triangulation and optics, and eliminating clashing between instruments.

Also, the lack of publicly available datasets for children with annotated emotion labels leads most researchers to focus on adults. In this paper, we introduce a newly collected multimodal emotion dataset of children between the ages of four and fourteen years old.

Microsurgery is, in fact, expected to gain importance in a growing range of surgical specialties as novel technologies progressively enable the detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases at earlier stages. Within such scenarios, robotic microsurgery emerges as one of the key components of future surgical interventions, and will be a vital technology for addressing major surgical challenges. Nonetheless, several issues have yet to be overcome in terms of mechatronics, perception and surgeon-robot interfaces before microsurgical robots can achieve their full potential in operating rooms.

The following article summarizes the main contributions to the workshop. The Workshop consensus was that since video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is becoming the mainstream approach to resectable lung cancer in North America and Europe, robotic surgery for thoracic oncology is likely to be embraced by an increasing numbers of thoracic surgeons, since it has technical advantages over VATS, including intuitive movements, tremor filtration, more degrees of manipulative freedom, motion scaling, and high-definition stereoscopic vision. These advantages may make robotic surgery more accessible than VATS to trainees and experienced surgeons and also lead to expanded indications.

The center of gravity of the robot is carefully designed to allow the robot to jump on the surface continuously and smoothly. The influences of several critical factors, including the area of the supporting legs, the spring stiffness, the jumping angle, etc on jumping ability are analyzed by means of dynamic simulation and experiments. The jumping performance under different jumping angles is tested. The fabricated robot weighs approximately 10.2 g and can continuously jump on water with a maximum leap height and length of 120 and 410 mm, respectively.

Existing Omni-directional treadmills are heavy, complex and exhibit low power transmission efficiency. Their substantial drawback is limitation of rapid acceleration and deceleration, which make them inadequate for applications that require high acceleration and deceleration, such as training of soldiers in virtual environment.

Considering the complexity and difficulty of measuring the gas film stiffness and system damping of a spiral groove dry gas seal, a test system is designed to study the stability of the dry gas seal. Vibration amplitude of the stationary ring and gas film is measured in this study by writing a LabVIEW test program, adopting a high-precision improved eddy current micro-sensor, obtaining a series of anti-interference measures, and so on. The velocity diagram of the stationary ring and frequency spectrum are processed. According to the data, the variation of gas film stiffness and system damping is analyzed under different operating conditions. The measurement results of gas film stiffness and system damping for the dry gas seal show that at the rotating speed of 1000-3000 r/min and a medium pressure of 0.2-0.6 MPa, the range of gas film stiffness values is 4.8×108-1.50×109 N/m and the range of system damping values is 7.2×104-2.15×105 N.s/m. Both variations of gas film stiffness and system damping are nonlinear. The gas film stiffness value decreases with an increase in rotating speed and increases with an increase in pressure. The system damping value remains stable despite a change in pressure and decreases with an increase in rotating speed.

It is well-established that data and informatics are key factors for efficient and smart firefighting operation.

Consideration of the effects based on a multi-agent simulation is useful, and in a previous study, we showed the preliminary results of such simulation. In this study, we extend the simulation and investigate the effects of the location and capacity of personal mobility sharing stations.

The existing classification of these designs focuses on either their mobility or contact of the robot with the pipe inner surface. Such classification fails to provide a framework to guide the design of such robots. In this paper, we first propose a new approach to the devices classification and then apply it to the classification of in-pipe robots. This new approach has three features. The first feature is that classification of a device includes the function along with the context of the device. The second feature is that classification of a device starts with classification based on the operating principle of the device. The third feature is that classification of a device based on the complexity of the device especially the coupling property of the device. Classification of a device or system is an important step towards a more rational and systematic analysis and evaluation of the system, which is conducive to design innovation for discovery of new operating principles and new devices.

However the majority of researches assume that the flow field where the fish swims is a steady one, ignoring the fact that fish in nature has to deal with diverse flow fields. This takes part of responsibility for the low efficiency of robotic fish comparing with live one. In this paper, we present one experimental system which could form steady flow field and utilize the information collected from it on the robot as closed-loop control feedback. With this information we can infer the state of flow so that we can manipulate the robot to adopt corresponding swimming strategy which could increase the swimming efficiency markedly. To get information on the flow field we employ pressure transducer attached on the robotic fish prototype to detect the water surrounding the robot. And this system takes advantage of robot operating system (ROS) ensuring its flexibility and extensibility in future improvement. An experiment conducted on this platform indicates it can distinguish the speed of flow, verifying its feasibility and capability to conduct other experiments on closed-loop control. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Closed loop control systems; Efficiency; Fish; Flow fields; Industrial electronics; Robots; Steady flow; Bio-robotics; Closed loops; Closed-loop control; Experimental system; Future improvements; Robot operating systems (ROS); Robotic fishes; Speed of flows; Robotics",2-s2.0-84997190962

Therefore, it is adequate for modelling arbitrarily large deflections of a catheter with linear elastic analysis at the local element level. A novel design of active cardiac catheter of 9 Fr in diameter at the beginning of the paper is proposed, which is based on the contra-rotating double helix patterns and is improved from the previous prototypes. The modelling section is followed by MATLAB simulations of various deflections when the catheter is exerted different types of loads. This proves the feasibility of the presented modelling approach.

The pneumoperitoneum, which is normally applied in these surgeries to provide visual clarity and space to perform the procedure, may cause hemodynamic disturbance, potentially myocardial injury. Thus surgeons have recently considered opting for the low-pressure pneumoperitoneum to lower this negative impact. Herein we describe a protocol for a clinical trial to compare the impact of prolonged low-pressure and standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum on myocardial injury after robot-assisted surgery. Methods/design: This study is designed to be a bicenter clinical trial. In total 280 patients scheduled to undergo robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or robot-assisted radical cystectomy will be enrolled and randomized into two groups, with standard- (12-16 mmHg) and low-pressure (7-10 mmHg) pneumoperitoneum, respectively. Troponin T will be measured as the primary endpoint to assess the extent of myocardial injury. Nt-proBNP and hemodynamic indexes will also be recorded for further analysis. Discussion: The significance of this study is emphasized by the fact that there are few studies that have focused on the impact of prolonged pneumoperitoneum on myocardial injury, which is relevant to postoperative mortality. We hope that the conclusions drawn from this study could provide reference and basis to the future of the pneumoperitoneum in clinical practice.

The robot has a bio-inspired design by employing four Festo fluidic actuators that mimic skeletal muscles to actuate three rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs). A position controller in task space was developed to track the predefined trajectory of the end effector. The position tracking was achieved by the length tracking of each actuator in joint space by inverse kinematics. A stroke patient with drop foot participated in the trial as a case study to evaluate the potential of this robot for clinical applications. The patient gave positive feedback in using the ankle robot for the treatment of drop foot, although some limitations exist. The trajectory tracking showed satisfactory accuracy throughout the whole training with varying ranges of motion, with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) value being 0.0408 rad and the normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) value being 8.16%.

For successful task achievement, efficient information sharing between the modules, better perception of configuration and well-structured motion sequence or docking are very important. In a scenario where sharing resources between different configurations is a priority, it is crucial to have a well-defined, energy-efficient, task-specific and effective strategy of operation. This paper presents a method to (1) discover the topology of a given structure by a master module in a recursive manner, (2) share the information with another master module to compare the utility of current or future configurations and (3) make a successful docking attachment. These all use automata theory to minimize calculation overhead. The first two methods were tested in simulation for an arbitrary ModRED II (Modular Robot for Exploration and Discovery) configuration with nine modules that uses serial communication between modules, and the third was validated in hardware. © 2016 IEEE.","Automata; Configuration Detection; Modular Robots; Task Adaptation","Automata theory; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Information dissemination; Modular robots; Automata; Functionality driven; Hybrid automatons; Information sharing; Self reproduction; Serial communications; Sharing resources; Task adaptation; Robots",2-s2.0-84994300012

The method consists of two steps. The first step is to determine an optimal future time and the target object’s corresponding motion state for the robot to capture the tumbling object, so that, at the time when the gripper of the robot intercepts the target the very first instant, the resulting impact or disturbance to the attitude of the base spacecraft will be minimal. The second step is to control the robot to reach the tumbling object at the predicted optimal time along an optimal trajectory. The optimal control problem is solved with random uncertainties in the initial and final boundary conditions. Uncertainties are introduced because sensor and estimation errors inevitably exist in the first step, i.e., determination process of the initial and final boundary conditions. The application of the method is demonstrated using a dynamics simulation example. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Capture; Minimal impact; Optimal control; Space robot; Tumbling object; Tumbling target; Uncertainties","Boundary conditions; Optimal control systems; Orbits; Robots; Space debris; Spacecraft; Capture; Minimal impact; Optimal controls; Space robots; Uncertainties; Manipulators",2-s2.0-84990857120

The main aim is to integrate a charging system which allows the batteries to be charged from solar panels, wall outlet, and a deployable solar charging station. The proposed system is divided in three sections: design of solar panels, design of a battery charger and design of a DC-DC converter with fuzzy MPPT tracking system. This paper will cover only up to the design of the DC-DC converter, as further work is still pending design/results. For the design of the solar panels, different cell configurations were considered. Once the solar panels were designed and fitted to the robot, we determined the battery requirements to meet the robot power load and payload. Lithium Polymer batteries were chosen as the power source for the robot since they have a competitive power density to weight ratio. In order to extend the battery life, and simplify the load, we decided to take two battery banks. One battery is charging while the other battery is discharging. This allowed us to precisely control the battery charging profile without load variations interfering with our measurements. We used a fuzzy maximum power point tracking controller with a primary focus on regulating the power input for a lipo. Different topologies of DC-DC converters were considered and based on our literature research, it was concluded that a Buck-Boost converter is the most appropriate option when working with solar cells.

In this paper, the stabilization control of TSR during target capturing is studied. The space tether is described by the lumped mass model, and the impact dynamic model for target capturing is derived using the Lagrange method with the consideration of space tether length, in/out-plane angles, and gripper attitude. Given the structure of the TSR's gripper, a position-based impedance control method is proposed for target capturing operation. The neural network is used to estimate and compensate the uncertainties in the dynamic model of TSR, and an adaptive robust controller is designed to overcome the influence of the space tether and track the desired position generated by impedance controller. Numerical simulations suggest that the proposed controller can realize the stabilization of TSR during target capturing; besides, the uncertainties of the TSR can effectively be compensated via adaptive law and the influence of the space tether can be suppressed via the robust control strategy, which lead to smaller overshoot, less convergence time, and higher control accuracy during capturing operation. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive control; impedance control; target capturing; tethered space robot (TSR)","Controllers; Dynamic models; Grippers; Robots; Robust control; Space tethers; Stabilization; Tetherlines; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptive Control; Adaptive robust controllers; Impedance control; Impedance control methods; Stabilization control; Stabilization methods; Target capturing; Tethered space robots; Adaptive control systems",2-s2.0-84983568824

This discipline has seen major changes related to the development of new tracers, instrumentation and software. The goal of this review is to comment on current development and perspectives in the RS field. The review is based on published papers that highlight the role of RS and explore current advances such as the Guided intraOperative Scintigraphic Tumour Targeting (GOSTT) concept, which established the see, open and see strategy and propose a new one, Guided Hybrid intraOperative Specific Targeting (GHOST). We examine the development of radioactive, fluorescent and hybrid tracers and corresponding instrumentation and software to detect them and suggest ways in which these developments could be integrated. The role of hybrid tracers in RS, in particular 99mTc nanocolloid indocyanine green on sentinel node procedures, is highlighted. Labeled specific targeted peptides, antibodies and nanostructures will allow better preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative localization of tissue of interest. Photodynamic therapy could be applied during surgery to eliminate residual tumoral tissue. In the follow up, patients could be considered for treatment with targeted radiotherapy. RS has moved from open surgery to laparoscopic and robotic surgery. In each of them it is possible to add fluorescent, radioactive and hybrid modules able to detect labeled tissue of interest, while preserving healthy ones. As we have seen, RS is advancing through an interdisciplinary collaboration that will provide surgeons with new tools to improve surgical outcomes. © 2016, Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.","99mTc nanocolloid-indocyanine green; GHOST; GOSTT; Hybrid tracers; Radioguided surgery","epidermal growth factor receptor 2; indocyanine green; nanomaterial; technetium 99m; tracer; trastuzumab; cellular distribution; guided intraoperative scintigraphic tumour targeting; human; imaging software; imaging system; intraoperative imaging; isotope labeling; laparoscopy; near infrared imaging system; nonhuman; peroperative care; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; prostate cancer; radioguided surgery; radiosurgery; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; robot assisted surgery",2-s2.0-84988729318

Rosie is a tabletop robot implemented in the Soar architecture that learns new tasks from online interactive language instruction. In the past, the features of each task's goal were explicitly described by a human instructor through language. In this work, we develop and study additional techniques for learning representations of goals. For game tasks, the agent can be given visual demonstrations of goal states, refined by human instructions. For procedural tasks, the agent uses information derived from task execution to determine which state features must be included in its goal representations. Using both approaches, Rosie learns correct goal representations from a single goal example or task execution across multiple games, puzzles, and procedural tasks. As expected, in most cases, the number of words required to teach the task is reduced when visual goal demonstrations are used.

Various current systems include a robotic arm, robotic-guided cutting jigs, and robotic milling systems with a diversity of different navigation strategies using active, semiactive, or passive control systems. Semiactive systems have become dominant, providing a haptic window through which the surgeon is able to consistently prepare an arthroplasty based on preoperative planning. A review of previous designs and clinical studies demonstrate that these robotic systems decrease variability and increase precision, primarily focusing on component positioning and alignment. Some early clinical results indicate decreased revision rates and improved patient satisfaction with robotic-assisted arthroplasty. The future design objectives include precise planning and even further improved consistent intraoperative execution. Despite this cautious optimism, many still wonder whether robotics will ultimately increase cost and operative time without objectively improving outcomes. Over the long term, every industry that has seen robotic technology be introduced, ultimately has shown an increase in production capacity, improved accuracy and precision, and lower cost. A new generation of robotic systems is now being introduced into the arthroplasty arena, and early results with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty have demonstrated improved accuracy of placement, improved satisfaction, and reduced complications.

In the evaluation of such ambient assisted living solutions, both the technical and user perspectives are important to prove usability, effectiveness and safety, and to ensure adequate device application. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the methodology of studies evaluating robotic rollators with focus on the user perspective and to give recommendations for future evaluation studies. Methods: A systematic literature search up to December 31, 2014, was conducted based on the Cochrane Review methodology using the electronic databases PubMed and IEEE Xplore. Articles were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: evaluation studies of robotic rollators documenting human-robot interaction, no case reports, published in English language. Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified that met the predefined inclusion criteria. Large heterogeneity in the definitions of the target user group, study populations, study designs and assessment methods was found across the included studies. No generic methodology to evaluate robotic rollators could be identified. We found major methodological shortcomings related to insufficient sample descriptions and sample sizes, and lack of appropriate, standardized and validated assessment methods. Long-term use in habitual environment was also not evaluated. Conclusions: Apart from the heterogeneity, methodological deficits in most of the identified studies became apparent. Recommendations for future evaluation studies include: clear definition of target user group, adequate selection of subjects, inclusion of other assistive mobility devices for comparison, evaluation of the habitual use of advanced prototypes, adequate assessment strategy with established, standardized and validated methods, and statistical analysis of study results.

However, the use of robots in medicine has only 30Â years of history. The application of robots in surgery originates from the need of modern man to achieve two goals: the telepresence and the performance of repetitive and accurate tasks. The first “robot surgeon” used on a human patient was the PUMA 200 in 1985. In the 1990s, scientists developed the concept of “master–slave” robot, which consisted of a robot with remote manipulators controlled by a surgeon at a surgical workstation. Despite the lack of force and tactile feedback, technical advantages of robotic surgery, such as 3D vision, stable and magnified image, EndoWrist instruments, physiologic tremor filtering, and motion scaling, have been considered fundamental to overcome many of the limitations of the laparoscopic surgery. Since the approval of the da VinciÂ® robot by international agencies, American, European, and Asian surgeons have proved its factibility and safety for the performance of many different robot-assisted surgeries. Comparative studies of robotic and laparoscopic surgical procedures in general surgery have shown similar results with regard to perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes. However, higher costs and lack of haptic feedback represent the major limitations of current robotic technology to become the standard technique of minimally invasive surgery worldwide. Therefore, the future of robotic surgery involves cost reduction, development of new platforms and technologies, creation and validation of curriculum and virtual simulators, and conduction of randomized clinical trials to determine the best applications of robotics.

However, people do not remain locked in synchrony; Instead, they repeatedly enter and exit synchrony. In many important interactions, such as therapy, marriage and parent-infant communication, it is the ability to exit and then re-enter synchrony that is thought to build strong relationship. The phenomenon of entry into zero-phase synchrony is well-studied experimentally and in terms of mathematical modeling. In contrast, exit-from-synchrony is understudied. Here, we focus on human motion coordination, and examine the exit-from-synchrony phenomenon using experimental data from the mirror game paradigm, in which people perform joint improvised motion, and from human tracking of computer-generated stimuli. We present a mathematical mechanism that captures aspects of exit-from-synchrony in human motion. The mechanism adds a random motion component when the accumulated velocity error between the players is small. We introduce this mechanism to several models for human coordinated motion, including the widely studied HKB model, and the predictor-corrector model of Noy, Dekel and Alon. In all models, the new mechanism produces realistic simulated behavior when compared to experimental data from the mirror game and from tracking of computer generated stimuli, including repeated entry and exit from zero-phase synchrony that generates a complexity of motion similar to that of human players. We hope that these results can inform future research on exit-from-synchrony, to better understand the dynamics of coordinated action of people and to enhance human-computer and human-robot interaction. © 2016 Dahan et al.

This is unlike most current techniques that rely heavily on machine learning to estimate the distribution as well as the profile of spatio-temporal quantities.

Multifunctional materials, sort of smart materials, can be activated by electrical stimuli so as to produce its geometry change or property change. There are many multifunctional materials available by the advent of nanotechnology, ranging from carbon nanotubes, graphene, inorganic nanoparticles, conducting polymers, and so on. However, future multifunctional smart materials should be harmonized with our living environment. Thus, it is natural to develop smart materials that can be renewable in the nature. Biopolymers are renewable materials that harmonize with environment.This chapter introduces multifunctional smart biopolymer composites and their actuator applications. Raw materials of biopolymers including cellulose, bacterial cellulose, chitosan, gelatin, starch, polylactic acid, and polyglycolic acid are introduced and their active behaviors are reviewed in terms of electronic and ionic working behaviors. Polymer films and gels are also taken into account in the review. Recently, cellulose has been rediscovered as an active material, namely electroactive paper (EAPap). This chapter explains the fabrication and actuation principle of EAPap and its three subareas in terms of piezoelectric EAPap, ionic EAPap, and hybrid EAPap along with their applications. To further improve functionality of biopolymers, hybrid composites of inorganic functional materials are introduced by incorporating carbon nanotubes, graphene, titanium dioxide, tin oxide, and metal nanoparticles with biopolymers. Their active behaviors in the presence of electrical or pH stimuli are also illustrated. Since biopolymers are biocompatible, biodegradable, capable of broad chemical modification, various actuator applications of multifunctional smart biopolymer composites are possible such as artificial muscles, biomimetic robots, reconfigurable lens systems, and so on. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Interfacing brain-inspired devices with the real brain is at the forefront of such emerging field, with the term ""neurobiohybrids"" indicating all those systems where such interaction is established. We argue that achieving a ""high-level"" communication and functional synergy between natural and artificial neuronal networks in vivo, will allow the development of a heterogeneous world of neurobiohybrids, which will include ""living robots"" but will also embrace ""intelligent"" neuroprostheses for augmentation of brain function. The societal and economical impact of intelligent neuroprostheses is likely to be potentially strong, as they will offer novel therapeutic perspectives for a number of diseases, and going beyond classical pharmaceutical schemes. However, they will unavoidably raise fundamental ethical questions on the intermingling between man and machine and more specifically, on how deeply it should be allowed that brain processing is affected by implanted ""intelligent"" artificial systems. Following this perspective, we provide the reader with insights on ongoing developments and trends in the field of neurobiohybrids. We address the topic also from a ""community building"" perspective, showing through a quantitative bibliographic analysis, how scientists working on the engineering of brain-inspired devices and brain-machine interfaces are increasing their interactions.

Human technology has created robotic moving systems that excel in movement on and within environments of societal interest: paved roads, open air and water. However, such devices cannot yet robustly and efficiently navigate (as animals do) the enormous diversity of natural environments which might be of future interest for autonomous robots; examples include vertical surfaces like trees and cliffs, heterogeneous ground like desert rubble and brush, turbulent flows found near seashores, and deformable/flowable substrates like sand, mud and soil. In this review we argue for the creation of a physics of moving systems - a 'locomotion robophysics' - which we define as the pursuit of principles of self-generated motion. Robophysics can provide an important intellectual complement to the discipline of robotics, largely the domain of researchers from engineering and computer science. The essential idea is that we must complement the study of complex robots in complex situations with systematic study of simplified robotic devices in controlled laboratory settings and in simplified theoretical models. We must thus use the methods of physics to examine both locomotor successes and failures using parameter space exploration, systematic control, and techniques from dynamical systems. Using examples from our and others' research, we will discuss how such robophysical studies have begun to aid engineers in the creation of devices that have begun to achieve life-like locomotor abilities on and within complex environments, have inspired interesting physics questions in low dimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter physics, and have been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex terrain.

Energy self-sufficiency may be within our reach if the robot is driven by electric motors and can be charged by solar energy, but this type of robot often has no self-locking joints, which leads to certain energy consumption against gravity even when they stand still; although the joint brake mechanism may be helpful, but shortcomings like energy penalty and lack of compact in mechanism that come with it will appear. If the joints are self-locking to ensure no energy consumption when the robot stands still, then the energy consumption when moving will increase dramatically. Based on the above problems, to minimize overall energy consumption of the robot when it's moving or long-time standing still, a hexapod robot design with optimal disposition of self-locking joints was given, the energy consumption optimization model was also built only considering that the robot had a specific motion which avoided a non-deterministic polynomial hard problem, and thus the model just needed to optimize the energy consumption instantaneously. A defect of such an existing optimization model based on the torque distribution algorithm was corrected by introducing the difference of torque transmission efficiencies of robot joints in forward and reverse drive; in order to adapt the compacted soil ground in hilly areas, the constraints of the existing model which were suitable for the rigid environment were modified based on terrain mechanics. For different self-locking joints configurations, there would be different energy consumption optimization models, and their corresponding objective functions were given separately; this allowed energy consumption comparison of different configurations being conducted based on the minimum values of objective functions from different optimization models, and then the self-locking joints must be positioned properly and used as few as possible in the optimal configuration. In order to validate the optimization models and the effect of optimal disposition of self-locking joints, an experiment and optimization simulations were carried out. Torque transmission efficiencies of a self-locking worm joint in forward and reverse drive were tested in the experiment. The test data agreed with the ones obtained from the theoretical formula, which proved the correctness for the model to introduce the difference of torque transmission efficiency and the accurateness of the model compared with the existing one. Optimization results of the model proposed in this paper were contrasted with that of the existing one through Matlab and Adams co-simulation. Comparison results show that: joint torques as the optimum solution obtained from the optimization model of this paper have fewer chances to do negative work when robot is moving, which is better in accord with the ""gravitationally decoupled actuation"" and ""coupled drive"" concepts, and thus the total energy consumption of robot can be further reduced by more than 40% compared with the existing model. For a given robot configuration, the power consumption is more than 38 W when standing still if the robot has no self-locking joints, and the energy consumption when moving is 3 times higher than the former one if all the joints are self-locking; only when applying the optimization model and the optimal joints disposition, the robot can not only stand still with no energy consumption but also consume energy basically at the same level as the former one when moving, and the energy consumption of the robot is only 14.2%, 45.5% and 16.3% higher than that with no self-locking joints when walking downhill, uphill along a 30° ramp and level, respectively. The energy consumption optimization model proposed in the paper provides theoretical supports for the design and optimization of agricultural hexapod robot with self-locking joints. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The use of ambiguous definitions in the scientific literature, and lack of common agreement on what should be measured, present large barriers to advancements in this area.

Six specific areas of evidence are critically important for supporting the continuing use of RARC for MIBC, including technical aspects of surgery, perioperative outcomes, complications, oncological outcomes, functional outcomes, and financial costs. Considerable progress has been made regarding these aspects and data show that RARC replicates the technical benchmarks of ORC in terms of success of cystectomy, lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion, and could offer advantages over the more-established technique. Despite some clear benefits of RARC (such as reduced blood loss) other perioperative outcomes, including duration of inpatient stay and 30-90 day complication rates, seem to be similar to those of ORC. Current data on oncological and functional outcomes are promising, but robust data from prospective studies will help determine the indications for use of RARC for treating MIBC in the future. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

This paper evaluates the feasibility of a robotic telemanipulation during thoracoscopic sutureless aortic valve implantation in cadavers. Methods: Cadavers were prepared with a five thoracosopic trocar setting, with a transthoracic clamp inserted in the first right intercostal space and the optics inserted in the second. Seven sutureless valve implantations were scheduled using 5 Sorin Perceval and 2 Medtronic 3f Enable valves. Results: In all cases performance of pericardial suspension, aortotomy and root exposure required less than 20 min. Native valve excision and sutureless bioprosthesis implantation was technically feasible in all cases. A satisfactory prosthesis sealing was ascertained visually and the absence of paravalvular leakages was assessed with a nerve hook test around the prosthetic flange.

However, successful HRI requires people to trust robots, and, in turn, the trust affects the interaction. Although prior research has examined the determinants of human-robot trust (HRT) during HRI, no research has examined the messages that people received before interacting with robots and their effect on HRT. We conceptualize these messages as SMART (Strategic Messages Affecting Robot Trust). Moreover, we posit that SMART can ultimately affect actual HRI outcomes (i.e., robot evaluations, robot credibility, participant mood) by affording the persuasive influences from user-generated content (UGC) on participatory Web sites. In Study 1, participants were assigned to one of two conditions (UGC/control) in an original experiment of HRT. Compared with the control (descriptive information only), results showed that UGC moderated the correlation between HRT and interaction outcomes in a positive direction (average Δr = +0.39) for robots as media and robots as tools. In Study 2, we explored the effect of robot-generated content but did not find similar moderation effects.

Within the past 15 years, unprecedented advances have been experienced in robotic surgery. Urology has been played an active role in these developments. Owing to innovations of robotic surgery, some technical limitations of conventional laparoscopy have been overcome. Especially, some technical limitations of conventional laparoscopic surgery requiring reconsTURction and operational challenges have significantly been solved. Despite these superior advantages, high cost of the method is the most important disadvantage. In the literature, the cost-effectiveness is the main point of discussions about robotic surgery. In the future, if the cost problem is resolved, robotic surgery will be the gold standard of treatment for the operations, such as partial nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, radical prostatectomy and radical cystectomy, which require more complex reconsTURction. © 2016, Galenos.

Unfortunately, inherent limitations of laparoscopy impeded widespread utilization of laparoscopic surgery in advanced procedures such as laparoscopic colectomy. Even as prospective and randomized trials demonstrated outcomes advantages for the patient, few surgeons introduced laparoscopic colectomy into their practice. Robotic surgery has offered solutions to these inherent limitations of laparoscopic surgery. Yulan Wang and Computer Motion introduced the first FDA approved robotic surgery assistant, AESOP. This robot responded to foot controls and subsequently oral commands providing tremor free reliable video-laparoscopic camera control. As video-laparoscopic colorectal surgery evolved, Colorectal Surgeons were plagued with the intrinsic limitations of laparoscopic surgery, such as motion reversal and motion amplification of the surgical instruments caused by the fulcrum effect of the abdominal wall trocar. Using Department of Defense grants and venture capital funding, two surgical technology companies, Computer Motion and Intuitive Surgery developed robotic surgical systems to overcome these limitations, Zeus and da Vinci, respectively. Although these robotic surgical systems were intended to perform remote battle-field surgery with the surgeon stationed on an aircraft carrier or remote MASH Hospital, state licensing issues and malpractice concerns prompted both companies to focus on surgery with the patient, surgeon and robot in the same operating room. Zeus gained FDA approval first and Da Vinci followed shortly after. Eventually patent conundrums proved only solvable by Intuitive buying out Computer Motion leading to a consolidation of the technology from both companies into the subsequent generations of Da Vinci. More recently, as Intuitive׳s patents begin to expire, new robotic surgery companies are entering the market with surgical robots targeting specific niches in the future robotic surgery market. In particular, MedRobotics, for example, will soon introduce a surgical robot given FDA approval for transanal resections of neoplastic lesions. Similarly, Titan will enter the market with a surgical robot at a substantially lower price-point that the da Vinci. Clearly, surgical robotic options for colorectal patients will continue to expand in the near future. The long-term use of these technologies, of course, will require a long period of prospective and randomized clinical trials. © 2016",,"Article; cholecystectomy; colorectal surgery; cost effectiveness analysis; digestive surgical equipment; human; imaging and display; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; muscle fatigue; operation duration; operative blood loss; postoperative pain; proprioception; quality of life; robotic surgical procedure; three dimensional imaging; treatment outcome; two dimensional imaging",2-s2.0-84995584068

They are used to improve the surface quality and get glossy surfaces with enhanced mechanical properties. In this paper, the authors first look into the fundamental principles of the ECM polishing technology. Then the main parameters that affect the ECM polishing process such as applied voltage, electrolyte concentration, rotational speed and polishing pressure are discussed, and the related research issues are raised. Studying these parameters will enhance the performance, increase the efficiency of ECM polishing technology and provide a useful reference for further developments. Up to date, automatic ECM polishing is limited for planarization process and surfaces with simple geometry such as hole-wall and rotary surfaces. In addition, in some of ECM finishing technologies, the limited available working space usually forces the manufacture to machine one part in multiple stages. Because robots have some advantages over conventional machines such as flexibility, low price and mechanical reconfigurability, they are an effective and economical solution for ECM polishing of geometrically complex workpieces. In order to advance the ECM technology for the next competitive stage where a promising quantitative and qualitative processing is required, the authors proposed that the future researches on ECM polishing should also include ECM polishing using robots. In addition, the authors propose several configurations and setups of robotic ECM polishing systems. The research topics in this area should include designing of new ECM polishing tools, investigating the synergistic effects of additional sources of energies such as magnetic field and ultrasonic vibrations besides the normal effect of ECM tools and developing models and control methods of the processes.

Robotic-assisted surgery has been available clinically for almost 15 years and was developed, in part, to address these concerns. Robotic-assisted surgery aims to improve TKA by enhancing the surgeon's ability to optimize soft tissue balancing, reproduce alignment, and restore normal knee kinematics. Current systems include a robotic arm with a variety of different navigation systems with active, semi-active, or passive control. Semi-active systems have become the dominant strategy, providing a haptic window through which the surgeon consistently prepares a TKA based on preoperative planning. A review of previous designs and clinical studies demonstrates that these robotic systems decrease variability and increase precision, primarily with the mechanical axis and restoration of the joint line. Future design objectives include precise planning and consistent intraoperative execution. Preoperative planning, intraoperative sensors, augmenting surgical instrumentation, and biomimetic surfaces will be used to re-create the 4-bar linkage system in the knee. Implants will be placed so that the knee functions with a medial pivot, lateral rollback, screw home mechanism, and patellar femoral tracking. Soft tissue balancing will become more than equalizing the flexion and extension gaps and will match the kinematics to a normal knee. Together, coupled with advanced knee designs, they may be the key to a patient stating, ""My knee feels like my natural knee."".

We developed a standardized value framework by using radar charts to visualize and communicate a wide range of patient outcomes and cost for three forms of prostate cancer treatment. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from men with low-risk prostate cancer who were treated with low-dose rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT), proton beam therapy, or robotic-assisted prostatectomy. Patient-reported outcomes comprised the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-50 domains for sexual function, urinary incontinence and/or bother, bowel bother, and vitality 12 months after treatment. Costs were measured by time-driven activity-based costing for the first 12 months of the care cycle. Outcome and cost data were plotted on a single radar chart for each treatment modality. Results: Outcome and cost data from patients who were treated with robotic-assisted prostatectomy (n = 381), proton beam therapy (n = 165), and LDR-BT (n = 238) were incorporated into the radar chart. LDR-BT seemed to deliver the highest overall value of the three treatment modalities; however, incorporation of patient preferences regarding outcomes may allow other modalities to be considered high-value treatment options. Conclusion: Standardization and visualization of outcome and cost metrics may allow more comprehensive and collaborative discussions about the value of health care services. Communicating the value framework by using radar charts may be an effective method to present total value and the value of all outcomes and costs in a manner that is accessible to all stakeholders. Variations in plotting of costs and outcomes will require future focus group initiatives.

Most of the published literature regarding robotic inguinal hernia repair has been performed by urologists who have dealt with this entity in a concomitant way during radical prostatectomies. General surgeons, who perform the vast majority of inguinal herniorrhaphies worldwide, have yet to describe the role of robotic inguinal hernia repair. Here, we describe our initial experience and create the foundation for future research questions regarding robotic inguinal hernia repair. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed in 78 patients who underwent robotic transabdominal preperitoneal TAPP inguinal hernia repair with a prosthetic mesh using the da Vinci platform (Intuitive Surgical Inc). Data collected included patient demographics, past medical history, previous surgeries, details related to the surgical procedure, perioperative outcomes and complications. Results: A total of 123 hernias were repaired. Forty-five patients had bilateral robotic inguinal herniorrhaphies, and the mean age was 55.1 years (SD 15.1), with a mean BMI of 27.6 (SD 6.1). There were 71 male and 7 female patients. Surgical complications included hematoma in three patients (3.9 %), two seromas (2.6 %) and one superficial surgical site infection at a trocar site (1.3 %), which resolved with oral antibiotics. Chronic postoperative complications (>30 days post-surgery) included the persistence of hematomas in two patients (2.6 %). Same day discharge was achieved in 60 patients (76.9 %) with a mean length of stay of 8 h (SD 2.65). Neither mortality nor conversion to open surgery occurred. Conclusion: Our early experience has demonstrated that the robotic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair is a safe and versatile approach that allows the general surgeon to perform this procedure in more complex cases such as those involving incarcerated and/or recurrent hernias. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Robotic hernia repair; Robotic hernioplasty; Robotic herniorrhaphy; Robotic inguinal hernia; Robotic TAPP","antibiotic agent; acute kidney failure; adult; Article; chronic kidney disease; comorbidity; feasibility study; female; follow up; hematoma; hernioplasty; herniorrhaphy; human; hypertension; hypotension; inguinal hernia; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; priority journal; retrospective study; robot assisted surgery; robotic inguinal hernia repair; seroma; sleep disordered breathing; superficial surgical site infection; surgical infection; suture; trocar; urine retention; Hernia, Inguinal; laparoscopy; robotic surgical procedure; surgical mesh; Feasibility Studies; Female; Hernia, Inguinal; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Surgical Mesh",2-s2.0-84952643246

There is a wide diversity of elements used by various modelling approaches for information and representation of product architecture, which incurs difficulties for multidisciplinary engineers working across different phases of design in capturing, visualising, sharing and tracing consistent yet common knowledge and elements across the function and structure domains. This prompts for fixation of detail and common modelling knowledge across both functional and structural analytical approaches which are also critical from automatised software perspective. A limitation of the existing approaches is that they tend to focus more on 'what' and less on 'how' (and vice versa). This article proposes an integrated conceptual product architecting approach that combines and expands the functional and structural modelling approaches, enabling capturing and tracing knowledge coherently through a common binding domain. This is underpinned by the view that most interaction requirements among the physical components during structural modelling can be derived from functional modelling. The proposed integrated approach is underpinned by the critical analysis and synthesis of the existing approaches in the literature dealing with functional and structural architecture analyses, integrated within a multiple domain matrix to fuse the knowledge of both solution-independent (functional) and solution-dependent (structural) analyses. The proposed framework is illustrated with a case study of solar robot toy, followed by discussion and suggestions for future work. © The Author(s) 2016.","functional modelling; multiple domain matrix; product architecture; product design; structural modelling","Conceptual design; Design; Integrated control; Analytical approach; Conceptual design stages; Design decomposition; Functional modelling; Multipledomain matrix (MDM); Product architecture; Structural architecture; Structural modelling; Product design",2-s2.0-84983035393

Here, we discuss appropriate CME procedure with regard to the oncologic backgrounds, essential components, applied anatomy, laparoscopic technique, short-term, and oncologic outcomes. The introduction of CME has improved oncologic outcomes greatly in patients with colon cancer. The improved outcomes with CME can be attributed to underlying sound oncologic principles such as dissection through the proper plane of mesocolic excision, central vascular ligation, and sufficient length of proximal and distal margins. Thereby, CME technique can achieve en bloc removal of the diseased lesion with the increased amount of the colonic mesentery even though the length of for both bowel and mesentery resection remains a matter of debate. CME is a technically demanding operation thus, comprehensive understanding of the applied vascular anatomy is essential for successful CME.

Typically, resistance during walking is provided using cable robots or weights that are secured to the distal shank of the subject. However, there exists no device that is wearable and capable of providing resistance across the joint, allowing over ground gait training. In this study, we created a lightweight and wearable device using eddy current braking to provide resistance to the knee. We then validated the device by having subjects wear it during a walking task through varying resistance levels. Electromyography and kinematics were collected to assess the biomechanical effects of the device on the wearer. We found that eddy current braking provided resistance levels suitable for functional strength training of leg muscles in a package that is both lightweight and wearable. Applying resistive forces at the knee joint during gait resulted in significant increases in muscle activation of many of the muscles tested. A brief period of training also resulted in significant aftereffects once the resistance was removed. These results support the feasibility of the device for functional strength training during gait.

Recent research into origami-inspired tubular geometries has suggested that geometric texturing is able to significantly improve metal pipe resistance to propagation buckling failures, with an increase in critical and propagation pressures. This paper aims to investigate whether texturing generates a similar improvement in hyperelastic tubes under axial loading and internal pressure, with elastomer origami structures of recent interest for use as soft actuators and robots. A new fabrication method with 3D printed moulds in a dip process was first developed to enable fabrication of textured tube samples. An experimental study was then conducted on inflated smooth and textured latex tubes, with instability formation observed at a 1 ms resolution. Comparative numerical models with a Mooney–Rivlin material were able to provide a good prediction of experimentally-observed behaviours up to and slightly past the critical pressure and bulge formation. A parametric numerical study is then conducted to show that the number of divisions in the axial direction and circumferential direction have no and modest effects on critical pressure, respectively. The experimental and numerical investigations both showed that the critical pressure of the textured tube was increased compared to the smooth tube, however the degree of increase was a modest 8% and so unlikely to be of significant practical benefit.

This robotic model is purely made of soft materials and allows two working modes that require very simple control: 1) deflate the soft fingers for bending to one direction therefore to open the gripper 'claw' and 2) inflate the fingers with compressed air for bending to the reverse direction, therefore to grip objects reversibly. Systematic tests of the gripping performance of the soft robotic model were conducted for 5 effective finger lengths ranging from 30 mm to 100 mm. Under each effective length, we measured the pull-off force of 8 sphere-shaped objects with diameters from 20 to 90mm, and five typical geometric shaped objects including sphere, cubic and cylinder etc. We also measured the pull-off force of gripping objects with different stiffness. Notably, we found that each object with different size prefer a 'sweet' effective finger length for generating maximum pull-off force. We show that tunable effective finger length for the soft robot can significantly improve the performance when gripping multiple objects. Current soft robotic prototype exhibits a simple-control, low-cost approach of grasping objects with different size, weight, and shape as well as material stiffness, and may open up new avenues for future industrial gripping. © 2016 TCCT.","gripper; pneumatic actuation; Soft robotics",,2-s2.0-84987858922

However, due to the busy work schedule for most of the pet owners and not being able to share the caring task with others, paying full time attention to the pet is almost impossible. To solve the mentioned problem, we aimed to develop intelligent and interactive system to bridge the gap between the pet and the pet owner. This research is based on the concept of the Internet of Things by using Linux operating system and Raspberry Pi board as development platform. The proposed system provides a smart phone application to the pet owner that can make real-time communication with the pet using internet. As an input module the owner can use the vision module of the system to have a view of his/her pet and as an output module can control the servo motors of the wearable device on the pet for feeding. In future, we hope this system can be improved and used by pet owners for real-time interaction with their pets from distance where they can be in the same location physically. © 2016 IEEE.","Human-Computer Interaction; Intelligent Robotics; Interactive Systems; Internet of Thing","Computer operating systems; Human robot interaction; Internet; Internet of things; Robotics; Smartphones; Systems analysis; Web browsers; Development platform; Intelligent robotics; Interactive system; LINUX- operating system; Real time interactions; Real-time communication; Smart-phone applications; Wearable devices; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-84988457175

Mobile robot not only has to execute predefined tasks programmed with, but also it must explore the unknown environment that might be pushed to work in. In this paper we propose, implement and test a new model for mobile robot environment using mono-vision system. This proposed system develops 3D environment model utilizing mono-vision system. The model is developed through capturing multiple shots from different locations. The 3D model describes the distance and the angle of objects with respect to the robot. Finally, the mobile robot will utilize this model to navigate its environment. This is achieved through projecting the 3D model into the motion floor and identifying the obstacles surrounding the robot. Then, the robot will avoid any object in its motion line. Most importantly, the model is updated continuously based on the changes in the environment and the location of the robot. © 2016 IEEE.","3D model; environment model; intelligent visionary mobile robot; mobile robot; monocular vision; obstacle avoidance; robot track plan","Collision avoidance; Intelligent robots; Mobile robots; Robots; 3-D environments; 3-d modeling; Environment modeling; Mobile robot systems; Monocular vision; Robot environment; Robot tracks; Unknown environments; Computer vision",2-s2.0-84987623724

The ability of using the upper limb is indispensable for a human being in everyday activities, making easy tasks like drinking a glass of water a real challenge. We can agree that physiotherapy promotes recovery, but not at an optimal level, due to limited financial and human resources. Hence, the need of robot-assisted rehabilitation emerges. A robot for upper-limb exercises should have a design that can accurately control interaction forces and progressively adapt assistance to the patients' abilities and also to record the patient's motion and evolution.

Pure dynamics model with successive integrations, Pythagorian Hodograph methods or fictive potential fields bring different drawbacks that cannot solve the problem of connecting 3D positions with associated complex set of constraints (speed orientation, curvature, torsion...) in a satisfying way. We propose in the present paper a new method based on enhanced 3D motions primitives. Their construction has been possible due to the transformation of flight loop numerical simulations into a symbolic and infinitely derivable model based on Beziers curves. Our algorithm defines strategic forms like cylinders referring to Dubins circles or vertical planes and hooks them up with the ad hoc 3D motion primitives while minimizing the curvilinear abscissa according to new principles, which are introduced. The concepts are tested for two path-planning problems and then validated against a reconstructed helicopter accident. The performance of the algorithm is measured versus an ideal Dubins-like 3D path metrics.

They involve the integration of autonomous elements into a new, higher-level organization whereby the former isolated units interact in novel ways, losing their original autonomy. All major transitions, which include the origin of life, cells, multicellular systems, societies or language (among other examples), took place millions of years ago. Are these transitions unique, rare events? Have they instead universal traits that make them almost inevitable when the right pieces are in place? Are there general laws of evolutionary innovation? In order to approach this problem under a novel perspective, we argue that a parallel class of evolutionary transitions can be explored involving the use of artificial evolutionary experiments where alternative paths to innovation can be explored. These ‘synthetic’ transitions include, for example, the artificial evolution of multicellular systems or the emergence of language in evolved communicating robots. These alternative scenarios could help us to understand the underlying laws that predate the rise of major innovations and the possibility for general laws of evolved complexity. Several key examples and theoretical approaches are summarized and future challenges are outlined. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Tire slip behaves differently depending on the surface type, the motion of the robot, and other environmental factors. Therefore, different kinds of situations and conditions are considered to estimate more accurate tire slip. Also as far as the tire slip is not based on actual data, it will be assumed to imitate the real tire slip behavior based on other study data.

This topic of research shares some similarities with robot coordination problems, inspiring our research on autonomous intersection management. In this article, we use a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for time-optimal robots coordination along specified paths and apply it to intersection management for autonomous vehicles. Our formulation allows to simultaneously solve a discrete optimal vehicle ordering problem, and a (discretized) continuous optimal velocity planning problem taking into account kinodynamics constraints. This allows faster pruning of the decision tree for the discrete problem, thus reducing computation time. A possible application for ITS is to evaluate the efficiency loss from a given vehicle ordering policy, or dynamically adapt policies to improve their efficiency. Moreover, any intermediary solution found by the solver can be used as a heuristically good policy, with proved bounds on sub-optimality. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Advanced traffic management systems; Decision trees; Efficiency; Highway traffic control; Information management; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Optimization; Robot programming; Robots; Vehicles; Amount of information; Autonomous intersection managements; Autonomous Vehicles; Intelligent transportation systems; Intersection managements; Mixed integer linear programming; Robot coordination; Traffic management systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",2-s2.0-84983239112

Surface electromyography can be used to create a user-driven control of a rehabilitation robot, in which the subject needs to engage actively, by using spared voluntary activation to trigger the assistance of the robot. Methods: The study investigated methods for the selective estimation of individual finger movements from high-density surface electromyographic signals (HD-sEMG) with minimal interference between movements of other fingers. Regression was evaluated in online and offline control tests with nine healthy subjects (per test) using a linear discriminant analysis classifier (LDA), a common spatial patterns proportional estimator (CSP-PE), and a thresholding (THR) algorithm. In all tests, the subjects performed an isometric force tracking task guided by a moving visual marker indicating the contraction type (flexion/extension), desired activation level and the finger that should be moved. The outcome measures were mean square error (nMSE) between the reference and generated trajectories normalized to the peak-to-peak value of the reference, the classification accuracy (CA), the mean amplitude of the false activations (MAFA) and, in the offline tests only, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCORR). Results: The offline tests demonstrated that, for the reduced number of electrodes (≤24), the CSP-PE outperformed the LDA with higher precision of proportional estimation and less crosstalk between the movement classes (e.g., 8 electrodes, median MAFA ~ 0.6 vs. 1.1 %, median nMSE ~ 4.3 vs. 5.5 %). The LDA and the CSP-PE performed similarly in the online tests (median nMSE < 3.6 %, median MAFA < 0.7 %), but the CSP-PE provided a more stable performance across the tested conditions (less improvement between different sessions). Furthermore, THR, exploiting topographical information about the single finger activity from HD-sEMG, provided in many cases a regression accuracy similar to that of the pattern recognition techniques, but the performance was not consistent across subjects and fingers. Conclusions: The CSP-PE is a method of choice for selective individual finger control with the limited number of electrodes (<24), whereas for the higher resolution of the recording, either method (CPS-PA or LDA) can be used with a similar performance. Despite the abundance of detection points, the simple THR showed to be significantly worse compared to both pattern recognition/regression methods. Nevertheless, THR is a simple method to apply (no training), and it could still give satisfactory performance in some subjects and/or simpler scenarios (e.g., control of selected fingers). These conclusions are important for guiding future developments towards the clinical application of the methods for individual finger control in rehabilitation robotics. © 2016 The Author(s).","Finger control; Hand rehabilitation; High-Density electrodes; Human-machine interfaces; Machine learning; Rehabilitation robotics; Surface electromyography","adult; algorithm; analytic method; Article; electromyogram; electromyography; finger; human; human experiment; joint function; linear discriminant analysis classifier; male; medical device; muscle contraction; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; musculoskeletal system parameters; normal human; performance; priority journal; robotics; sensitivity and specificity; devices; electrode; electromyography; female; finger; machine learning; movement (physiology); online system; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; signal processing; stroke rehabilitation; Adult; Algorithms; Electrodes; Electromyography; Female; Fingers; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Machine Learning; Male; Movement; Online Systems; Psychomotor Performance; Robotics; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Stroke Rehabilitation",2-s2.0-84985038288

To realize these concepts, a human-robot interaction system together with a collision avoidance system are developed to enable a safe navigation of the mobile robots. In this system, when a robot meets people in its path, it will try to interact with the human to execute one of the three actions: move forward, move backward, and collision avoidance; or the robot will implement the collision-avoidance autonomously when no people interacted with it.

Assessments are necessary to plan and adjust the therapy in order to maximize the chances of individual recovery. Nowadays, however, assessments are seldom used in clinical practice due to administrative constraints or to inadequate validity, reliability and responsiveness. In clinical trials, more sensitive and reliable measurement scales could unmask changes in physiological variables that would not be visible with existing clinical scores. In the last decades robotic devices have become available for neurorehabilitation training in clinical centers. Besides training, robotic devices can overcome some of the limitations in traditional clinical assessments by providing more objective, sensitive, reliable and time-efficient measurements. However, it is necessary to understand the clinical needs to be able to develop novel robot-aided assessment methods that can be integrated in clinical practice. This paper aims at providing researchers and developers in the field of robotic neurorehabilitation with a comprehensive review of assessment methods for the lower extremities. Among the ICF domains, we included those related to lower extremities sensorimotor functions and walking; for each chapter we present and discuss existing assessments used in routine clinical practice and contrast those to state-of-the-art instrumented and robot-aided technologies.

We have designed a new approach to enable robots to perceive human group motion in real time to anticipate future actions and synthesize their own motion accordingly. We explore this within the context of joint action, in which humans and robots move together synchronously. In this paper we present an anticipation method, which takes high-level group behavior into account. We validate the method within a human-robot interaction scenario, in which an autonomous mobile robot observes a team of human dancers and then successfully and contingently coordinates its movements to 'join the dance.' We compared the results of our anticipation method to move the robot with another method that did not rely on high-level group behavior and found that our method performed better both in terms of more closely synchronizing the robot's motion to the team and exhibiting more contingent and fluent motion. These findings suggest that the robot performs better when it has an understanding of high-level group behavior than when it does not.

Method: This paper reviews various representative patents, productions and papers related to omnidirectional wheels. Their structures and working principles are introduced, compared and analyzed. Results: Current and future developments of the omni-directional wheels are finally provided and discussed. Conclusion: Developing an omni-directional wheel which can be used in common at anywhere is impractical. It is effective and reasonable to develop modified omni-directional wheels based on above four kinds of wheels to satisfy different requirements for the wheeled mobile robot. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.","Ball wheel; Loading capacity; Mecanum wheel; Mobility; Omni-directional wheel; Orthogonal wheel; Rover wheel; Wheeled mobile robot","Carrier mobility; Domestic appliances; Interplanetary spacecraft; Mobile robots; Patents and inventions; Robots; Wheels; Ball wheels; Loading capacities; Mecanum wheels; Omni-directional; Rover wheels; Wheeled mobile robot; Loading",2-s2.0-84987660303

Such behavior becomes a factor hindering a smooth walking. When robots will come to be used in our immediate environment in the future, similar situations are likely to occur. The objective of this study is to determine the appropriate avoidance action (direction and timing) that a robot should take in order to minimize the risk of coming face to face with a pedestrian, in situations where the two parties, who share a common travel line, pass one another. First, two experiments were conducted using human subjects to investigate the walking tendencies (gait characteristics) when a person walks past another oncoming person. Here, we examined the relationship between the landed foot and the direction in which it is easier to move and the tendencies of the avoidance direction when a person makes a sudden move to avoid another oncoming person. Based on the results, we proposed the avoidance action that the robot must take when it passes a human pedestrian, and confirmed its effectiveness through a verification experiment. © 2016, Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics.

Advances in the field of social robotics have provided a promising route to deliver AAI while avoiding these aforementioned obstacles. Although there has been promising initial research on social robotics in older adults, to date there has been no such research conducted with a veteran population. The present pilot study followed 23 veteran residents of a Veterans Affairs (VA) geropsychiatric long-term care facility over the span of approximately a year and a half. It was found that use of Paro, a social robot, resulted in increased observed positive affective and behavioral indicators, with concomitant decreases observed in negative affective and behavioral indicators. The authors concluded that Paro is likely an effective nonpharmacological approach for managing dementia-related mood and behavior problems with veterans in VA long term care facilities. They additionally observed that Paro is best presented to residents who are relatively calm and approachable, as opposed to actively exhibiting behavior or mood problems. Future research directions are discussed in light of both the positive results noted and the inherent limitations of our pilot study.

TWCs have two distinctive features. First, they are soft interactive devices, which look like tender animals, able to arise attachment emotions and give a continuous reassuring physical contact. Second, TWCs are embedded social robots responding to the child’s manipulations by emitting lights, sounds, or vibrations usable for multiple purposes, for example to enhance the child’s engagement. TWCs can have additional important features. First, the input–output rules with which they respond to the child’s actions can be changed by the therapist/caregiver, for example through a tablet, thus opening a large number of possibilities to foster social interaction. Second, TWCs can have biosensors gathering information on the child’s physiological and emotional state, thus offering multiple ways to support the interaction with the child during therapy and daily life. The paper presents the principles underlying TWC design, their possible future enhancements, a first prototype (+me) of social TWC, and possible empirical experiment procedures to test the effectiveness of TWC in controlled experiments. For their multifaceted and flexible features, TWCs might become an important tool to enhance ASD children’s social abilities in ecological and therapeutic contexts. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Autism; Biosensors; Emotional state; Interactivity; Social interaction; Therapy; Wearable","Biosensors; Diseases; Interactive devices; Social sciences; Wearable technology; Autism; Emotional state; Interactivity; Social interactions; Therapy; Wearable; Education",2-s2.0-84985962931

In this paper, the estimation of the terrain inclination is improved for walking in place on an inclination-varying slope. A passivity based admittance control utilizes the force/torque sensing in feet to actively regulate the impedance at the center of mass to stabilize the robot. The logic-based inclination estimation algorithm uses the feet to probe the terrain and deals with the under-actuation. The equilibrium set-point in the admittance control is regulated based on the detected inclination. The effectiveness of the control framework is validated on the humanoid robot COMAN and demonstrated by estimating the terrain inclination, coping with the under-actuation phase, adapting to the slope with changing inclination during both standing and walking.

In the case of an ectopic pregnancy, these risks are especially high. Case: A 29-year-old, gravida 1 female with a pregnancy at 9 weeks' gestational age, who presented for care, was found to have a uterine-horn ectopic pregnancy. Imaging confirmed the presence of a unicornuate uterus with the pregnancy located in a noncommunicating uterine horn. Excision of the ectopic pregnancy was recommended, and the patient underwent a robotic assisted resection of the noncommunicating rudimentary uterine horn and the pregnancy. Results: There were no postoperative complications. The patient's pathology was consistent with a tubal/cornual ectopic pregnancy. She stated that she would like to conceive in the future. Any future pregnancies in this patient will need to be monitored closely because of her risk of a higher complication rate. Conclusions: This is the first reported case describing a robotic approach as a feasible treatment option to minimize risk and complications. In the past, the patient in this case would likely have undergone an open procedure at risk for high blood loss and a prolonged recovery time. With the use of this approach, the patient underwent an uncomplicated, minimally invasive procedure with minimal blood loss.

Methods: Subjects were recruited during a robotic surgery curriculum. They were divided into three groups: the group RA with robotic bed-assistance experience, the group LS with laparoscopic surgical experience, and the control group without bed-assistance or laparoscopic experience. The subjects first performed two standard FLS exercises on a laparoscopic simulator for the assessment of basic laparoscopic skills. After that, they performed three virtual reality exercises on XTT, and then performed similar exercises on physical models on a da Vinci® box trainer. Results: Twenty-eight persons volunteered for and completed the tasks. Most expert subjects agreed on the realism of XTT and the three exercises, and also their interest for teamwork and bed-assistant training. The group RA and the group LS demonstrated a similar level of basic laparoscopic skills. Both groups performed better than the control group on the XTT exercises (p &lt; 0.05). The performance superiority of the group RA over LS was observed but not statistically significant. Correlation of performance was determined between the tests on XTT and on da Vinci® box trainer. Conclusions: The introduction of XTT facilitates the training of bedside assistants and emphasizes the importance of teamwork, which may change the paradigm of robotic surgery training in the near future. As an assessment tool of bed-assistance skills, XTT proves face, content, and concurrent validity. However, these results should be qualified considering the potential limitations of this exploratory study with a relatively small sample size. The training modules remain to be developed, and more complex and discriminative exercises are expected. Other studies will be needed to further determine construct validity in the future. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bedside assistant; Robotic simulator; Robotic surgical training; Validity; Virtual reality simulation; Xperience Team Trainer","adult; Article; concurrent validity; construct validity; content validity; controlled study; face validity; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; physical model; priority journal; robot assisted surgery; simulator; surgical training; teamwork; virtual reality; case control study; clinical competence; education; laparoscopy; robotic surgical procedure; simulation training; validation study; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Clinical Competence; Humans; Laparoscopy; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Simulation Training",2-s2.0-84949562077

The amount of direct hand-tool-tissue interaction and feedback in minimally invasive surgery varies from being attenuated in laparoscopy to being completely absent in robotic minimally invasive surgery. The role of haptic feedback during surgical skill acquisition and its emphasis in training have been a constant source of controversy. This review discusses the major developments in haptic simulation as they relate to surgical performance and the current research questions that remain unanswered. Search Strategy. An in-depth review of the literature was performed using PubMed. Results. A total of 198 abstracts were returned based on our search criteria. Three major areas of research were identified, including advancements in 1 of the 4 components of haptic systems, evaluating the effectiveness of haptic integration in simulators, and improvements to haptic feedback in robotic surgery. Conclusions. Force feedback is the best method for tissue identification in minimally invasive surgery and haptic feedback provides the greatest benefit to surgical novices in the early stages of their training. New technology has improved our ability to capture, playback and enhance to utility of haptic cues in simulated surgery. Future research should focus on deciphering how haptic training in surgical education can increase performance, safety, and improve training efficiency. © The Author(s) 2016.","haptic feedback; minimally invasive surgery; simulation","Article; general surgery; human; minimally invasive surgery; robot assisted surgery; simulator; surgical training; tactile feedback; tactile stimulation; virtual reality; computer interface; education; feedback system; minimally invasive surgery; simulation training; touch; Feedback; Humans; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Simulation Training; Touch; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-84978204522

Functional outcomes, in particular swallowing, have become of increasing interest in the debate regarding treatment options. Contemporary reviews on function following treatment frequently include surrogate markers and limit the value of comparative analysis. Objectives of review: A systematic review was performed to establish whether direct comparisons of swallowing outcomes could be made between trans-oral surgical approaches (trans-oral laser microsurgery (TLM)/trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS)) and (chemo)radiotherapy ((C)RT). Type of review: Systematic review. Search strategy: MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases were interrogated using the following MeSH terms: antineoplastic protocols, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, deglutition disorders, swallowing, lasers, and trans-oral surgery. Evaluation method: Two authors performed independent systematic reviews and consensus was sought if opinions differed. The WHO ICF classification was applied to generate analysis based around body functions and structure, activity limitations and participation restriction. Results: Thirty-seven citations were included in the analysis. Twenty-six papers reported the outcomes for OPSCC treatment following primary (C)RT in 1377 patients, and 15 papers following contemporary trans-oral approaches in 768 patients. Meta-analysis was not feasible due to varying methodology and heterogeneity of outcome measures. Instrumental swallowing assessments were presented in 13/26 (C)RT versus 2/15 TLM/TORS papers. However, reporting methods of these studies were not standardised. This variety of outcome measures and the wide-ranging intentions of authors applying the measures in individual studies limit any practical direct comparisons of the effects of treatment on swallowing outcomes between interventions. Conclusions: From the current evidence, no direct comparisons could be made of swallowing outcomes between the surgical and non-surgical modalities. Swallowing is a multidimensional construct, and the range of assessments utilised by authors reflects the variety of available reporting methods. The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory is a subjective measure that allows limited comparison between the currently available heterogeneous data, and is explored in detail. The findings highlight that further research may identify the most appropriate tools for measuring swallowing in patients with OPSCC. Consensus should allow their standardised integration into future studies and randomised control trials. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"cetuximab; cancer staging; case control study; chemoradiotherapy; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; fluoroscopy; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; laser surgery; meta analysis; multicenter study (topic); oral surgery; oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma; oropharynx carcinoma; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; questionnaire; retrospective study; Review; robot assisted surgery; swallowing; systematic review; transoral laser microsurgery; transoral robotic surgery; treatment outcome; videofluoroscopy",2-s2.0-84977477645

BCIs can also be useful for healthy individuals in situations limiting their movement or where other computer interaction modalities need to be supplemented. Event-related and steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are the top two brain signal types used in developing BCIs that allow the user to make a choice from a discrete set of options, including the selection of commands from a menu for a robot or computer to perform, as well as typing letters, symbols, or icons for communication. Popular BCI speller paradigms, such as the P300 Matrix Speller, RSVP KeyboardTM or SSVEP spellers in which the letters on the keyboard display flicker, are sensitive to the font, size and presentation speed. In addition, sensitivity to eye gaze control plays a significant role in usability of most of these keyboards. We present a code-VEP based BCI, utilized in a language model assisted keyboard application. Utilizing a cursor based selection method, stimuli and targets are separated. FlashTypeTM separates visual stimulation from alphabet presentation to achieve performance invariance under presentation variations. Therefore, FlashTypeTM can be used for all languages, including the ones containing symbols and icons. FlashTypeTM, contains a Static Keyboard, a row of Suggested Characters and a row of Predicted Words. FlashTypeTM, by default, uses only one EEG electrode and four stimuli. The system can operate using only one stimulus at a lower selection rate, useful for individuals with limited or no gaze control. This feature is to be explored in future.

For this theoretical team to exist, an interaction system must be developed that can translate utterances and autonomously organize and direct the agents into completing the task. This paper presents a task manager that uses on ontology to divide tasks into subtasks and finds the most capable agent to complete the task.

Think of self-driving cars, companion robots, and medical diagnosis support systems. Also, humans and machines will often need to work together and agree on common decisions. Thus hybrid collective decision making systems will be in great need. In these scenarios, both machines and collective decision making systems should follow some form of moral values and ethical principles (appropriate to where they will act but always aligned to humans'). In fact, humans would accept and trust more machines that behave as ethically as other humans in the same environment. Also, these principles would make it easier for machines to determine their actions and explain their behavior in terms understandable by humans. Moreover, often machines and humans will need to make decisions together, either through consensus or by reaching a compromise. This would be facilitated by shared moral values and ethical principles. In this paper we introduce some issues in embedding morality into intelligent systems.

Grid cells are particularly interesting in this regard, as they are thought to provide a general coordinate system of space. Artificial neural network models of grid cells show the ability to perform path integration, but important for a robot is also the ability to calculate the direction from the current location, as indicated by the path integrator, to a remembered goal. This paper presents a neural system that integrates networks of path integrating grid cells with a grid cell decoding mechanism. The decoding mechanism detects differences between multi-scale grid cell representations of the present location and the goal, in order to calculate a goal-direction signal for the robot.

The proposed method leverages the fact that existing solutions to both walking pattern generation and constrained nonlinear control have been independently constructed as Quadratic Programs (QPs) and that these constructions can be related through an equality constraint on the instantaneous acceleration of the center of mass. Specifically, the proposed method solves a single Quadratic Program which incorporates elements from Model Predictive Control (MPC) based center of mass planning methods and from rapidly exponentially stabilizing control Lyapunov function (RES-CLF) methods. The resulting QP-based controller simultaneously solves for a COM trajectory that satisfies ZMP constraints over a future horizon while also producing joint torques consistent with instantaneous acceleration, torque, ZMP and RES-CLF constraints.

However, regarding to products produced in small numbers the programming of those robots can be very time-consuming and workers have to be trained in programming the movements and tasks. Also, in the medical field where robots can be used for assistance during surgery or cancer treatment in future the surgeon or doctor has to respond to each patient individually. To train those medical specialists in programming robots would be very extensive. Therefore, the development of an intuitive robot control can help to facilitate tasks done by non-specialized workers or surgeons. In this contribution a concept of an intuitive control of robots via gesture control is shown. For the perception of gestures the different degrees of freedom of the worker's arm are detected by the use of a wearable sensor system based on dielectric elastomer sensors, which are generally lightweight and flexible.

By grouping multiple control variables into synergies, the brain reduces the number of degrees-of-freedom effectively available to solve a certain task. Kinematic, or postural synergies have been identified during the execution of pointing tasks involving either the eye, the head or the wrist and during hand grasping. Postural synergies can be predicted via constrained optimization by hypothesizing the existence of cost functions that the brain would minimize during the execution of redundant tasks. From a computational perspective, in the hypothesis of a correct guess for the cost function, the challenge remains of how to tune the cost parameters so as to predict experimental synergies. In this work a postural model for the wrist-forearm previously proposed in the literature is extended with a non-linear inverse optimization (NIO) approach to tune the discomfort function parameters of the model. An efficient method is proposed to filter and down-sample the experimental data so as to reduce the computational burden of the NIO algorithm. Results show that, after the optimization of the cost parameters, the model can predict with high accuracy six experimental pointing strategies.

At the same time, the emergence of robotic devices for stroke therapy offers technical possibilities for strength training. We propose a control strategy for strength training that is based on a viscous force field shaped towards the patient's performance abilities at different positions and directions during a movement. The controller was implemented in the arm rehabilitation robot ARMin in combination with a one-degree-of-freedom repetitive tracking task. The viscous force field is adapted in each round as a function of the local performance profile (shape) and the performance sum of each round (task level). The patient gets feedback by visual representation of the tracking task displaying the position of the moving target object and the position of the patient cursor. We hypothesize that the performance-shaped task level of the viscous force field demands the maximum effort of the participant at each point of the trajectory. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the participants are more motivated by this controller for strength training than by controllers using a constant task level. The controller was tested in a feasibility study with 31 healthy subjects. The resulting individual task level of the viscous force field increased compared to the initial state but did not reach a steady state by (visual inspection). No differences in motivation compared to a controller using a constant viscous force field were identified.

The prevalence of complex curved surfaces in the industry provides motivation for the use of 6 axis robots in these inspections. The purpose of this paper is to present work undertaken for the development of a KUKA robot manipulator based automated NDT system. A new software solution is presented that enables flexible trajectory planning to be accomplished for the inspection of complex curved surfaces often encountered in engineering production. The techniques and issues associated with conventional manual inspection techniques and automated systems for the inspection of large complex surfaces were reviewed. This approach has directly influenced the development of a MATLAB toolbox targeted to NDT automation, capable of complex path planning, obstacle avoidance, and external synchronization between robots and associated external NDT systems. This paper highlights the advantages of this software over conventional off-line-programming approaches when applied to NDT measurements. An experimental validation of path trajectory generation, on a large and curved composite aerofoil component, is presented. Comparative metrology experiments were undertaken to evaluate the real path accuracy of the toolbox when inspecting a curved 0.5 m2 and a 1.6 m2 surface using a KUKA KR16 L6-2 robot. The results have shown that the deviation of the distance between the commanded TCPs and the feedback positions were within 2.7 mm. The variance of the standoff between the probe and the scanned surfaces was smaller than the variance obtainable via commercial path-planning software. Tool paths were generated directly on the triangular mesh imported from the CAD models of the inspected components without need for an approximating analytical surface. By implementing full external control of the robotic hardware, it has been possible to synchronise the NDT data collection with positions at all points along the path, and our approach allows for the future development of additional functionality that is specific to NDT inspection problems. For the current NDT application, the deviations from CAD design and the requirements for both coarse and fine inspections, dependent on measured NDT data, demand flexibility in path planning beyond what is currently available from existing off-line robot programming software. © 2015 The Authors.

A key theme of the forum was what has come to be known as the “fourth industrial revolution”. Design/methodology/approach: News reports and blog posts about the forum gave the impression that this new “revolution” would bring unprecedented advances in science and medicine as well as would hold the potential for a future dominated by intelligent robots and massive levels of unemployment. Findings: For example, on January 24, 2016, Elliot of The Guardian reported that the “Fourth Industrial Revolution brings promise and peril for humanity”. Sensational headlines and sound bites are good at attracting attention but they are not very effective with regard to communicating what this revolution is about and what it could mean for our lives, communities, governments and our workplaces in the near and distant future. The snippets of information reported here and there give the impression that robots, artificial intelligence, cloud-based computing, big data and a combination of other technologies are gradually merging to create a new reality which has the potential for revolutionizing our way of life.

In addition, enormous number of robots have been designed and assembled by explicitly realising their biological oriented behaviours. To enhance skill behaviours and adequate grasping abilities in these devices, a new phase of dexterous hands has been developed recently with bio-mimetically oriented and bio-inspired functionalities. The aim in writing this review paper is to present a detailed insight towards the development of the bio-mimetic based dexterous robotic multi-fingered artificial hand. An “ideal” upper limb prosthesis should be perceived as a part of their natural body by the amputee and should replicate sensory-motor capabilities of the amputated limb. Upper-limb amputations are most often the result of sudden trauma to the body, although they also can be caused by malignancy, congenital deficiencies and vascular diseases. This paper discusses the different bio-mimetic approaches using a framework that permits for a common description of biological and technical based hand manipulation behaviour. In particular, the review focuses on a number of developments in the inspired robotic systems. In conclusion, the study found that a huge amount of research efforts in terms of kinematics, dynamics, modelling and control methodologies are being put in to improve the present hand technology, thereby providing more functionality to the prosthetic limb of the amputee. This would improve their quality-of-life and help in performing activities of daily living (ADL) tasks with comparative ease in the near future. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Amputee; Artificial hand; Bio-mimetic; Prosthetic; Robotics","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Prosthetics; Robotics; Activities of Daily Living; amputee; Artificial hand; Grasping ability; Hand manipulation; Modelling and controls; Upper limb amputation; Upper limb prosthesis; Artificial limbs; arm amputation; biomimetics; bionics; compliance (physical); daily life activity; disabled person; dynamics; food and drug administration; hand amputation; hand prosthesis; health care cost; human; iLIMB hand; kinematics; limb prosthesis; priority journal; quality of life; Review; robotics; sensorimotor function; squse life like robot hand; touch; zurich tokyo hand",2-s2.0-84964484506

However, available traditional economy approaches for coordination of multi-robot systems (MRS) exploration lack efficient target selection strategy under a few of situations and rely on a perfect communication. In order to overcome the shortages and endow each robot autonomy, a novel coordinated algorithm based on supervisory control of discrete event systems and a variation of the market approach is proposed in this paper. Two kinds of utility and the corresponding calculation schemes which take into account of cooperation between robots and covering the environment in a minimal time, are defined. Different moving target of each robot is determined by maximizing the corresponding utility at the lower level of the proposed hierarchical coordinated architecture. Selection of a moving target assignment strategy, dealing with communication failure, and collision avoidance are modeled as behaviors of each robot at the upper level. The proposed approach distinctly speeds up exploration process and reduces the communication requirement. The validity of our algorithm is verified by computer simulations.

The network is trained on-line; it grows by inserting new nodes when abnormal observation is perceived from the environment; and also shrinks when the learned information is not necessary anymore. In addition, the network is also capable of learning region-specific novelty thresholds on-line continuously. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, real-world robotic experiments were conducted by fusing sensory perceptions (vision and laser sensors) and the robot motor control outputs (translational and rotational velocities). Experimental results showed that all of the novelty cases were highlighted by the proposed algorithms and it produced reliable local novelty thresholds while the robot patrols in the noisy environment.

Various resection tools employed in TORS were also studied. Materials, methods and results The review was not conducted like a meta-analysis but was an overview of the selected topics. Electronic databases, primarily PubMed and Science direct, were referred to identify relevant studies published in English language between January 1990 and August 2015 using text words transoral robotic surgery and robot-assisted surgery. The publications included case reports and series, preclinical and clinical researches and review articles. Discussion Oral and maxillofacial surgeons today are increasingly getting involved in management of head and neck cancers and maxillofacial reconstructions. TORS, recent biomedical engineering advancement, is finding increasing application in these fields, particularly in maxillofacial oncology. It features use of a surgical robot to gain conservative access into pharyngolaryngeal surgical sites via oral cavity rather than employing more radical approaches. Potential advantages include better visualization and access to surgical sites via minimal invasion. With this technique, it is possible to overcome severe morbidities secondary to loss of large volumes of muscular tissue and organs associated with open surgery, thereby improving functional, cosmetic and oncologic outcomes. Conclusion TORS provides a novel treatment option to oral and maxillofacial surgeons for treating patients chiefly suffering from oropharyngeal cancer and obstructive sleep apnea.

Methods: Although optical-motion-capture master interfaces for surgical robot systems can overcome the stiffness, friction, and coupling problems of mechanical master interfaces, it is difficult to add haptic feedback to an optical-motion-capture master interface without constraining the free motion of the operator’s hands. Therefore, we utilized a Bowden cable-driven mechanism to provide the grasp and push–pull sensation while retaining the free hand motion of the optical-motion capture master interface. To evaluate the haptic device, we construct a 2-DOF force sensing/force feedback system. We compare the sensed force and the reproduced force of the haptic device. Finally, a needle insertion test was done to evaluate the performance of the haptic interface in the master–slave system. Results: The results demonstrate that both the grasp force feedback and the push–pull force feedback provided by the haptic interface closely matched with the sensed forces of the slave robot. We successfully apply our haptic interface in the optical-motion-capture master–slave system. The results of the needle insertion test showed that our haptic feedback can provide more safety than merely visual observation. Conclusions: We develop a suitable haptic device to produce both kinesthetic grasp force feedback and cutaneous push–pull force feedback. Our future research will include further objective performance evaluations of the optical-motion-capture master–slave robot system with our haptic interface in surgical scenarios. © 2015, CARS.","Cutaneous force feedback; Haptic interface; Kinesthetic force feedback; Master–slave surgical robot; Optical-motion-capture master","Article; equipment design; friction; grip strength; haptic device; human; motion; needle; portable equipment; priority journal; rigidity; robotics; skin sensation; surgical equipment; tactile feedback; computer assisted surgery; computer interface; devices; equipment design; feedback system; hand strength; kinesthesia; optical instrumentation; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; robotics; touch; Equipment Design; Feedback; Hand Strength; Humans; Kinesthesis; Motion; Optical Devices; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Robotics; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Touch Perception; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-84949513879

Studies assessing asymmetric brain function in ASD individuals have suggested that facial processing, which is known to be lateralized in neurotypical (NT) individuals, may be less lateralized in ASD. Here we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to first test this theory by comparing patterns of lateralized brain activity in homologous temporal-occipital facial processing regions during observation of faces in an ASD group and an NT group. As expected, the ASD participants showed reduced right hemisphere asymmetry for human faces, compared to the NT participants. Based on recent behavioral reports suggesting that robots can facilitate increased verbal interaction over human counterparts in ASD, we also measured responses to faces of robots to determine if these patterns of activation were lateralized in each group. In this exploratory test, both groups showed similar asymmetry patterns for the robot faces. Our findings confirm existing literature suggesting reduced asymmetry for human faces in ASD and provide a preliminary foundation for future testing of how the use of categorically different social stimuli in the clinical setting may be beneficial in this population. © 2016 Jung et al.

Objective To overview the use and key elements of ERAS pathways, and define needs for future clinical trials. Evidence acquisition A comprehensive systematic MEDLINE search was performed for English language reports published before May 2015 using the terms “postoperative period,” “postoperative care,” “enhanced recovery after surgery,” “enhanced recovery,” “accelerated recovery,” “fast track recovery,” “recovery program,” “recovery pathway”, “ERAS,” and “urology” or “cystectomy” or “urologic surgery.” Evidence synthesis We identified 18 eligible articles. Patient counseling, physical conditioning, avoiding excessive alcohol and smoking, and good nutrition appeared to protect against postoperative complications. Fasting from solid food for only 6 h and perioperative liquid–carbohydrate loading up to 2 h prior to surgery appeared to be safe and reduced recovery times. Restricted, balanced, and goal-directed fluid replacement is effective when individualized, depending on patient morbidity and surgical procedure. Decreased intraoperative blood loss may be achieved by several measures. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis, and thermoregulation were found to help reduce postsurgical complications, as was a multimodal approach to postoperative nausea, vomiting, and analgesia. Chewing gum, prokinetic agents, oral laxatives, and an early resumption to normal diet appear to aid faster return to normal bowel function. Further studies should compare anesthetic protocols, refine analgesia, and evaluate the importance of robot-assisted surgery and the need/timing for drains and catheters.

Conclusions: Transthoracic port placement augments the safety of the dissection along the IVC inferiorly and the right hepatic vein superiorly due to direct visualization. Also, it provides a direct instrument-to-target axis without the typical fulcrum of dissecting the postero/superior liver. Laparoscopic ultrasound is critical to confirm preserved flow to the RPPP and guide the parenchymal transection. Liver volumetry should be obtained before surgery to determine adequate future liver remnant if conversion to a right lobectomy becomes necessary. © 2016, Society of Surgical Oncology.",,"bevacizumab; adult; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; case report; colon cancer; female; human; laparoscopic access port; laparoscopic posterior sectionectomy; laparoscopic surgery; liver metastasis; middle aged; multiple cycle treatment; patient positioning; robot assisted surgery; robotic surgical procedure; single transthoracic trocar; treatment response; tumor localization",2-s2.0-84959116942

Robotic technology is one of the most recent technological changes in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operations. The current analysis was conducted to identify trends in the use and outcomes of robotic-assisted CABG (RA-CABG). Methods. A retrospective analysis was performed using data from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database between 2006 and 2012. Patient and site-level characteristics were compared between traditional CABG and RA-CABG. Operative death, postoperative length of stay, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. Results. The number of sites using RA-CABG remained relatively constant during the study period (from 148 in 2006 to 151 in 2012). The volume of RA-CABG as a percentage of the total CABG procedures increased slightly from 0.59% (872 RA-CABG of 127,717 total CABG) in 2006 to 0.97% (1,260 RA-CABG of 97,249 total CABG) in 2012. The RA-CABG patients were significantly younger (64 vs 65 years, p < 0.0001), had fewer comorbidities, and had lower rates of cardiopulmonary bypass use (22.4% vs 80.4%, p < 0.0001). RA-CABG patients had significantly lower unadjusted major complication rates (10.2% vs 13.5%, p < 0.0001), including postoperative renal failure (2.2% vs 2.9%, p < 0.0001), and shorter length of stay (4 vs 5 days, p < 0.0001). The difference in operative death was not significant (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.30, p = 0.29). Conclusions. RA-CABG use remained relatively stagnant during the analysis period despite lower rates of major perioperative complications and no difference in operative deaths. Additional analysis is needed to fully understand the role that robotic technology will play in CABG operations in the future. © 2016 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,"adult; aged; Article; cardiopulmonary bypass; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; data base; female; heart infarction; heart surgery; human; kidney failure; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical society; middle aged; peroperative complication; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; reoperation; retrospective study; robot assisted surgery; robotic assisted coronary artery bypass graft; surgical mortality; thoracic surgeon; clinical trial; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; factual database; follow up; incidence; medical society; multicenter study; Postoperative Complications; procedures; robotics; survival rate; thorax surgery; time factor; treatment outcome; trends; United States; Aged; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Databases, Factual; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Robotics; Societies, Medical; Survival Rate; Thoracic Surgery; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States",2-s2.0-84975261146

In this paper, a voice command system is developed to control a UAV and a vision-based approach system controls the UGV in a leadfollower formation to enhance human-robot teams for military defence and rescue missions in urban areas. The proposed voice control framework is executed using open source interface, Robot Operating System (ROS), for aerial vehicle communication supported by spoken dialogues using a wireless microphone, while the UGV detects and tracks a target image captured by the on board low-cost camera from the height of the UAV, using the proposed vision-based approach. The lead-follower formation is based on communication and visibility between the UAV and UGV in a given environment. In addition, a speech recognition module translates voice input to text and the published text is then mapped to the control input of the UAV in order to execute corresponding voice commands. The relative distance and position between the UAV and UGV is estimated from the image received via laptop. UGVs and UAVs have sophisticated design features such as network device communication, navigation, vision sensors and obstacle detection sensors. The UAV is a quadcopter that leads the UGV to accessible areas, while the UGV plays the role of the follower with wheel activators to track and locate the target image on the UAV, given a defined geographic path. The joint behavioural control system of the proposed voice command and vision-based approach is verified by experimental setups that show the UAV has a high voice recognition response and the UGV autonomously tracks the moving UAV in real time operation. As a consequence of the experimental tests, it is expected that the voice control system and vision-based approach developed play an important role in future combat fields.

It has the ability to enhance the quality of life immensely when present as music; at the same time, it can degrade its quality when manifested as noise. Hence, understanding its sources and the processes by which it is produced gains acute significance. Although various theories exist with respect to evolution of bells, it is indisputable that they carry millennia of cultural significance, and at least a few centuries of perfection with respect to design, casting and tuning. Despite the science behind its design, the nuances pertaining to founding and tuning have largely been empirical, and conveyed from one generation to the next. Post-production assessment for bells remains largely person-centric and traditional. However, progressive bell manufacturers have started adopting methods such as finite element analysis (FEA) for informing and optimising their future model designs. To establish confidence in the FEA process it is necessary to correlate the virtual model against a physical example. This is achieved by performing an experimental modal analysis (EMA) and comparing the results with those from FEA. Typically to collect the data for an EMA, the vibratory response of the structure is measured with the application of accelerometers. This technique has limitations; principally these are the observer effect and limited geometric resolution. In this paper, 3-dimensional laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) has been used to measure the vibratory response with no observer effect due to the non-contact nature of the technique; resulting in higher accuracy measurements as the input to the correlation process. The laser heads were mounted on an industrial robot that enables large objects to be measured and extensive data sets to be captured quickly through an automated process. This approach gives previously unobtainable geometric resolution resulting in a higher confidence EMA. This is used to correlate with FEA up to significantly higher frequencies. Automated, robotized measurements made it possible to easily capture 4000 geometric points per bell. Measurements were made for two carillon bells manufactured by John Taylor & Co., weighing about 100 and 150 kilos. The bells were mounted as freely as possible to allow them to resonate without constraint. They were excited with an electrodynamic shaker attached to an area of the bell where the clapper would normally strike. The frequency response functions (FRF) were collected for each geometry location, and solved to calculate the mode shape for each harmonic. Proprietary system software (Robovib and PSV from Polytec GmbH) was used to measure and capture data. The EMA was solved using industry standard tools from the Siemens PLM suite (LMS Test.Lab Polymax). The deviation for partials/harmonics (in cents) was found to be less than 1.6% from that predicted by the design rules. The mode shapes obtained from model based FEA analysis also correlated well with those from measurements. © 2016 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-84984535232

For this purpose, the current study proposes using the model predictive control (MPC) law in order to provide robustness for a humanoid robot against sudden disturbances. The main motivation for choosing MPC is that it naturally provides precautions against the predicted future disturbances and parameter changes. In order to check the performance of the humanoid robot considered here in a balance recovery reaction under the effect of a sudden external disturbance, its performance is compared to the experimentally recorded responses of a human subject. A single-axis tilt-platform is used to apply the sudden disturbance experimentally to the human subject. The results of the experimental runs show that there are obviously noticeable differences between the initial and final postures of the human subject. Therefore, the MPC method is applied to the humanoid robot in two different versions. In the first version, the robot tries to come back to the initial equilibrium posture. In the second version, the robot aims at the final equilibrium posture, which is observed in the experimental data of the human subject. The automatic prediction of the final equilibrium posture by the robot itself without imitating a human being will possibly be a typical subject of interest in the forthcoming studies. In this study, the robot detects and predicts a suddenly applied external disturbance automatically, and it generates the necessary control inputs to recover its balance. The simulation results indicate that the humanoid robot with MPC can give a much faster and smoother balance recovery response to the same external disturbance as compared to the response of the actual human subject. Hence, it is concluded that the proposed MPC law may be applied successfully to the humanoid robots that will relieve the human beings from several risky-environmental tasks in the future. © 2016 IEEE.","balance-recovery; disturbance prediction; humanoid robot; model predictive control; tilt disturbance","Anthropomorphic robots; Environmental regulations; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Recovery; Automatic prediction; Balance recoveries; Disturbance prediction; External disturbances; Humanoid robot; Initial equilibriums; Sudden disturbance; tilt disturbance; Robots",2-s2.0-84979505694

Forces generated during open contact operations have to be taken into careful consideration so that structural components can be successfully acquired and assembled by the robot. Unlike ground-based robots, the free-flying space robot base will deviate from its desired orientation when the spacecraft comes in contact with structural elements. This effect on spacecraft attitude may adversely affect communication, solar energy collection and in extreme cases the stability of the spacecraft. While thrusters can be used to provide regulation torques, in a scenario where the spacecraft is surrounded by structural components that are to be assembled, filing clusters is undesirable. Further, the force impulses generated by thrusters have poor resolution and hence are unsuitable for providing fine regulation. In this paper, the authors utilize reaction wheels (RWs) to provide accurate and smooth control torques without the need to have on-board fuel. By adopting the commonly used canonical-form dynamic model of a space robot as found in the literature, force tracking may be achieved, but a desired orientation of the spacecraft cannot be guaranteed. To solve this problem, the authors build dynamic equations of the space manipulator and the spacecraft base separately to form basis for separate contact-force control and attitude control of the platform. By taking a further step from previous literature which mainly try to maintain contact between the end-effector and the target, hybrid force/motion control is extended to a space robot in this paper in order to track a desired force trajectory and simultaneously maintain a desired relative position between the end-effector and the target to avoid inducing tumbling torques. A recently proposed adaptive variable structure control method is applied to design a robust attitude controller taking into account system uncertainties and external disturbances. A two-link planar space robot model is simulated to track a desired uni-axial contact force and regulate the spacecraft attitude during contact with a free-floating target. The simulation results have demonstrated better robustness and performance of the proposed controller, such as shorter settling time in the presence of disturbance and smaller force tracking error, in comparison to a conventional feedback linearisation attitude controller. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Adaptive control systems; Attitude control; Controllers; End effectors; Robots; Solar energy; Space stations; Structural design; Tracking (position); Variable structure control; Adaptive variable structure control; Contact force control; External disturbances; Feedback linearisation; Large space structure; Robust attitude controller; Solar energy collections; System uncertainties; Spacecraft",2-s2.0-84978513689

The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standard protocols Spacecraft Monitor & Control (SMandC), Asynchronous Message Service (AMS), and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) provide such a method. However, the maturity level of this protocol stack is insufficient for mission inclusion at this time. This Space Data System prototype is intended to provide experience which will raise the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of this protocol set. In order to reduce costs, future missions can take advantage of these standard protocols, which will result in increased interoperability between control centers. This prototype demonstrates these capabilities by implementing a realistic space data system in which telemetry is published to control center applications at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and the Johnson Space Center (JSC). Reverse publishing paths for commanding from each control center are also implemented. The target vehicle consists of realistic flight computer hardware running Core Flight Software (CFS) in the integrated Power, Avionics, and Power (iPAS) Pathfinder Lab at JSC. This prototype demonstrates a potential upgrade path for future Deep Space Network (DSN) modification, in which the automatic error recovery and communication gap compensation capabilities of DTN would be exploited. In addition, SM&C provides architectural flexibility by allowing new service providers and consumers to be added efficiently anywhere in the network using the common interface provided by SM&C's Message Abstraction Layer (MAL). In FY 2015, this space data system was enhanced by adding telerobotic operations capability provided by the Robot API Delegate (RAPID) family of protocols developed at NASA. RAPID is one of several candidates for consideration and inclusion in a new international standard being developed by the CCSDS Telerobotic Operations Working Group. Software gateways for the purpose of interfacing RAPID messages with the existing SM&C based infrastructure were developed.

A Phobos mission would serve to facilitate the development of the human-based Mars transportation infrastructure, unmanned cargo delivery systems, as well as habitation and exploration assets that would be directly relevant to subsequent Mars surface missions. It would also potentially provide for low latency teleoperations (LLT) of Mars surface robots performing a range of tasks from landing site validation to infrastructure development to support future crewed Mars surface Missions. A human mission to Phobos would be preceded by a cargo predeploy of a Phobos surface habitat and a pressurized excursion vehicle (PEV) to Mars orbit. Once in Mars orbit, the habitat and PEV would spiral to Phobos using solar electric propulsion (SEP)-based systems. When a crewed mission is launched to Phobos, it would include the remaining systems to support the crew during the Earth-to-Mars orbit transit and to reach Phobos after insertion into a high Mars orbit (HMO). The crew would taxi from HMO to Phobos in a spacecraft that is based on a MAV to rendezvous with the predeployed systems. A predominantly static Phobos surface habitat was chosen as a baseline architecture. The habitat would have limited capability to relocate on the surface to shorten excursion distances required by the PEV during exploration and to provide rescue capability should the PEV become disabled. PEVs would contain closed-loop guidance and provide life support and consumables for two crewmembers for two weeks plus reserves. The PEV has a cabin that uses the exploration atmosphere of 8.2psi with 34% oxygen. This atmosphere enables EVA to occur with minimal oxygen prebreathe before crewmembers enter their EVA suits through suit ports, and provides dust control to occur by keeping the suits outside the pressurized volume. When equipped with outriggers, the PEV enables EVA tasks without the need to anchor. Tasks with higher force requirements can be performed with PEV propulsion providing the necessary thrust to counteract forces. This paper overviews the mission operational concepts, and timelines, along with analysis of the power, lighting, habitat stability, and EVA forces. Exploration of Phobos builds heavily on the development of the cis-lunar proving ground and significantly reduces Mars surface risk by facilitating the design, development and testing of habitats, MAVs, and pressurized rover cabins that are all investments in Mars surface assets. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Ecosystems; Investments; Lunar missions; Martian surface analysis; Propulsion; Space rendezvous; Taxicabs; Base-line architecture; Development and testing; Human exploration missions; Infrastructure development; Mars surface missions; Operational concepts; Solar electric propulsion; Transportation infrastructures; Orbits",2-s2.0-84978488549

Capitalizing on the appeal of robotics is one strategy proposed to increase STEM interest. The interdisciplinary nature of robots, which involve motors, sensors, and programs, make robotics a useful STEM pedagogical tool. There is also a significant need for industrial certification programs in robotics. Robots are increasingly used across industry sectors to improve production throughputs while maintaining product quality. The benefits of robotics, however, depend on workers with up-to-date knowledge and skills to maintain and use existing robots, enhance future technologies, and educate users. It is critical that education efforts respond to the demand for robotics specialists by offering courses and professional certification in robotics and automation. This, NSF sponsored, project introduces a new approach for Industrial Robotics in electrical engineering technology (EET) programs at Michigan Tech and Bay de noc Community College. The curriculum and software developed by this collaboration of two- and four-year institutions will match industry needs and provide a replicable model for programs around the US. The project also addresses the need for certified robotic training centers (CRTCs) and provides curriculum and training opportunities for students from other institutions, industry representatives, and displaced workers. Resources developed via this project will be disseminated through a variety of means, including workshops, conferences, and publications.

Through this endeavor, students can gain insight about engineering systems and how scientific knowledge and technology can blend together to provide meaningful applications to enhance our daily life. To further manifest the close relationship between different engineering fields used in real situation, a robotic project named Max2 is used to show the multi-disciplinary nature of robotics. Max2 is a service robot which can attend the household, or search for anomalous situations in the environment. This system is one example of a project for K-12 or first-year undergraduate students who want to learn the basics of robotics. For example, for the robot to be able to check whether the house light is left on while the owner is out, it needs an algorithm to navigate autonomously in the house environment. Students have to learn how to integrate the motion control and sensing capability so that the robot can estimate the surrounding environment and avoid bumping into any obstacle while moving around, as well as collecting and processing the information about its ambient environment. Furthermore, students have to learn how to set the light sensor so the robot can tell whether the light is on or not. Finally, the communication about how to send back the sensed information which is readable is another task for students to figure out. In this case students will learn Bluetooth and Wi-Fi communication protocols. The project is based on LEGO Mindstorms Kit for its flexibility and scalability [1]. This unit does not end here. Students should augment this project and develop their own robotic projects with additional functions or tasks based on this model. In addition, they should be able to extend it to other robotic platforms, for example, VEX or Arduino microcontroller in the future. In the class, we divided the project into many smaller task modules during a semester. Students learned functions of robotic components one at a time to accomplish the partial task until they finished all the modules and the entire project was completed to reach the goal as expected. The project was implemented in fall 2015 in an introductory mechatronics class, and was received enthusiastically, resulting in increased motivation to study robotics and automation, as well as mechatronics. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.",,,2-s2.0-84983353095

The primary goal of the camp was to introduce more females into the field of engineering through robotic projects and competitions, guest speakers, and field trips. The camp had an additional emphasis on providing learning and research opportunities for girls from underrepresented communities. miniGEMS was the first free camp in San Antonio, TX for middle school girls with a special focus on engineering. Despite being held for the first time, there were 25 middle school students from various school districts in San Antonio. The camp was planned, coordinated, and directed by the authors who were also the principal investigators of the program. Additionally, four engineering research assistants from the AVS Lab and three middle school teachers from the local school districts helped with the daily robotics projects and competition. The first half of the week focused on the EV3 Lego Mindstorms robots for the campers to learn about robotics, autonomous land navigation, and computer programming. The students also had the opportunity to build and compete using the SeaPerch underwater robots. This was the first time that the SeaPerch was used for a middle school girls' research competition in Texas. The campers had hands-on experience in building robots as a team which could be guided through an underwater obstacle course. The last day of the camp consisted of a field trip to a digital art and engineering studio and an awards presentation and banquet for outstanding research achievements. The individual and group interactions with the students and their parents reveal that the students had had a great time at the camp and many were motivated to consider engineering as a career.

To this end, radiobased localization has demonstrated the potential for high accuracy. Key enabling ideas include motion-based synthetic aperture radar, multipath detection, and the use of different frequencies (channels). But indoors in real-world situations, current systems often fall short of the mark, mainly because of the prevalence and strength of ""multipath"" reflections of the radio signal off nearby objects. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of MobiTagbot, an autonomous wheeled robot reader that conducts a roving survey of the above such areas to achieve an exact spatial order of RFIDtagged objects in very close (1-6 cm) spacings. Our approach leverages a serendipitous correlation between the changes in multipath reflections that occur with motion and the effect of changing the carrier frequency (channel) of the RFID query. By carefully observing the relationship between channel and phase, MobiTagbot detects if multipath is likely prevalent at a given robot reader location. If so, MobiTagbot excludes phase readings from that reader location, and generates a final location estimate using phase readings from other locations as the robot reader moves in space. Experimentally, we demonstrate that cutting-edge localization algorithms including Tagoram are not accurate enough to exactly order items in very close proximity, but MobiTagbot is, achieving nearly 100% ordering accuracy for items at low (3-6 cm) spacings and 86% accuracy for items at very low (1-3 cm) spacings. © 2016 ACM.","Localization; Multipath propagation; Order tracking; RFID","Location; Machine design; Mobile phones; Multipath propagation; Robots; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Design and implementations; Different frequency; Localization; Manufacturing lines; Multipath detection; Multipath reflections; Order tracking; Real world situations; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",2-s2.0-84979896225

It is very important to obtain a computational understanding of how humans can form symbol systems and obtain semiotic skills through their autonomous mental development. Recently, many studies have been conducted regarding the construction of robotic systems and machine learning methods that can learn a language through embodied multimodal interaction with their environment and other systems. Understanding human?-social interactions and developing a robot that can smoothly communicate with human users in the long term require an understanding of the dynamics of symbol systems. The embodied cognition and social interaction of participants gradually alter a symbol system in a constructive manner. In this paper, we introduce a field of research called symbol emergence in robotics (SER). SER represents a constructive approach towards a symbol emergence system. The symbol emergence system is socially self-organized through both semiotic communications and physical interactions with autonomous cognitive developmental agents, i.e. humans and developmental robots. In this paper, specifically, we describe some state-of-art research topics concerning SER, such as multimodal categorization, word discovery, and double articulation analysis. They enable robots to discover words and their embodied meanings from raw sensory-motor information, including visual information, haptic information, auditory information, and acoustic speech signals, in a totally unsupervised manner.

Future robots require high power-to-weight ratios as well as inherent long operational lifetimes without breakage in order to achieve similar perfection. Robustness due to passive compliance and high-speed catapult-like motions as possible with fast energy release are further beneficial characteristics. Such properties can be realized with antagonistic muscle-based designs. Additionally, control algorithms need to exploit the full potential of the robot. Learning control is a promising direction due to its the potential to capture uncertainty and control of complex systems. The aim of this paper is to build a robotic arm that is capable of generating high accelerations and sophisticated trajectories as well as enable exploration at such speeds for robot learning approaches. Hence, we have designed a light-weight robot arm with moving masses below 700 g with powerful antagonistic compliant actuation with pneumatic artificial muscles. Rather than recreating human anatomy, our system is designed to be easy to control in order to facilitate future learning of fast trajectory tracking control. The resulting robot is precise at low speeds using a simple PID controller while reaching high velocities of up to 12 m/s in task space and 1500 deg/s in joint space.

We call this type of robots “Pet-Bot”. To implement this function in a robot, in this paper we introduce a self-organizing interaction and synchronization method between wearable devices and Pet-Bots. First, the Pet-Bot opportunistically identifies its owner without any human intervention, which means that the robot self-identifies the owner’s approach on its own. Second, Pet-Bot’s activity is synchronized with the owner’s behavior. Lastly, the robot frequently encounters uncertain situations (e.g., when the robot goes ahead of the owner but meets a situation where it cannot make a decision, or the owner wants to stop the Pet-Bot synchronization mode to relax). In this case, we have adopted a gesture recognition function that uses a 3-D accelerometer in the wearable device. In order to achieve the interaction and synchronization in real-time, we use two wireless communication protocols: 125 kHz low-frequency (LF) and 2.4 GHz Bluetooth low energy (BLE). We conducted experiments using a prototype Pet-Bot and wearable devices to verify their motion recognition of and synchronization with humans in real-time.

Empirical observation of robot hardware is needed because ground impedance and foot-ground interaction is challenging to predict in simulation. This paper presents experimental data of the MIT Super Mini Cheetah robot hopping on hard and soft ground. We show that controllers tuned for each surface perform better for each specific surface type, assessing performance using measurements of 1.) stability of the robot in response to self-disturbances applied by the robot onto itself and 2.) the peak accelerations of the robot that occur during ground impact, which should be minimized to reduce mechanical stress. To aid in controller selection on different ground types, we show that the robot can measure ground stiffness and friction in-situ by measuring its own interaction with the ground.

The ability to sense forces of interaction allows these robots to also control their interaction with the environment. In past studies, the force sensing models were subject to quasi-static assumptions. The goal of this paper is threefold: to update the wrench sensing model taking into account dynamic forces, to investigate the effect of these dynamic forces on the wrench sensing abilities of these robots and to present design atlases that help designers with the determination of critical dimensions ensuring bounded effect of dynamics on wrench sensing. The paper presents a simplified dynamics model using a Lagrangian formulation. This dynamics model is then used to update the wrench estimation model for a single-segment continuum robot. Finally, a set of normalized parameters is used to produce design atlases that help designers predict the effect of dynamics on the wrench estimation model. These results will allow improved performance in force sensing and control for multi-backbone continuum robots. Employing the methods presented in the paper, continuum robots, that have previously demonstrated excellent distal dexterity, will be able to control their force interaction with the anatomy better in future - thereby improving safety and the finesse of surgery. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Design; Dynamics; Robotics; Robots; Tools; Critical dimension; Dynamics modeling; Estimation models; Force interaction; Force sensing models; Lagrangian formulations; Normalized parameters; Quasi-static assumptions; Machine design",2-s2.0-84977578638

In this paper, we present a method for learning policies with internal memory for high-dimensional, continuous systems, such as robotic manipulators. Our approach consists of augmenting the state and action space of the system with continuous-valued memory states that the policy can read from and write to. Learning general-purpose policies with this type of memory representation directly is difficult, because the policy must automatically figure out the most salient information to memorize at each time step. We show that, by decomposing this policy search problem into a trajectory optimization phase and a supervised learning phase through a method called guided policy search, we can acquire policies with effective memorization and recall strategies. Intuitively, the trajectory optimization phase chooses the values of the memory states that will make it easier for the policy to produce the right action in future states, while the supervised learning phase encourages the policy to use memorization actions to produce those memory states. We evaluate our method on tasks involving continuous control in manipulation and navigation settings, and show that our method can learn complex policies that successfully complete a range of tasks that require memory. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Aerodynamics; Complex networks; Manipulators; Robots; Supervised learning; Continuous control; Continuous system; Deep neural networks; High-dimensional; Learning policy; Policy learning; Robotic manipulators; Trajectory optimization; Robotics",2-s2.0-84977555800

The current work involves an underactuated, tendon driven, anthropomorphic manipulator with two flexor tendons and an abduction-adduction tendon, and describes its design based on experimental human precision manipulation data. Link lengths, joint axis alignment, and moment arms were derived from human subject data and values in the literature. The spring ratios, determining the torque relationships between joints, were then selected to maximize the achievable manipulation workspace from the human trial without requiring large forces, which are likely to lead to instability and object ejection. This is done by minimizing the stored spring energy in the robotic fingers across the range of precision manipulation workspace positions achieved by a representative human subject. After fabricating the hand, the energy characteristics of the resulting prototype are analyzed, and the robotic workspace is compared against the original human one. Despite only having three actuators, the hand is able to manipulate the test object within a 2.7 cm3 workspace volume, compared to an average human workspace of 5.4 cm3 for the same object.

Songbirds have the ability to acquire songs and calls of various rhythms through imitation. In several species, birds can even coordinate the timing of their vocalizations with other individuals in duets that are synchronized with millisecond-accuracy. It is not known, however, if songbirds can perceive rhythms holistically nor if they are capable of spontaneous entrainment to complex rhythms, in a manner similar to humans. Here we review emerging evidence from studies of rhythm generation and vocal coordination across songbirds and humans. In particular, recently developed experimental methods have revealed neural mechanisms underlying the temporal structure of song and have allowed us to test birds’ abilities to predict the timing of rhythmic social signals. Surprisingly, zebra finches can readily learn to anticipate the calls of a “vocal robot” partner and alter the timing of their answers to avoid jamming, even in reference to complex rhythmic patterns. This capacity resembles, to some extent, human predictive motor response to an external beat. In songbirds, this is driven, at least in part, by the forebrain song system, which controls song timing and is essential for vocal learning. Building upon previous evidence for spontaneous entrainment in human and non-human vocal learners, we propose a comparative framework for future studies aimed at identifying shared mechanism of rhythm production and perception across songbirds and humans. © 2016 Benichov, Globerson and Tchernichovski.","Entrainment; Predictive timing; Rhythm; Rhythm perception; Social coordination; Songbird vocalizations; Vocal learning; Zebra finch","coordination; forebrain; human; human experiment; human versus animal comparison; learning; perception; rhythm; Taeniopygia guttata; vocalization",2-s2.0-84973322088

What kind of risks derive from the use of robots? Are there any differences between insuring a robot and another product? And finally, who should bear the burden of paying the insurance premium? The objective of this article is to provide the reader with an overview on the issue of risk management of robotic applications through insurance contracts. Indeed, insurance products are essential for an effective technology transfer from research to market. As of today, the production, use and diffusion of robots, determines risks that can hardly be identified and assessed both with respect to the probability of their occurrence and to the consequences they might bring about. Thence, innovation causes existing insurance products to be inadequate, and often times, it leaves insurance companies in the complex position of needing to elaborate new solutions in the absence of complete information.

The environment is divided into sub-maps and all the necessary information and the topological representation of the world, are stored into a remote cloud infrastructure. By means of specific environmental tags, composed of a set of ARTags and QR codes, the robot gets the access to the cloud service and it is able to update its navigation configuration in a dynamic and automatic way.

A spatio-temporal memory categorizes the experiences of a robot to improve its ability to adapt to its environment. In this paper, we present a spatio-temporal (ST) memory model consisting of a cascade of two adaptive resonance theory (ART) networks: one to categorize spatial events and the other to extract temporal episodes from the robot’s experiences. Artificial emotions are used to dynamically modulate learning and recall of the ART networks based on how the robot is able to carry its task, using a simple model of artificial emotions. Once an episode is recalled, future events can be predicted and used to influence the intentions of the robot. Evaluation of our ST model is done using an autonomous robotic platform that has to deliver objects to people within an office area. Results demonstrate that our model can memorize and recall the experiences of a robot, and that emotional episodes are recalled more often, allowing the robot to use its memory of past experiences early on when repeating a task. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptive resonance theory; Artificial emotions; Autonomous robots; Spatio-temporal memory","Robots; Adaptive resonance theory; Adaptive resonance theory networks; Artificial emotions; Autonomous Mobile Robot; Autonomous robotics; Design and integrations; Simple modeling; Spatio temporal; Machine design",2-s2.0-84942028668

In this paper we present a novel robot-mediated intervention system for imitation skill learning, which is considered a core deficit area for children with ASD. The Robot-mediated Imitation Skill Training Architecture (RISTA) is designed in such a manner that it can operate either completely autonomously or in coordination with a human therapist depending on the intervention need. Experimental results are presented from small user studies validating system functionality, assessing user tolerance, and documenting subject performance. Preliminary results show that this novel robotic system draws more attention from the children with ASD and teaches gestures more effectively as compared to a human therapist.

Older people, especially, can benefit from assistive robots that give physical, cognitive and emotional support. However, thus far, little is understood of how to increase currently low acceptance of assistive robots through marketing (DAA Design Brief, Acceptance of assistive technology, 2014). Therefore, marketing strategies need to be developed addressing needs and fears of the stakeholders, which is especially critical regarding utopian-appearing assistive robots. To understand what drives acceptance, conscious and subconscious needs, wants and barriers of use of the relevant stakeholders have to be analysed. As such, in this intelligence gathering process not only end-users should be integrated. Also other stakeholders (e.g. as users, decision makers and buyers might not be identical) should be identified and their needs understood. In this paper we report our findings on marketing factors for different stakeholder clusters for assistive robots that we identified during the EU-co-funded (FP7) Robot-Era project. We employed a user-centred way of identifying stakeholders and marketing strategies by analysing different stakeholders in an iterative design process from an early stage (Mollenkopf et al., AAL in der alternden Gesellschaft: Anforderungen, Akzeptanz und Perspektiven, 2010) with quantitative and qualitative methods. The most important acceptance factors we identified for assistive robotics include functionality, usability, safety, costs and financing, (non-) stigmatization and ethical aspects. The structure of the paper is the following: first we look at the relevance of assistive robotics and the challenge of missing acceptance. We then look at the 4p concept in marketing to structure our approach of user-centered marketing. We then describe our data collection and the results to end with a discussion. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ambient assisted living; Assistive robotics marketing; Demographic change; Robot-Era; Stakeholder cards; Stakeholder-centred design; User-centred design","Commerce; Data visualization; Decision making; Design; Digital storage; Iterative methods; Machine design; Planning; Robotics; Robots; Strategic planning; User centered design; Ambient assisted living; Assistive robotics; Assistive technology; Demographic changes; Intelligence gathering; Marketing strategy; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Stakeholder cards; Marketing",2-s2.0-84976426653

Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed all radical prostatectomies (RPs) performed for localized prostate cancer in Victoria, Australia, from the Victorian Admitted Episode Dataset, a large administrative database that records all hospital inpatient episodes in Victoria. The first database, covering the period from July 2010 to April 2013 (n = 5 130), was used to compare length of hospital stay (LOS) and blood transfusion rates between surgical approaches. This was subsequently integrated into an economic model. A second database (n = 5 581) was extracted to cover the period between July 2010 and June 2013, three full financial years, to depict patterns of care and make future predictions for the 2014-2015 financial year, and to perform a hospital volume analysis. We then created an economic model to evaluate the incremental cost of RARP vs open RP (ORP) and laparoscopic RP (LRP), incorporating the cost-offset from differences in LOS and blood transfusion rate. The economic model constructs estimates of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) costs of ORP and LRP, adds the gross cost of the surgical robot (capital, consumables, maintenance and repairs), and manipulates these DRG costs to obtain a DRG cost per day, which can be used to estimate the cost-offset associated with RARP in comparison with ORP and LRP. Economic modelling was performed around a base-case scenario, assuming a 7-year robot lifespan and 124 RARPs performed per financial year. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed for the four-arm da Vinci SHD, Si and Si dual surgical systems (Intuitive Surgical Ltd, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Results We identified 5 581 patients who underwent RP in 20 hospitals in Victoria with an open, laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgical approach in the public and private sector. The majority of RPs (4 233, 75.8%), in Victoria were performed in the private sector, with an overall 11.5% decrease in the total number of RPs performed over the 3-year study period. In the most recent financial year, 820 (47%), 765 (44%) and 173 patients (10%) underwent RARP, ORP and LRP, respectively. In the same timeframe, RARP accounted for 26 and 53% of all RPs in the public and private sector, respectively. Public hospitals in Victoria perform a median number of 14 RPs per year and 40% of hospitals perform <10 RPs per year. In the public system, RARP was associated with a mean (±sd) LOS of 1.4 (±1.3) days compared with 3.6 (±2.7) days for LRP and 4.8 (±3.5) days for ORP (P < 0.001). The mean blood transfusion rates were 0, 6 and 15% for RARP, LRP and ORP, respectively (P < 0.001). The incremental cost per RARP case compared with ORP and LRP was A$442 and A$2 092, respectively, for the da Vinci S model, A$1 933 and A$3 583, respectively, for the da Vinci Si model and A$3 548 and A$5 198, respectively for the da Vinci Si dual. RARP can become cost-equivalent with ORP where ~140 cases per year are performed in the base-case scenario. Conclusions Over the period studied, RARP has become the dominant approach to RP, with significantly shorter LOS and lower blood transfusion rate. This translates to a significant cost-offset, which is further enhanced by increasing the case volume, extending the lifespan of the robot and reductions in the cost of consumables and capital. © 2015 The Authors BJU International © 2015 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Australia; economic analysis; health technology assessment; patterns of care; prostate cancer; robotic prostatectomy","Article; blood transfusion; cost control; health economics; human; laparoscopic radical prostatectomy; laparoscopic surgery; laparoscopic surgical instrument; length of stay; major clinical study; male; priority journal; private hospital; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; public hospital; retrospective study; robot assisted radical prostatectomy; robot assisted surgery; Victoria; aged; Australia; computer assisted surgery; economic model; economics; epidemiology; factual database; hospitalization; laparoscopy; middle aged; mortality; Postoperative Complications; procedures; prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; public health; robotic surgical procedure; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Aged; Australia; Blood Transfusion; Databases, Factual; Hospitalization; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Economic; Postoperative Complications; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Public Health; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84946073811

However, designing a robot that properly emulates the kinematic and dynamic properties of an animal is difficult because of the complexity of musculoskeletal systems and the limitations of current robotics technology. Here, we propose a design process that combines high-speed cineradiography, optimization, dynamic scaling, three-dimensional printing, high-end servomotors and a tailored dry-suit to construct Pleurobot: a salamander-like robot that closely mimics its biological counterpart, Pleurodeles waltl. Our previous robots helped us test and confirm hypotheses on the interaction between the locomotor neuronal networks of the limbs and the spine to generate basic swimming and walking gaits. With Pleurobot, we demonstrate a design process that will enable studies of richer motor skills in salamanders. In particular, we are interested in how these richer motor skills can be obtained by extending our spinal cord models with the addition of more descending pathways and more detailed limb central pattern generator networks. Pleurobot is a dynamically scaled amphibious salamander robot with a large number of actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs: 27 in total). Because of our design process, the robot can capture most of the animal's DOFs and range of motion, especially at the limbs. We demonstrate the robot's abilities by imposing raw kinematic data, extracted from X-ray videos, to the robot's joints for basic locomotor behaviours in water and on land. The robot closely matches the behaviour of the animal in terms of relative forward speeds and lateral displacements. Ground reaction forces during walking also resemble those of the animal. Based on our results, we anticipate that future studies on richer motor skills in salamanders will highly benefit from Pleurobot's design. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Objective: This article provides insights into the latest developments in social service robots (SSR) based on the recently finished HOBBIT project. The idea of the HOBBIT project was to develop a low-cost SSR which is able to reduce the risk of falling, to detect falls and handle emergencies in private homes. The main objective of the project was to raise the technology to a level that allows the robot to be fully autonomously deployed in the private homes of older users and to evaluate technology market readiness, utility, usability and affordability under real-world conditions. Method: During the initial phase of the project, a first prototype (PT1) was developed. The results of laboratory tests with PT1 were used for the development of a second prototype (PT2), which was finally tested in seven households of senior adults (mean age 79 years) for 3 weeks each, i.e. in total more than 5 months. Results: The results showed that PT2 is intuitive to handle and that the functions offered meet the needs of older users; however, the robot was considered more as a toy than a supportive device for independent living. Furthermore, despite an emergency function of the robot, perceived security did not increase. Conclusion: Reasons for this might be a lack of technological robustness and slow performance of the prototype and also the good health conditions of the users; however, users believed that a market-ready version of the robot would be vital for supporting people who are more fragile and more socially isolated. Thus, SSRs have the potential to support independent living of older people although the technology has to be considerably improved to reach market readiness. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Assistive technologies; Falls; Independent living; Robotics; Technology acceptance","aged; assistive technology; clinical article; emergency; field study; household; human; independent living; laboratory test; market; robotics; social work; Austria; computer interface; daily life activity; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; falling; female; independent living; male; man machine interaction; needs assessment; organization and management; patient preference; prevention and control; psychology; robotics; self help device; social support; statistics and numerical data; Sweden; utilization; utilization review; very elderly; Accidental Falls; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Austria; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Female; Humans; Independent Living; Male; Man-Machine Systems; Needs Assessment; Patient Preference; Robotics; Self-Help Devices; Social Support; Sweden; User-Computer Interface; Utilization Review",2-s2.0-84975297854

Our results show that a pulsed torque outperforms its sinusoidal counterpart with a lower energy expenditure. Moreover, the pulsed driving torque is capable of keeping the same energy efficiency, while changing the forward hopping velocity, which is not possible with the sinusoidal driving torque. Such findings will help shape the future of robotics by achieving higher energy efficiencies within legged robots, while maintaining behavioral diversity. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; Hopping; Open-loop control; Pulsed torque; Sinusoidal torque","Control theory; Robots; Torque; Behavioral diversity; Driving torques; Hopping; Hopping robots; Improving efficiency; Lower energies; Open loop control; Sinusoidal driving; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-84969931991

In this paper, we consider a setting where a group of robots, equipped with standard cameras, must fully cover a surrounding area while minimizing associated movement costs. To address this problem, we use a descriptor for visual coverage that encodes a measure of the visual information contained in an area, based on a regular discretization of the environment in voxels. In particular, our measure of coverage is related to how much of each voxel volume is ""penetrated"" by the bundle of rays projected from the camera center. Crucially, our descriptor explicitly encodes the viewing direction from which the voxel is observed, which is a key element to measure coverage of visual sensors. Next, we propose an autonomous cooperative exploration approach to control robot movements. Specifically, based on our visual coverage descriptor, we define a utility function to encode the value of future moves for the robots, and we select the next move for a robot by performing a greedy maximization of such utility function. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach in a simulation scenario based on real visual data and on widely used robotic tools (such as ROS and Stage). Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline random approaches (i.e., random, semirandom, and uncoordinated) and thus is a valid solution for visual coverage in large-scale outdoor scenarios. © Copyright 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Cameras; Encoding (symbols); Robots; Security systems; Application scenario; Cooperative exploration; Multi-robot strategy; Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction; Utility functions; Video surveillance; Viewing directions; Visual information; Three dimensional computer graphics",2-s2.0-84934343442

Segmenting surgical procedures into constituent phases is of significant utility for resident training, education, self-review, and context-aware operating room technologies. Phase annotation is a highly labor-intensive task and would benefit greatly from automated solutions. Methods: We propose a novel approach using system events—for example, activation of cautery tools—that are easily captured in most surgical procedures. Our method involves extracting event-based features over 90-s intervals and assigning a phase label to each interval. We explore three classification techniques: support vector machines, random forests, and temporal convolution neural networks. Each of these models independently predicts a label for each time interval. We also examine segmental inference using an approach based on the semi-Markov conditional random field, which jointly performs phase segmentation and classification. Our method is evaluated on a data set of 24 robot-assisted hysterectomy procedures. Results: Our framework is able to detect surgical phases with an accuracy of 74 % using event-based features over a set of five different phases—ligation, dissection, colpotomy, cuff closure, and background. Precision and recall values for the cuff closure (Precision: 83 %, Recall: 98 %) and dissection (Precision: 75 %, Recall: 88 %) classes were higher than other classes. The normalized Levenshtein distance between predicted and ground truth phase sequence was 25 %. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that system events features are useful for automatically detecting surgical phase. Events contain phase information that cannot be obtained from motion data and that would require advanced computer vision algorithms to extract from a video. Many of these events are not specific to robotic surgery and can easily be recorded in non-robotic surgical modalities. In future work, we plan to combine information from system events, tool motion, and videos to automate phase detection in surgical procedures. © 2016, CARS.","Robot-assisted surgery; Sensor data; Surgical phase detection; Surgical process modeling; Surgical task flow; Surgical workflow analysis; System events","algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; colpotomy; dissection; human; hysterectomy; ligation; markov chain; measurement accuracy; priority journal; random forest; recall; resident; robot assisted surgery; support vector machine; surgeon; surgical equipment; surgical phase detection; surgical technology; surgical training; task performance; anatomic model; artificial neural network; female; hysterectomy; motion; robotic surgical procedure; support vector machine; surgery; task performance; theoretical model; workflow; Algorithms; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Models, Anatomic; Models, Theoretical; Motion; Neural Networks (Computer); Robotic Surgical Procedures; Support Vector Machine; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Task Performance and Analysis; Workflow",2-s2.0-84968637818

In order to have a macroscopic view of publication activities about robotic surgery, the first bibliometric analysis was conducted to investigate the publication distributions of robotic surgery. Methods: The original articles about robotic surgery were extracted from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) on Web of Science and analyzed concerning their distributions. We also explored the potential correlations between publications of different countries and their Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Results: The total number of original articles retrieved from SCI-E was 3362 from 1994 to 2015. The number of original articles published in the last decade has a burgeoning increase of 572.87% compared with that published in the former decade. The leading country was USA who have published 1402 pieces of articles (41.701%), followed by Germany with 342 (10.173%). The journal published the highest number of original articles was Journal of Endourology with 237 (7.049%), followed by Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques (188, 5.592%). There was strong correlations between publication numbers and GDP of different countries (r2 = 0.889, p &lt; 0.001). In the different medical fields, urology has the highest number of articles (n = 878, 26.007%).

The knowledge we present here gives ideas about how nursing science can address the postmodern, technologic, and global world to come. Monsters therefore serve as an entrance to explore technologic innovations such as AI. Analyzing when and why monsters step out of character can provide important insights into the conceptualization of caring and nursing as a science, which is important for discussing these empathic protocols, as well as more general insight into human knowledge.

Robots provide new innovations that will influence minimally invasive liver surgery in the future. This article presents our initial experience with this technology in our patient population. Material und Methods: In 14 patients with benign or malignant liver tumours, robotic-Assisted liver surgery was performed. Selection criteria were compensated liver function and resection of ≤3 liver segments. Chronic liver disease or previous abdominal surgery were no exclusion criteria. Results: Malignant liver tumours were removed in 10 patients (71%) and benign symptomatic liver tumors in 3 patients (21%), respectively, with histopathologically negative margins (R0). One patient suffering from HCC underwent intraoperative ablation. In one case (7%) conversion was necessary. Mean operation time was 296min (120-458min); mean estimated blood loss was 319±298ml. The mean hospital stay of the patients was 8 days (3-17 days). Three patients (21%) suffered from postoperative complications, which were manageable by conservative treatment (Clavien-Dindo I) in 2 cases (14%). One patient (7%) needed endoscopic treatment for postoperative bile leak (Clavien-Dindo IIIa). No patient died intra-or perioperatively. Conclusion: Robotic-Assisted liver surgery is a safe procedure, which provides patients with all benefits of minimally invasive surgery.

This platform has a patented kinematics designed to keep the final position error below 2 μm in its workspace. But as the high precision performances are due to the proximity of singularities, some drawbacks such as high joint velocities and torques may appear when the trajectory is too close to singularities. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to identify the singularity loci. Usually, when a non-redundant robot operates in a 3D space, the singularity locus is a surface. Here, one contribution is the identification of an helicoidal line for the singularity locus within the workspace. The specific control problems linked to this singularity locus are then described in details. Another contribution concerns the identification of the singularity loci taking into account the robot redundancy and the analysis of the induced control problems linked to the crossing of singularity surfaces.

Modern vehicles can have over 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are small computers, together executing gigabytes of software. ECUs are connected to each other through severalnetworks within the car, and in some cases also to the outside world. This need for addressing ever increasing complexity as well as for offering flexibility, support of continuous evolution, and very late changes in user visible features introduces new challenges for developing and maintaining a suitable electronic architecture.

Furthermore, stiffness adjsutability can enhance energy efficiency in some particular applications, e.g. periodic motions with different frequencies. To adjust the stiffness, different mechanisms have been implemented in VSAs, each to fulfill the requirements of different applications with certain determinants. This paper explains these determinants and presents a comprehensive framework to systematically analyse performances of different stiffness adjustment mechanisms. First, a classification of different stiffness adjustment mechanisms is presented. Then, characteristics of each class regarding different determinants are evaluated and compared through numerical analysis.

Many theories attempt to explain this ability of infant as imitation based on acoustic matching. However, the acoustic qualities of speech produced by the infant and caregiver are quite different and therefore cannot be fully explained by imitation. Instead, the interaction itself may have an important role to play, but the mechanism is still unclear. In this paper, we review studies addressing this topic based on explicit interaction mechanisms using computer simulations and/or real vocal robots. The relationships between these approaches are analyzed after a brief review of the early development of an infant's speech perception and articulation based on observational studies in developmental psychology and a few neuroscientific imaging studies. Finally, future issues related to real infant-caregiver vocal interaction are outlined. © 2016 IEEE.","Affirmative bias; Social interaction; Virtual and physical agents; Vocal development","Affirmative bias; Developmental psychology; Interaction mechanisms; Observational study; Origin of languages; Physical agents; Social interactions; Vocal development; Neurophysiology",2-s2.0-85016152684

Among all the possible information given by a vision system, the punctual estimation of the canopy volume is surely an interesting parameter: it is related to the crop vegetative status and, hence, it is fundamental for performing and setting-up properly some important field-operations (e.g., pruning/thinning, spraying). A system able to recognize the canopy volume can provide either the input-signals for implementing a robotic real-time site-specific farming system or relevant information for a proper crop management. However, there are many practical difficulties in the field implementation of such a system: complex canopy shapes, different colours, textures and illumination conditions with projected shadows. Terrestrial/aerial vision systems working on visible-light wavelengths and/or 2D-images of crops, although capable of excellent performances, have a computationally-heavy post-processing; therefore, they are unsuitable for implementing low-cost real-time servo-actuated cropping systems (e.g., robotised sprayers). Instead, a vision system composed by two LiDAR sensors aligned vertically, scanning the same targets, could give a sort of stereoscopic vision, here named ""lateral-linear-stereoscopic vision"". The aim of this study is assessing the opportunity to use such a system on an automatic or autonomous/robotised implement by performing some preliminary tests in a controlled environment. The resulting system is independent of the lighting conditions (it works also in the dark), is highly reliable (no projected shadows) and data processing is very fast. Although further studies are required to overcome the issues that could arise in a future field implementation, this system has all the premises to be successfully embedded in an automatized monitoring system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural robotic system; Canopy detection; Lateral-linear-stereoscopic vision; LiDAR; Vision systems; Volume estimation","Agriculture; Crops; Data handling; Information management; Monitoring; Optical radar; Real time systems; Robotics; Stereo image processing; Controlled environment; Illumination conditions; Robotic systems; Site-specific farming; Stereoscopic vision; Visible-light wavelengths; Vision systems; Volume estimations; Computer vision; agricultural management; agricultural technology; canopy architecture; data processing; detection method; lidar; robotics; stereo image; unmanned vehicle; vision; volume change",2-s2.0-84961665297

However, the existing robotic heads need improvements in construction and behaviors to facilitate more friendly interactions. This paper presents about design and development of an anthropomorphic robotic head that can make reflex actions based on external forces applied on it. The design parameters of the robotic head have been decided by examining the biomechanics of human head. The robotic head has been designed with 3 DoFs for the neck section. The developed force attentive mechanism is capable of identifying the direction of the applied force. The response of the robot depends on the direction of the external force and the response is decided by a reaction function.

This suggests that effective cancer-fighting micro- or nanorobots would require more integrated functionalities than just the development of directional propelling constructs which have so far been the main general emphasis in medical micro- and nanorobotic research. Development of artificial agents that would be most effective in targeting hypoxic regions may prove to be a very challenging task considering present technological constraints. Self-propelled, sensory-based and directionally-controlled agents in the form of Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB) of the MC-1 strain have been investigated as effective therapeutic nanorobots in cancer therapy. Following computer-based magnetotactic guidance to reach the tumor area, the microaerophilic response of drug-loaded MC-1 cells could be exploited in the tumoral interstitial fluid microenvironments. Accordingly, their swimming paths would be guided by a decreasing oxygen concentration towards the hypoxic regions. However, the implementation of such a targeting strategy calls for a method to switch from a computer-assisted magnetotactic displacement control to an autonomous aerotactic displacement control. In this way, the MC-1 cells will navigate to tumoral regions and, once there, target hypoxic areas through their microaerophilic behavior. Here we show not only how the magnitude of the magnetic field can be used for this purpose but how the findings could help determine the specifications of a future compatible interventional platform within known technological and medical constraints. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Cancer; Hypoxia; Magnetic field; Magnetotactic bacteria; Nanorobots","Bacteria; Diseases; Displacement control; Magnetic fields; Nanorobots; Robots; Tumors; Cancer; Hypoxia; Interstitial fluids; Magnetotactic Bacteria; Micro- and nanorobotics; Oxygen concentrations; Technological constraints; Therapeutic outcomes; Nanorobotics",2-s2.0-84982868513

This phenomenon is largely due to increased work requirements in lower extremity joints, in turn requiring higher muscle activation. The aim of this work was to assess the biomechanical and physiological effects of a multi-joint soft exosuit that applies assistive torques to the biological hip and ankle joints during loaded walking. Methods: The exosuit was evaluated under three conditions: powered (EXO-ON), unpowered (EXO-OFF) and unpowered removing the equivalent mass of the device (EXO-OFF-EMR). Seven participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill and carried a load equivalent to 30 % their body mass. We assessed their metabolic cost of walking, kinetics, kinematics, and lower limb muscle activation using a portable gas analysis system, motion capture system, and surface electromyography. Results: Our results showed that the exosuit could deliver controlled forces to a wearer. Net metabolic power in the EXO-ON condition (7.5 ± 0.6 W kg-1) was 7.3 ± 5.0 % and 14.2 ± 6.1 % lower than in the EXO-OFF-EMR condition (7.9 ± 0.8 W kg-1; p = 0.027) and in the EXO-OFF condition (8.5 ± 0.9 W kg-1; p = 0.005), respectively. The exosuit also reduced the total joint positive biological work (sum of hip, knee and ankle) when comparing the EXO-ON condition (1.06 ± 0.16 J kg-1) with respect to the EXO-OFF condition (1.28 ± 0.26 J kg-1; p = 0.020) and to the EXO-OFF-EMR condition (1.22 ± 0.21 J kg-1; p = 0.007). Conclusions: The results of the present work demonstrate for the first time that a soft wearable robot can improve walking economy.

Nevertheless, economic incentives have resulted in an arms race, where fraudsters develop automated solvers and, in turn, captcha services tweak their design to break the solvers. Recent work, however, presented a generic attack that can be applied to any text-based captcha scheme. Fittingly, Google recently unveiled the latest version of reCaptcha. The goal of their new system is twofold, to minimize the effort for legitimate users, while requiring tasks that are more challenging to computers than text recognition. ReCaptcha is driven by an ""advanced risk analysis system"" that evaluates requests and selects the difficulty of the captcha that will be returned. Users may be required to click in a checkbox, or solve a challenge by identifying images with similar content. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of reCaptcha, and explore how the risk analysis process is influenced by each aspect of the request. Through extensive experimentation, we identify flaws that allow adversaries to effortlessly influence the risk analysis, bypass restrictions, and deploy large-scale attacks. Subsequently, we design a novel low-cost attack that leverages deep learning technologies for the semantic annotation of images. Our system is extremely effective, automatically solving 70.78% of the image reCaptcha challenges, while requiring only 19 seconds per challenge.

Modifications in the surgical technique may help to further improve functional outcomes. Objective To assess the outcome of early catheter removal 48 h after surgery, as opposed to standard catheter removal 6 d after surgery following RARP, using a newly developed surgical technique for posterior reconstruction and anastomosis (Aalst technique). Design, setting, and participants Patients scheduled for RARP were prospectively scheduled for early catheter removal at postoperative d 2 (group A, n = 37) and standard catheter removal at postoperative d 6 (group B, n = 37). Surgical procedure RARP was performed using the Da Vinci Si system. The Aalst technique for the urethro-vesical anastomosis including posterior reconstruction was used as previously described. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The primary endpoint was spontaneous voiding after catheter removal. Secondary endpoints were rate of anastomotic urinary leakage after catheter removal, presence and severity of urethral, perineal, and abdominal pain, as well as patient's bother after catheter removal using visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Rate and severity of urinary incontinence after catheter removal were assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Module (ICIQ-MLUTS) questionnaire. Results and limitations There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to baseline and perioperative parameters, as well as pathological features; however, significantly more patients underwent bilateral nerve-sparing procedures in group A (34 vs 23, p = 0.008). After catheter removal, patients in both groups showed spontaneous voiding, whereas only 11% and 8% of the patients in group A and group B experienced urinary retention after catheter removal (p = 0.7). Patients in group B had significantly higher maximum flow rates, but lower voided volumes after catheter removal in comparison with patients in group A (21 ml/s vs 10 ml/s, p ≤ 0.001 and 170 ml vs 200 ml, p ≤ 0.001, respectively). ICIQ-MLUTS questionnaire and VAS scores showed no significant differences between the groups at any time point. Conclusions The Aalst technique allows the removal of catheters 2 d after RARP and results in spontaneous voiding. Early removal showed no increased rate of urinary leakage, no negative impact on short-term continence and on perineal, urethral or penile pain, and no increase in urinary retention rates. Future studies have to confirm these results with longer follow-up including detailed parameters on return to daily activity. Patient summary We provide evidence that it is possible to remove the bladder catheter as early as 2 d after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy without any negative effects on voiding and pain parameters. Thus, leaving the hospital early without a catheter in place could represent a significant and relevant benefit for the patient. © 2015 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Authors explored what it meant to be human, by contrasting us with hypothetical robots. Such robots were generally seen as coming into existence centuries into the future. In the last decade the rate of progress in robotics has accelerated way beyond popular expectation. The timescales of Asimov and Dick look generous, whereas the dystopian near future of 'Player Piano' [71] seems grimly real. This anxiety is not limited to novelists.

After discussing the great variety and modifications proposed for the basic RRT algorithm, we turn our focus to versions which can address highly dynamic environments, especially those which become increasingly uncertain due to limited accuracy of the sensors used. We, subsequently, explore methods which use Fuzzy Logic to address the uncertainty and methods which consider navigation solutions within the holistic approach of a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework.

Borrowing from the concept of a mobile inverted pendulum system, in this paper, a two-wheel robotic vehicle system is implemented and controlled as the future personal transportation device called the TransBOT. The TransBOT has two driving modes: a regular vehicle mode, where stable contact on the ground is maintained by two wheels and two casters, and the balancing mode, which maintains the stable posture with two wheels on the ground. The two-wheel balancing mechanism can be used as a transportation vehicle in narrow and busy urban areas. Gain scheduling control methods based on linear controllers are used for different drivers. In addition, desired balancing angles are specified for the different sizes of drivers in order to have a stable balancing control performance. These desired balancing angle values have been found by empirical studies. Experimental studies with drivers of different weights, as well as indoor and outdoor driving tasks, were conducted to ensure the feasibility of TransBOT. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2014.","Balancing control; Personal vehicle; Sensor fusion; Two-wheel robot","Electric vehicles; Linear control systems; Pendulums; People movers; Robotics; Transportation; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Wheels; Balancing controls; Gain scheduling control; Mobile inverted pendulum; Personal transportation; Personal vehicles; Sensor fusion; Transportation vehicles; Two wheel robot; Vehicle wheels",2-s2.0-84963851975

We used multivariable generalized mixed linear regressions, which identified several significant risk factors and interactions of risk factors associated with milk production. Free traffic was associated with increased production per cow and per robot per day compared with forced systems, and the presence of a single robot per pen was associated with decreased production per robot per day compared with pens using 2 robots. Retrofitted farms had significantly less production in the first 4 yr since installation compared with production after 4 yr of installation. In contrast, newly built farms did not see a significant change in production over time since installation. Overall, retrofitted farms did not produce significantly more or less milk than newly constructed farms.

Fiber lasers offer their users a production laser at the lowest price per watt, with the highest beam quality, the lowest electrical consumption and minimum maintenance. These lightweight compact lasers can be installed in a matter of a few hours without the need for special mounting surfaces required by many solid-state lasers. The acceptance of fiber lasers for production applications in the automotive industry has been rapid and accelerating. Fueled by their ease of integration with industrial robots, the elimination of He as a welding cover gas and the excellent beam quality, all major automotive companies and their suppliers worldwide have adopted fiber lasers to meet their very demanding production requirements. The major portion of the welding market utilizes fiber lasers from the 2 to 6-kW power levels and are employed for welding, brazing and cladding. These lasers, usually integrated with robots, are employed on applications too numerous to mention as they are deployed in virtually all disciplines of manufacturing. The lower power CW fiber lasers which are available in either a single-mode or multi-mode configuration have also experienced double-digit growth. The single-mode version in the 400–1000 W output power range has become the dominate choice for 3D power bed manufacturing machines.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent uterine-sparing prolapse procedures performed by 10 female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeons between January 2003 and December 2011. Demographic information, operative characteristics, complications (intraoperative and postoperative), and prolapse recurrence were obtained by chart review. Additional information collected included subsequent uterine or cervical pathology, procedures, and pregnancies. Results: Two hundred forty uterine-sparing prolapse procedureswere performed in the 9-year period. One hundred two patients (42.5%) underwent a vaginal procedure, 95 patients (39.6%) underwent a conventional laparoscopic procedure, 28 patients (11.7%) underwent a robotic-assisted laparoscopic procedure, and 15 patients (6.3%) underwent an abdominal procedure. Median follow-up time and interquartile range for abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic surgical routes were 16.4 (3.9-23.9), 14 (3.3-36.4), 22.6 (2.9-64.5), and 6.1 (3-24.4) months, respectively. Prolapse recurrence rates were similar for all groups (abdominal 13.3%, vaginal 14.7%, laparoscopic 11.6%, robotic 3.6%; P = 0.39). Intraoperative, postoperative, and long-term complications rates were similar between all groups (P = 0.63, P = 0.43, P = 0.10). The rate of benign gynecologic conditions encountered after surgery was similar among all groups, with an overall rate of abnormal uterine bleeding/postmenopausal bleeding of 5.4% and overall rate of cervical dysplasia of 0.8%. Two pregnancies were reported, both undergoing cesarean delivery at term.

Some literature suggests exposure to natural movements/stimuli helps restore attention (Herzog, Black, Fountaine, & Knotts, 1997; Kaplan, 1995). Participants were randomly assigned to one experimental condition: dog video breaks, robot video breaks, countdown breaks or continuous vigilance.

The main risk of the procedure is damage of the facial nerve due to mechanical interaction or due to temperature elevation during the drilling process. To evaluate the thermal risk of the drilling process, a simplified model is proposed which aims to enable an assessment of risk posed to the facial nerve for a given set of constant process parameters for different mastoid bone densities. The model uses the bone density distribution along the drilling trajectory in the mastoid bone to calculate a time dependent heat production function at the tip of the drill bit. Using a time dependent moving point source Green’s function, the heat equation can be solved at a certain point in space so that the resulting temperatures can be calculated over time. The model was calibrated and initially verified with in vivo temperature data. The data was collected in minimally invasive robotic drilling of 12 holes in four different sheep. The sheep were anesthetized and the temperature elevations were measured with a thermocouple which was inserted in a previously drilled hole next to the planned drilling trajectory. Bone density distributions were extracted from pre-operative CT data by averaging Hounsfield values over the drill bit diameter. Post-operative (Formula presented.) CT data was used to verify the drilling accuracy of the trajectories. The comparison of measured and calculated temperatures shows a very good match for both heating and cooling phases. The average prediction error of the maximum temperature was less than 0.7 °C and the average root mean square error was approximately 0.5 °C. To analyze potential thermal damage, the model was used to calculate temperature profiles and cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 °C at a minimal distance to the facial nerve. For the selected drilling parameters, temperature elevation profiles and cumulative equivalent minutes suggest that thermal elevation of this minimally invasive cochlear implantation surgery may pose a risk to the facial nerve, especially in sclerotic or high density mastoid bones. Optimized drilling parameters need to be evaluated and the model could be used for future risk evaluation. © 2015, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Bone drilling; Cumulative equivalent minutes; In-vivo experimental study; Minimally invasive cochlear implantation; Robotic surgery; Thermal model for bone drilling; Thermal nerve damage","Bits; Bone; Drills; Function evaluation; Mean square error; Risk assessment; Robotics; Surgery; Thermocouples; Trajectories; Bone drilling; Cumulative equivalent minutes; In-vivo; Minimally invasive; Nerve damage; Robotic surgery; Cochlear implants; animal experiment; Article; bone density; bone drill; cochlear implantation; controlled study; drill bit; facial nerve injury; in vivo study; mathematical computing; mathematical model; minimally invasive procedure; nonhuman; predictive value; priority journal; risk assessment; robotics; sheep; temperature prediction model; temperature sensitivity; thermal injury; animal; biological model; cochlea; cochlea prosthesis; mastoid; minimally invasive surgery; robotic surgical procedure; temperature; Animals; Bone Density; Cochlea; Cochlear Implantation; Cochlear Implants; Mastoid; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Models, Biological; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Sheep; Temperature",2-s2.0-84941330797

Ungrounded cutaneous feedback provides an elegant and inherently stable way to refer haptic feedback to the surgeon in such situations. Choosing the most appropriate display, however, is challenging given the substantial number of unique cutaneous displays presented in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate how measuring the space of tactile sensations that a device can create can be employed to objectively compare different cutaneous displays for a specific task. We built four cutaneous displays and compared their ability to render sensations measured while pinching four disparate materials with a biomimetic tactile sensor. As predicted, quantitative tactile rendering errors varied significantly across devices and materials. The results of this comparison can be used to design better cutaneous displays for pinching palpation in robotic surgery. Furthermore, the proposed approach could provide a useful tool for evaluating novel cutaneous devices for various other tactile tasks, providing an objective framework to supplement and guide future human subject studies. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Biomimetic materials; Biomimetics; Display devices; Electric grounding; Haptic interfaces; Robotics; Surgery; Cutaneous feedbacks; Haptic feedbacks; Human subjects; Safety risks; Specific tasks; Tactile rendering; Tactile sensation; Tactile sensors; Robotic surgery",2-s2.0-84966762927

The main goal of this paper is sharing firsthand experience of using the same set of robots to teach students over 12 grades. This paper starts with general information of the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robots, the basic methods, and the concept of STEM in very simple terms. This paper then explains how building and programming robots was implemented in different ways for different age and experience groups. There are 5 groups in discussion. The first group is the youngest and without any experience. The second group is older but without experience. The third group is older and with some experience. The fourth group is a group of middle school age (grade 5 to 8) students, mostly with some pre-exposure to robots. The last group consists of high school students. Each group is given an age-appropriate goal. It is observed that they have different challenges to conquer.

This will eventually lead to a cascading process called the Kessler syndrome. The time may have come to seriously consider active debris removal (ADR) missions as the only viable way of preserving the space environment for future generations. Among all objects in the current environment, the SL-8 (Kosmos 3M second stages) rocket bodies (R/Bs) are some of the most suitable targets for future robotic ADR missions. However, to date, an autonomous relative navigation to and capture of an non-cooperative target has never been performed.

In particular, the concept was developed having in mind the most critical part of an ADR mission, i.e. close range proximity operations, and state of the art algorithms in the field of autonomous rendezvous and docking.

It is expected that reciprocity will play a principal role in HRI in the future. The negative side of reciprocal phenomena has not been entirely explored in human-robot interaction. For instance, a reciprocal act such as bribery between Humans and robots is a very novel area. In this paper, we try to evaluate the questions: Can a robot bribe a human? To what extent is a robot bribing a human affect his/her reciprocal response? We performed an experiment using the Rock, Paper, Scissors game (RPSG). The robot bribes the participant by losing intentionally in certain rounds to obtain his/her favour later, and through using direct and indirect speech in certain rounds. The participants could obtain between 20%- 25% more money when the robot bribed them than in the control condition. The robot also used either direct or indirect speech requesting a favour in a second task. Our results show that the bribing robot received significantly less reciprocation than in the control condition regardless of whether the request was couched in direct or indirect speech. However there is a significant interaction effect between the bribe and speech conditions. Moreover, just three of sixty participants reported the robot-bribe in an interview as a malfunction, though they did not mention any moral judgement about its behaviour. Further, just 10% of the participants reported the bribe in the online questionnaire. We consider that our experiment makes an early contribution to continue the exploration of morally ambiguous and controversial reciprocal situations in HRI. Robot designers should consider the reciprocal human response towards robots in different contexts including bribery scenarios. Additionally our study could be used in guidelines for robot behavioural design to model future HRI interactions in terms of moral decisions. © 2016 IEEE.","Bribery; Decision games; Paper scissors game; Reciprocity; Rock","Human computer interaction; Machine design; Man machine systems; Robots; Rocks; Tools; Bribery; Decision games; Human relationships; Human response; Interaction effect; Online questionnaire; Reciprocity; Robot designers; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-84964805818

No matter if these children are normally developing or have special needs, evaluating Child- Robot Interaction (CRI) is a challenge. To find methods that work well and provide reliable data is difficult, for example because commonly used methods such as questionnaires do not work well particularly with younger children. Previous research has shown that children need support in expressing how they feel about technology. Given this, researchers often choose time-consuming behavioral measures from observations to evaluate CRI. However, these are not necessarily comparable between studies and robots. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from different disciplines to share their experiences on these aspects. The main topics are methods to evaluate child-robot interaction design, methods to evaluate socially assistive child-robot interaction and multi-modal evaluation of child-robot interaction. Connected questions that we would like to tackle are for example: i) What are reliable metrics in CRI? ii) How can we overcome the pitfalls of survey methods in CRI? iii) How can we integrate qualitative approaches in CRI? iv) What are the best practices for in the wild studies with children? Looking across disciplinary boundaries, we want to discuss advantages and shortcomings of using different evaluation methods in order to compile guidelines for future CRI research.

The developed magnetic localization setup is a 2-D array (8 × 8) of mono-axial Hall-effect sensors, which measure the perpendicular magnetic fields at their given positions. We introduce two steps for localizing a magnetic robot more accurately. First, the dipole-modeled magnetic field of the electromagnet is subtracted from the measured data in order to determine the robot's magnetic field. Second, the subtracted magnetic field is twice differentiated in the perpendicular direction of the array, so that the effect of the electromagnetic field in the localization process is minimized. Five variables regarding the position and orientation of the robot are determined by minimizing the error between the measured magnetic field and the modeled magnetic field in an optimization method. The resulting position error is 2.1 ±0.8 mm and angular error is 6.7 ±4.3° within the applicable range (5 cm) of magnetic field sensors at 200 Hz. The proposed localization method would be used for the position feedback control of untethered magnetic devices or robots for medical applications in the future. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Capsule endoscopy; Localization; Magnetic actuation; Magnetic robot","Electromagnetic fields; Endoscopy; Errors; Hall effect; Hall effect devices; Hall effect transducers; Magnetic field measurement; Magnetic fields; Medical applications; Robots; Capsule endoscopy; Electromagnetic systems; Localization; Magnetic actuation; Magnetic robots; Perpendicular magnetic fields; Position and orientations; Position feedback control; Magnetism",2-s2.0-84963838719

The robot basically releases all of the actuators so that the surgeon can manipulate the drill within the robot's working area with minimal restriction. When the drill reaches a forbidden area, the surgeon feels as if the drill hits a wall. Results: When an engineer performed mastoidectomy using the robot for assistance, the facial nerve in the segmented region was always protected with a more than 2.5 mm margin, which was almost the same as the pre-set safety margin of 3 mm.

If properly designed, a mechanism can also be automatically fabricated without the need of assembly. Considering these capabilities of 3-D printing, this paper presents a novel pneumatic robot design that can be fabricated by 3-D printing processes without the need of assembly. The key element of the proposed robot is the innovative design of a pneumatic stepper motor that allows control of multimotion pattern modes. The proposed pneumatic stepper design is based on a fan motor, thus, having a low requirement on airtightness, which makes it possible for 3-D printing fabrication. For angular motion control, a roller valve is added to the fan motor design. By controlling the air pressure of the roller valve, continuous motion and stepping motion can be obtained. Experiments have shown that the angular velocity can also be controlled by varying the roller-valve air pressure. The effectiveness of the proposed concepts has been demonstrated by a 3-D printed nonassembly pneumatic robot. The printed robot, when connected with air tubes and a pneumatic controller, can perform simple pick and place operations. It is argued that the future functional nonassembly pneumatic robotic systems could be 3-D printed for relevant industries. © 1996-2012 IEEE.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing (AM); Air motor; Motion control; Non-assembly mechanisms; Pneumatic actuators; Stepper motor","3D printers; Air; Atmospheric pressure; Design; Fabrication; Manufacture; Motion control; Pneumatic actuators; Pneumatics; Printing; Robotics; Robots; Rollers (machine components); Stepping motors; 3-D printing; Air motors; Angular motion control; Assembly mechanism; Continuous motions; Geometric complexity; Pneumatic controllers; Stepper motor; Machine design",2-s2.0-84963804548

In the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC), we assessed whether peer and crowd-sourced (ie, layperson) video review of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) could distinguish technical skill among practicing surgeons. A total of 76 video clips from 12 MUSIC surgeons consisted of one of four parts of RARP and underwent blinded review by MUSIC peer surgeons and prequalified crowd-sourced reviewers. Videos were rated for global skill (Global Evaluation Assessment of Robotic Skills) and procedure-specific skill (Robotic Anastomosis and Competency Evaluation). We fit linear mixed-effects models to estimate mean peer and crowd ratings for each video. Individual video ratings were aggregated to calculate surgeon skill scores. Peers (n = 25) completed 351 video ratings over 15 d, whereas crowd-sourced reviewers (n = 680) completed 2990 video ratings in 38 h. Surgeon global skill scores ranged from 15.8 to 21.7 (peer) and from 19.2 to 20.9 (crowd). Peer and crowd ratings demonstrated strong correlation for both global (r = 0.78) and anastomosis (r = 0.74) skills. The two groups consistently agreed on the rank order of lower scoring surgeons, suggesting a potential role for crowd-sourced methodology in the assessment of surgical performance. Lack of patient outcomes is a limitation and forms the basis of future study.

In various applications, these single systems are linked together to become advanced mechatronic systems since they can realize special and general tasks. Unfortunately, the degree of automation in carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) manufacturing is currently rather low. A lot of research still needs to be done in order to achieve the knowledge necessary to gain a consistent, robust and reliable production chain for CFRP. The most decisive criterion in automation is the tradeoff between speed in production and the attainable layup accuracy. One aspect that affects accuracy is vibration caused by rapid movement and interaction forces. In the case of advanced mechatronic systems, the effect of the dynamic coupling is one key factor in accuracy. Over the last few decades, the field of active vibration suppression has made use of its excellent capability to improve the accuracy of machines. Therefore, the paper presents a comprehensive review of active vibration suppression technology for the improvement of precision in manufacturing.

This article reviews the current role of machine learning (ML) techniques in the context of surgery with a focus on surgical robotics (SR). Also, we provide a perspective on the future possibilities for enhancing the effectiveness of procedures by integrating ML in the operating room. Methods: The review is focused on ML techniques directly applied to surgery, surgical robotics, surgical training and assessment. The widespread use of ML methods in diagnosis and medical image computing is beyond the scope of the review. Searches were performed on PubMed and IEEE Explore using combinations of keywords: ML, surgery, robotics, surgical and medical robotics, skill learning, skill analysis and learning to perceive. Results: Studies making use of ML methods in the context of surgery are increasingly being reported. In particular, there is an increasing interest in using ML for developing tools to understand and model surgical skill and competence or to extract surgical workflow. Many researchers begin to integrate this understanding into the control of recent surgical robots and devices. Conclusion: ML is an expanding field. It is popular as it allows efficient processing of vast amounts of data for interpreting and real-time decision making. Already widely used in imaging and diagnosis, it is believed that ML will also play an important role in surgery and interventional treatments. In particular, ML could become a game changer into the conception of cognitive surgical robots. Such robots endowed with cognitive skills would assist the surgical team also on a cognitive level, such as possibly lowering the mental load of the team. For example, ML could help extracting surgical skill, learned through demonstration by human experts, and could transfer this to robotic skills. Such intelligent surgical assistance would significantly surpass the state of the art in surgical robotics.

Understanding the causes of adverse events and their impact on patients in robotassisted surgery will help improve systems and operational practices to avoid incidents in the future. Methods By developing an automated natural language processing tool, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the adverse events reported to the publicly available MAUDE database (maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) from 2000 to 2013. We determined the number of events reported per procedure and per surgical specialty, the most common types of device malfunctions and their impact on patients, and the potential causes for catastrophic events such as patient injuries and deaths. Results During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the 10,624 reports), 1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were reported. The numbers of injury and death events per procedure have stayed relatively constant (mean = 83.4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 74.2-92.7 per 100,000 procedures) over the years. Surgical specialties for which robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower numbers of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9 per 100,000 procedures, Risk Ratio = 2.2, 95% CI, 1.9-2.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as falling of burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%), electrical arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of instruments (8.6%), system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems (2.6%), constituted a major part of the reports. Device malfunctions impacted patients in terms of injuries or procedure interruptions. In 1,104 (10.4%) of all the events, the procedure was interrupted to restart the system (3.1%), to convert the procedure to non-robotic techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it (2.5%). Conclusions Despite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery in the U.S., a non-negligible number of technical difficulties and complications are still being experienced during procedures. Adoption of advanced techniques in design and operation of robotic surgical systems and enhanced mechanisms for adverse event reporting may reduce these preventable incidents in the future. © 2016 Alemzadeh et al.

Rectal cancer surgery, known to be technically challenging, may benefit from robotics in achieving better mesorectal dissection and may contribute to improved perioperative outcomes. The objective of this study was to compare early experience in robotic surgery to conventional approaches with regard to clinicopathologic and economic parameters. Methods: A retrospective review using a prospectively maintained database of rectal cancer surgeries performed at a tertiary cancer center from 2007 to 2013 was conducted. These resections included those performed via laparotomy, laparoscopy, and robotic-assisted operations. Perioperative demographic and tumor characteristics were collected, and short-term clinicopathologic outcomes were compared. Additionally, economic variables were evaluated for each patient’s episode of care. Results: Seventy-nine cases were identified. Twenty-six were completed via open approach, 27 laparoscopically, and 26 via robotic assistance. Demographic characteristics were similar between all groups including age, gender, BMI, and Charlson score. Comparison of intraoperative characteristics showed a lower rate of conversion to laparotomy (12 vs. 37 %, p = 0.05), and lower estimated blood loss (mean 296 vs. 524 cc, p = 0.04), in the robotic group compared to laparoscopy or open resection. There was no significant difference in quality of total mesorectal excision and number of lymph nodes harvested between the three cohorts. Postoperative complication rate, mean length of stay, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality were comparable among the cohorts. Median cost per episode of care was lower in laparoscopic surgery ($11,493), compared to open ($12,558) and robotic approach ($18,273); p = 0.029. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate similar perioperative and short-term outcomes between robotic surgery and conventional approaches. Robotic assistance is associated with decreased intraoperative blood loss and fewer conversions, albeit at an increased overall cost. Given these benefits, and as data and experience mature, future study is needed to fully define the value of the robotic approach. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cost; Laparoscopy; Rectal cancer; Robotics","aged; Article; cancer center; cancer surgery; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chemoradiotherapy; clinical effectiveness; comparative effectiveness; female; hospital readmission; hospitalization; hospitalization cost; human; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; major clinical study; male; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; patient care; priority journal; rectum cancer; rectum surgery; robot assisted surgery; tertiary care center; colon resection; comparative study; laparoscopy; laparotomy; middle aged; Postoperative Complications; procedures; Rectal Neoplasms; retrospective study; robotic surgical procedure; tertiary care center; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Colectomy; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Laparotomy; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Rectal Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Tertiary Care Centers; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84961782059

We selected 11 areas with populations of around 1 million or more where there were one or more hospitals with robotic equipment and 4 or more without it. In addition, annual changes of case loads for prostatectomy over 4 years from 2010 to 2013 were clearly determined in these areas. The case loads were determined based on the results of a questionnaire survey for the hospitals with robots and on the Diagnostic Procedures Combination data provided by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Wealth for those without such equipment. The concentration of the case loads was principally defined as when hospitals with robots had more predominant proportion of cases than those without them in the comparison between case loads prior to instillation of robots (or in the initial year of the study) and those in the final years. The 11 selected areas included 44 hospitals with robots and 156 without them. Concentration of case loads was found in 5 areas. In 4 areas, installation of robots did not have a specific relation to the distribution patterns of case loads in hospitals with or without the equipment. The remaining 2 areas tended to have a weak but not definite concentration of case loads. In the areas in which installation did not influence case loads the further analysis revealed that their case loads had already been concentrated in the initial year (2010) of the study. Although the current results were found in a single department of the hospital, robotic installation may result in concentration of prostatectomy case loads for such hospitals in some areas. The current results are intriguing when we consider the future roles of acutecare hospitals and beds in our country where the number of aged patients having chronic diseases will increase. In conclusion, installation of robotic equipment may result in concentration of prostatectomy case loads in some areas.","Case load; DPC data; Prostatectomy; Questionnaire; Robotic surgery; Survey","devices; hospital; human; male; prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; questionnaire; robotic surgical procedure; statistics and numerical data; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84973571029

The number of robot-assisted surgeries has increased dramatically in the field of urology. In April 2012, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy became covered by the Healthcare Insurance System in Japan. Moreover, it may soon become covered for use in partial nephrectomy and radical cystectomy. With the continued development of minimally invasive surgery in the field of adult urology, including endoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic approaches, the indications for minimally invasive surgery have similarly expanded for the pediatric population. The most commonly performed robotic procedure in children has been pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. The use of robotics in complex reconstructive surgery in the lower urinary tract has also become acceptable. There are many studies which have reported its advantages in that it can produce better results and involves a shorter learning curve when compared to open or laparoscopic surgery. The da Vinci robot system is also used not only for laparoscopic surgery but also for open urethroplasty procedures because of the advantages of this approach, such as motion scaling, greater optical magnification, increased instrument tip dexterity, and tremor filtration. The main limitations to robotic surgery are its high purchase price and its maintenance costs, with the cost-effectiveness of this technology still needing to be validated. In pediatric urology, cosmetic needs and smaller workspace needs are disadvantages. However, these problems could be resolved soon by advancements in the technology. In the near future, robotic-assisted surgery may become established as an alternative to minimally invasive surgery in the field of pediatric urology.","Antireflux surgery; Pediatric urology; Pyeloplasty; Robotic surgery; Urethroplasty",,2-s2.0-84973661414

Despite knowledge of contact sensation in air, little is known about contact sensing underwater and the impact of fluid on both the robotic probe and the target object. The objective of this work is to understand the effects of fluidic loading, fin webbing, and target object geometry on strain sensation within compliant robotic fins and beams during obstacle contact. General descriptions of obstacle contact were sought for strain measurements in fins and beams. Multiple phases of contact were characterized where the robot, fluid, and object interact to affect sensory signals. Unlike in air, the underwater structure-fluid-structure interaction (SFSI) caused changes to strain in each phase of contact. The addition of webbing to beams created a mechanical coupling between adjacent beams, which changed contact strains. Complex obstacle geometries tended to make contact less apparent and caused stretch in fins. This work demonstrates several effects of fluidic loading on strain sensing with compliant robotic beams and fins as they contact obstacles in air and underwater, and provides guidance for future work in underwater active sensing with compliant manipulators. © 2015 IEEE.","Biorobotics; collision detection; measurement-based synthesis/modeling; sensors","Air; Air navigation; Crashworthiness; Fins (heat exchange); Fluid structure interaction; Haptic interfaces; Manipulators; Robotics; Sensors; Strain; Bio-robotics; Collision detection; Compliant manipulators; Contact sensing; General description; Measurement-based; Mechanical coupling; Underwater operations; Loading; animal; biological model; biomechanics; computer simulation; devices; equipment design; fin (organ); human; physiology; procedures; robotics; transducer; utilization; Animal Fins; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Computer Simulation; Equipment Design; Humans; Models, Biological; Robotics; Transducers",2-s2.0-84976349403

Robots provide new innovations that will influence minimally invasive liver surgery in the future. This article presents our initial experience with this technology in our patient population. Material und Methods: In 14 patients with benign or malignant liver tumours, robotic-assisted liver surgery was performed. Selection criteria were compensated liver function and resection of ≤ 3 liver segments. Chronic liver disease or previous abdominal surgery were no exclusion criteria. Results: Malignant liver tumours were removed in 10 patients (71%) and benign symptomatic liver tumors in 3 patients (21%), respectively, with histopathologically negative margins (R0). One patient suffering from HCC underwent intraoperative ablation. In one case (7%) conversion was necessary. Mean operation time was 296 min (120-458 min); mean estimated blood loss was 319 ± 298 ml. The mean hospital stay of the patients was 8 days (3-17 days). Three patients (21%) suffered from postoperative complications, which were manageable by conservative treatment (Clavien-Dindo I) in 2 cases (14%). One patient (7%) needed endoscopic treatment for postoperative bile leak (Clavien-Dindo IIIa). No patient died intra- or perioperatively. Conclusion: Robotic-assisted liver surgery is a safe procedure, which provides patients with all benefits of minimally invasive surgery. This highly advanced technology requires surgeons to strive for an increasing level of specialisation, in addition to being well-trained in liver surgery. Hence, a clear definition of the procedures and standardised teaching programs are necessary. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart·New York.","laparoscopic surgery; liver metastasis resection; liver resection; liver tumour; surgical technique","adult; aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; devices; female; Germany; human; laparoscopy; length of stay; liver; Liver Diseases; Liver Neoplasms; liver resection; male; middle aged; pathology; Postoperative Complications; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; secondary; surgical equipment; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Female; Germany; Hepatectomy; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Liver; Liver Diseases; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Surgical Equipment; Surgical Instruments",2-s2.0-84963620779

The proposed system is used to detect and track moving targets from near-to-far ranges and covers a wide range of more than 130 m without decreasing detection accuracy. Typical examples of targets include traffic signs, vehicles, animals, and pedestrians. In this paper, the detection and tracking of moving pedestrians from near-to-far ranges is investigated. The proposed system is composed of two identical cameras. The first camera is equipped with a short focal length lens to detect and track pedestrians in near-to-mid range, and the second camera with a long focal length lens is used to detect and track pedestrians in mid-to-far range. To synchronize the detection results of both cameras and to eliminate repeated measurements, two synchronization algorithms were developed. The tracking process is applied after the detection, and it is used to track and predict the future motion and direction of pedestrian. To prevent vehicle-target collisions, two algorithms that generate alert and danger warnings are developed. A mathematical model based on the fundamental physics of the camera and lens is developed to illustrate the feasibility of our work.

Design/methodology/approach – Other studies have investigated symmetric physiotherapy. A key difficulty in previous work is in maintaining mirror-imaged trajectories between the affected and less-affected limbs. This obstacle was overcome in this work by using a two-armed robotic exoskeleton to enforce symmetry. In total, 15 subjects, >6 months post stroke were, randomly assigned to bilateral symmetric robotic training, unilateral robotic training, and standard physical therapy. Findings – After 12 training sessions (90 minutes/session), the bilateral training group had the greatest intensity of movement training. They also had the greatest improvement in range of motion at the shoulder. The unilateral training group showed the greatest reduction in spasticity. Research limitations/implications – The rationale for symmetric physiotherapy is that it might promote connections from the undamaged brain hemisphere. The robot generated copious amounts of detailed kinematic data. Even though these data provided insights into the human to machine interface using different training modalities, it proved difficult to draw neurological conclusions. It is recommended that future research along these lines should include measures of neurophysiological change and/or changes in neurological activity. Practical implications – This research suggests that the advantage of bilateral symmetric movement over other modalities is slight, and that robotic training has comparable results with standard care. If BST is used, care is potentially needed to avoid exacerbation of spasticity. Finally, this research includes a novel quantitative approach for evaluating robotic training. Originality/value – This study is of value to therapeutic researchers interested in new physiotherapy techniques, roboticists interested in developing rehabilitation devices, or for rehabilitation game designers interested in using virtual reality. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bilateral; Data mining; Physical therapy; Real-time systems; Robotics; Stroke; Stroke survivors; Symmetric; Virtual reality","Data mining; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Interactive computer systems; Neurology; Physical therapy; Real time systems; Virtual reality; Bilateral; Design/methodology/approach; Quantitative approach; Rehabilitation devices; Robotic exoskeletons; Stroke; Stroke survivors; Symmetric; Robotics",2-s2.0-84960356362

My aim in this paper is twofold. First, I will argue that the ethical case for allowing autonomous targeting, at least in specific restricted domains, is stronger than critics have typically acknowledged. Second, I will attempt to defend the intuition that, even so, there is something ethically problematic about such targeting. I argue that an account of the nonconsequentialist foundations of the principle of distinction suggests that the use of autonomous weapon systems (AWS) is unethical by virtue of failing to show appropriate respect for the humanity of our enemies. However, the success of the strongest form of this argument depends upon understanding the robot itself as doing the killing. To the extent that we believe that, on the contrary, AWS are only a means used by combatants to kill, the idea that the use of AWS fails to respect the humanity of our enemy will turn upon an account of what is required by respect, which is essential conventional. Thus, while the theoretical foundations of the idea that AWS are weapons that are evil in themselves are weaker than critics have sometimes maintained, they are nonetheless sufficient to demand a prohibition of the development and deployment of such weapons.

Structured surgical training and objective assessment are critical for outcomes. Objective To develop and validate a modular training and assessment pathway via Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) for trainees undertaking RARP and evaluate learning curves (LCs) for procedural steps. Design, setting, and participants This multi-institutional (Europe, Australia, and United States) observational prospective study used HFMEA to identify the high-risk steps of RARP. A specialist focus group enabled validation. Fifteen trainees who underwent European Association of Urology robotic surgery curriculum training performed RARP and were assessed by mentors using the tool developed. Results produced LCs for each step. A plateau above score 4 indicated competence. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis We used a modular training and assessment tool (RARP Assessment Score) to evaluate technical skills. LCs were constructed. Multivariable Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and κ coefficient analyses were used. Results and limitations Five surgeons were observed for 42 console hours to map steps of RARP. HFMEA identified 84 failure modes and 46 potential causes with a hazard score ≥8. Content validation created the RARP Assessment Score: 17 stages and 41 steps. The RARP Assessment Score was acceptable (56.67%), feasible (96.67%), and had educational impact (100%). Fifteen robotic surgery trainees were assessed for 8 mo. In 426 RARP cases (range: 4-79), all procedural steps were attempted by trainees. Trainees were assessed with the RARP Assessment Score by their expert mentors, and LCs for individual steps were plotted. LCs demonstrated plateaus for anterior bladder neck transection (16 cases), posterior bladder neck transection (18 cases), posterior dissection (9 cases), dissection of prostatic pedicle and seminal vesicles (15 cases), and anastomosis (17 cases). Other steps did not plateau during data collection. Conclusions The RARP Assessment Score based on HFMEA methodology identified critical steps for focused RARP training and assessed surgeons. LCs demonstrate the experience necessary to reach a level of competence in technical skills to protect patients. Patient summary We developed a safety and assessment tool to gauge the technical skills of surgeons performing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Improvement was monitored, and measures of progress can be used in future to guide mentors when training surgeons to operate safely. © 2015 European Association of Urology.","Assessment; Learning curve; Patient safety; Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy; Training","anastomosis; Article; assessment of humans; bladder surgery; clinical assessment; clinical competence; clinical evaluation; construct validity; content validity; cost effectiveness analysis; curriculum; feasibility study; healthcare failure mode and effect analysis; high risk patient; human; interrater reliability; job performance; learning curve; observational study; patient safety; priority journal; prospective study; prostate surgery; prostatectomy; risk assessment; risk factor; robot assisted radical prostatectomy; Robot assisted Radical Prostatectomy Assessment Score; robot assisted surgery; seminal vesicle; surgical risk; surgical training; treatment failure; validation process; adverse effects; Australia; clinical trial; education; educational status; Europe; longitudinal study; male; medical education; mentor; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; procedures; prostatectomy; reproducibility; robotic surgical procedure; statistical model; task performance; teaching; United States; validation study; Australia; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Graduate; Educational Measurement; Educational Status; Europe; Humans; Learning Curve; Linear Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mentors; Multivariate Analysis; Prospective Studies; Prostatectomy; Reproducibility of Results; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Task Performance and Analysis; Teaching; United States",2-s2.0-84973533408

The authors propose a passive, reconfigurable, parallel robot which can be directly attached to bone anchors implanted in a patient’s skull, avoiding the need for surgical tracking systems. Prior to clinical trials, methods are necessary to patient specifically optimize the configuration of the mechanism with respect to accuracy and stability. Furthermore, the achievable accuracy has to be determined experimentally. Methods: A comprehensive error model of the proposed mechanism is established, taking into account all relevant error sources identified in previous studies. Two optimization criteria to exploit the given task redundancy and reconfigurability of the passive robot are derived from the model. The achievable accuracy of the optimized robot configurations is first estimated with the help of a Monte Carlo simulation approach and finally evaluated in drilling experiments using synthetic temporal bone specimen. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the bone-attached mechanism exhibits a mean targeting accuracy of (Formula presented.)  mm under realistic conditions. A systematic targeting error is observed, which indicates that accurate identification of the passive robot’s kinematic parameters could further reduce deviations from planned drill trajectories. Conclusion: The accuracy of the proposed mechanism demonstrates its suitability for minimally invasive cochlear implantation.

Combining these advantages, mobile dual-arm robots are expected to perform a variety of tasks in the future. Kinematically, the configuration of two arms that branches from the mobile base results in a serial-to-parallel kinematic structure. In order to respond to external disturbances, this serial-to-parallel kinematic structure makes inverse kinematic computations non-trivial, as the motion of the base has to take the needs of both arms into account. Instead of using the dual-arm kinematics directly, we propose to use a virtual kinematic chain (VKC) to specify the common motion of the two arms. We formulate a constraint-based programming solution which consists of two parts. In the first part, we use an extended serial kinematic chain including the mobile base and the VKC to formulate constraints that realize the desired orientation and translation expressed in the world frame. In the second part, we use the resolved VKC motion to constrain the common motion of the two arms. In order to explore the redundancy of the two arms in an optimization framework, we also provide a VKC-oriented manipulability measure as well as its closed-form gradient. We verify the proposed approach with simulations and experiments that are performed on a PR2 robot, which has two 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) arms and a 3 DoF mobile base. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","dual-arm robot; Mobile manipulation; virtual kinematic chain","Chains; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Inverse kinematics; Manipulators; Robotic arms; Robots; Dual-arm robot; External disturbances; Kinematic chain; Manipulability measures; Mobile manipulation; Optimization framework; Programming solutions; Serial to parallels; Kinematics",2-s2.0-84963626954

In this review, we discuss therapeutic and diagnostic applications of untethered medical microrobots. Wirelessly controlled milli/microrobots with integrated sensors are revolutionizing micromanipulation based medical interventions and are enabling doctors to perform minimally invasive procedures not possible before. 3D fabrication technologies enabling milli/microrobot fabrication at the single cell scale are empowering high-resolution visual imaging and in vivo manipulation capabilities. Swallowable millirobots and injectabale ocular microrobots allow the gastric ulcer imaging, and performance of vitreoretinal microsurgery at previously inaccessible ocular sites. Many invasive excision and incision based diagnostic biopsy, prostrate, and nephrolgical procedures can be performed minimally or almost noninvasively due to recent advancements in microrobotic technology. Advances in biohybrid microrobot systems are pushing microrobotic systems even smaller, using biological cells as on-board microactuators and microsensors using the chemical energy. Such microrobotic systems could be used for local targeted delivery of imaging contrast agents, drugs, genes, and mRNA, minimally invasive surgery, and cell micromanipulation in the near future. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.","Drug delivery; Micromanipulation; Microrobots; Minimally invasive surgery; Theranostic","contrast medium; drug; ligand; messenger RNA; biopsy; cell therapy; diagnostic imaging; drug delivery system; drug targeting; follow up; gene; human; micromanipulation; microrobot; microsurgery; minimally invasive surgery; molecular imaging; nonhuman; nonviral gene delivery system; priority journal; regenerative medicine; Review; robot assisted surgery; robotics; stomach ulcer; tissue engineering; vitreoretinal surgery; devices; equipment design; image processing; mobile phone; procedures; theranostic nanomedicine; Cell Phones; Drug Delivery Systems; Equipment Design; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microsurgery; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Theranostic Nanomedicine",2-s2.0-84961754987

The basic controllers of this architecture are the emotional processes that decide which behaviors the robot must activate to fulfill the objectives. The number of emotional processes increases (hundreds of millions/s) with the complexity level of the application, limiting the processing capacity of a main processor to solve the complex problems. Fortunately, the potential parallelism of emotional processes permits their execution in parallel, hence enabling the computing power to tackle the complex dynamic problems. In this paper, Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), multicore processors and single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions are used to provide parallelism for the emotional processes. Different GPUs, multicore processors and SIMD instruction sets are evaluated and compared to analyze their suitability to cope with robotic applications. The applications are set-up taking into account different environmental conditions, robot dynamics and emotional states. Experimental results show that, despite the fact that GPUs have a bottleneck in the data transmission between the host and the device, the evaluated GTX 670 GPU provides a performance of more than one order of magnitude greater than the initial implementation of the architecture on a single core. Thus, all complex proposed application problems can be solved using the GPU technology in contrast to the first prototype where only 55% of them could be solved. Using AVX SIMD instructions, the performance of the architecture is increased in 3.25 times in relation to the first implementation. Thus, from the 27 proposed applications about 88.8% are solved. In the case of the SSE SIMD instructions, the performance is almost doubled and the robot could solve about 74% of the proposed application problems. The use of AVX and SSE SIMD instructions provides almost the same performance as a quad- and a dual-core, respectively, with the advantage that they do not add any additional hardware cost. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Emotional architecture; Graphics Processing Unit processors; Multicore processors; Robotics; SIMD instructions","Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Mobile agents; Parallel processing systems; Problem solving; Program processors; Robotics; Robots; Emotional architectures; Environmental conditions; Graphic processing unit(GPU); Graphics Processing Unit; Multi-core processor; Processing capacities; SIMD instructions; Single instruction multiple data instructions; Computer architecture",2-s2.0-84958756908

Patients and Methods: From January 2003 to November 2014, 315 simple prostatectomies were performed using three techniques, LSP, RSP, and IF-RSP; of the patients who underwent these procedures, 236 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Results: No statistically significant difference (SSD) was found in preoperative or perioperative variables. Of the postoperative variables that were analyzed, an SSD (p > 0.01) in prostate-specific antigen levels was found, with levels of 0.07 ± 1.1 ng/mL following IF-RSP, and the detection rate of prostate adenocarcinoma (26%) and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN; 12%) was higher for IF-RSP. We also found that lower International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) were associated with LSP, at 4.8 ± 3.2. Erectile function was reduced in IF-RSP patients in the first 6 months after surgery but was similar in all patient groups at 12 months after surgery; continence and other measured parameters were also similar at 12 months for all three techniques. Conclusion: The IF-RSP technique is safe and effective, with results at 1-year follow-up for continence, IPSS, and Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores similar to those for the LSP and RSP techniques. IF-RSP also offers the advantages that it does not require postoperative irrigation, has an increased ability to detect prostate cancer (CA) and HG-PIN, and avoids the risk of future cancer and subsequent reintervention for possible new prostate growth. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",,"prostate specific antigen; prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; Article; body mass; clinical trial; continence; diarrhea; enterocutaneous fistula; follow up; genital system disease assessment; hematuria; human; intermethod comparison; International Prostate Symptom Score; intrafascial robotic simple prostatectomy; intraoperative period; laparoscopic simple prostatectomy; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; middle aged; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; overactive bladder; peroperative complication; postoperative complication; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; prostate adenocarcinoma; prostate hypertrophy; prostate volume; prostatectomy; prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia; robot assisted surgery; robotic simple prostatectomy; sexual health; Sexual Health Inventory for Men; skin infection; urethra stenosis; urinary tract infection; urine retention; urinoma; adenocarcinoma; blood; comorbidity; comparative study; erectile dysfunction; laparoscopy; penis erection; Postoperative Complications; procedures; prostatectomy; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Prostatic Neoplasms; treatment outcome; Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Comorbidity; Erectile Dysfunction; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Penile Erection; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Prostatic Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84960905296

Comic heroes ranging from live action comedians Chaplin or Keaton to animated animals Felix or Mickey worked against work through the playful excesses of their obediences and transgressions within an increasingly rationalized, industrial world. The digital animation studio Pixar summoned slapstick and its specifically Fordist resonances in its 2008 feature, WALL-E, yet offered a twist in humanizing a figure of perfected Fordism itself with its title character, a robot repetitively working in a post-apocalyptic earth devoid of human life. Explicitly modeled after Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd, WALL-E contrasts with the film's humans, who are entirely liberated from labor through automation in a satirical reflection of both post-Fordist accounts of the 'end of work' as well as broader critiques of a distracting digital culture. This article focuses on the film's revitalization of slapstick traditions within the context of recent debates about post-Fordism, the future of automated labor and the transformation of working human bodies. Just as slapstick's relationship to modern labor touched on the playful mode of its cinematic production as well as their form as indexical montage so too does Pixar's corporate reputation as 'Creativity, Inc' suggest a complex relationship between its slapstick hero and the digital labor animating his movement. The same will be argued of Pixar's vaunted techniques with both digital image-making and commodity generation, both of which suggest a nostalgic animation of slapstick's antinomies as much as a disavowal of the post-Fordist production of which Pixar is vanguard. © SAGE Publications. © The Author(s) 2015.","automatism; comedy; digital; Fordism; indexical; labour; Pixar; post-Fordism; slapstick",,2-s2.0-84959040521

The sensor module collects soil moisture and temperature data and air temperature and humidity data that is then gathered periodically by a line following robot that uploads the stored data from the sensor module via Bluetooth communication for further analysis. © 2015 IEEE.","Agricultural Monitoring System; Bluetooth Communication; Data Collection System; Real Time System; Remote Areas","Agriculture; Air quality; Bluetooth; Crops; Data acquisition; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Soil moisture; Agricultural monitoring; Bluetooth communications; Data collection system; Farming management; Line-following robots; Precision Agriculture; Predictive analytics; Remote areas; Monitoring",2-s2.0-84964880212

The architecture splits this problem into two parts: The stochastic transient firing of the network embodies the dynamics of the planning task. With appropriate injected input this dynamics is shaped to generate high-reward state trajectories. A general class of reward-modulated plasticity rules for these afferent synapses is presented. The updates optimize the likelihood of getting a reward through a variant of an Expectation Maximization algorithm and learning is guaranteed to convergence to a local maximum. We find that the network dynamics are qualitatively similar to transient firing patterns during planning and foraging in the hippocampus of awake behaving rats. The model extends classical attractor models and provides a testable prediction on identifying modulating contextual information. In a real robot arm reaching and obstacle avoidance task the ability to represent multiple task solutions is investigated. The neural planning method with its local update rules provides the basis for future neuromorphic hardware implementations with promising potentials like large data processing abilities and early initiation of strategies to avoid dangerous situations in robot co-worker scenarios.",,"avoidance behavior; coworker; expectation; foraging; hippocampus; human; human experiment; information processing; model; plasticity; prediction; reward; robotics; synapse; wakefulness",2-s2.0-84959020509

Relying on one robot is far from optimal as loss of the unit means failure of the whole mission. On the contrary, robotic swarms depend on large numbers of simple, cheap, and error-prone robots that exhibit global desirable features like fault-Tolerance, scalability, and robustness. The study of underwater robotic swarms from the overall mission-planning perspective has been very limited. Planning specific parts of a mission has mostly been the focus of previous research. We propose a general framework for designing and planning underwater swarm missions. We break a typical mission down into its primary constituents and study the requirements for each sub-mission separately. Initially, the swarm self-organizes to form a shape that maximizes residual energy and minimizes water resistance during transport towards the target. This is followed by path planning and shape maintenance, in which the swarm strives to maintain its collective shape and move in cohesion on a collectively-selected path. Next, another self-organization phase takes place to optimize mission-core accomplishment at the target. Remaining phases, in the back trip, are the counterparts of the first two.

Many research studies have focused on robot' s walking together with people where participants are mainly adults. However, these research were not targeted for children, and therefore, children are ignored when considering a walking together system. In addition, some of these studies used robots that were operated by remote control as the first step. In this paper, we propose a walking together system that enables a child to assist a robot by teaching the robot the moving direction. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by implementing our system on the personal robot Pepper and by conducting an experiment with nine child participants. In the experiment, the robot is supposed to walk with a child by having its hand pulled for recognizing the moving direction. A child walks in two ways during the experiment: One is walking in front of it and the other is walking besides it. Three trials are used for setting the proper experimental course. Six out of the nine participants walking data, five walking video data and inquiry results from nine participants are evaluated.

No studies have investigated whether combining these interventions enhances lower extremity motor function following SCI. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether active tDCS paired with LT-RGO improves lower extremity motor function more than a sham condition, in subjects with motor incomplete SCI. METHODS: Fifteen adults with SCI received 36 sessions of either active (n=9) or sham (n=6) tDCS (20 minutes) preceding LT-RGO (1 hour). Outcome measures included manual muscle testing (MMT; primary outcome measure); 6-Minute Walk Test (6MinWT); 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT); Timed Up and Go Test (TUG); Berg Balance Scale (BBS); and Spinal Cord Independence Measure-III (SCIM-III). RESULTS: MMT showed significant improvements after active tDCS, with the most pronounced improvement in the right lower extremity. 10MWT, 6MinWT, and BBS showed improvement for both groups. TUG and SCIM-III showed improvement only for the sham tDCS group. CONCLUSION: Pairing tDCS with LT-RGO can improve lower extremity motor function more than LT-RGO alone.

Video-assisted thoracoscopy is the technique most commonly used today, but the robotic approach is considered the future of minimally invasive surgery, above all because of its high-definition stereoscopic view, improved dexterity because of increased degrees of movement of the instruments, lack of the fulcrum effect, tremor filtration, and greater surgeon comfort. Two techniques have been described for robotic lobectomy: robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) and complete portal robotic lobectomy. The RATS technique necessitates an anterior approach to the hilum and does not routinely use CO2 insufflation; complete portal robotic lobectomy uses a posterior approach, with the specimen extracted at the end of surgery via a subcostal, transdiaphragmatic route. This article provides a step-by-step description of right upper lobectomy using a 4-arm RATS approach. The procedure is feasible and safe to perform for experienced surgeons. Although the incidence of severe intraoperative complications is low but potentially life-threatening, we believe the technique is valid for the minimally invasive treatment of lung cancer. Nonetheless, operator comfort should be the main factor influencing the choice of technique. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","lung cancer; robotic lung lobectomy; robotic surgery","carbon dioxide; aeration; Article; body position; endoscopic surgery; human; lung cancer; lung lobectomy; patient safety; priority journal; robot assisted surgery; surgeon; surgical technique",2-s2.0-85028661225

In most studies on electromagnetic actuated microrobots, only a single microrobot has been used to manipulate cells or microparticles. However, the use of a single microrobot can pose several limitations when performing multiple roles in microparticle manipulation. To overcome the limitations associated with using a single microrobot, we propose a new method for the control of multiple microrobots. Multiple microrobots can be controlled independently by an electromagnetic actuation system and multiple microclampers combined with microheaters. To select a specific microrobot among multiple microrobots, we propose a microclamper composed of a clamper structure using thermally responsive hydrogel and a microheater for controlling the microclamper. A fundamental test of the proposed microparticle manipulation system is performed by selecting a specific microrobot among multiple microrobots. Through the independent locomotion of multiple microrobots with U- and V-shaped tips, heterogeneous microparticle manipulation is demonstrated in the creation of a two-dimensional structure. In the future, our proposed multiple-microrobot system can be applied to tasks that are difficult to perform using a single microrobot, such as cell manipulation, cargo delivery, tissue assembly, and cloning. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","magnetic control; microparticle manipulation; multiple microrobots; thermally responsive hydrogel","Clone cells; Heating equipment; Hydrogels; Microelectromechanical devices; Molecular biology; Particle optics; Electromagnetic actuation; Magnetic control; Micro-robot systems; Microparticle manipulations; Microrobots; Thermally responsive; Thermally responsive hydrogels; Two-dimensional structures; Data communication equipment",2-s2.0-84959386818

A natural outgrowth of these advances are systems comprised of large numbers of robots that collaborate autonomously in diverse applications. Research on effective autonomous control of such systems, commonly called swarms, has increased dramatically in recent years and received attention from many domains, such as bioinspired robotics and control theory. These kinds of distributed systems present novel challenges for the effective integration of human supervisors, operators, and teammates that are only beginning to be addressed. This paper is the first survey of human-swarm interaction (HSI) and identifies the core concepts needed to design a human-swarm system. We first present the basics of swarm robotics. Then, we introduce HSI from the perspective of a human operator by discussing the cognitive complexity of solving tasks with swarm systems. Next, we introduce the interface between swarm and operator and identify challenges and solutions relating to human-swarm communication, state estimation and visualization, and human control of swarms. For the latter, we develop a taxonomy of control methods that enable operators to control swarms effectively. Finally, we synthesize the results to highlight remaining challenges, unanswered questions, and open problems for HSI, as well as how to address them in future works. © 2013 IEEE.","Human-robot interaction (HRI); human-swarm interaction (HSI); multi-robot systems; swarm robotics","Cognitive systems; Interface states; Robotics; Robots; Surveys; Autonomous control; Bio-inspired robotics; Cognitive complexity; Control methods; Distributed systems; Diverse applications; Human interactions; Human supervisors; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-84944622449

Compared to car-like nonholonomic vehicles, they provide a higher degree of maneuverability, and often require less complex path planning and control schemes. Three different types of holonomic wheels that enable omnidirectional motion have been proposed in literature: universal, Mecanum, and ball wheel mechanisms. A problem commonly associated with the first two wheel types is that they induce vibrations in the system due to the discontinuous contact points. In this article, a ball wheel mechanism with superior features including slip measurement, free-wheel modus and attrition sensing is presented. The first prototype was built using additive manufacturing. The requirements for the design and possible improvements for future versions are discussed. Based on the presented ball wheel drive, a design for an omnidirectional mobile robot platform driven by three redundant ball wheel units is proposed. The velocity kinematic model of this mobile base is also addressed. Moreover, motion planning for an individual ball drive is demonstrated by means of an online trajectory generation scheme. The pseudocode of the trajectory planning algorithm implemented in LabVIEW is then presented. Finally, the motion characteristics of the ball drive mechanism are tested and its functionality is evaluated in detail. Measurements obtained from these tests show that the slip between the ball wheel and the ground can be estimated quite accurately. Hence, it is expected that these improved dead-reckoning estimates will result in a higher positioning accuracy of the final base. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ball drive; Free-wheel; Mobile platform; Omnidirectional; Redundancy","Kinematics; Machine design; Maneuverability; Mobile robots; Motion planning; Redundancy; Robots; Wheels; Mobile platform; Motion characteristics; Omni-directional motion; Omnidirectional; Omnidirectional mobile robot; On-line trajectory generations; Path planning and control; Trajectory planning algorithm; Vibrations (mechanical)",2-s2.0-84955202038

This simultaneously exploits the strengths of both humans and robots, such that the surgeon directly feels tool-tissue interactions and remains in control of the procedure, while taking advantage of the robot's higher precision and accuracy. A crucial challenge in hands-on robotics for delicate manipulation tasks, such as surgery, is that the user must interact with the dynamics of the robot at the end-effector, which can reduce dexterity and increase fatigue. This paper presents a null-space-based optimization technique for simultaneously minimizing the mass and friction of the robot that is experienced by the surgeon. By defining a novel optimization technique for minimizing the projection of the joint friction onto the end-effector, and integrating this with our previous techniques for minimizing the belted mass/inertia as perceived by the hand, a significant reduction in dynamics felt by the user is achieved. Experimental analyses in both simulation and human user trials demonstrate that the presented method can reduce the user-experienced dynamic mass and friction by, on average, 44% and 41%, respectively. The results presented robustly demonstrate that optimizing a robots pose can result in a more natural tool motion, potentially allowing future surgical robots to operate with increased usability, improved surgical outcomes, and wider clinical uptake.

A promising approach to provoke cardiovascular stress while facilitating task-specific exercise in people with disabilities is feedback-controlled robot-assisted end-effector-based stair climbing (RASC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, reliability, and repeatability of augmented RASC-based CPET in able-bodied subjects, with a view towards future research and applications in neurologically impaired populations. Methods Twenty able-bodied subjects performed a familiarisation session and 2 consecutive incremental CPETs using augmented RASC. Outcome measures focussed on standard cardiopulmonary performance parameters and on accuracy of work rate tracking (RMSEPa root mean square error). Criteria for feasibility were cardiopulmonary responsiveness and technical implementation. Relative and absolute test-retest reliability were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of the measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC). Mean differences, limits of agreement, and coefficients of variation (CoV) were estimated to assess repeatability. Results All criteria for feasibility were achieved. Mean V0O2peak was 106Â±9% of predicted V0O2max and mean HRpeak was 99Â±3% of predicted HRmax. 95% of the subjects achieved at least 1 criterion for V0O2max, and the detection of the sub-maximal ventilatory thresholds was successful (ventilatory anaerobic threshold 100%, respiratory compensation point 90% of the subjects). Excellent reliability was found for peak cardiopulmonary outcome measures (ICC ≥ 0.890, SEM ≤ 0.60%, MDC ≤ 1.67%). Repeatability for the primary outcomes was good (CoV ≤ 0.12). Conclusions RASC-based CPET with feedback-guided exercise intensity demonstrated comparable or higher peak cardiopulmonary performance variables relative to predicted values, achieved the criteria for V0O2max, and allowed determination of sub-maximal ventilatory thresholds. The reliability and repeatability were found to be high. There is potential for augmented RASC to be used for exercise testing and prescription in populations with neurological impairments who would benefit from repetitive task-specific training. © 2016 Stoller et al.",,"adult; Article; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiopulmonary function; coefficient of variation; correlation coefficient; exercise; feasibility study; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; limits of agreement; lung ventilation; male; maximal exercise capacity; mean difference; measurement accuracy; measurement repeatability; medical device; minimal detectable change; outcome assessment; prediction; robot assisted end effector based stair climbing; robotic device; robotics; standard error of the measurement; statistical analysis; test retest reliability; adolescent; clinical trial; devices; exercise test; middle aged; procedures; Adolescent; Adult; Exercise Test; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Robotics",2-s2.0-84959421707

This paper presents the 'GRIBBOT' - a novel 3D vision-guided robotic concept for front half chicken harvesting. It functions using a compliant multifunctional gripper tool that grasps and holds the fillet, scrapes the carcass, and releases the fillet using a downward pulling motion. The gripper has two main components; a beak and a supporting plate. The beak scrapes the fillet down the rib cage of the carcass following a path determined by the anatomical boundary between the meat and the bone of the rib cage. The supporting plate is actuated pneumatically in order to hold the fillet. A computer vision algorithm was developed to process images from an RGB-D camera (Kinect v2) and locate the grasping point in 3D as the initial contact point of the gripper with the chicken carcass for harvesting operation. Calibration of camera and robot was performed so that the grasping point was defined using 3D coordinates within the robot's base coordinate frame and tool centre point. A feed-forward Look-and-Move control algorithm was used to control the robot arm and generate the motion trajectories, based on the 3D coordinates of the grasping point as calculated from the computer vision algorithm. The results of an experimental proof-of-concept demonstration showed that GRIBBOT was successful both in scraping the carcass, grasping chicken fillets automatically and in completing the front half fillet harvesting process. It demonstrated a potential for the flexible robotic automation of the chicken fillet harvesting operation. Its commercial application, with further development, can result in automated fillet harvesting, while future research may also lead to optimal raw material utilisation. GRIBBOT shows that there is potential to automate even the most challenging processing operations currently carried out manually by human operators. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Chicken; Flexible automation; Gripper; Harvesting; Robot; Visual servoing","Algorithms; Animals; Automation; Cameras; Grippers; Harvesting; Robotics; Robots; Visual servoing; Chicken; Commercial applications; Computer vision algorithms; Flexible automation; Harvesting operations; Initial contact point; Processing operations; Production efficiency; Computer vision; algorithm; bone; calibration; computer vision; coordinate; harvesting; image analysis; meat; performance assessment; poultry; research work; robotics; Norway",2-s2.0-84951753536

This manuscript reviews the most recent literature regarding the comparative efficacy of various surgical repair techniques in the treatment of advanced stage pelvic organ prolapse. Uterosacral ligament suspension has similar anatomic and subjective outcomes when compared to sacrospinous ligament fixation at 12 months and is considered to be equally effective. The use of transvaginal mesh has been shown to be superior to native tissue vaginal repairs with respect to anatomic outcomes but at the cost of a higher complication rate. Minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy appears to be equivalent to abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC). Robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RSC) and laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) appear as effective as abdominal sacrocolpopexy, however, prospective studies of comparing long-term outcomes of ASC, LSC, and RSC in relation to health care costs is paramount in the near future. Surgical correction of advanced pelvic organ prolapse can be accomplished via a variety of proven techniques. Selection of the correct surgical approach is a complex decision process and involves a multitude of factors. When deciding on the most suitable surgical intervention, the chosen route must be individualized for each patient taking into account the specific risks and benefits of each procedure.

The future trajectories of the robot are represented as directed graphs and the uncertain states of the obstacles are represented by probability distributions. Instead of evaluating the safety of the graph by determining the route with the smallest collision probability, the optimal policy minimizing the collision probability is used. The policy allows one to replan the route depending on the future probability distributions of the obstacles. Since these distributions are unknown at the time point of the assessment, they are simulated and represented by compound probability distributions. These compound distributions represent all possible future distributions of the obstacles. It is shown that this novel method is always less conservative than previous approaches. Two example implementations are presented, one using Gaussian distributions and one using motion patterns for representing the uncertain states of the obstacles. Simulation scenarios are used for validating the proposed concept. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","POMDP; Robotics; Safety assessment; Uncertain environments","Directed graphs; Probability; Robotics; Safety engineering; Transport properties; Collision probability; Compound distributions; Motion pattern; Optimal policies; POMDP; Possible futures; Safety assessments; Uncertain environments; Probability distributions",2-s2.0-84955628868

Methods: Ten patients underwent RA. After exposure of the retroperitoneal space, but before adrenal dissection was started, ICG was given intravenously (IV). Fluorescence Firefly™ imaging was performed at 1-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min time points. The precision with which the borders of the adrenal tissue were distinguished with ICG imaging was compared to that with the conventional robotic view. The number and the total volume of injections for each patient were recorded. Results: There were six male and four female patients. Diagnosis was primary hyperaldosteronism in four patients and myelolipoma, adrenocortical neoplasm, adrenocortical hyperplasia, Cushing’s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, and metastasis in one patient each. Procedures were done through a robotic lateral transabdominal approach in nine and through a robotic posterior retroperitoneal approach in one patient. Dose per injection ranged between 2.5 and 6.3 mg and total dose per patient 7.5–18.8 mg. The adrenal gland took up the dye in 1 min, with contrast between adrenal mass and surrounding retroperitoneal fat becoming most distinguished at 5 min. Fluorescence of adrenal tissue lasted up to 20 min after injection. Overall, ICG imaging was felt to help with the conduct of operation in 8 out of 10 procedures. There were no conversions to open or morbidity. There were no immediate or delayed adverse effects attributable to IV ICG administration. Conclusion: In this pilot study, we demonstrated the feasibility and safety of ICG imaging in a small group of patients undergoing RA. We described a method that enabled an effective fluorescence imaging to localize the adrenal glands and guide dissection.

Wireless microrobots are employed in a wide range of biomedical application and they may have the potential to accomplish various radical medical procedures because they can be transported deep into the human body to perform tasks safely and reliably. In particular, colonoscopy is an important procedure during the diagnosis of various pathologies, especially cancer of the colon and rectum. However, the colonoscopy process is often painful for the patient and complex for the operator, so wireless microrobots could be employed for the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal malignant tumors. In this study, we developed a novel tele-operation system that can be used in biomedical applications, where we designed a master controller and slaver controller for the system. We also designed a novel type of wireless microrobot with hybrid motion, which can be driven by differences in an external magnetic field. Thus, a doctor could operate joysticks from the master side to control the wireless microrobot on the slave side in real time. Using a control algorithm based on an eight-step rotating magnetic field, the slave controller can generate a more uniform rotating magnetic field and avoid many of the problems that affect traditional control methods. We evaluared the performance of a tele-operated controller and the wireless microrobot with hybrid motion in experiments. The experimental results indicated that the wireless microrobot with hybrid motion could complete forward-backward and upward-downward movements easily with similar kinematic characteristics, where the available frequency band was widened by the control algorithm based on an eight-step rotating magnetic field. The maximum velocity was measured as 29.8 mm/s at around 18 Hz in the horizontal direction and as 9.6 mm/s at around 16 Hz in the vertical direction with an input current of 0.7 A. The tele-controller obtained good performance in the experiments and it could be used widely in medical clinics in the future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The original humanitarian goals of BCIs and the technological inventiveness result in BCIs being surprisingly useful. We begin from the neurologically impaired person, the problems encountered, and some pioneering responses from computers and machines. Secondly, the interface of mind and brain is explored via two points of clarification: direct and indirect BCIs, and the nature of thoughts. Thirdly, dualism is beset by mind–body interaction difficulties and is further questioned by the phenomena of intentions, interactions, and technology. Fourthly, animal minds and robots are explored in BCI settings again with relevance for dualism.

Here, we present a new concept for a hybrid actuated soft microrobot targeted drug delivery. The proposed soft microrobot consists of a hydrogel bilayer structure of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (PHEMA) and poly (ethylene glycol) acrylate (PEGDA) with iron (II, III) oxide particles (Fe3O4). The PHEMA layer as a pH-responsive gel is used for a trapping and unfolding motion of the soft microrobot in pH-varying solution, and the PEGDA-with-Fe3O4 layer is employed for the locomotion of the soft microrobot in the magnetic field. The bilayer soft microrobot was fabricated by a conventional photolithography procedure and its characteristics were analyzed and presented. To evaluate the trapping performance and the motility of the soft microrobot, test solutions with different pH values and an electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system were used. First, the soft microrobot showed its full trapping motion at about pH 9.58 and its unfolding motion at about pH 2.6. Second, the soft microrobot showed a moving velocity of about 600 μm s-1 through the generated magnetic field of the EMA system. Finally, we fabricated the real anti-cancer drug microbeads (PCL-DTX) and executed the cytotoxicity test using the mammary carcinoma cells (4T1). The viability of the 4T1 cells treated with the proposed microrobot and the PCL-DTX microbeads decreased to 70.25 ± 1.52%. The result demonstrated that the soft microrobot can be moved to a target position by the EMA system and can release a small amount of beads by the pH variation and the robot exhibited no toxicity to the cells. In the future, we expect that the proposed soft microrobot can be applied to a new tumor-therapeutic tool that can move to a target tumor and release anti-tumor drugs. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","drug delivery; magnetic actuation; microrobot; pH-responsive hydrogel; soft microrobot","Data communication equipment; Diseases; Drug delivery; Electromechanical actuators; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; PHEMA; Photolithography; Polyethylene glycols; Tumors; 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate; Conventional photolithography; Electromagnetic actuation; Magnetic actuation; Mammary carcinoma cell; Micro robots; pH-responsive hydrogels; Targeted drug delivery; Hydrogels",2-s2.0-84957041293

A large number of controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that laparoscopic colorectal surgery is associated with the same benefits than other minimally invasive procedures, including lesser pain, earlier recovery of bowel transit and shorter hospital stay. On the other hand, despite initial concerns about oncological safety, well-designed prospective randomized multicentre trials have demonstrated that oncological outcomes of laparoscopy and open surgery are similar. Although the use of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery has increased in recent years, the percentages of patients treated with surgery using minimally invasive techniques are still reduced and there are also substantial differences among centres. It has been argued that the limiting factor for the use of laparoscopic procedures is the number of surgeons with adequate skills to perform a laparoscopic colectomy rather than the tumour of patients' characteristics. In this regard, future efforts to increase the use of laparoscopic techniques in colorectal surgery will necessarily require more efforts in teaching surgeons. We here present a review of recent controversies of the use of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery, such as in rectal cancer operations, the possibility of reproducing complete mesocolon excision, and the benefits of intracorporeal anastomosis after right hemicolectomy.

The box pushing problem is a well known problem in robotics, used to demonstrate the advantages of multi-robot systems. The goal is to move an object (typically a box-like structured object) to a predefined location. A team of robots is used if the box is too heavy or too difficult to handle for a single robot. Additionally, the box pushing problem is relevant in many real world applications like warehouse stocking or transporting of materials in a production process. A solution to the box pushing problem using a single spherical robot is presented in this paper. The emphasis of this work was a robust solution to the box-pushing problem with real robotic hardware, rather than the multi-robot aspect of the original box-pushing problem. A fully autonomous solution is presented, consisting of a camera module for localization issues and a path planning module for controlling the spherical robot, both modules are connected via the open source Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. The final implementation is capable to reliably move the box to any arbitrary location, compensating disturbances in sensor information or varying surface frictions. The paper describes the key components of the final implementation and concludes with an outline for future extensions of the system. © 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Mechatronik.",,"Industrial robots; Motion planning; Multipurpose robots; Open systems; Robotics; Robots; Spheres; Innovative approaches; Multi-robot systems; Production process; Robot operating systems (ROS); Robotic hardware; Robust solutions; Sensor informations; Spherical robots; Robot programming",2-s2.0-84966589431

Control of robot manipulator for industrial applications is considered as one of the challenging tasks. In this paper, Model Predictive Controller (MPC), a class of advanced control technique is proposed in order to control the motion of the revolute joints. MPC is an optimal control strategy based on numerical optimization. Future control inputs and future plant responses are predicted using a system model and optimized at regular intervals with respect to a performance index. Prediction is to determine the future value of the output variables based on available information. This prediction can be used in the design of control laws for better performance of the control systems. The suggested predictive control approach uses an objective function centered on output estimates over a prediction horizon, and hence error is decreased by a selection of operated variable over a control horizon. The performance of the angular motion of the 2-DOF robot link is analyzed with various set point changes in terms of torque.

We allow three types of possible interaction between neighbors, which we term signalling, sweeping and tracking. Assuming any such interaction can be executed without significant delay, and assuming each point can generate random bits and has unlimited memory, we describe a randomized algorithm which a.a.s. runs in time O(n), hence in time proportional to the diameter, provided the number of points is o(n3).

Delivering exercises at a participant's desired difficulty has the potential to improve both motor learning and users' engagement in therapy. Motivation and engagement are among the contributing factors to the success of exercise programs. The authors previously demonstrated that error amplification can be used to introduce levels of challenge into a robotic reaching task, and that machine-learning algorithms can dynamically adjust difficulty to the desired level with 85% accuracy. Building on these findings, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study investigating the impacts of practicing under desirable difficulty conditions. A control condition with a predefined random order for difficulty levels was deemed more suitable for this study (compared to constant or continuously increasing difficulty). By practicing the task at their desirable difficulties, participants in the experimental group perceived their performance at a significantly higher level and reported lower required effort to complete the task, in comparison to a control group. Moreover, based on self-reports, participants in the experimental group were willing, on average, to continue the training session for 4.6 more training blocks (∼45 min) compared to the control group's average. This study demonstrates the efficiency of delivering the exercises at the user's desired difficulty level to improve the user's engagement in exercise tasks.

However, the competitors choice to build humanoid robots tells a different narrative. In particular, through the physical design choices, the giving of names and the tasking of roles, the competing teams perpetuated a gendered narrative. This narrative in turn reifies gendered norms of warfighting, and ultimately leads to an accretion of gendered practices in militaries, politics and society, despite contemporary attempts at minimizing these practices through policies of inclusion. I argue that though much work on gender and technology exists, the autonomous humanoid robot - the one currently sought by DARPA - is something entirely new, and must be addressed on its own terms. In particular, this machine exceeds even Haraway's conception of the post-human cyborg, and rather than emancipating human beings from gender hierarchy, further reifies its practices.

The purpose of this review is to facilitate the continued growth of the subfield by describing the state of the art in concentric tube robot research. We begin with current and proposed applications for these robots and then trace their origins (some aspects of which date back to 1985), before proceeding to describe the state of the art in terms of modeling, control, sensing, and design. The paper concludes with forward-looking perspectives, noting that concentric tube robots provide rich opportunities for further research, yet simultaneously appear poised to become viable commercial devices in the near future. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Machine design; Robotics; Robots; Commercial Devices; Concentric tube; Forward looking; In-control; Medical robotics; State of the art; Robot programming",2-s2.0-84964896885

Currently, robots lack the ability to learn from their environment. Learning is advantageous, since it decreases engineering effort and allows the robot to adapt to specific properties of its potentially yet unknown environment. However, in space robotics machine learning is not yet used, as it introduces extra risk for safety-critical missions. In this talk, we will introduce self-supervised learning as a reliable learning method that allows robots to adapt to their environment. We have previously successfully tested this method for the navigation of autonomous drones on Earth, which showed its potential in terms of reliability for application in space. Here, we will present preliminary results from an ISS test performed with the MIT/NASA SPHERES VERTIGO satellite, which is equipped with a stereo vision system that allows it to see distances and navigate by itself in the ISS. The presented preliminary experiments were performed on October 8th 2015 on board the ISS. In the experiments, the satellite learned by itself how to see distances with a single camera. It did so by using the distance estimates from its stereo vision process as supervised learning targets. The main advantage of this learning method is that the robot becomes robust against losing the images from one of the cameras - it can then still continue to function. The main goals of the experiment were (1) data gathering, and (2) navigation on the basis of stereo vision. First the astronaut Kimya Yui moved the satellite around the Japanese Experiment Module to gather stereo vision data for learning. Subsequently, the satellite freely explored the space in the module based on its (trusted) stereo vision system and a pre-programmed exploration behavior, while simultaneously performing the self-supervised learning on board in the background. The two main goals were successfully achieved, representing the first online learning robot experiments in space. These results lay the ideal basis for a follow-up experiment in which the satellite will use the learned single-camera distance estimation for autonomous exploration in the ISS, and form a small step towards future space robots that continuously improve their navigation capabilities over time, even in harsh and completely unknown space environments.","Monocular depth estimation; Persistent self-supervised learning; Space robotics; Stereo vision",,2-s2.0-85016473685

The shielding from cosmic radiation that they provide makes them a potentially hospitable habitat for life. This motivates the need to explore such lava tubes and assess their potential as locations for future human outposts. Such exploration will likely be conducted by autonomous mobile robots before humans, and this paper proposes a novel mechanism for constructing maps of lava tubes using a multi-robot platform. A key issue in mapping lava tubes is the presence of fine sand that can be found at the bottom of most tubes, as observed on earth. This fine sand makes robot odometry measurements highly prone to errors. To address this issue, this work leverages the ability of a multi-robot system to measure the relative motion of robots using laser range finders. Mounted on each robot is a 2D laser range finder attached to a servo to enable 3D scanning. The lead robot has an easily recognized target panel that allows the follower robot to measure both the relative distance and orientation between robots. First, these measurements are used to enable 2D (SLAM) of a lava tube. Second, the 3D range measurements are fused with the 2D maps via ICP algorithms to construct full 3D representations. Thismethod of 3D mapping does not require odometry measurements or fine-scale environment features. It was validated in a building hallway system, demonstrating successful loop closure and mapping errors on the order of 0.63m over a 79.64m long loop. Error growth models were determined experimentally that indicate the robot localization errors grow at a rate of 20mm per meter travelled, although this is also dependent on the relative orientation of robots localizing each other. Finally, the system was deployed in a lava tube located at Pisgah Crater in the Mojave Desert, CA. Data was collected to generate a full 3D map of the lava tube. Comparison with known measurements taken between two ends of the lava tube indicates the mapping errors were on the order of 1.03m after the robot travelled 32m. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Cosmology; Errors; Industrial robots; Landforms; Mapping; Multipurpose robots; Radar equipment; Radiation shielding; Range finders; Robot applications; Robot learning; Robotics; Tubes (components); 3d representations; Autonomous Mobile Robot; Laser range finders; Multi-robot systems; Range measurements; Relative distances; Relative orientation; Robot localization; Robots",2-s2.0-84961279447

This is due to the fact that mostly industrial robots are not properly equipped to recognize their surrounding and take intelligent decisions regarding path planning especially for low volume, flexible production with versatile production lines. The proposed idea is that a robot manipulator performing assembly or disassembly tasks should be able to predict potential collisions even with unknown obstacles and must be able to prevent i.e. react automatically for safe detour around obstacle. Currently, industrial robots have tactile sensing abilities, which detect collisions after a real contact but the existing proposals for its avoidance are either computationally expensive, need prior information about the obstacles or not very well adapted to the safety standards. Therefore, this paper introduces a ToF sensor based information collection and intelligent decision methodology in order to localize the un-known, un-programmed obstacles and propose a safe peg-in-hole automated assembly process. In the case of collisions, the proposed method will provide various solutions and decides for the best solution according to the scenario on-hand.

Since the future actions of humans are ambiguous, robots need to carefully conclude about the appropriate action. This requires a mathematical model to evaluate all possible future actions, corresponding probabilities and the possible relation between humans and the objects. Our contribution is the modeling methodology for the human activities using the probabilistic state machine (PSM). Not only the objects, but also latent human poses and the relationships between humans and the objects are here considered. The probabilistic model allows uncertainties and variations in the object affordances.

Here we are particularly interested in heterogeneous robots that collaborate in complex scenarios with incomplete, dynamically changing information. In detail, we consider a search and rescue setting, where robots with different capabilities work together to accomplish tasks (rescue) and find information about further tasks (search) at the same time. The state of the art for such collaboration is robot control based on independent planning for robots with different capabilities and typically incorporates uncertainty with only a limited scope. In contrast, in this paper, we create a joint plan to optimise all robots' actions incorporating uncertainty about the future information gain of the robots. We evaluate our planner's performance in settings based on real disasters and find that our approach decreases the response time by 20-25% compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, practical constraints are met in terms of time and resource utilisation. Copyright © 2016, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

This poses increasing demands on healthcare, both in numbers and capabilities. For a number of specific applications new medical robots possibly can increase quality as well as reduce costs of healthcare. A new precision surgical robot design is presented which enables precise, safe, fast and less invasive bone removal, with a focus on procedures in the skull (base) and ear. The compact robot can operate autonomously using CT image data, but can also be driven manually by the surgeon. After determination of the robots' requirements, a deterministic process was used to select the best concept from multiple generated robotic concepts. A compact serial robotic arm with seven axes, built from modular units, gives the possibility to have a high rigidity, dexterity, large range of motion and low-cost design, while being able to achieve sufficient accuracy of an estimated 50 μm. Moreover, it is designed to withstand milling and drilling forces up to 50 N and usable in the medical operating room with minimal intervention. The weight of the seven- Axis robot with its base is estimated to be 9 kg. In future medical operating rooms, this precision robot may reduce the amount of bone removed up to a factor 30, could improve safety and could enable new surgical procedures. It might reduce bone-milling time from hours into minutes, being able to help more patients and reduce costs. Exact numbers will be generated after realisation and testing of one module and the full robot, which will be steps in future research.","Bone surgery; Computer assisted surgery; Drilling; Milling; Modular robot; Otology; Serial robot; Skull base surgery; Surgical robot","Audition; Bone; Computerized tomography; Cost reduction; Costs; Drilling; Health care; Machine design; Milling (machining); Modular robots; Nanotechnology; Operating rooms; Precision engineering; Robotic arms; Robotic surgery; Robotics; Robots; Safety factor; Surgery; Transplantation (surgical); Bone surgery; Computer assisted surgery; Otology; Serial robots; Skull base surgery; Surgical equipment",2-s2.0-84984621769

This project is divided in three phases: the definition of the requirements and scenarios, the development of a new robotic platform, and the evaluation. This work presents the results obtained in the first phase, in which several meetings were conducted with a set of subject-matter experts in the areas of Alzheimer’s Disease and social robotics. The meetings were classified according to the application areas they covered: general aspects, safety, entertainment, personal assistance, and stimulation. The meetings ended up with a repertory of scenarios where robots can be applied to Alzheimer’s patients and their caregivers at their home or in longterm care facilities. These scenarios present different psychological, social and technical concerns that must be addressed for the design of the robot.

The system has enough precision and robustness to meet the requirements of industrial environments. Design/methodology/approach - Using an algorithm for artificial beacon detection combined with a Kalman Filter and an outlier rejection method, it was possible to enhance the precision and robustness of the overall localization system. Findings - Usually, industrial automatic guide vehicles feature two kinds of lasers: one for navigation placed on top of the robot and another for obstacle detection (security lasers). Recently, security lasers extended their output data with obstacle distance (contours) and reflectivity. These new features made it possible to develop a novel localization system based on a security laser. Research limitations/implications - Once the proposed methodology is completely validated, in the future, a scheme for global localization and failure detection should be addressed. Practical implications - This paper presents a comparison between the presented approach and a commercial localization system for industry. The proposed algorithms were tested in an industrial application under realistic working conditions. Social implications - The presented methodology represents a gain in the effective cost of the mobile robot platform, as it discards the need for a dedicated laser for localization purposes. Originality/value - This paper presents a novel approach that benefits from the presence of a security laser on mobile robots (mandatory sensor when considering industrial applications), using it simultaneously with other sensors, not only to guarantee safety conditions during operation but also to locate the robot in the environment. This paper is also valuable because of the comparison made with a commercialized system, as well as the tests conducted in real industrial environments, which prove that the approach presented is suitable for working under these demanding conditions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","AGV; Kalman filter; Localization; Mobile robots; Outliers rejection; Security laser","Accident prevention; Kalman filters; Laser safety; Mobile robots; Object recognition; Obstacle detectors; Robot applications; Statistics; Design/methodology/approach; Implementation cost; Industrial environments; Industry case studies; Localization; Mobile robot localization; Mobile robot platforms; Outliers rejections; Robots",2-s2.0-84991783904

Originality/value: The increasing presence of robots and artificial intelligence not only offers alternative ways for society to function but also sharpens the challenges that one culture faces when confronted by other communities who are able to fill traditional positions beyond the traditional one of “work”. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Cultural change; Education; Foresight; Future; Robots; Work",,2-s2.0-85010659662

A potential route toward natural and efficient learning and teaching in HumanRobot Interaction (HRI) is to leverage the social competences of humans and the underlying interactional mechanisms. In this perspective, this article discusses the importance of pragmatic frames as flexible interaction protocols that provide important contextual cues to enable learners to infer new action or language skills and teachers to convey these cues. After defining and discussing the concept of pragmatic frames, grounded in decades of research in developmental psychology, we study a selection of HRI work in the literature which has focused on learning-teaching interaction and analyze the interactional and learning mechanisms that were used in the light of pragmatic frames. This allows us to show that many of the works have already used in practice, but not always explicitly, basic elements of the pragmatic frames machinery. However, we also show that pragmatic frames have so far been used in a very restricted way as compared to how they are used in human-human interaction and argue that this has been an obstacle preventing robust natural multitask learning and teaching in HRI. In particular, we explain that two central features of human pragmatic frames, mostly absent of existing HRI studies, are that (1) social peers use rich repertoires of frames, potentially combined together, to convey and infer multiple kinds of cues; (2) new frames can be learnt continually, building on existing ones, and guiding the interaction toward higher levels of complexity and expressivity. To conclude, we give an outlook on the future research direction describing the relevant key challenges that need to be solved for leveraging pragmatic frames for robot learning and teaching. © 2016 Vollmer, Wrede, Rohlfing and Oudeyer.","Action learning; Cognitive developmental robotics; Human-robot interaction; Language learning; Pragmatic frames; Robot learning; Robot teaching; Social learning","Education; Human computer interaction; Machinery; Man machine systems; Robot learning; Robotics; Robots; Teaching; Action learning; Developmental robotics; Language learning; Pragmatic frames; Robot teaching; Social learning; Human robot interaction; developmental psychology; human; language development; machine; robotics; social learning; teaching",2-s2.0-85015616313

A different line of research in developmental psychology has established a major role for imitation in skill transfer and emergence of culture. This study is a preliminary cross–cultural exploration of the effect of imitating the robot (back imitation) on human’s perception of robot’s imitative skill. In previous research, we have shown that engagement in back imitation with a NAO humanoid robot, results in increased perception of robot’s imitative skill, human–likeness of motion, and willingness of future interaction with the robot. This previous work mostly used Japanese university students. In this paper, we report the results of conducting the same study with subjects of two cultures: Japanese and Egyptian university students. The first finding of the study is that the two cultures have widely different expectations of the robot and interaction with it and that some of these differences are significantly reduced after the interaction. The second finding is that Japanese students tended to attribute higher imitation skill and human likeness to the robot they imitated while Egyptian students did not show such tendency.

Breakthroughs made in artificial intelligence, natural language processing and related fields make it possible to replace human labors with online artificial intelligent robots to provide the e-commerce customer service, which indicates the online robots are the future of e-commerce customer services. However, most of the current robots are designed to reply with knowledge matching the key words in question sentences from the database, rarely involving in research on customer intentions that are key factors influencing user experience and online sales. In this research, an intention recognizing model was proposed to obtain intentions of e-commerce consumers by computing the strengths of candidate intention nodes in the intention graph, which was used to describe relations between different goods that could be the intentional targets of e-commerce consumers. The proposed robot was constructed based on the intention recognizing model to identify intentions of consumers and use the located knowledge combined with the AIML based sentence composition template to produce the response sentences for consumers.

The introduction of industrial robots is widely seen as an effective strategy against rising competition and outsourcing to low-cost countries. The investment into industrial robot cells is often based on the initial offering and its pay-off time. However, procurement decisions based only on the initial price are often poor decisions since they do not consider hidden cost factors such as maintenance or energy consumption. Evaluating the total cost of ownership (TCO) of industrial robots is a far better alternative to calculate all costs involved during their company ownership. Thus far, only a few models concerning TCO or similar cost analysis techniques for industrial robots have been published and empirical studies of the economic aspects of robotic implementation are scarce. The key contribution of this paper is the development of a conceptual model for TCO calculation of industrial robots, which can be used during the decision making process. The developed model was tested in two case studies, one for material handling robots and one for arc welding. The goal was to identify the most crucial factors allowing an easily estimated calculation of the TCO based on the net present value. As most contributing factors, operators' wages, spare parts and energy consumption are identified. However, this paper also shows that retrieving necessary data from companies turned out to be complicated, because of the low awareness of these companies' expenditures for the costs generated by their automation equipment. In accordance with the results, both, a simple template was created in order to support the people involved in the decision making process with additional investment information and crucial factors are pointed out for measuring and evaluation in of future digitalized robot systems. © 2016 The Authors.","Automation; industrial robot; method development; total cost of ownership (TCO)","Automation; Behavioral research; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Electric welding; Energy utilization; Industrial robots; Investments; Manufacture; Materials handling; Robots; Automation equipment; Contributing factor; Decision making process; Material handling robots; Method development; Procurement decisions; Robotic implementation; Total cost of ownership; Economic and social effects",2-s2.0-85006981405

The wiping mechanism is the most important functional component of a glass-cleaning robot, which indirectly affects the design of the adsorption and transport mechanisms. This study aims to compare two types of wiping mechanisms - the drag-wiper and roller-wiper -through an analysis and an actual experiment, providing theoretical and measured data that can be applied to the optimization of the design of future glass-cleaning robots. Design/methodology/approach - The authors undertook a theoretical force and energy consumption analysis of glass-cleaning robots and, based on the obtained results, undertook an analysis the two wiper types. They verified the theoretical analysis by conducting several experiments including studying the relationship between a wiper's friction force and rotational speed, measuring the contact normal forces of the suckers, wiper and crawlers relative to the glass wall, measuring the energy consumed to drive the robot and studying the relationship between the vacuum pump's power consumption and the adsorption force. The authors also compared the wiping efficacy of the drag-wiper robot and roller-wiper robot. Findings - The drag-wiper offers the advantages of simplicity while being able to wipe the area around the edge of a window frame. Meanwhile, the use of a roller-wiper not only improves the robot's driving performance and reduces the required adsorption force but can also reduce the amount of energy consumed to drive both the robot itself and also the vacuum pump; in addition, the roller-wiper is more flexible and energy- and time-efficient when dealing with dirt that is difficult to remove.

Given that both a change in movement behavior and social behavior are an objective in the contexts of aging-in-place, neurocognitive and neurophysical rehabilitation, and depression, these key mechanisms should also be included in the interaction with social companion robots in therapy and care. We give an overview on the two concepts ranging from a social neuroscience over a behavioral towards a sociological perspective and argue that both concepts affect each other and are up to now only marginally applied in human–robot interaction.

Here, we present the design of a miniature robotic fish for future animal-robot interaction studies featuring a novel application of multi-material three-dimensional (3D) printing and utilizing a solenoid for actuation. The use of multi-material printing enables a skeletal design of only two parts, while retaining the complete functionality of larger prototypes enclosing requisite electronics and incorporating an active joint for propulsion.

This paper presents a novel unsupervised qualitative-relational framework for learning human motion patterns using a single mobile robot platform. It is capable of learning human motion patterns in real-world environments, in order to predict future behaviours. This previously untackled task is challenging because of the limited field of view provided by a single mobile robot. It is only able to observe one location at any time, resulting in incomplete and partial human detections and trajectories. Central to the success of the presented framework is mapping the detections into an abstract qualitative space, and then characterising motion invariant to exact metric position. This framework was used by a physical robot autonomously patrolling an office environment during a six week deployment. Experimental results from this deployment demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the system.

In order to understand the behavior of the robot during the motion on a generic trajectory, an open loop position controller has been implemented. In particular, the experimental robot trajectory has been reconstructed from odometric quantities through a simplified kinematic model. This trajectory has been compared with the trajectory obtained from a multibody model of the real prototype in order to evaluate the differences between the two approaches.

First, the optimal base placement is formulated as a constrained optimization problem based on manipulability and kinematics of the robot. Then, the constrained optimization problem is expressed into the expanded Lagrangian system and subsequently converted into a homotopy map. Finally, the Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the constrained optimization problem as a continuation problem. The complete formulation for the case of a 6-DOF manipulator is presented and a planar optimal mobile platform motion planning approach is proposed. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed approach is able to achieve the desired results. The approach also shows the potential for incorporating factors such as joint limits or collision avoidance into the motion planning process as inequality constraints and will be part of future research.

Arrays of polymer air-bridges form in seconds by simply hand brushing a bead of polymeric liquid over an array of micropillars. The domination of capillary force that is thinning unstable capillary bridges leads to uniform arrays of nanofiber air-bridges. Similarly, arrays of vertically oriented Ag2Ga nanoneedles have been formed by dipping silvercoated arrays of pyramidal silicon into melted gallium. Force-displacement measurements of these structures are presented. These nanostructures, especially when compressively or torsionally buckled, have extremely low stiffnesses, motion due to thermal fluctuations that is relatively easily detected, and the ability to move great distances for very small changes in applied force. Nanofibers with bead-on-a-string structure, where the beads are micron diameter and loaded with magnetic iron oxide (maghemite), are shown to be simply viewable under optical microscopes, have micronewton/ m stiffness, and have ultralow torsional stiffnesses enabling the bead to be rotated numerous revolutions without breaking. Combination of these high aspect ratio structures with stretched elastomers offer interesting possibilities for robotic actuation and locomotion. Polydimethylsiloxane loaded with nanomaterials, e.g. nanotubes, graphene or MoS2, can be efficiently heated with directed light. Heating produces considerable force through the thermoelastic effect, and this force can be used for continuous translation or to trigger reversible elastic buckling of the nanostructures. The remote stimulation of motion with light provides a possible mechanism for producing cooperative behavior between swarms of semiautonomous nanorobots. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Fast action recognition and action understanding abilities make humans adept at social interactions, and are fundamental requirements for future robots in order for them to interact with humans.

Human environments are highly cluttered and dynamic, making it difficult to foresee all necessary capabilities and pre-program all desirable future skills of the robot. One approach to increase robot performance is semi-autonomous operation, allowing users to intervene and guide the robot through difficult tasks. To this end, robots need intuitive Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) that support fine motion control without overwhelming the operator. In this study we evaluate the performance of several interfaces that balance autonomy and teleoperation of a mobile manipulator for accomplishing several household tasks. Our proposed HMI framework includes teleoperation devices such as a tablet, as well as physical interfaces in the form of piezoresistive pressure sensor arrays. Mobile manipulation experiments were performed with a sensorized KUKA youBot, an omnidirectional platform with a 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) arm. The pick and place tasks involved navigation and manipulation of objects in household environments. Performance metrics included time for task completion and position accuracy. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

With their strength and physical condition decreasing, they are also reluctant to walk outside. Even in sheltered accommodation or hospitals, they may have phases of loneliness when they are left alone or when the personnel cannot continuously take care of them. With an aging population and the financial difficulties of having a full time caregiver for every dependent person living at home, the proliferation of advanced assistant robots seems to be a viable future solution. However, as most of what can be done with a robot is also possible without it, it is sometimes difficult to quantify the real value this technology can add to the current situation. Hence we believe that such a robot should be a reliable assistant, capable of helping a person indoors as well as outdoors. Furthermore, it should be a companion for dialoging, as well as a system capable of detecting health problems. The Roberta Ironside project proposes to build such an advanced robot. That is, we want to build a cognitive coach that on the one hand fulfills the lack of social contact, and on the other hand may transform into a physical coach when going outside. In this paper we propose an affordable and simplified design for this human-sized humanoid. It starts with an overall description of the robot, followed by a justification for the choice of putting it into an electric wheel-chair. Next, it emphasizes the technology that is used for the head and the face, and then ends with a discussion of the verbal and non-verbal communication capabilities of the robot, highlighting its distinct characteristics as an Embodied Conversational Agent. © 2016, AMSE Press.

Studying plants of a given strain under multiple environments can greatly help to reveal their interactions. To collect the labor-intensive data required to perform experiments in this area, an indoor rover has been developed, which can accurately and autonomously move between and inside growth chambers. The system uses mecanum wheels, magnetic tape guidance, a Universal Robots UR 10 robot manipulator, and a Microsoft Kinect v2 3D sensor to position various sensors in this constrained environment. Integration of the motor controllers, robot arm, and a Microsoft Kinect (v2) 3D sensor was achieved in a customized C+ + program. Detecting and segmenting plants in a multi-plant environment is a challenging task, which can be aided by integration of depth data into these algorithms. Image-processing functions were implemented to filter the depth image to minimize noise and remove undesired surfaces, reducing the memory requirement and allowing the plant to be reconstructed at a higher resolution in real-time. Three-dimensional meshes representing plants inside the chamber were reconstructed using the Kinect SDKs KinectFusion. After transforming user-selected points in camera coordinates to robot-arm coordinates, the robot arm is used in conjunction with the rover to probe desired leaves, simulating the future use of sensors such as a fluorimeter and Raman spectrometer. This paper shows the system architecture and some preliminary results of the system, as tested using a life-sized growth chamber mock-up. A comparison of using raw camera coordinates data and using KinectFusion data is presented.

Combat simulations attempt to represent essential elements of warfare to support training, analysis, and testing. While combat simulations have rapidly incorporated representations of unmanned systems into their capabilities, little has been done to distinguish unmanned systems from human systems in these simulations. This is making it difficult to impossible to consider questions of future manned/unmanned system mix, levels of unmanned system autonomy required for most effective operational success, and other relevant questions. One might think that replacing humans with fully autonomous unmanned systems, such as in unmanned convoys, results in identical mission performance with the added benefit of a decrease in loss of human life. However, this is a naïve line of reasoning when one considers that unmanned systems cannot react to the battlespace environment with the same level of flexibility as humans. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to capture such distinctions in combat models.

As these systems becoming increasingly more robust, they support highly complex commands beyond direct teleoperation and waypoint finding facilitating a transition away from robots as tools to robots as teammates. Supporting future Soldier-Robot teaming requires communication capabilities on par with human-human teams for successful integration of robots. Therefore, as robots increase in functionality, it is equally important that the interface between the Soldier and robot advances as well. Multimodal communication (MMC) enables human-robot teaming through redundancy and levels of communications more robust than single mode interaction. Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies released in recent years for smart-phones and gaming provide tools for the creation of portable interfaces incorporating MMC through the use of speech, gestures, and visual displays. However, for multimodal interfaces to be successfully used in the military domain, they must be able to classify speech, gestures, and process natural language in real-time with high accuracy. For the present study, a prototype multimodal interface supporting real-time interactions with an autonomous robot was developed. This device integrated COTS Automated Speech Recognition (ASR), a custom gesture recognition glove, and natural language understanding on a tablet.

To understand how users make sense of the design characteristics of robots, we asked 6 participants to classify and interpret the appearance of existing robots in relation to their function and potential usefulness. All the robots had humanlike aspects in their design, and participants most commonly remarked on these humanlike features of the robots. However, the commonsense logic of the ""Uncanny Valley"" (UV) in HRI design, which suggests that robots should be similar to humans to some degree without being too humanlike, was not supported by participant comments, which did not correlate humanlikeness to user-friendliness in line with the UV hypothesis. Rather, participants related the design features of robots to their everyday contexts, and focused their commentary on context-dependent design implications. As a result, we suggest our understanding of the design characteristics of robots should include the perspectives of users from the earliest stages of design so we can understand their contextual interpretations of different design characteristics.

Mobile robots operating in such environments are typically required to assume climbing configurations to complete desired tasks. These tasks are usually considered planar in nature, however, in practice are generally non-planar. A common task seen on non-planar surfaces is the welding of ship hulls. This process consists of welding segments together and is normally completed by a skilled laborer due to the complexity of the surface. Through the advancement of kinematic modeling of mobile robots there exists the ability to develop future platforms with the potential to perform efficient operations on non-planar surfaces. While the majority of kinematic models presented for mobile robots assume operations on planar surfaces, a number of studies consider kinematic behavior on non-planar surfaces. These past works generally take one of two approaches: developing assumed modifications to the existing kinematic constraints as algebraic equations, or making use of a set of differential equations describing the instantaneous motion of the contact point between non-planar surfaces. The second approach is more general and shown to be applicable for both general and specific terrains. However, the previous works main focus is on differential-steer platforms with a passive castor. Conversely, Skid-Steer mobile robots, (SSMR), provide simple, robust platforms that have several features making them well suited to manufacturing tasks.

Moreover, external factors such as varying lifecycles and shifting boundary conditions due to the demographic change intensify the severity on determining a suitable level of automation and changeability. Within this context, human-robot-cooperation offers a promising solution in order to cope with future demands towards flexible production systems. While most assembly design methods focus on interrelations between functionality and performance, the dependency of a varying economical feasibility due to an increased changeability potential within human-robot-cooperation is not considered so far and furthermore cannot be represented using conventional methodologies. Hence, the consistent comparability between system alternatives with variable degrees of automation is aggravated, representing the primary problem.

As reported in the literature, surgeons have been opting for minimally invasive surgery, as it reduces patient complications, overall patient recovery time, and hospital time for the patient. Robotic manipulators can be used to overcome natural limitations related to vision and human dexterity, and allow surgeons to transcend these limitations without having to sacrifice improvement in patient outcome. A desirable attribute of surgical robots is maneuverability similar to the human arm. The KUKA DLR Lightweight Robot Arm (LWR), with seven degrees of freedom, retains many of these human-like dexterity traits. Due to the KUKA robot arms maneuverability and flexibility, it is well-suited for intricate tasks based upon motion analyses and modeling of the compliance to path trajectory in addition to the overall smoothness of the path. This robot may be further programmed to be effective and precise for surgical applications. In the studies reported here, a unique Rapidly exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) based path-planning algorithm is developed and this algorithm is used to generate path plans between an initial state and a goal state for simulated models of robotic manipulator arms. Along with constraints, the RRT algorithm has been implemented to find paths for the chosen kinematic or dynamic robotic manipulator arm. Similar techniques are to be used to analyze the KUKA LWR IV+ system. Motion analyses have been carried out with consideration Address all correspondence to this author. of motion trajectories and all possible locations of the end effector with unique constraints applied to the system. In these simulations, the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters were recorded, with special attention to movement restrictions. The results of the RRT paths generation, analysis of the manipulator arm trajectories, and simulations allow one to better determine the location of the end-effector at any given point in time and location. From this foundation, the generation of path-planning restrictions for the KUKA robots path programming is expected to take into account surgically restricted dangerous or undesirable zones. In future work, the trajectories of the KUKA robot and other manipulator arms are to be compared with the data available in the literature. This work holds promising implications for the improved use of such robot systems in surgical applications. For example, precise pre-programmed robotic movements are expected to be particularly helpful for surgeries in tight, anatomically restricted sites, with adjacent delicate tissues. Ultimately, it is expected that this type of novel robotic application will greatly aid surgeons in improving the precision and safety of surgical procedures, by reducing potential complications and minimizing potential nicks and tears, and working towards giving the surgeons the same ease that they have with traditional surgery.

When in motion, the Moballs are able to keep their center of mass in the geometric center of the Moball to facilitate movement; alternatively, they can lower their center of mass, against the slope or wind, or move it to the side, to stop, or control their speed and trajectory. The Moballs could form a communication wireless mesh network among themselves and base-stations (e.g. human settlement sites, the orbiter, or the Earth) to provide collaborative and optimized exploration, environmental monitoring, navigation, positioning, computation, and relaying communication for future human exploration and settlement missions. Using their robotic arms and science instruments, they can also assist future human missions as solo robots to perform various repair or science tasks in harsh or risky environments and/or situations which would endanger the space personnel. Mars/Moon Net, as described above, is an unprecedented, cost-effective and multifunctioning space system that could ensure the success and safety of future human exploration missions to Mars or the Moon by providing the above capabilities in addition to scouting and finding safe area for future settlements (e.g. underground lava tubes or covered craters which could protect the space crew from harmful radiations, meteorites, dust and sand storms, and large diurnal temperature swings), search and rescue, sample search and retrieval, water reservoir and harmful radiation mapping, safe landing assistance and landing site identification. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This paper also proposes a teaching training method for improving the training performance of LLR-Ro. When a physician trains the lower limb of a patient, the acceleration data of the patient's lower limb motion will be collected through a wireless data acquisition system. The data can reproduce the movement trajectory of the physician rehabilitation training and this can be used as the training trajectory of LLR-Ro.

The route to high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) involves various detector upgrades and requires significant infrastructure changes. Recent measurements by CERN Radiation Protection, verifying previous calculations by The University of Sheffield (UoS), has raised awareness about future restrictions of human activity in HL-LHC experimental construction and maintenance areas avoiding exposure from dangerously high levels of radiation.

It is also important for resource management, increasingly demanding in terms of reducing costs and environmental polluting agents as well as increasing productivity. Additional problems arise when this task involves irregular agricultural terrains where the crop follows non-uniform configurations and extends over steep rocky slopes. For mountain vineyards, finding the optimal path to cover a restricted set of terraces, some of them with dead ends and with other constraints due to terrain morphology, is a great challenge. The problem involves other variables to be taken into account such as speed, direction and orientation of the vehicle, fuel consumption and tank capacities for chemical products. This article presents a decision graph-based approach, to solve a Rural Postman Coverage like problem using A* and Dijkstra algorithms simultaneously to find the optimal sequence of terraces that defines a selected partial coverage area of the vineyard. The decision structure is supported by a graph that contains all the information of the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the vineyard. In this first approach, optimality considers distance, cost and time requirements. The optimal solution was represented in a graphical user OpenGL application developed to support the path planning process. Based on the results, it was possible to prove the applicability of this approach for any vineyards which extend like routes. Near optimal solutions based on other specific criteria could also be considered for future work. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Coverage path planning; Mountain vineyards; Path planning","Agriculture; Application programming interfaces (API); Fuel tanks; Graphic methods; Landforms; Navigation systems; Optimal systems; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Temperature control; Agricultural fields; Autonomous navigation systems; Coverage path planning; Digital terrain model; Mountain vineyards; Near-optimal solutions; Planning applications; Resource management; Motion planning",2-s2.0-84951737615

If the mismatch is large, the system will further process the sensor signal to compute a corrective action through feedback.

Robots can be broadly classified into two types namely; fixed robot and mobile robot. Mobile robot may prove a breakthrough and is a future of robots. But there are some challenges in mobility of mobile robots such as ad-hoc networks, path finding, navigation etc. Path navigation is an important factor for mobile robots. A precise navigation technique is necessary so that a robot can reach at destination point exactly. Many navigation techniques are have been developed that require vision system, number of sensor nodes etc. This paper presents a novel navigation technique for robots, in which the robot navigates its path using received signal strength that is available from a transmitterlocated at a distant destination point. As the signal strength decreases with increasing distance, hence this concept can be used as an efficient technique for robot to find shortest path automatically. The architecture involves two antennas mounted on the robot and these antennas received signal from the destination point. On the basis of received signal strength the robot navigates its path. The accuracy of this navigation technique is very high because the robots find its path using received signal strength.

Further, first response teams, particularly those responding to complex events, such as Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive device incidents will incorporate robots into their future teams to assist human team members and collect additional information. The deployment of such robots will require a human team member to supervise and task the various robots associated with the team. As the complexity of an incident increases and the number of responders with different specialties increases, for example Police, Emergency Medical Services, and Hazardous Materials, it will be harder to track the robots associated with a particular team, especially by the human team member responsible for the robots. A new algorithm, the Robot Visualization Algorithm, was developed to improve the saliency of robots for which the human team operator (e.g., Emergency Medical Services) is responsible, while generally minimizing the saliency of the robots from other teams (e.g., Police and Hazardous Materials) that are not relevant to the team operator. The presented Robot Visualization Algorithm makes the other teams' robots more salient if their activities will impact the operator's team.

Our work focuses on bridging this gap, and we propose a framework for freeway ramp metering in a probabilistic setting. Our algorithm finds onramp flows in a freeway network while treating exogenous vehicular arrivals as random variables with known distributions, allowing for the network arrivals to conform with their stochastic nature. We use sampling techniques in a model predictive control setup to formulate a tractable approximation of our stochastic optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to relax the non-linear constraints of our optimization to create a linear program with an augmented set of constraints. We prove that the solution of our linear program formulation is the same as the solution of the original mixed-integer formulation.

Methods: The existing A-star algorithm is modified to make the robot to move in an unknown scenario in which static obstacles are located. The robot is expected to travel to the goal position without colliding with any of the obstacles present. The Enhanced A* algorithm guides the robot to reach the target following an optimal path. By adding a new parameter namely number of turnings (p(n)) the robot makes during its traverse, currently existing A* algorithm is improved. This is done in order to improve the algorithm for optimal motion of the robot. Findings: The proposed Enhanced A* algorithm will be shown to remove certain drawbacks, which are found in the currently existing algorithms, for optimal travel of the robot. Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the performances of the proposed Enhanced A* algorithm and the original A* algorithm. The outcome of the simulation experiments is expected to provide better performance as compared to the A* algorithm concerning Elapsed time of travel.It is expected that the Enhanced A* algorithm is able to provide an effective contrivance for exploring path planning in robotics education and path control of robot.

Design/methodology/approach: A close review of the literature provides a comprehensive list of web robot detection techniques. Reviews of system documentation and open source code are carried out along with personal interviews to provide a comparison of the robot detection techniques used in the major IR platforms. An empirical test based on a simple random sample of downloads with 96.20 per cent certainty is undertaken to measure the accuracy of an IR’s web robot detection at a large Irish University. Findings: While web robot detection is not ignored in IRs, there are areas where the two main systems could be improved. The technique tested here is found to have successfully detected 94.18 per cent of web robots visiting the site over a two-year period (recall), with a precision of 98.92 per cent. Due to the high level of robot activity in repositories, correctly labelling more robots has an exponential effect on the accuracy of usage statistics. Research limitations/implications: This study is performed on one repository using a single system. Future studies across multiple sites and platforms are needed to determine the accuracy of web robot detection in OA repositories generally. Originality/value: This is the only study to date to have investigated web robot detection in IRs. It puts forward the first empirical benchmarking of accuracy in IR usage statistics. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Detection; Downloads; Institutional repositories; Open access; Usage statistics; Web robots",,2-s2.0-84987811332

The development of Space technology put forward higher requirements on the performance of the space robot, the dual-arm space robot has movement stability and load ability, will become an important tool in the future space missions. Space station remote manipulator system and its end effector-SPDM put into use, which means that dual arm space robot has been used in the space. Dual-arm system is similar to the upper limbs of primate, which is more advantageous to carry objects, ensure the control accuracy. In the process of space robot to complete various missions, actuators is inevitably impacted by target. Space robot itself is in a state of weightlessness in space, which may lead to large angle rotation is dangerous for the space facilities. For space robot arms grab task, coupling motion relations are between arms and base, make its control design scheme is become more difficult than ground robot. In addition, the existences of dual-arm space robot with closed chain constraint and controller redundancy add the difficulty of control design. In this paper, the impact effect analysis for a dual-arm space robot capturing a satellite and the coordinated stabilization control problem for closed chain system are discussed. At first, the dynamic equations of dual-arm space robot and satellite are obtained by multi-body theory. The response of the dual-arm space robot impacted by the target is analyzed by momentum conservation law; the dynamic evolution process is derived at the same time. Secondly, the recurrent fuzzy neural network control scheme is designed for unstable closed chain system with uncertain system parameter. In order to overcome the effects caused by system parameter perturbation and external disturbance, the recurrent fuzzy neural network is used to approximate the unknown part with H∞ tracking characteristic. Meanwhile, the weighted minimum-norm theory is introduced to distribute torques guarantee that cooperative operation between manipulators. At last, numerical examples simulate the process of collision and the efficiency of the control scheme is verified by the simulation results.

Such fields include pipeline construction, green energy development, infrastructure and shipbuilding. To operate in these environments, the mobile robotic platform must provide controlled motion of a manufacturing toolset over the surface of a structure which is generally non-planar. One such example is welding a seam along a non-flat ship hull where the surface may consist of sections resembling common geometric shapes such as cylinders or spheres and the tool must follow a path defined by the weld seam. This paper will present a kinematic control approach applicable to one mobile robot topology performing a task on a cylindrical surface. This method is readily generalized to other robot topologies or surface geometries. The method is based on a kinematic model that predicts the robot motion and configuration joint parameters while on a nonplanar surface with the desired motion prescribed in local tool space. The effort is motivated by a practical application of welding on steel hulls or other surfaces and the results will be compared with these empirical experiences. A discussion of how these results can be used to guide future design of mobile robot platforms for manufacturing is provided. © 2016, Industrial Research Institute for Automation and Measurements.

Sensorimotor stimulation exercises, particularly the Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) and robot-aided therapy are promising in children. However, exhaustive data about their effectiveness in the clinical practice and differences of these treatments still lack in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform a preliminary comparative evaluation among CIMT, robot-aided therapy with Armeo®Spring and conventional physiokinesitherapy about their efficacy in upper limb rehabilitation of children after ABI. A group of 10 children was treated with two of the three abovementioned therapies, randomly chosen in the order. The evaluation included clinical and functional scales as well as 3D kinematics to objectively measure the outcome. Our results showed improvements at the elbow and shoulder after CIMT and ARMEO, whereas physiokinesitherapy frequently showed changes in the opposite direction. Further, many improvements in terms of trunk rotation and joints selectivity were conveyed by the robot-aided therapy.

The convention, since the development of modern civilisation, is to discard a broken item and then procure a new one. In the 20th century enlightened environmentalists campaigned for recycling and reuse (R and R). R and R has continued to be an important part of new technology development, but there is still a huge problem of non-recyclable materials being dumped into landfill and being discarded in the environment. The challenge is even greater for robotics, a field which will impact on all aspects of our lives, where discards include motors, rigid elements and toxic power supplies and batteries. One novel solution is the biodegradable robot, an active physical machine that is composed of biodegradable materials and which degrades to nothing when released into the environment. In this paper we examine the potential and realities of biodegradable robotics, consider novel solutions to core components such as sensors, actuators and energy scavenging, and give examples of biodegradable robotics fabricated from everyday, and not so common, biodegradable electroactive materials. The realisation of truly biodegradable robots also brings entirely new deployment, exploration and bio-remediation capabilities: why track and recover a few large non-biodegradable robots when you could speculatively release millions of biodegradable robots instead? We will consider some of these exciting developments and explore the future of this new field. © 2016 SPIE.","Bio-remediation; Biodegradable electroactive polymers; Biodegradable robotics; Soft robotics","Actuators; Conducting polymers; Electroactive polymer actuators; Energy harvesting; Organic polymers; Polymers; Robotics; Robots; Bio remediations; Biodegra-dable materials; Electro-active polymers; Electroactive material; Modern technologies; New technology development; Recyclable material; Soft robotics; Biodegradable polymers",2-s2.0-84989236022

In this approach, the motion pattern of the obstacle is analysed by taking into account the past co-ordinates traversed by the obstacle. Then the futuristic region where the obstacle is likely to occupy is predicted. This region is termed as region of certainty.

Extended absence from the classroom has negative and overlapping educational and social consequences as students may fall behind in instruction, feel isolated from their peers, and experience loneliness and depression. School districts sometimes provide individual tutors who make occasional home visits but such tutoring cannot substitute for regular participation in the classroom environment. Telepresence robots may provide a way for students to remain connected to their schools, classmates, teachers, and maintain or develop critical social relationships via virtual inclusion. A total of sixty-one participants were included in this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five homebound children, five parents, ten teachers, thirty-five classmates, and six school/district administrators. While the robots were deployed, one home observation, two classroom observations and two focus group sessions were conducted. This study is a small-scale exploratory case study that examined the use of robots to attend school and how schools integrated homebound students via robots into traditional classrooms. Three themes emerged from the coding and analysis of the data: 1) anthropomorphism for social acceptance and normalcy, 2) overcoming isolation to meet socio-emotional needs, and 3) new experiences that generated talk of an academic future. © Common Ground Publishing, Veronica A.

Affective haptics is an emerging field, which focuses on the analysis, design, and evaluation of systems that can capture, process, or display emotions through the sense of touch. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the recent achievements in affective haptics and to discuss how the sense of touch can elicit or influence human emotions. We first introduce a definition to the term affective haptics and describe its multidisciplinary nature - as a field that integrates ideas from affective computing, haptic technology, and user experience. Second, we provide a thorough discussion about the effectiveness of using the haptic channel to communicate affective information through direct and mediated means. Third, we present a variety of applications in the area ranging from interhuman social interaction systems to human robot interaction applications. Finally, we discuss some of the key findings discerned from the various surveyed papers, and present some of the challenges and trends in this field. We extract the following conclusions pertaining to affective haptics: 1) haptic stimulation can be successfully used to achieve a higher level of emotional immersion during media consumption or emotional telepresence; 2) existing research has demonstrated that haptics is effective in communicating valence and arousal, and the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger and fear, and less focus have been given to the communication of disgust and surprise; 3) the haptic-based affect detection remains an understudied topic, whereas the haptic-based affect display is a well-established subject; and 4) the interpretation of the haptic stimulation by human beings is highly contextual. © 2013 IEEE.","Affective computing; Haptic interfaces; Human computer interaction; social computing; tactile sensors","Data mining; Haptic interfaces; Human robot interaction; Robots; Visual communication; Well stimulation; Affect detection; Affective Computing; Haptic technology; Inter-personal communications; Media consumption; Social computing; Social interactions; Tactile sensors; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-84979830771

With time easy resources of the fossil fuels are shrinking and newly searched reservoirs, to feed supply demands of global consumption, are mostly located in extreme environmental conditions such as hot deserts, deep water and arctic zone etc. Production of the fossil fuels, in such inhospitable environmental conditions, poses difficult challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE). Tragic incidents like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills are examples of such challenges. Therefore, oil and gas industry has lot to learn from successful implementation of robotics and automation for dull, dirty and dangerous (3D) tasks of manufacturing industry. Most of the robotics technologies, currently used in the oil and gas industry, are mainly focused on inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) of plant facilities with higher frequency and accuracy. Fundamental idea, involved in the automatization of these processes, is based on the principle of teleoperation with skilled operator. Automation of 3D tasks not only improves HSE standards but also lead to much needed economic efficiency by reducing production cycle, floor space and number of staff members required for continuous inspection and manipulation of plant facilities. Considering the risks involved in this industry usage of completely autonomous robots, first without achieving very high reliability, is still a far fetch choice. Therefore, semi-autonomous robots, where actions are performed by robots but cognitive decisions are still taken by skilled operator, is an excellent choice for this industry as a near future solution. In the onshore oil and gas industry robotic solutions are used both in upstream and downstream processes, such as site survey, drilling, production and transportation, mainly focused in the form of in-pipe inspection robots (IPIRs), tank inspection robots (TIRs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) etc. This paper presents the state of art robotic solutions currently used in onshore oil and gas facilities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Automation; In-pipe inspection robots; NDT; Oil and gas exploration; Robotics; Tank inspection robots; UAV; Wireless sensor networks (WSN)","Accident prevention; Arctic vehicles; Arid regions; Automation; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas industry; Gases; Industrial robots; Inspection; Nondestructive examination; Offshore gas fields; Oil spills; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum transportation; Repair; Rivers; Robots; Tanks (containers); Traffic surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wireless sensor networks; Health , safety and environments; In-pipe inspection robot; Inspection , maintenance and repairs; Inspection robots; Oil and gas exploration; Onshore oil and gas facilities; Production and transportations; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Robotics",2-s2.0-84994558664

We aimed to investigate whether if children with ASD will illustrate more irrational beliefs and therefore more dysfunctional emotions and maladaptive behaviors compared to TD children. In order to test our hypothesis we have used a robot-based task since previous studies have shown that children with ASD could benefit of the presence of a social robot in the task. 81 participants were included in this study, 40 TD children (M =5.4, SD = 0.4) and 41 children with ASD (M =8.4, SD = 2.2). In order to measure our outcomes we have used a mood induction task: false feedback technique. In children with ASD group we have identified significantly more irrational beliefs expressed during experimental task compared to TD children. 41.5% of children with ASD have presented dysfunctional emotions during the robot-assisted task compared to TD children who expressed only functional negative emotions. TD children exhibited significantly more adaptive behaviors compared with children with ASD, who 39% of them engaged in maladaptive behaviors. This study provides important information on irrational beliefs and their association with dysfunctional emotions and maladaptive beliefs adopted by children with ASD in comparison to TD children.

The main motivation for this research is to study the impact of BIM in bridging the gap between design and construction. Considering the growing interest in applying additive manufacturing technology for future building construction, this paper proposes a computer-aided system that translates a generic architectural project in a set of pieces to be fabricated with 3D printers. The system uses a proposed set of algorithms to process the architectural project: it considers the division of the building in different parts or pieces to be fabricated, based on the work volume of the printer; it also considers the relative position of the part in the bed of the printer, for best results in production; minimum dimension of features to achieve mechanical resistance; and geometric features that would demand support material.

This paper presents a novel lunar mission design to demonstrate enabling technologies for deep-space exploration, in accordance with the Global Exploration Roadmap and the National Research Council. This mission, named ALCIDES, takes advantage of some of the systems that are currently under development as a part of the HERACLES exploration architecture: these include the Orion module, the Space Exploration Vehicle, the Boeing Reusable Lander, the Ariane 6, the Falcon Heavy, the Space Launch System, as well as the Evolvable Deep-Space Habitat placed in EML2. A consistent part of the efforts in designing the ALCIDES mission accounts for innovative exploration scenarios: by analyzing state of the art in robotics and planetary exploration, we introduce a mission architecture in which robots and humans collaborate to achieve several tasks, both autonomously and through cooperation. During this mission, high-performance mobility, extravehicular activity and habitation capabilities would be carried out and implemented. This project aims to demonstrate the human capability to live and work in the lunar environment through the development of a long-term platform. We selected the Amundsen-Ganswindt basin as the landing site for multiple reasons: the possible presence of permanently shadowed regions, its position within the South Pole and its proximity to the Schrödinger basin. The main objectives of the ALCIDES mission are to study the lunar cold trap volatiles, to gain understanding of the lunar highlands geology through sampling and in-situ measurements and to study Human-Robotic interactions. In addition, factors such as psychology, legal issues and outreach regarding this mission were also considered. In particular, four traverses connecting the Amundsen crater with the Schrödinger basin were proposed, three of which to be performed by a teleoperated rover, and the remaining one to be carried out by a human crew with rover assistance. During these traverses, the rover will collect samples from several points of interest as well as perform in-situ measurements with a suite of instruments on board, helping to locate a convenient place for future human habitation. The ALCIDES mission results will help the scientific community to better understand the Moon and to take advantage of its resources for future space exploration. Gaining this knowledge will allow us to move forward in the development of systems and capabilities for manned missions to Mars and beyond.

However, their wide usage has also been criticized as not giving good representation of how real, autonomous robots can interact. In this paper, I argue that thoughtfully designed Wizard-of-Oz control interfaces can enable robot designers to explore the interaction design space fur human robot interaction and also move them towards autonomous robot development. I provide two case studies of WoZ controlled robots and their interfaces and describe the design rationale behind them. I then provide an initial set of design considerations for future WoZ controllers as a way to improve how WoZ interactions can inform the design of autonomous behavior and move closer to fully autonomous robots.

A great deal of success has been demonstrated by low degree of freedom platforms that rely on either pure torsion or thrusting to provide the requisite locomotive power. However, means of synergizing these approaches and the potential benefits thereof are not well understood. In this study, the effects of torsional and prismatic energy addition on running performance are investigated, both in isolation and as a hybrid approach. By allowing both mechanisms to be used in tandem, improvements to speed, stability and efficiency are noted. Additionally, these results suggest that rather than utilizing prismatic and torsional actuation to provide an even distribution of power, inhomogenous power generation may lead to futher performance benefits. This study not only examines the degree of actuator hybridization that leads to improved running, but also identifies the fundamental mechanisms by which these two approaches affect performance. These insights, in turn, provide physical intuition for the design of future legged platforms of more complex morphologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Robotics; Robots; Complex morphology; Energy addition; Fundamental mechanisms; Hybrid approach; Locomotive power; Performance benefits; Potential benefits; Torsional actuation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics)",2-s2.0-84948152170

This situation creates both a need and an opportunity to deploy technologies such as rehabilitation robotics, and in the last decade and half, several research groups have deployed variations of this technology. Results so far are mixed with the available evidence demonstrating unequivocally that some forms of robotic therapy can be highly effective, even for patients many years post-stroke, while other forms of robotic therapy have been singularly ineffective. The contrast is starkest when we contrast upper-extremity and lower-extremity therapy. In fact, 2010 Stroke Care Guidelines of the American Heart Association (AHA) and of the Veterans Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) endorsed the use of the rehabilitation robotics for upper-extremity post- stroke care, but concluded that lower-extremity robotic therapy is much less effective as compared to usual care practices in the USA and declared “still in its infancy."" We submit that the contrasting effectiveness of upper- and lower-extremity therapies arises from neural factors, not technological factors. Though, no doubt, it might be improved, the technology deployed to date for locomotor therapy is elegant and sophisticated. Unfortunately, it may be misguided, providing highly repeatable control of rhythmic movement but ultimately doing the wrong thing. The technology we have deployed to date for upper-extremity therapy is firmly based on an understanding of how upper-extremity behavior is neurally controlled and derived from decades of neuroscience research. The limitations of lower-extremity robotic therapy lie not in the robotic technology but in its incompatibility with human motor neuroscience. In this chapter we briefly review the evidence supporting such negative views, and based on our experience with upper-extremity robotic therapy, we describe what we are presently investigating to revert and work toward a future endorsement of the AHA and VA/DoD for rehabilitation robotics for lower-extremity post-stroke care. © Springer International Publishing 2016.","Anklebot; Cerebral palsy; Lower extremity; MIT-skywalker; Rehabilitation robotics; Robot-assisted therapy; Robotic therapy; Stroke",,2-s2.0-85017089312

Studying plants of a given strain under multiple environments can greatly help to reveal their interactions. To collect the labor-intensive data required to perform experiments in this area, a Mecanum-wheeled, magnetic-tape-following indoor rover has been developed to accurately and autonomously move between and inside growth chambers. Integration of the motor controllers, a robot arm, and a Microsoft Kinect (v2) 3D sensor was achieved in a customized C++ program. Detecting and segmenting plants in a multi-plant environment is a challenging task, which can be aided by integration of depth data into these algorithms. Image-processing functions were implemented to filter the depth image to minimize noise and remove undesired surfaces, reducing the memory requirement and allowing the plant to be reconstructed at a higher resolution in real-time. Three-dimensional meshes representing plants inside the chamber were reconstructed using the Kinect SDK's KinectFusion. After transforming user-selected points in camera coordinates to robot-arm coordinates, the robot arm is used in conjunction with the rover to probe desired leaves, simulating the future use of sensors such as a fluorimeter and Raman spectrometer.

Several research works are related with human-robot interaction and with cooperation between robots. Other studies aim to bring them capabilities of self-organization which allow them quick and appropriated autonomous answers to quite simple events. That endows the swarm of robots with interesting capabilities of resilience and adaptation. But these objectives will be limited especially when the individual and collective robot abilities will be insufficient to cope with complex demands of the environment. The only solution is therefore to ask the human help. Nevertheless the behavior of a self-organized swarm of robots is difficult to predict by the human, due to his/her difficulty to build and especially to update on line a precise representation of the situation. A first way to cope with this problem is to analyze the robots’ tasks according to several levels of activity: a strategic level in which the global objectives are decided and the whole planned mission, the tactical level for applying and updating the mission regarding new events or new objectives and the operational level for implementing decisions.

Postoperative evaluation criteria was made with the Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI), Chung score and a patient satisfaction survey. Results: No perioperative or postoperative complications were reported. Blood loss was low (75 mL). The patient stayed less than 12 hours in the ambulatory unit thanks to a rapid recovery. The patient returned home after reporting a Chung score of 10. No hospital readmission was necessary. Functional results were: a bowel movement on day 1, back to work on day 2, normal urinary continence on day 8, a correct erectile function on day 9. Oncological results revealed negative surgical margins for cancer and PSA postoperative < 0.03 ng/mL. Conclusion: Ambulatory robotic radical prostatectomies can be performed on voluntarily-selected patients without affecting the high quality of urological surgery outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Ambulatory; Outpatient; Prostate cancer; Radical prostatectomy; Robot-assisted","prostate specific antigen; tumor marker; ambulatory surgery; blood; case report; human; male; middle aged; patient satisfaction; procedures; prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; robotic surgical procedure; treatment outcome; trends; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Biomarkers, Tumor; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84961393368

Here, we describe our work to develop microsurgical robotic systems and apply engineering technology to assess microsurgical skills. With the collaboration of neurosurgeons and an engineering team, we have developed two types of microsurgical robotic systems. The first, the deep surgical systems, enable delicate surgical procedures such as vessel suturing in a deep and narrow space. The second type allows for super-fine surgical procedures such as anastomosing artificial vessels of 0.3 mm in diameter. Both systems are constructed with master and slave manipulator robots connected to local area networks. Robotic systems allowed for secure and accurate procedures in a deep surgical field. In cadaveric models, these systems showed a good potential of being useful in actual human surgeries, but mechanical refinements in thickness and durability are necessary for them to be established as clinical systems. The super-fine robotic system made the very intricate surgery possible and will be applied in clinical trials. Another trial included the digitization of surgical technique and scientific analysis of surgical skills. Robotic and human hand motions were analyzed in numerical fashion as we tried to define surgical skillfulness in a digital format. Engineered skill assessment is also feasible and should be useful for microsurgical training. Robotics and medical engineering should bring science into the surgical field and training of surgeons. Active collaboration between medical and engineering teams and academic and industry groups is mandatory to establish such medical systems to improve patient care. © 2016, Japan Neurosurgical Society.

The proposed system generates a dance for a humanoid robot through the combination of basic movements synchronized with the music. The system made up of three parts: the extraction of features from audio file, estimation of movements through the Hidden Markov Models and, finally, the generation of dance. Starting from a set of given movements, the robot choices sequence of movements a suitable Hidden Markov Model, and synchronize them processing musical input. The proposed approach has the advantage that movement execution probabilities could be changed according evaluation of the dance execution in order to have an artificial creative system. In the same way, a choreographer could give more importance to some movements and/or exclude others, using the system as a co-creation tool. The approach has been tested on Aldebaran NAO humanoid using different genres of music, and experimentations was conduct at presence of real human dancers to have feedback of the goodness of the robot execution. Three professional judges expressed their evaluations about the following points: appropriateness of movements for a given musical genre; the precision to track the rhythm; the aesthetic impact of the whole sequence of movements; and the overall judgment of the robot performance. All the evaluations are very satisfying, and confirm that robot dance is realistic and aesthetically acceptable.

Here, we provide a review of the theory underlying HAL treatment as well as our clinical experience and recommendations for future clinical studies using HAL in acute stroke patients. We performed a PubMedbased literature search, a retrospective data review of our acute stroke case series, and included a sample case report of our findings. Given past animal studies and functional imaging results, iBF therapy using the HAL in the acute phase of stroke seems an appropriate approach for preventing learned non-use and interhemispheric excitation imbalances. iBF therapy may furthermore promote appropriate neuronal network reorganization. Based on experiences in our stroke center, HAL rehabilitation is a safe and effective treatment modality for recovering motor impairments after acute stroke, and allows the design of tailored rehabilitation programs for individual patients. iBF therapy through the HAL system seems to be an effective and promising approach to stroke rehabilitation; however, the superiority of this treatment to conventional rehabilitation remains unclear. Further clinical studies are warranted. Additionally, the formation of a patient registry will permit a meta-analysis of HAL cases and address the problems associated with a controlled trial (e.g., the heterogeneity of an acute stroke cohort). The development of robotic engineering will improve the efficacy of HAL rehabilitation and has the potential to standardize patient rehabilitation practice. © 2016, Japan Neurosurgical Society.

The motivational system provides the motivation that guides the robot operation according to its knowledge of its sensorial space so that rewards are maximized during its lifetime. In order to do this, a motivational engine progressively and interactively creates an internal model of expected future reward (value function) for areas of the robot’s state space, through a neuroevolutionary process, over samples obtained in the sensorial (state space) traces followed by the robot whenever it obtained a reward. To improve this modelling process, a strategy is proposed to decompose the global value function leading to the reward or goal into several more local ones, thus discovering sub-goals that simplify the whole learning process and that can be reused in the future.

However, it is still an open problem that how we can integrate the lower level motor control and a higher level symbol manipulation system. One of our research goals is to make a computational model of human intelligence from the motor control to the higher level symbol manipulation. To this end, we propose a robot motor control learning as the first step in this paper. The method is based on HMMs (Hidden Markov Models). The robot moves its arm randomly by changing torques of joint angles and obtains the pose of its arm. The HMM uses state space for representing the relationship between joint torques and pose of the arm by segmenting the obtained sensory-motor information autonomously. The robot can gradually learn to move its arm to a specific position by planning the torque sequence using the learned model. Moreover, we also discuss a future plan for the ultimate goal. We are planning to probabilistically integrate the proposed motor control HMM and the language acquisition model, which has already been proposed by the authors.

Current shared autonomy frameworks primarily take direct user input, for example through a joystick, that directly controls the robot's actions. However, indirect input, such as eye gaze, can be a useful source of information for revealing user intentions and future actions. For example, when people perform manipulation tasks, their gaze centers on the objects of interest before the corresponding movements even begin. This implicit information contained in eye gaze can be used to improve the goal prediction of a shared autonomy system, improving its overall assistive capability. In this paper, we describe how eye gaze behavior can be incorporated into shared autonomy. Building on previous work that represents user goals as latent states in a POMDP, we describe how gaze behavior can be used as observations to update the POMDP's probability distributions over goal states, solving for the optimal action using hindsight optimization.

One class of mobile robots, known as Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV), follow a fixed path along the floor using tracks, RFID tags, or magnetic tape. These robots typically travel along predetermined routes and offer limited flexibility for changes to be made or for their use in environments like hospitals or military installations. Moving away from traditional fixed AGV systems to wireless and dynamic control and monitoring presents some distinct advantages and new opportunities. This type of robot is known as an Autonomous AGV. A prototype smart materials warehouse is presented in this paper as a platform to explore some particular aspects of this technology. First, four multi-purpose mobile robots were built using off-the-shelf BattleBot kits, wireless Arduino controls, and fabricated components. Secondly, a Microsoft Kinect camera was installed on one robot for visual feedback, obstacle avoidance, and shape recognition. Lastly, a ceiling mounted IP camera was used with software developed using Visual Studio NET and the C# wrapper for OpenCV (EmguCV) to facilitate robot path development, video processing and real-time tracking.

The study and results pertain to robotic systems operating in extreme environments, such as in lunar or Martian conditions, where there is a need for autonomous construction of regolith structures for infrastructure or human habitat protection. The purposes of this study were to: i) advance and document the practical knowledge of multior swarm robot systems in the field; ii) ascertain the feasibility of additive construction with many-simple rather than few-complex robots; and iii) explore individual behavioural rules for the robots which, although are indirectly controlled in themselves, can result in a controlled outcome. Behaviour is understood as the interactions between an individual and its environment where the behaviour of the individual affects its own perceptions, and thus its future actions and perceptions. Applying this concept to robots results in a field of autonomous behavioural machines capable of operating in partially unknown and changing environments without human intervention. In the paper we describe the design and mechanical operation of the multi-robot system, the local positioning and communication system, ending with a discussion of the programmed behaviours and the final built outcomes. The results of this workshop will be used to inform the next stage of the technology demonstration in which the whole process will be scaled up.

Further, the disparity between accuracy specifications, communication technologies and control methods required for such operations calls for greater efforts in robot programming and control. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically program an industrial robot-based on the CAD model of the product variants and to enable online control to minimize errors during a deburring process. The paper starts with the modeling of the product, process and resource (PPR model) which is used to generate robot motion trajectories taking into account the constraints and the free degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the robotic deburring process. The operator selects the edge of the workpiece to be machined, and an automatic program generation system is designed which programs the robot for the deburring process and enables online compensation. A laser scanner sensor device is used for localizing the workpiece in the robot cell and in the online compensation to perform fine corrections of the robot's movement during the process. Experimental results are used to validate the robotic program generation and control mechanism for a deburring process, and to outline the future potential of this work. © 2016 VDE VERLAG GMBH Berlin Offenbach.",,"Automatic programming; Computer aided design; Deburring; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Robot programming; Robots; Automatic programs; Communication technologies; Control mechanism; Degrees of freedom (DoFs); Industrial scenarios; Online compensation; Product variants; Program generation; Robotics",2-s2.0-84983783236

Harvesting robots in cultivars with dense vegetation require multiple viewpoints and on-line trajectory adjustments in order to reduce the amount of false negatives and correct for fruit movement. In contrast to specialised software, the framework proposed aims to support a wide variety of agricultural use cases, hardware and extensions. A set of Robotic Operating System (ROS) nodes was created to ensure modularity and separation of concerns, implementing functionalities for application control, robot motion control, image acquisition, fruit detection, visual servo control and simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) for monocular relative depth estimation and scene reconstruction. Coordination functionality was implemented by the application control node with a finite state machine. In order to provide visual servo control and simultaneous localisation and mapping functionalities, off-the-shelf libraries Visual Servoing Platform library (ViSP) and Large Scale Direct SLAM (LSD-SLAM) were wrapped in ROS nodes. The capabilities of the framework are demonstrated by an example implementation for use with a sweet-pepper crop, combined with hardware consisting of a Baxter robot and a colour camera placed on its end-effector. Qualitative tests were performed under laboratory conditions using an artificial dense vegetation sweet-pepper crop. Results indicated the framework can be implemented for sensing and robot motion control in sweet-pepper using visual information from the end-effector.

Up to the authors knowledge, this approach has not been presented in the context of laser surgery at 2.94 μm wavelength. The preliminary system design is composed of a 3D Er:YAG laser processing unit enabling automatic laser to fiber coupling, a GeO2 solid core fiber, and a customized module combining collimation and focusing unit (focal length of 20 mm, outer diameter of 8 mm). The performance is evaluated with studies on tissue substitutes (agar-agar) as well as porcine samples that are analysed by optical coherence tomography measurements. Cuts (depths up to 3mm) with minimal carbonization have been achieved under adequate moistening and sample movement (1.5mms-1). Furthermore, an early cadaver study is presented. Future work aims at module miniaturization and integration into an endoluminal robot for scanning and focus adaptation. © 2016 SPIE.","endoluminal robot; ER:YAG laser; laser surgery; laser-fiber-coupling; soft tissue ablation","Ablation; Algae; Carbonization; Diagnosis; Electric power transmission; Erbium; Laser surgery; Laser tissue interaction; Molecules; Optical fibers; Optical tomography; Polysaccharides; Robots; Surgery; Surgical equipment; Textile fibers; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Water absorption; Conventional fibers; Endoluminal; Er:YAG lasers; Experimental evaluation; Hard tissue ablation; Laser-fiber coupling; Laser-to-fiber coupling; Soft tissue ablation; Laser mirrors",2-s2.0-84973382904

Automation in cars can vary across a continuum of levels at which it can replace manual tasks. Social relationships like anthropomorphic behavior of owners towards their cars is also expected to vary according to this spectrum of autonomous decision making capacity. Some researchers have proposed a joint cognitive model of a human-car collaboration that can make the best of the respective strengths of humans and machines. For a successful collaboration, it is important that the members of this human-car team develop, maintain and update each others behavioral models. We consider mutual trust as an integral part of these models. In this paper, we present a review of the quantitative models of trust in automation. We found that only a few models of humans' trust on automation exist in literature that account for the dynamic nature of trust and may be leveraged in human car interaction. However, these models do not support mutual trust. Our review suggests that there is significant scope for future research in the domain of mutual trust modeling for human car interaction, especially, when considered over the lifetime of the vehicle. Hardware and computational framework (for sensing, data aggregation, processing and modeling) must be developed to support these adaptive models over the operational phase of autonomous vehicles. In order to further research in mutual human - automation trust, we propose a framework for integrating Mutual Trust computation into standard Human - Robot Interaction research platforms. This framework includes User trust and Agent trust, the two fundamental components of Mutual trust. It allows us to harness multi-modal sensor data from the car as well as from the user's wearable or handheld device. The proposed framework provides access to prior trust aggregate and other cars' experience data from the Cloud and to feature primitives like gaze, facial expression, etc. from a standard low-cost Human - Robot Interaction platform. © 2016 Association for the Advancement of Artifical Intelligence (www.aaai.org) All rights reserved.",,"Automation; Data handling; Decision making; Man machine systems; Robots; Vehicles; Autonomous decision; Autonomous Vehicles; Computational framework; Facial Expressions; Fundamental component; Processing and modeling; Quantitative models; Social relationships; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-84980018596

Here we consider the complementary problem of learning the unknown transition dynamics of an MDP based on such observations. We describe the behavior-aware modeling (BAM) algorithm, which learns models of transition dynamics from user generated state-action trajectories. BAM makes assumptions about how users select their actions that are similar to those used in inverse reinforcement learning, and searches for a model that maximizes the probability of the observed actions. The BAM algorithm is based on policy gradient algorithms, essentially reversing the roles of the policy and transition distribution in those algorithms. As a result, BAM is highly flexible, and can be applied to continuous state spaces using a wide variety of model representations. In this preliminary work, we discuss why the model learning problem is interesting, describe algorithms to solve this problem, and discuss directions for future work.

First, dynamic model of the vehicle moving on a horizontal plane is developed and validated with the experimental platform Spido. Then, to reduce the complexity, the model is linearized by assuming that the side slip angles remain small and a linear lateral slippage model introducing the lateral contact stiffness is used. The kinematics of the vehicle is also linearized by assuming that the rover remains close a reference path and with a small relative heading angle. The linearized model permits the design of a Linear Quadratic Regulator LQR that minimizing the angle deviation and the lateral error. Then, nonlinear predictive controller is presented. This approach combines the kinematic model of the path-tracking with the dynamic model of the vehicle to deduce a non-linear Continuous Generalized Predictive Controller NCGPC controller. The predictive approach is dedicated to achieve an accurate path tracking and minimizing the angle deviation and the lateral error during prediction horizon time. Finally, we compare performance results between the NCGPC and the LQR controller. The simulation results show that both controllers have equivalent path tracking performance only in the straight line sections. However, predictive controller clearly outperform LQR controller when cornering. NCGPC controller has a higher rate of convergence to the reference trajectory with minimal lateral position error, thanks to the anticipation of future reference path changes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Lateral dynamics; Lateral slippage; LQR controller; Mobile robot; Nonlinear continuous time generalized predictive control; Path tracking","Continuous time systems; Dynamic models; Errors; Information science; Kinematics; Linearization; Mobile robots; Predictive control systems; Robotics; Vehicles; Generalized predictive control; Lateral dynamics; Lateral slippage; LQR controller; Path tracking; Controllers",2-s2.0-84978643508

Anticipating which activities will a human do next (and how) can enable an assistive robot to plan ahead for reactive responses. Furthermore, anticipation can even improve the detection accuracy of past activities. The challenge, however, is two-fold: We need to capture the rich context for modeling the activities and object affordances, and we need to anticipate the distribution over a large space of future human activities. In this work, we represent each possible future using an anticipatory temporal conditional random field (ATCRF) that models the rich spatial-temporal relations through object affordances. We then consider each ATCRF as a particle and represent the distribution over the potential futures using a set of particles. In extensive evaluation on CAD-120 human activity RGB-D dataset, we first show that anticipation improves the state-of-the-art detection results.

Basically it has the same indications but, at present, is reserved for selected patients. Compared to traditional video-assisted surgery presents some important differences. The surgeon is physically distant from the operative field and sits at a console, equipped with a monitor, from which, through a complex system, controls the movement of the robotic arms. These are fixed the various surgical instruments, tweezers, scissors, dissectors, that team shall present to the operating table to introduce into the cavity operative site. The use of mechanical arms has the advantage of allowing a three dimensional view an image with more stops and to make the most delicate maneuvers purposes and also because the tools are articulated to the distal end. The disadvantage is related to the times longer operative and the difficulty of determining the strength (as can happen in giving the right tension to a surgeon's knot).

Many existing methods for learning the dynamics of physical interactions require labeled object information. However, to scale real-world interaction learning to a variety of scenes and objects, acquiring labeled data becomes increasingly impractical. To learn about physical object motion without labels, we develop an action-conditioned video prediction model that explicitly models pixel motion, by predicting a distribution over pixel motion from previous frames. Because our model explicitly predicts motion, it is partially invariant to object appearance, enabling it to generalize to previously unseen objects. To explore video prediction for real-world interactive agents, we also introduce a dataset of 59, 000 robot interactions involving pushing motions, including a test set with novel objects. In this dataset, accurate prediction of videos conditioned on the robot's future actions amounts to learning a ""visual imagination"" of different futures based on different courses of action.

The Moon is no longer perceived as a target to reach, but as a starting point and platform to be exploited as a step towards greater objectives. In this context, the European Space Agency proposed the ESA Moon Challenge, an International Student Contest challenging international teams, composed by University students from at least two continents, to design a mission scenario and operational concept for ESA's HERACLES concept study. This paper focuses on the main results and original aspects of the mission scenario proposed and designed by the Advanced Concepts for Moon Exploitation (ACME) team: a combination of large-scale lunar surface and trans-lunar space architectures is proposed, to produce and assemble key spacecraft components directly in space, enabling currently unfeasible deep space missions and more efficient Earth servicing space systems building up. The key motivation being the energetic requirement to launch massive elements from the Moon to be strongly reduced with respect to launch them from Earth. The mission includes three main building blocks: the automated Moon surface infrastructure, the orbiting manned station, located in the Earth-Moon Lagrangian Point 2 (EML2) and the Earth segment. The first is composed by three further modules: (1) set of robots to collect regolith and feed the (2) In-Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) plants to extract the correct chemicals to either feed the (3) 3D printers to produce basic spacecraft structural components (trusses, plates) or to synthetize rocket propellants (H2, O2, metals). The orbiting manned station is conceived to receive the lunar surface products and technologically advanced hardware coming from Earth and assemble them into operational space vehicles aimed to perform different exploration mission scenarios. The EML2 station itself is designed to be modular, to launch from Earth small modules then enlarged and assembled in orbit, exploiting the in-situ produced structures as well. The paper reports the overall architecture design and operations strategy, pointing out the mandatory requirements; attention is then focused on the Moon surface modules definition and design; their feasibility is critically discussed according to the current Technology Readiness Level and the potential development plan. The cost effectiveness of the proposed scenario is highlighted, supported by the performed economic analysis to assess the validity of the proposed concept.",,,2-s2.0-85016448691

Originally, approaches were based on empirical experience, but growing evidence suggests that exercise-dependent plasticity constitutes the main mechanism underlying the effects of physiotherapy. Exercise increases synaptic strength and influences neurotransmission, thus potentiating functional circuitry in PD. In addition, exercise is a pivotal element of motor learning. PD patients retain a sufficient capacity of motor learning, though learning rates and performance are reduced in comparison to normal controls. Recent meta-analyses demonstrated that rehabilitation could induce short-lasting, but clinically important benefits, particularly for gait and balance. However, the interventions are largely heterogeneous (stretching, muscle strengthening, balance, postural exercises, occupational therapy, cueing, treadmill training), and there is still no consensus about the optimal approach. Innovative techniques have been recently proposed: virtual reality and exergaming, motor imagery and action observation, robot-assisted physiotherapy and non-conventional therapies (e.g.: dance, martial arts). The rehabilitative program for PD should be ""goal-based"" (targeted to practicing and learning specific activities in the core areas), but a number of practice variables (intensity, specificity, complexity) need to be identified and the program should tailored to the individual patients' characteristics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Parkinson's disease; Physical exercise; Plasticity; Rehabilitation","Article; body equilibrium; clinical effectiveness; cognitive rehabilitation; exercise intensity; gait; guided imagery; human; kinesiotherapy; mental capacity; motor control; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; occupational therapy; outcome assessment; Parkinson disease; patient care planning; physiotherapy; priority journal; robotics; synaptic transmission; treadmill exercise; treatment duration; virtual reality exposure therapy; walking speed; animal; daily life activity; exercise; forecasting; Parkinson disease; physiology; trends; Activities of Daily Living; Animals; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Forecasting; Gait; Humans; Parkinson Disease; Physical Therapy Modalities",2-s2.0-84947869088

Therefore, the utilization of robots for these tasks will be a necessity in future space exploration. There is a wide spectrum of possibilities for the utilization of robots with, in principle, two extreme strategies. The first one involves de use of few robots, highly sophisticated and complex, capable of at least near humane dexterity, but incorporating mechanical strength, physical power and resistance to extreme environments which humans lack. Despite its versatility, this option has some notorious potential practical disadvantages, like: high unitary cost, very high complexity and therefore multitude of failure points and difficulty of repairing, large per-unit power consumption and fragility of the mission as a whole due to the lost or degradation of one or few units. The second possibility is the utilization of a large number of small simple robots, each one with a limited capacity to perform simple tasks, operating in a largely autonomous but cooperative way based on mutual backfeeding. The advantages of this option are basically the simplicity of each unit and, consequently, its electro-mechanical robustness, low cost, minimal power consumption and, very importantly, the independence of the success of the mission with respect to the lost or failure of even a considerable number of individual robots. As a proof of concept, a small ensemble of robots will be implemented in a full payload that can be deployed in the lunar surface using a third party lander, such as the Griffin Lander of Astrobotic. The payload will consist of a module instrumented for communications, initial operation, transport to the lunar surface, deployment of the set of robots and, if necessary, of the tools and material and/or control surfaces, and visual and electronic validation of success. In general lines, the mission will consist on the deployment onto the lunar surface of a set of robots that will perform, in an independently verifiable way, a cooperative task which will include the construction or deployment of a small structure outside the lander.

Despite challenges in the agricultural robotic designs, robots are capable of performing various tasks and changing themselves accordingly, based on specific conditions. To address modern problems in the agricultural field, an agricultural robot is one of the key technologies. Although agricultural robotic is still in the development stage, these particular robots have a bright future ahead. This paper proposes a new 5DOF articulated robotic arm design that would become a solution for heavy crop harvesting like pumpkin and cabbage. The main design process of the device was conceived using 6 stages of Shigley design process. All components were designed, assembled and analyzed by using Solidworks 2014 in compliance with JIS standards. The parts of the system that had dynamic nature were analyzed manually using standard mechanical formulas. Calculations of the workspace, required joint torque, and coordination of mass center position were developed using standard machine design methods. Denavit-Hartenberg method was used to calculate forward and reverse kinematics. To resolve the torque reduction, components were designed by different material and mass center and were compared together. Results showed that total torque in Joints number 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were 6.15, 257.35, 103.4, 20.2 and 0.1 N. m respectively with a rotational speed range of 15 ~ 60 rpm. Changes in the linkage material and servo motor location improved 29.7% ~ 47.7% and 29.7% ~68.9% of the total required torque for each joint. The maximum distance covered by the arm was 1640 mm from the J2 and 1830 mm from the attachment point.

In applications such as search and rescue, command and control, and air traffic control, operators in the future will likely need to work in teams together with robots. It is critical to understand how these teams could be robust against uncertainty and what influences team performance. We conducted two experiments in which teams of three operators controlled simulated heterogeneous robots on the same testbed. Experiment 1 investigated the impact of team structure and uncertainty of task arrival processes on team coordination and performance. Experiment 2 explored the usage of information-sharing tools under different uncertainty levels. In Experiment 1, it was found that divisional teams were more robust against the uncertainty on task arrival processes. However, this robustness was achieved with an overall worse performance compared to functional teams. Three reasons for the degraded performance were identified, namely duplication on task assignment, under-utilization of vehicles, and infrequent communication. In Experiment 2, it was found that information-sharing tools reduced the duplication on task assignments, improved overall task performance, and reduced workload. These results provide insights for achieving robust and effective teamwork. This goal can be achieved by using a team structure that could adapt to uncertainties together with effective information-sharing tools.

On the other hand, while offering many advantages in safety and adaptability to interact with unstructured environments, objects, and human bodies, mechanical compliance also violates many inherent assumptions in traditional rigid-body robotics. Thus, a complete soft robotic system requires new approaches to utilize proprioception that provides rich sensory information while remaining flexible, and motion control under significant time delay. This paper discusses our proposed solutions for each of these system-level challenges in soft robotics research. © 2016 SPIE.","Electropermanent magnet valves; Fluidic elastomer actuators; Magnetic soft sensing; Portable pressure generation; Sliding mode control; Soft robotics","Delay control systems; Magnetic actuators; Nanotechnology; Sliding mode control; Time delay; Visual servoing; Magnetic soft sensing; Mechanical compliance; Pressure generation; Robot maintenance; Sensory information; Soft robotics; System integration; Unstructured environments; Robotics",2-s2.0-84991512043

Giant oil fields are declining in their production worldwide and this situation is creating need for search of new conventional and non-conventional fossil reserves. With steep depletion of major onshore and shallow-water-offshore oil fields new search of fossil fuel is moving towards deep-water and ultra-deep water offshore fields. Obviously new reserves are located in extreme, hostile and hard-to-reach environmental conditions. Exploration, development and production of oil from such difficult offshore fields have many serious challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE) therefore, require sophisticated technological innovations to support increasing energy demand. Biggest oil spill accidents in explosion of Deepwater Horizon offshore oil platform are burning example of such challenges which human society cannot risk to repeat. Therefore, development of advance drilling system, more accurate and intelligent inspection mechanism, faster responsive system in cases of unfortunate incidence and efficient damage control system is need of the safer future. Successful implementation of robotics, in space and manufacturing industry, is an critical example of how robotic assistance and automation is the only option for safe and cost-effective production of oil in foreseeable future. Teleoperation of unmanned drilling and production platforms, remote operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), under-water welding, welding robots for double hulled ships and under-water manipulator are such key robotic technologies which have facilitated smooth transition of offshore rigs from shallow waters to ultra-deep waters in modern time. Considering the sensitivity of product and difficulty of environment, most of these technologies fall under semi-autonomous category, where human operator is in loop for providing cognitive assistance to the overall operation for safe execution.

Think of self-driving cars, companion robots, and medical diagnosis support systems. We also believe that humans and machines will often need to work together and agree on common decisions. Thus hybrid collective decision making systems will be in great need. In this scenario, both machines and collective decision making systems should follow some form of moral values and ethical principles (appropriate to where they will act but always aligned to humans'), as well as safety constraints. In fact, humans would accept and trust more machines that behave as ethically as other humans in the same environment. Also, these principles would make it easier for machines to determine their actions and explain their behavior in terms understandable by humans. Moreover, often machines and humans will need to make decisions together, either through consensus or by reaching a compromise.

To better understand the relationships between artificial intelligence (AI) and RI in a way that promotes trust between autonomous systems and human users, this book explores the underlying theory, mathematics, computational models, and field applications. It uniquely unifies the fields of RI and trust and frames it in a broader context, namely the effective integration of human-autonomous systems. A description of the current state of the art in RI and trust introduces the research work in this area. With this foundation, the chapters further elaborate on key research areas and gaps that are at the heart of effective human-systems integration, including workload management, human computer interfaces, team integration and performance, advanced analytics, behavior modeling, training, and, lastly, test and evaluation. Written by international leading researchers from across the field of autonomous systems research, Robust Intelligence and Trust in Autonomous Systems dedicates itself to thoroughly examining the challenges and trends of systems that exhibit RI, the fundamental implications of RI in developing trusted relationships with present and future autonomous systems, and the effective human systems integration that must result for trust to be sustained. © Springer Science+Business Media (outside the USA) 2016.",,"Computation theory; Human computer interaction; Human resource management; Hybrid systems; Integration; Autonomous systems; Computational model; Field application; Human computer interfaces; Human systems integration; Test and evaluation; Trusted relationships; Workload management; Intelligent robots",2-s2.0-84978349466

Such systems need solving the challenging task of designing robust algorithms handling intra and inter-personal variability: for a given action, people do never reproduce the same movements, preventing from having stable and reliable models for recognition. In our work, we use the latent force model (LFM [2]) to introduce mechanistic criteria in explaining the time series describing human actions in terms actual forces. According to LFM’s, the human body can be seen as a dynamic system driven by latent forces. In addition, the hidden structure of these forces can be captured through Gaussian processes (GP) modeling. Accordingly, regression processes are able to give suitable models for both classification and prediction. We applied this formalism to daily life actions recognition and tested it successfully on a collection of real activities. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the approach.

Recognizing human emotion has varied range of applications in humanoid robots, animation industry, psychology, forensic analysis, medical aid, automotive industry, etc. This work focuses on emotion recognition under various illumination conditions using images from CMU-MultiPIE database. The database is provided with five basic expressions like neutral, happiness, anger, disgust and surprise with varying pose and illuminations. The experiment has been conducted on images with varying illuminations initially without pre-processing and also by applying a proposed ratio-based pre-processing method followed by feature extraction and classification. Dual—Tree-Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) was applied for the formation of feature vectors along with K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) as the classifier. The result shows that pre-processed images give better results than original images. It is thus concluded that varying illumination has effect on emotion recognition and the pre-processing algorithm demonstrates improvement in accuracy of recognition.

Especially vacuum infusion techniques for large CFRP structures still involve a high amount of manual work. In detail, the vacuum bagging depends on manual lay-up processes of auxiliary materials. A first approach of automation concepts for robot-based vacuum bagging will be discussed in this paper. In a research project at the Center for Leigtweight Production Technology in Augsburg, automated manufacturing of a single-curved CFRP fuselage demonstrator has been investigated. A rigid gripping system with needle grippers has been developed and validated for the application of auxiliary materials as peel ply, release film and airweave on the top of a dry fiber preform. Alongside the process chain, handling and positioning procedures have been analyzed both analytically and in experimental test series. According to the rigidity of the gripping system, an adequate motion concept for the fuselage demonstrator has been found. The gripping system allows pick-up, transportation and positioning of auxiliary material packages on a single-curved preform with high accuracy. Based on these results conclusions for future vacuum bagging processes can be drawn. © 2016, European Conference on Composite Materials, ECCM.

Although RT combines the unique benefits of the surgical robot and remote access thyroidectomy, its applicability on cancer patients is challenged by the questionable oncological benefits and safety. This review aims to analyze the current literature evidence in comparing RT to OT on thyroid cancers for their perioperative and oncological outcomes. To date, no randomized controlled trial is available in comparing RT to OT. All published studies are nonrandomized or retrospective comparisons. Current data suggests that RT compares less favorably than OT for longer operative time, higher cost, and possibly inferior oncological control with lower number of central lymph nodes retrieved. In terms of morbidity, quality of life outcomes, and short-term recurrence rates, RT and OT are comparable. While conventional OT continues to be appropriate for most thyroid cancers, RT should better be continued by expert surgeons on selected patients who have low-risk thyroid cancers and have high expectations on cosmetic outcomes.

Peripheral nerve stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are neuromodulation techniques that can upregulate neuroplasticity and, in turn, enhance outcomes of motor training after stroke. Few studies have investigated possible adjuvant effects between peripheral nerve stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and intensive motor training. OBJECTIVE: This proof-of-concept study investigated whether timing variations in neuromodulation paired with robot-assisted motor training effect differential outcomes for subjects with chronic, moderate-to-severe upper extremity impairment after stroke. METHODS: Ten subjects in the chronic phase (>12 months after stroke) of recovery completed the study. Subjects received 10 daily sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation either at the start (n = 4) or at the end (n = 6) of peripheral nerve stimulation preceding intensive motor training. Pre-post changes in motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment; Stroke Impact Scale) and neuroplasticity (transcranial magnetic stimulation) were assessed by condition. RESULTS: Significant improvement in Stroke Impact Scale (p = 0.02) and no change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment were associated with the start condition. No changes in Stroke Impact Scale and Fugl-Meyer Assessment were associated with the end condition. Only 1 subject in the start group had measurable neuroplastic responses and demonstrated an increase in ipsilesional cortical map volume. Only 1 subject in the end group had measurable neuroplastic responses and demonstrated a decrease in ipsilesional cortical map volume. Opposite shifts in ipsilesional cortical centers of gravity occurred relative to condition. CONCLUSION: In cases of moderate-to-severe impairment after stroke, transcranial direct current stimulation at the start, rather than the end, of peripheral nerve stimulation prior to motor training may effect better functional outcomes. Future research with a larger sample size is needed to validate the findings of this proof-of-concept study. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Meanwhile the labor time, labor intensity of drivers and the production cost are saved. The path tracking of agricultural vehicle was studied in an operating condition, and a variety of sensors were installed on the car features of the external environment. Then it generated a four-element in state space by the target path which was given for controling the agricultural vehicles to track the target path automaticly according to the theory of optimal navigation control. The location method of GPS/INS was selected, the navigation system was developed, and the experiment was finished in 2014. According to the needs of automatic walking positioning system, a variety of sensors has been chosen, including the inertial sensor, angle sensor and GPS sensor. Then the serial program was writen to collect the signal from the sensors and calibrate them. In order to meet the requirements of vehicle navigation system, the positioning system with low cost and high precision was developed. The hardware of the system consisted of two GPS modules, two Zigbee wireless transmission modules and an inertial sensor. The data from the sensors are filtered and fused, and finally accurate, reliable vehicle position data was got. The tracking controller based on preview control was designed to obtain the future values and target values of the vehicle. With the target path and its curvature, the feed forward control value was got. There was an error between the current state and the state of vehicle target path that was needed to use LQR for elimination. The performance of the path following controller was simulated by Matlab, then the maximum lateral error was 0.16 m and 0.27 m at the speed of 0.5 m/s and 1 m/s respectively. The results showed that the control method was feasible. The steering control system was designed based on steer-by-wire(SBW) after the study of vehicle navigation control principle. SBW removed out mechanical connection between steering wheel and steering front wheel. It used motors to control front wheel angle and simulated force characteristic. Compared with traditional steering system, SBW had characteristics of ideal steering ratio and active steering control according to vehicle state parameters, and improved safety of driving and handling stability. The strategy of BLDCM was designed in order to make actual front angle follow the desired angle better. PID control and sliding mode variable structure control were applied in strategy of BLDCM and the result of simulation showed that sliding mode variable structure control was better than PID control. This paper designed the electronic control unit of SBW based on chip of MC9S12XET256, mainly including peripheral circuit of MCU, CAN communication circuit, drive circuit of BLDCM, power circuit, signal acquisition and processing circuit, current sampling circuit of motor. Based on the requirement of joint simulation, we designed a bench test for control strategy and hardware, software of ECU in 2015. The results of test bench showed that angle correction was similar with the result of simulation and sliding mode variable structure control was better than PID control in following front angle. Finally, the vehicle steering control test and the vehicle path tracking control test were carried out based on vehicle test platform, which was built personally. The vehicle path tracking system was based on the Windows platform, using Microsoft Visual Studio as the development environment. The integrated navigation system was validated and the test data showed that the integrated navigation system had a high positioning accuracy and the steering system had a reliable tracking performance. The final navigation and positioning accuracy of integrated navigation system was around 0.1 m to 0.5 m and the response speed of the whole system was about 0.1s.The results proved that the system could meet the requirements of agricultural vehicle path tracking control system. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The existing semantic mapping approaches typically consider small number of semantic categories, require complex inference or large number of training examples to achieve desirable performance. In the proposed work we present an efficient approach for predicting locations of generic objects in urban environments by means of semantic segmentation of a video into object and non-object categories. We exploit widely available exemplars of non-object categories (such as road, buildings, vegetation) and use geometric cues which are indicative of the presence of object boundaries to gather the evidence about objects regardless of their category. We formulate the object/non-object semantic segmentation problem in the Conditional Random Field framework, where the structure of the graph is induced by a minimum spanning tree computed over a 3D point cloud, yielding an efficient algorithm for an exact inference. The chosen 3D representation naturally lends itself for on-line recursive belief updates with a simple soft data association mechanism.

The main goal of infrastructure security is to secure, withstand, and rapidly recover from potential threats that may affect critical resources located within a given bounded region. In order to strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure, proactive and coordinated efforts are necessary. Motivated from questions raised by infrastructure security, in this paper we survey several recent optimization problems whose solution has occupied (and continues to occupy) computer science researchers in the last few years. Topics discussed include: 1. Patrolling. 2. Sensor Coverage and Interference. 3. Evacuation. 4. Domain Protection and Blocking. The central theme in all the problems mentioned above will involve mobility in that the participating agents will be able to move over a specified region with a given speed. Security in itself is undoubtedly a very broad and complex task which involves all layers of the communication process from physical to network. As such the limited goal of this survey is to outline existing models and ideas and discuss related open problems and future research directions, pertaining to optimization problems in infrastructure security. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Blocking; Coverage; Evacuation; Infrastructure security; Interference; Mobile robots; Patrolling","Complex networks; Mobile robots; Surveys; Wave interference; Blocking; Coverage; Evacuation; Infrastructure security; Patrolling; Optimization",2-s2.0-84960452687

Furthermore, the main contributions in the field of motion planning of SMs are often concentrated in the point-to-point strategy, with special interest in the complex dynamics of such systems. In fact, planners for space manipulators generally count on a previously computed path in order to modify it to avoid collisions. Nonetheless, the computing of the previous path still lacks robust formulations, specially in the case of freefloating manipulators. Our goal consists in creating a path planner with collision avoidance for a free-floating planar manipulator. The dynamic model is based on the Dynamically Equivalent Manipulator and the concept of Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees serves as a framework for the developed algorithm. A combination of a method that reduces the metric sensitivity with a bidirectional approach is proposed in order to achieve a solution convergence. Details of the collision checking algorithm are provided. The system is validated by simulating the path planning task for a three-link planar free-floating manipulator, while considering the presence of an obstacle. The results are then discussed and promising directions for future works are presented. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,"Collision avoidance; Manipulators; Motion planning; Robotics; Spacecraft equipment; Trees (mathematics); Collision-checking; Complex dynamics; Dynamic singularities; Path-planning tasks; Planar manipulator; Rapidly-exploring random trees; Robust formulations; Space manipulators; Robot programming",2-s2.0-84992697189

Being pursued by the group of Gramazio Kohler Research at ETH Zurich, this approach involves a spatially coordinated movement of two sixaxis robotic arms that control the curvature of a hot-wire, which adopts itself against the resistance of the processed material (e.g. polystyrene). In contrast to standard CNC hot-wire cutting processes, in which the cutting medium remains linear, it allows the automated fabrication of non-ruled, doubly curved surfaces. This pursuit includes the development of a custom digital design and robotic control framework that combines computational simulation and manufacturing feedback information. Ultimately, SWC enables a considerably expanded design and fabrication space for complex architectural geometries and their construction through automated robotic technology.

The capability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been extended from approaches assuming steady-state conditions to consideration of unsteady/transient conditions associated with the body motion of a swimmer. However, to predict hydrodynamic forces and the swimmer’s potential speeds accurately, more robust and efficient numerical methods are necessary, coupled with validation procedures, requiring detailed experimental data reflecting local flow. Experimental data obtained by particle image velocimetry (PIV) in this area are limited, because at present observations are restricted to a two-dimensional 1.0 m2 area, though this could be improved if the output range of the associated laser sheet increased.

A running on-board range estimate must be used to update the visible star catalog to perform star ID. Additionally, once stars are identified each of these stars can then act as a beacon for position estimation.

Rather than use the harvesting manipulator to place picked apples in a storage container, the secondary system catches and stores apples at the point of fruit separation in order to minimize path length and improve cycle time. Monte Carlo simulations were used to select link lengths and joint limits. The design includes two low cost stepper motors and a vacuum assisted end-effector. After fabrication, laboratory studies were conducted to measure the system's repeatability and validate the proof-of-concept. A conservative estimate of repeatability is 20 mm, which is within the catching end-effector's effective workspace. During integrated system testing in the lab, the secondary system caught all harvested fruit. Likewise, the pick-and-catch technique resulted in an approximately 50 percent reduction in overall cycle time compared to the conventional pick-and-place method. Future work will include development of an end-effector prototype with soft elements to minimize fruit bruising. © 2016","Agriculture; Mechanization; Monte Carlo simulation; Robot kinematics; Robotic manipulator","Agriculture; Commerce; End effectors; Fruits; Intelligent systems; Machinery; Manipulators; Mechanization; Monte Carlo methods; Stepping motors; Integrated system testing; Laboratory studies; Planar manipulator; Preliminary design; Proof of concept; Robot kinematics; Robotic manipulators; Storage container; Robotics",2-s2.0-84994753742

For high-density power electronic systems with miniaturized system size, a balancing of the semiconductor switching speed, duty cycles ranges, frequency of switching, current density, ripple and overshoot voltages are necessary. In order to assess the design rules of GaN switch circuits in connection with the supporting passive components, in particular the DC-link and filter capacitors, simultaneous measurements of the electromagnetic emissions and the waveforms of the voltage and currents in the capacitors and also in the switched node in a 650V GaN half bridge followed by a resonant filter structure were made. Results are obtained for different switching frequency ranges, mainly between 50 kHz and 1000 kHz, different interlock delay and capacitor technologies. The results are interpreted in terms of the correlation between the voltage and current waveforms and the emitted radiation for varying input voltage levels. It was found that for the half bridge with RC filter - circuit without load, that film capacitors show higher amplitudes of voltage and current transients at high switching frequency, resulting in increased levels of EMI, than the ceramic ones. Also the interlock delay time setting in conjunction with duty cycle parameters and the rise time of the gate pulse showed considerable influence on EMI levels. For a LC combination in a buck converter structure it has been established that no optimized interlock delay time could be found where ripple currents and EMI emissions could be reduced while maintaining a fast rise at the GaN, independent of load. The results from a GaN - capacitor combination test circuit showed that clamping of gate voltage either passively, actively, or by topology is necessary for avoiding unwanted switching actions in fast GaN circuits. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.",,"Bandpass filters; DC-DC converters; Electromagnetic dispersion; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy management; Film capacitor; Gallium nitride; Intelligent robots; Interference suppression; Power electronics; Switching; Switching frequency; Wide band gap semiconductors; Electromagnetic emissions; Filter structures; High power electronic applications; High switching frequencies; Miniaturized systems; Simultaneous measurement; Voltage and current transients; Voltage and current waveforms; Passive filters",2-s2.0-85025689268

Summaryof Background Data: Superior outcomes of MIDP compared with open distal pancreatectomy have been reported. In the Netherlands (2005 to 2013) only 10% of distal pancreatectomies were in a minimally invasive fashion and 85% of surgeons welcomed MIDP training. The feasibility and impact of a nationwide training program is unknown. Methods: From 2014 to 2015, 32 pancreatic surgeons from 17 centers participated in a nationwide training program in MIDP, including detailed technique description, video training, and proctoring on-site. Outcomes of MIDP before training (2005-2013) were compared with outcomes after training (2014-2015). Results: In total, 201 patients were included; 71 underwent MIDP in 9 years before training versus 130 in 22 months after training (7-fold increase, P < 0.001). The conversion rate (38% [n = 27] vs 8% [n = 11], P < 0.001) and blood loss were lower after training and more pancreatic adenocarcinomas were resected (7 [10%] vs 28 [22%], P=0.03), with comparable R0-resection rates (4/7 [57%] vs 19/28 [68%], P = 0.67).

Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out using PubMed, Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI, WanFang, VIP and other sources like relevant references to obtain comparative studies assessing the effectiveness and safety between RG and LG published between 2013 and 2016. Then the literature was screened and the data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. The quality of the literature was assessed, and the data analyzed using Stata/SE 14 software. Fixed effects or random effects models wereapplied according to heterogeneity. Results: A total of 12 non-randomized observational clinical studies involving 3,580 patients were included, of which 1,096 had undergone RG and 2,484 had received LG. The results of the meta-analysis showed in terms of effectiveness, RG was associated with less blood loss, less time to first flatus and greater number of harvested lymph nodes, but there were no significant differences in proximal and distal resection margins, compared with LG. In terms of efficiency, RG was associated with shorter hospital stay, but longer operative time. In terms of safety, there were no statistically significant differences in complications, mortality and conversions between RG and LG. Conclusions: RG can achieve comparable or better short-term and radical effects than LG, with respect to effectiveness, efficiency and safety in treatment of gastric carcinoma. Future studies involving RG should focus on decreasing operative time and reducing cost. Moreover, there is a need for randomized controlled trials comparing the two techniques with long-term follow-up.","Da Vinci robot; Gastric carcinoma; Laparoscopy; Meta-analysis; Radical gastrectomy","adverse effects; aged; carcinoma; comparative study; female; gastrectomy; hospital; human; laparoscopy; length of stay; lymph node; male; meta analysis; middle aged; observational study; operation duration; Postoperative Complications; procedures; robotics; safety; Stomach Neoplasms; treatment outcome; Aged; Carcinoma; Female; Gastrectomy; Hospitals; Humans; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Lymph Nodes; Male; Middle Aged; Observational Studies as Topic; Operative Time; Postoperative Complications; Robotics; Safety; Stomach Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84995812866

We start by discussing the concept of bounded-input bounded-output stability, giving examples where the technique might not be sufficient to guarantee what we term “total system stability” due to complications associated with the levels of abstraction between the modules and components that are being chained together in the architecture. We then go on to discuss necessary conditions that may fall out of this naturally as a result. We further try to better-define the input and output constraints needed to guarantee total system stability, using an assumption-guarantee-like contractual framework that sits alongside the architecture; the requirements then may have influence across multiple modules, in order to keep consistency. We also discuss how the structure of the architectural modules may help or hinder the process of capability characterization and performance analysis of each module and a given architecture configuration as a whole. We then discuss two overlapping methods that, combined, should allow us to analyze the effectiveness of the architecture, and help towards verification and validation of both the components and the system as a whole. Demonstrative examples are given using a specific architectural implementation called the Resilient Spacecraft Executive. In future work, we hope to define both necessary and sufficient conditions for total system stability across such a system architecture for robotics use. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In the oil-producing Niger Delta, oil spillage is largely due to pipeline corrosion and crude oil theft and sabotage. This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing small mobile robots for early detection of ground oil leakage, a methodology defined as Ground Robotic Oil Spill Surveillance (GROSS). GROSS robot was constructed using iRobot Create, element serial Bluetooth Adapter Module (BAM) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sensor, and programmed using MATLAB to patrol a pipeline route 5 m in length. To simulate oil spills, varying volumes of gasoline - 30, 59, 118, 236, 354, 472, 590, and 708 ml - were placed along the pipeline route prior to the robot's patrol. GROSS robot demonstrated capability of detecting spills as little as 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7 liters when running at 100, 200, and 300 mm/s respectively. Detection distance between LPG sensor and spill ranged from 76 - 157 cm. GROSS robots could assist in early detection of oil spills.

The complexity of robotic devices is mainly determined by the residual functions of the patient. In patients with muscular weakness, a simple weight support system might be sufficient, whereas in patients with severe paralysis, actively driven exoskeletons with multiple degrees of freedom are necessary. Robots must comply with general regulatory and safety standards. Robotic devices have to be adjustable to a wide range of anthropometric properties and to the amount and the characteristics of their impairment. The user-friendliness of the robot’s human-machine interface consisting of the mechanical, the control, and the feedback interfaces determines whether a device becomes integrated in the rehabilitation program or not. An inherent advantage of the more complex rehabilitation robots is their ability to use angular and force sensor signals for assessment and documentation. These are important to objectively control the course of the training, to legitimate and shape the training, and to document progresses or deteriorations. In the future devices which allow the continuation of a robotic therapy at home will further enlarge the range of applications. © Springer International Publishing 2016.","Complexity vs. usability; End user requirements; Humanmachine interfaces; Robotic assessments; Safety issues",,2-s2.0-85017078522

Anticipatory networks generalize earlier models of consequence anticipation in multicriteria decision problem solving. This theory is based on the assumption that the decision maker takes into account the anticipated outcomes of future decision problems linked in a prescribed manner by the causal relations with the present problem. Thus arises a multigraph of decision problems linked causally (the first relation) and representing one or more additional anticipation relations. Such multigraphs will be termed anticipatory networks. We will also present the notion of a superanticipatory system, which is an anticipatory system that contains a future model of at least one anticipatory system besides itself. It will be shown that non-trivial anticipatory networks are superanticipatory systems. Finally, we will discuss several real-life applications of anticipatory networks, including an application to establish efficient collaboration of human and robot teams. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Anticipatory collaboration; Anticipatory networks; Multicriteria decision making; Preference modelling; Superanticipatory systems","Decision making; Directed graphs; Problem solving; Anticipatory collaboration; Anticipatory systems; Causal relations; Decision problems; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision problems; Preference modelling; Real-life applications; Decision theory",2-s2.0-84975781979

Legged animals primarily attach to surfaces using claws, soft and hairy pads, or combinations of them. Recent studies have indicated that the frictional forces generated by these structures not only control the movement of animals but also significantly increase the reliability of their attachment. Moreover, the frictional forces of various animals have opposite characteristics and hierarchical properties from toe-to-toe and leg-to-leg. These opposite frictional forces allow animals to attach securely and stably during movement. The coordination of several attachment (adhesion) modes not only helps animals adhere, which would be impossible in single mode, but also increases the overall stability of the attachment (adhesion) system. These findings can help the design of highly adaptable feet for bionic robots in the near future. © 2013, The author(s).","attachment reliability; claw interlocks; hairy pad adhesion; opposite frictional forces; soft pad adhesion",,2-s2.0-84976348917

Normally, the servicing targets are defunct satellites or space debris and therefore can be treated as non-cooperative targets. Space robot first has to capture the non-cooperative target in order to execute further operations. Nevertheless, due to the target mass parameters are unknown before capture, the motion of the target cannot be predicted using its dynamic model. It is impossible for the space robot to complete such a capture task without the knowledge of the target motion prediction. Therefore, how to obtain the non-cooperative target motion prediction in finite horizon precisely is one of the challenging issues in space and has gained increasing recognition. This paper describes a framework for predicting future positions and orientation of non-cooperative targets in the complex space environment employing autoregressive model (ARM). No constraints are placed on the target motion. Trajectories of the non-cooperative targets are not known a priori, but we assume that previous knowledge about position and orientation are available to the ARM from sensory devices. Based on the historical knowledge of the target motion, the parameters of the ARM are obtained with conditional maximum likelihood estimation. Once the parameters of the ARM are determined, the (n + np)th (np is the prediction horizon) position and orientation of a non-cooperative target could be calculated in a truly dynamic sense based on its first n positions and orientations. Simulation results show the feasibility and performance of the proposed scheme when compared with the motion prediction using truly dynamic model. The prediction model will be an essential part in designing a trajectory planning algorithm for a space robot executing on-orbit capture activities.

This paper presents the methodology adopted for planning a trajectory required to be followed by the eye-in-hand camera mounted near the end-effector of a six axis manipulator. The basic purpose is to acquire a sequence of images by translating the camera along the optical axis of the camera which is meant to be used by an algorithm inspired by Shape from Focus (SFF). Methods/Statistical Analysis: The movement of the camera (the end effector) is controlled in the task space of the robot a Cartesian space approach is presented where-in the inverse kinematics computations needs to be performed at run time. All the trajectory planning and simulation of the robot's movements are demonstrated in the simulation where the cues for camera motion are obtained from the SFF-inspired algorithm. Since the SFF-inspired algorithm requires a linear trajectory to be followed by the camera and manipulator is an all-revolute joint based one, careful understanding of the workspace of the robot for singularities is of prime importance. The ability of the manipulator to orient in three axes at the various reachable positions of the workspace is estimated by a manipulability measure. The linear trajectory to be followed by the end-effector is planned in the region of the workspace which has the highest manipulability. Findings: The paper describes the various steps involved in the process of understanding the manipulability of the workspace and planning of the trajectory in accordance with the manipulability index. The details of the trajectory planning to meet the requirements are clearly illustrated. Application/Improvements: Though the intended purpose of planning the trajectory is specific to a computer vision task, the methodology demonstrated is applicable for any application involving linear trajectories. The scope for future work in continuation of the current work is in the direction of dynamics affected trajectory planning.","Linear trajectory; Manipulability; SFF; Trajectory planning",,2-s2.0-84995804571

The implementation of this system is described herein. The simulation closely models the methodology needed to implement autonomous camera control in a real hardware system. The camera control algorithm follows three rules: (1) keep the view centered on the tools, (2) keep the zoom level optimized such that the tools never leave the field of view, and (3) avoid unnecessary movement of the camera that may distract/disorient the surgeon.

We argue here that the one-sided, emotionally tinged relationships that children form with media characters, known as parasocial relationships, influence children’s acquisition of information presented on screens. More specifically, these parasocial relationships can be instrumental in aiding children in their understanding of concepts that are essential for success in school, including language learning and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) topic areas. We then turn to future research directions in which we highlight robots and intelligent agents as technologies that will increasingly blur the lines between what is real and what is not.

Kember argues that there is a tendency to affirm and celebrate the existence of smart and often sexist objects, environments and materials in themselves; to elide writing and other forms of mediation; and to engage in disembodied knowledge practices. Disembodied knowledge practices tend towards a scientism that currently includes physics envy and are also masculinist. Where there is some degree of convergence between masculinist and feminist thinking about objects, environments and materials, there is also divergence, conflict and the possible opening towards a politics of imedia.

The most fundamental elements to materialize nano-technology are the development of battery-free nano-devices, which can be used to accomplish simple tasks such as computation, sensing, and communication [3]. Furthermore, by combining these basic units, the capacity of these nano-devices could be substantially expanded and much more complex tasks can be targeted, which highlights the concept of nanonetworks. The latter opens the door to an immense range of applications ranging from medical technologies to flexible electronics [4]. On the other hand, researches on body area networks (BAN) at microwave frequencies have obtained great achievements, and it is pointed out by Prof. Metin Sitti that the entire network systems would be shrunk into nano-scale with the nano-robots and molecular machine as the elements in the near future [1].

This key technology can be used in several space robotic missions such as in refuelling, repairing, servicing satellites, or for the removal of space debris. In the capturing operation, an accurate robot trajectory control should be used in order to minimize the impact force at the time of capture, and the robotic system should dampen the spin motion of the target in the post-capture phase. Indeed, the impact force could damage either the manipulator or the target, cause an undesired spacecraft attitude destabilization, or cause the target to be pushed away. Therefore, the robot trajectory has to be computed in such a way that the relative velocity between the robot end-effector and the target at the time of capture is very small. Moreover, the spacecraft attitude deviation should be minimized during and after the capture in order to maintain the communication link with the ground station. In this operative scenario there are several unsolved issues, mainly concerning the accurate identification of the dynamic parameters of the target, and the design and implementation of effective systems for impact reduction and motion damping of the target satellite in the post-capture scenario. In this paper, a novel control method which carries out the motion damping of the spinning target in the post-capture phase in an energy-efficient way is presented, thus enhancing the system useful life. The control method is also able to identify the main inertial parameters of the target satellite during the post-capture motion. Moreover, a new mechatronic system to dampen and reduce the effects of the impact between the robotic arm and the target satellite is developed, using compliant joints and backlash which can be activated/deactivated during the impact. Both the aforementioned systems are tested and demonstrated by means of dynamic simulations for evaluating their performance. Several test cases with different spin of the target are considered in order to simulate real space robotic operations scenarios. Finally, a real prototype has been developed and tested in laboratory in a simulated microgravity test facility in order to experimentally validate the proposed concepts.",,,2-s2.0-85016482468

The upper limb, and especially the hand, are important for a person’s ability to complete activities of daily living. Traditional therapy methods focus on motor recovery, but future methods should include sensory recovery and should promote the use of the affected limb(s) at home. In this review, we highlight the current state-of-art robotic devices for the upper limb, and we discuss benefits of including haptic feedback and virtual reality environments during neurorehabilitation. Robotic devices, such as end-effector devices, grounded and ungrounded exoskeletons, have been developed to assist with various functions including individual finger, whole hand, and shoulder movements. Many robots highlighted in this paper are inexpensive and are small enough to be in a patient’s home, or allow for telerehabilitation. Virtual reality creates safe environments for patients to practice motor movements and interactive games improve enjoyment of therapy. Haptic feedback creates more immersive virtual reality, and contributes to the recovery of sensory function.

Space agencies participating in the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) are discussing an international approach for achieving these goals, documented in ISECG's Global Exploration Roadmap (GER). The GER reference scenario reflects a step-wise evolution of critical capabilities from ISS to missions in the lunar vicinity in preparation for the journey of humans to Mars. The GER is driven by high-level objectives with a strong scientific component. In acknowledgement of the prominent scientific stakes in exploration, ISECG agencies have engaged in a coordinated interaction with scientific communities over the course of the last two years and initiated the development of a Science White Paper. This document's content is shaped by the scientific community in an open, transparent process. It addresses the scientific themes of investigations enabled by the GER mission themes, i.e. exploration of the lunar surface, extended duration missions in cis-lunar space and exploration of near-Earth asteroids, and discusses how these investigations feed forward to the horizon goal of human exploration of Mars. Specifically, the document will • ensure international science communities' perspectives inform the future evolution of mission concepts considered in the GER, • communicate overarching science themes and their relevance in the GER destinations, and • identify and highlight the scientific opportunities in early exploration missions as the GER reference architecture matures. A draft version of the Science White Paper has been discussed with international scientists and agency representatives at a dedicated two-day workshop organized by participating ISECG agencies and the COSPAR Panel on Exploration in February 2016 in Paris, with strong support from the European Science Foundation and NASA's Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute. Once mature, the document is expected to be published in the fall of 2016. The authors will provide an overview of Science White Paper development process and the key messages from the paper together with recommendations for the future evolution of the GER.

Computer games became the mostly preferred spare time activity for children of different ages. Several studies found that technology, ranging from computer applications to social robots, can act as a mediator to improve interaction for children with social impairments. The contribution presented is an intermediate step which combines the embodiment with tangible and intuitive interaction that social robots can offer and an affordable and autonomous solution as a computer game. Probogotchi is a way to play an educational computer game, where children have to interact with a toy equipped with sensors connected to a PC. The control architecture is built around an artificial homeostatic system for social agents and is set to simulate pet-like behavior, resulting in a dependency on the user's interactions. As such, affective human-computer interaction is achieved. The homeostatic regulation is an autonomous system that uses input stimuli from a tactile and object identification system to detect certain actions originating from the user. If an action is triggered, it will influence the internal needs that are subsequently translated into an emotional state. This emotional state is communicated back to the user by a virtual model showing the corresponding facial expression. For the evaluation section, a preliminary study using Probogotchi as a bridge for interaction between a child with ASD and his typically developed sibling is for the first time described. Quantitative data and qualitative observations are presented. The paper concludes with a focus on the technical limitations and also on future developments and implications for the clinical use of Probogotchi game for children with autism. © 2016, ASCR Press.

With real-time communication with the Earth impossible, the crew-members will have to work autonomously and depend a lot on technical resources located on board. Architects and psychologists need to work together to make sure good space flight behavioral health, the presence of high levels of personal adjustment, and positive interactions with the social and physical environments. METHODS It is presented in this paper the design concept for the interior space of spacecraft or human accommodation in other planets, with the introduction of the latest developments of virtual reality system and robots to the construction of the future environment. Meanwhile, hinted by the latest developments of psychology, the idea of cognitive behavioral therapy is also introduced in the design and construction process of the environment. Utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a very sophisticated psychological treatment of insomnia, the environment presented in this paper enhances the association of different crew-members and improves their psychological status. Based on the well-established efficacy of group treatment of the aforementioned method, crew-members can reduce the level of tension in this environment. RESULT A designed environment integrating psychosocial aspects with behavioral, technical and environmental issues shows that the design of unit space can be easily extended to the more complex situation. Two measures are conceptualized and assessed: emotional status and subjective physical comfort. Results prove the effect prior to their deployment in space. CONCLUSIONS The spaceflight-analogous environments presented in this paper can be served for future Mars or farther mission design and training. By designing and constructing facilities that are activity oriented, habit-ability is increased thereby decreasing environmental challenges to behavioral health. Furthermore, this paper concludes with suggestions for increasing collaboration between architects and psychologists. These include increased sharing of assumptions and mutual advocacy for potent and sustained involvement in mission planning and execution.

The jump also serves to launch the adult locust into the air in order to initiate flight. Various aspects of this important behavior have been studied extensively, from muscle physiology and biomechanics, to the energy storage systems involved in powering the jump, and more. Less well understood are the mechanisms participating in control of the jump trajectory. Here we utilise video monitoring and careful analysis of experimental directional jumps by adult desert locusts, together with dynamic computer simulation, in order to understand how the locusts control the direction and elevation of the jump, the residual angular velocities resulting from the jump and the timing of flapping-flight initiation. Our study confirms and expands early findings regarding the instrumental role of the initial body position and orientation. Both real-jump video analysis and simulations based on our expanded dynamical model demonstrate that the initial body coordinates of position (relative to the hind-legs ground-contact points) are dominant in predicting the jumps' azimuth and elevation angles. We also report a strong linear correlation between the jumps' pitch-angular- velocity and flight initiation timing, such that head downwards rotations lead to earlier wing opening. In addition to offering important insights into the bio-mechanical principles of locust jumping and flight initiation, the findings from this study will be used in designing future prototypes of a bio-inspired miniature jumping robot that will be employed in animal behaviour studies and environmental monitoring applications. © 2016 Gvirsman et al.","Angular velocity; Biomechanics; Flight initiation; Schistocerca gregaria; Simulation; Trajectory control","adult; animal behavior; biomechanics; body position; computer simulation; environmental monitoring; head; hindlimb; jumping; nonhuman; pitch; robotics; rotation; Schistocerca gregaria; videorecording; wing",2-s2.0-84991325593

However, the contact effect between the gripper and the door handle may produce excessive internal forces to damage mechanical devices because of position errors or the imprecise modelling of the robot and operation environment. To successfully suppress the excessive internal forces and assure the proper posture of the mobile manipulator under holonomic and non-holonomic constraints, a robust adaptive position/force control algorithm was proposed to track the desired posture and force in opening a door to avoid the complexity of compliant mechanism and the unpredictability of the contact stiffness in traditional impedance control. Dynamic simulation studies with MATLAB and RecurDyn were used to verify the dynamic model of the system and obtain the expected positions and forces during door opening. Simulation results and experiments show that the proposed method is robust in modelling errors, joint frictions and environment disturbances and meets the requirement for opening a door with a handle and suppressing excessive internal forces.

The majority of the design work has been completed, and it is projected that the system will have a tool accuracy of 0.167 mm, 0.141 mm, and 0.290 mm in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

However, image feature detectors cannot be easily applied in real-time embedded computing scenarios, such as autonomous robots and vehicles, mainly due to the fact that they are time consuming and require considerable computational resources. For embedded and low power devices, speed and memory efficiency is of main concern, and therefore, there have been several recent attempts to improve this performance gap through dedicated hardware implementations of feature detectors. Thanks to the fine grain massive parallelism and flexibility of software-like methodologies, reconfigurable hardware devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), have become a common choice to speed up computations. In this chapter, a review of hardware implementations of feature detectors using FPGAs targeted to embedded computing scenarios is presented. The necessary background and fundamentals to introduce feature detectors and their mapping to FPGA-based hardware implementations are presented. Then we provide an analysis of some relevant state-of-the-art hardware implementations, which represent current research solutions proposed in this field. The review addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, systems and solutions related to algorithm-to-hardware mapping of image interest point detectors. Our goal is not only to analyze, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability.

The real-time situational awareness of such active systems requires sensed data to be transmitted in the uplink to edge-cloud, processed, and control instructions transmitted in the downlink. Since many of these applications will be mission critical, the most suitable connectivity family will be cellular due to the availability of licensed spectrum able to protect the offered communications service. However, while much focus in the past was on the uplink of machine-type communications, little attention has been paid to the end-to-end reliability, latency, and energy consumption comprising both up and downlinks. To address this gap, in this paper, we focus on the definition, design, and analysis of machine-type multicast service (MtMS). We discuss the different procedures that need to be redesigned for MtMS and we derive the most appropriate design drivers by analyzing different performance indicators, such as scalability, reliability, latency, and energy consumption.

Recovery of recyclables is usually performed by waste pickers, which is highly risky and hazardous for their health. This paper reports the development of a robotic mobile manipulation system for automated sorting of useful recyclables from MSW. The developed robot is equipped with a thermal imaging camera, proximity sensor and a 5-DOF robotic arm. This paper presents an approach for sorting based on automated identification from thermographic images. The developed algorithm extracts keypoint features from the thermographic image and feeds into clustering model to map them into a bag-of-word vectors. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for identifying the recyclable material. We used the developed algorithm to detect three categories of recyclables namely, aluminum can, plastic bottle and tetra pack from given thermographic images.

This research focused on the interface design of a tele-operated crane considering human attention by using markerless augmented reality (AR) technologies. The attention-based interface has been designed with consideration of how the users' attention is divided into three view types: focused views, ambient views, and alert views. To verify the usability of the interface, a user test is conducted in a simulated environment using a robot arm. The results indicate that the interface prevented 57% of collisions possibility. The authors also found that the interface resulted in high levels of user satisfaction. The utility rate of the different view types was found to be correlated with general erection activities.

The automated scanning system elements are a laser line scanner mounted on a robot arm or a probe tip with coordinate measuring machine. A major challenge is determining the kinematic relationship between the elements of an automated laser scanning system that functions as a mechanical linkage in order to obtain a trajectory for scanning a surface. This paper solves the forward kinematic equations to get the validation pose for the elements of the system, derives the equation of component surface considering a spherical component, and uses inverse kinematics to characterize the movement of the entire automated scanning system on the point trajectory. The result is the position and orientation matrix for the laser line scanner beam and its movement on the trajectory in relation to a component surface. This kinematic chain of linkages and the obtained poses of point trajectory on the component surface is a starting point for future work that aims to develop optimal scan paths that can collect “best” point cloud datasets.

It is proposed method for finding the inscribed polyhedrons, based on the reduction of the problem to a nonlinear programming problem, in the article. It describes the basic functional limitations that are used for this task, and program resources to work effectively with the nonlinear programming problems. Described method requires a good initial solution. Solutions of other less accurate algorithms can be taken as a starting point. One of the most common algorithm with such goal is a homothetic bloating of object under different angles and with a center of mass in different points until an intersection with an external polyhedron. A separate chapter is devoted to the description and disadvantages of these methods. The main disadvantage is a locality of decision. As well as the need for iterating of rigidly defined forms of a polyhedron. This methods analogue, based on the nonlinear programming problem, is offered. The proposed method is based on representing any possible movement as composition of a rotation, a translation, and a dilation. Rotation matrix represented by quaternions in the described experiment.

Usage of stationary devices for solving these problems is inappropriately due to complex and variable geometry of control areas. In these cases self-organized systems of moving visual sensors is the best solution. This paper presents a concept of scalable visual sensor network with swarm architecture for multiple object pose estimation and real-time tracking. In this article recent developments of distributed measuring systems were reviewed with consequent investigation of advantages and disadvantages of existing systems, whereupon theoretical principles of design of swarming visual sensor network (SVSN) were declared. To measure object coordinates in the world coordinate system using TV-camera intrinsic (focal length, pixel size, principal point position, distortion) and extrinsic (rotation matrix, translation vector) calibration parameters were needed to be determined. Robust camera calibration was a too resource-intensive task for using moving camera. In this situation position of the camera is usually estimated using a visual mark with known parameters. All measurements were performed in markcentered coordinate systems. In this article a general adaptive algorithm of coordinate conversion of devices with various intrinsic parameters was developed. Various network topologies were reviewed. Minimum error in objet tracking was realized by finding the shortest path between object of tracking and bearing sensor, which set global coordinate system. Weight coefficients were determined by experimental researches of system sensors that are represented in this article.

To fulfil their scientific objectives, all of these missions require an arm with a long reach capable of performing a variety of tasks in stringent environmental conditions, such as low gravity sampling and precise sample handling and insertion. As part of a CREST-2 project supported by the UK Space Agency (UKSA), a consortium of UK companies have co-founded and developed LARAD, a new Lightweight Advanced Robotic Arm Demonstrator to address some of the underlying challenges related both to the design as well as operation of long arms to perform the payload deployment and sample return operations of future missions. The 15kg terrestrial demonstrator is built as a 2m long arm with 6 degrees of freedom. This arm is capable of deploying a payload with a mass up to 6kgs or operating a 4kg end-effector at 2m. It is using cutting edge technologies on both the hardware and software levels. The mechanical structure of the arm has been manufactured using an array of new processes such as optimised 3D printed titanium Additive Layer Manufactured (ALM) joints, Titanium/Silicon carbide metallic composites, and 3D printed harness routing drums. A modular joint design has been produced, featuring three mechanical sizes of joints each with integrated low level communication and motor drive. The electronics, software and sensors used in the joints are common across all sizes, increasing modularity. To achieve precise positioning, very high resolution absolute position sensing is used on-board. The arm uses novel collision avoidance and path-planning strategies combined with classical control loops. The On-board Control System's state machine combines different control strategies/modes (i.e. joint trajectory tracking, direct motor control, autonomous placement) depending on the high level user operation requirements. The high level On Board Computer (OBC) is Robot Operating System (ROS) based, enabling a flexible software approach.

This approach relates the mechanical response of the tissue to the intrinsic micro-structural properties of its constituents, such as collagen. This article summarises some of the work by the Auckland Bioengineering Institute contributing towards the goal of understanding the structure–function relationship of soft membranous tissue. Key aspects of our work are to (1) develop constitutive relations based on quantitative information of tissue structure; and (2) use rich sets of experimental data to aid in accurate and reliable constitutive parameter identification. We first outline several common techniques to quantify tissue structure, such as collagen fibre orientations. A detailed description of an extended-volume imaging system, developed in our laboratory, is then provided along with a few application examples. The gathered imaging data is incorporated into structural constitutive models by means of fitting to mathematical distributions. Based upon the observations made from some imaging studies, a conceptual fibre distribution model is proposed for modelling the collagen network in skin. We then introduce a selection of constitutive models, which have been developed to characterise the mechanical behaviour of soft connective tissues (skin in particular), with particular emphasis on structurally based models. Finite element models, used with appropriate constitutive relations, provide a means of interpreting experimental results. Some of our recent efforts in developing instrumentation to measure the two-dimensional and three-dimensional response of soft tissues are described. This includes a biaxial tensile rig, which is capable of deforming membranes in up to 16 directions, and a force-sensitive micro-robot. We highlight some of the challenges often associated with constitutive parameter identification using commonly used model based fitting approaches. These issues were examined and illustrated in depth by performing controlled studies on silicon gel phantoms, which allowed us to focus our attention solely on the identification problem. Lastly, future directions of applying structurally based models to understanding the biomechanics of soft tissues are discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2016.",,"Abstracting; Collagen; Constitutive models; Finite element method; Histology; Musculoskeletal system; Parameter estimation; Constitutive relations; Function relationships; Identification problem; Mechanical behaviour; Micro-structural properties; Quantitative information; Soft biological tissue; Three-dimensional response; Tissue",2-s2.0-84960205947

Within this field, the primate visual pathway and its hierarchical organization have been extensively studied. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the understanding of observed biological structure and function, have been successfully applied to visual recognition and classification tasks. In addition, implementations on neuromorphic hardware have enabled large-scale networks to run in (or even faster than) real time, making spike-based neural vision processing accessible on mobile robots. Neuromorphic sensors such as silicon retinas are able to feed such mobile systems with real-time visual stimuli. A new set of vision benchmarks for spike-based neural processing are now needed to measure progress quantitatively within this rapidly advancing field. We propose that a large dataset of spike-based visual stimuli is needed to provide meaningful comparisons between different systems, and a corresponding evaluation methodology is also required to measure the performance of SNN models and their hardware implementations. In this paper we first propose an initial NE (Neuromorphic Engineering) dataset based on standard computer vision benchmarksand that uses digits from the MNIST database. This dataset is compatible with the state of current research on spike-based image recognition. The corresponding spike trains are produced using a range of techniques: rate-based Poisson spike generation, rank order encoding, and recorded output from a silicon retina with both flashing and oscillating input stimuli. In addition, a complementary evaluation methodology is presented to assess both model-level and hardware-level performance. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the dataset and the evaluation methodology using two SNN models to validate the performance of the models and their hardware implementations.

A completely new business model with reference to Industrie4.0 and facilitated by 3D Experience Software in today's networked society in which customers expect immediate responses, delightful experience and simple solutions is one of the mission scenarios in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory at ESB Business School (Reutlingen University). The business experience platform provides software solutions for every organization in the company respectively in the factory. An interface with dashboards, project management apps, 3D - design and construction apps with high end visualization, manufacturing and simulation apps as well as intelligence and social network apps in a collaborative interactive environment help the user to learn the creation of a value end to end process for a personalized virtual and later real produced product. Instead of traditional ways of working and a conventional operating factory real workers and robots work semi-intuitive together. Centerpiece in the self-planned interim factory is the smart personalized product, uniquely identifiable and locatable at all times during the production process - a scooter with an individual colored mobile phone - holder for any smart phone produced with a 3D printer in lot size one. Smart products have in the future solutions incorporated internet based services - designed and manufactured - at the costs of mass products. Additionally the scooter is equipped with a retrievable declarative product memory. Monitoring and control is handled by sensor tags and a raspberry positioned on the product. The engineering design and implementation of a changeable production system is guided by a self-execution system that independently find amongst others esplanade workplaces. The imparted competences to students and professionals are project management method SCRUM, customization of workflows by Industrie4.0 principles, the enhancements of products with new personalized intelligent parts, electrical and electronic self-programmed components and the control of access of the product memory information, to plan in a digital engineering environment and set up of the physical factory to produce customer orders.

"Hexmoor H.","Argumentation for collaboration among Internet of Things",2016,"Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems, CTS 2016",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016980403&doi=10.1109%2fCTS.2016.84&partnerID=40&md5=8a2d26f58e9c4ad9991d3122da67dfc2","Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are algorithmically controlled mechanisms involving networked devices [1]. Whereas physical components of CPS (e.g., robots sand devices) are tangible, embodied, and occupy physical space, cyber components are largely disembodied, intangible, and location-independent. As such, internet of things (IoT) are a subset of CPS. In sharp contrast to the passive view for entities of things as objects, agent inhabitants of IoT are active and may take action proactively. In this perspective, things are enlivened with agent overlays that take advantage of smart sensors and provide intended decision making capacities for things. Numerous suggestions posit that things in physical proximity form social ties creating collaboration networks. Minimally, things provide profiles that include goods and services relevant to other things. We are focusing on interactions among people and things that lead to creation of trust, delegation, role arbitration, and thus collaboration. Nodes may perceive a level of social capital as experience prior and expected future beneficial interactions. Much needs to be developed to exploit the spectrum of sociality. We have used crowd evacuation as an illustrating case study and an exemplar for other scenarios. In the burgeoning era of cyber physical systems, it is essential that embedded IoT nodes work together on matters of common interest and using automated argumentation reach agreements or at least commonly identify the strongest position on consequential topics. For instance, a driverless car must determine the best course of action when confronted with unavoidable collision [2]. Legal considerations as well as ethical resolutions will remain outside current proposed work. However, future explorations may bring them into our focus. We define machine to machine social argumentation as negotiation that include but goes beyond argumentation when individuals are in a socially connected network as in [3]. Settings where humans and things form collaborative teams are fascinating but remain outside our current scope. Instead, we target machine to machine argumentation as in the case of vehicle to vehicle networks. There have been attempts to form autonomous robotic ad hoc coalitions; e.g., [4]. Similarly, IoT nodes that monitor health status of occupants in a building must agree on the safest building location for people to congregate. This is crucial for all types of disaster from weather concerns to the active shooter incidents. Argumentation is the process in which agents exchange and evaluate interacting and inevitably conflicting arguments. It is a form of dialog during which beliefs, understanding and opinions are presented, explained, compared, and defended. The arguments are the basis for inferences, negotiations, conflict resolution, and conclusions drawn by logical reasoning. Argumentation is one of the oldest research foci and one of the most enduring ones in Artificial Intelligence [5] [6] and in parallel in Philosophy, first reported in 7] and most recently in [8]. Automated Argumentation has been adapted to many domains including computational law and multi-agent negotiations [9]. The most vigorous and prolific argumentation research has been conducted with Argugrid (www.argugrid.eu), which is a grid based research consortium funded by the European Union and directed by Dr. Francesca Toni of Imperial College in London, United Kingdom. Whereas social abstract argumentation [3] facilitate online argumentation among human social media participants as can be found on Facebook, we aim to facilitate social argumentation chiefly among machines. Numerous suggestions posit that things in physical proximity form social links creating social networks. Minimally, things provide profiles that include goods and services relevant to other things [10]. For effective interaction with human peers and other animals, things need to be equipped with biological sensors (i.e., biosensors) so that their corresponding agents would ascertain conditions of their bio-organism cohabitants. For example, graphene nano-sensors are available for passive sensing of bacteria. Other typical passive biosensor exemplars are motion and vibration sensors, thermometers, audio and visual sensors, touch and tensile sensors, barometric pressure sensors, and a variety of chemical sensors. By fusing sensory information, a thing may determine bio-organism presence including humans at given radii from it. Agents controlling things can use biosensors as proximity sensors and behave in socially meaningful ways. Once agents inhabiting things perceive bio-presence, they may perceive and initiate as well as expect reciprocal sociality. Reciprocally, humans may perceive electro-mechanical things by sensing energy and wireless networking measures. In the context of smart IoT devices, the first task is identification of arguments generated by their corresponding agent. Each agent is designed to receive sensory data and perform problem solving that produces an output, which might be a mere perception or an action to perform. The problem solving module shown in Figure 1 is an expert system that encapsulates agent problem solving. Agents will fuse one or more sensory data for determining an input for reasoning. The expert system will include design and a model current applicable conditions. A periodically generated argument is a pair of sensed data and an output encapsulated as an atomic abstract argument that will be cast to compete with other arguments in the system argument pool, (Figure Presented). © 2016 IEEE.","Agent problem solving; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Expert system; Internet of Things (IoT); Machine to machine argumentation","Atmospheric pressure; Behavioral research; Biosensors; Cyber Physical System; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Expert systems; Internet of things; Machine-to-machine communication; Multi agent systems; Nanosensors; Sensory perception; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Visual servoing; Abstract argumentation; Applicable conditions; Collaboration network; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Effective interactions; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine to machines; Multiagent negotiation; Problem solving",2-s2.0-85016980403

Attention control is one of the best ways to reduce the complexity of sensory data, whereas in nowadays, we face with various types of sensors and actuators that all of them need to be managed through specific algorithms. Also, most of these sensory data is not usable in raw form, and some may need to be preprocessed for extraction of reliable and practical information. Most researches in this field are about presenting a model for more efficient use of sensory data in specific situations. So, these approaches don't control the hardware directly. Whiles by controlling sensors and actuators directly through attention model, we have increased the accuracy of sensory data, improved the accessibility to actuators and reduced the power consumption of whole system. In this research, we focused on a low-level attention control algorithm to adapt DCM layer with higher-level attention controllers. In this research, we present a top-down attention model based on incoming requests for each device form higher level algorithms and adapt each module's update frequency according to amount of attention on it. This model is inspired by simple sale forecasting techniques in economics like Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and some intuitive constraints to predict user's request rate in future and adapt each module's update frequency.

Hence, a whole-body control approach for future humanoid robots in (partially) unknown environments needs to take contact sensing into account, e.g., by means of artificial skin. However, translating contacts from skin measurements into physically well-understood quantities can be problematic as the exact position and strength of the contact needs to be converted into torques. In this paper, we suggest an alternative approach that directly learns the mapping from both skin and the joint state to torques. We propose to learn such an inverse dynamics models with contacts using a mixture-of-contacts approach that exploits the linear superimposition of contact forces. The learned model can, making use of uncalibrated tactile sensors, accurately predict the torques needed to compensate for the contact. As a result, tracking of trajectories with obstacles and tactile contact can be executed more accurately.

Second, the measurements of the Wi-Fi receiver and the multi-PTS cameras can be used for building a radio map and a gird-based map. Last, the localization method consisting of a fingerprint and a particle filter algorithms can find the broad and the exact positions of the robot sequentially by matching the real-time measurements of sensors and the maps.

In this background, synchronized bilateral teleoperation (SBT) was previously proposed that highly performs to reproduce an impedance of an environment in a master system. On the other hand, the control system requires large operational force in order to realize stable contact motion, especially to high stiffness environment. In this paper, the trade-off is overcome by using the equivalent plant model of the control system. The plant model realizes to calculate the future value of the system's position and velocity responses.

Cardiac ablation is routinely performed to treat Atrial Fibrillation, and requires a catheter be accurately positioned in the heart, by hand or by a robot, under feedback control. This is typically a slow process and methods to reduce procedure times are needed. To investigate our proposed method, a robotic system to manipulate a standard intracardiac catheter was constructed. To safely develop our proposed learning system, a comprehensive dataset was collected using a magnetic tracking system to measure the catheter tip positions versus robot actuator positions. Initially, the robot began with no model of its kinematics. A Genetic Algorithm was used to decide on the next actuator sequence that would reduce the uncertainty in a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) based inverse kinematic model. An automated iterative process was followed where the robot would perform virtual experiments, to grow its knowledge of its inverse kinematics. After 791 learning cycles the final analysis revealed that the complete inverse kinematic relationship has been explored with the given constraints. A validation dataset indicated the learned FFNN model was able to predict x, y and z positions of the catheter tip to within ±0.17 mm, ±0.73 mm and ±0.62 mm, respectively. The robot successfully self-learned its inverse kinematic model using the proposed methodology.

We formulate this problem as multi-robot belief space planning, where the belief represents the probability distribution of robot states from the entire group, as well as the mapped environment thus far. Our approach is capable of guiding each robot to reduce its uncertainty by re-observing areas previously observed (only) by other robots. Direct observations between robot states, such as relative-pose measurements, are not required, providing enhanced flexibility for the group as the robots do not have to coordinate rendezvous with each other. Instead, our framework supports indirect constraints between the robots, that are induced by mutual observations of the same area possibly at different time instances, and accounts for these future multi-robot constraints within the planning phase.

Adaptation, i. e. learning of a modified behavior, needs to be fast to enable quick utilization of the robot either in industry or in future household-assistant tasks. In this paper we show how to accelerate trajectory adaptation based on learning of coupling terms in the framework of dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). Our method applies ideas from feedback error learning to iterative learning control (ILC). By taking into account the actual physical constraints of the synchronous motion - through synchronization of both positions (or forces) and velocities - it is not only a more faithful representation of actual real-world processes, but it also accelerates the speed of convergence. To show the applicability of the approach in the framework of DMPs, we tested it on a formulation which encodes an initial discrete motion, followed by a periodic behavior, all in a single system. Modifications of the original discrete-periodic formulation now also allow for the use of DMP temporal scaling property. In the paper we also show how the DMP coupling can be implemented in joint space, whereas the measured forces and previous approaches always remained in the task space. We applied our approach to an example dual-arm synchronization task on Sarcos humanoid robot CB-i. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Anthropomorphic robots; Iterative methods; Robots; Synchronization; Two term control systems; Dynamic movement primitives; Feedback error learning; Iterative learning control; Movement primitives; Physical constraints; Speed of convergence; Synchronization task; Synchronous motion; Intelligent robots",2-s2.0-84958180604

However, excessive and premature robot assistance may deteriorate the user's physical abilities and can accelerate their aging process. The authors have already proposed a personal robot that can follow the user, even on uneven road surfaces. Therefore, people utilizing this personal robot do not need to carry heavy baggage, even after shopping. It is reported that a few brisk walks per week can be advantageous to our health management and can improve our quality of life, so this means that the personal robot can encourage the user to maintain an active lifestyle. For this personal robot, close following is required to ensure the safety of the baggage and the personal robot. However, it is difficult for the conventional approach to avoid collisions when the user stops suddenly. In this paper, a control approach based on model predictive control is proposed to achieve two conflicting requirements: close following and no collision. The proposed approach predicts multiple future outcomes, in which the user either stops or accelerates in the next step, in order to realize an appropriate relative distance and to consider the upper and lower boundaries for posture stabilization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach can be verified in numerical simulations using a multibody dynamics model consisting of actual 3D representations. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Model predictive control; Robots; 3d representations; Active lifestyles; Control approach; Conventional approach; Health management; Multibody dynamics model; Posture stabilization; Relative distances; Intelligent robots",2-s2.0-84958173587

There are many motion planning problems, including flight coordination and autonomous vehicles, that require an algorithm to predict obstacle motion and plan safely. In this paper, we propose Stochastic Ensemble Simulation (SES)-based planning, a novel framework to efficiently predict and produce safe trajectories in the presence of stochastic obstacles. The stochastic obstacles can be introduced in several ways including stochastic motion or position/speed uncertainty. SES-based planning works by first predicting an obstacle's future position offline through an ensemble of Monte Carlo simulations. These runs simulate the stochastic obstacle dynamics and store the simulation results in temporal snapshots of predicted positions. An online planner then uses this output to identify a predicted collision-free direct path to the goal. If the direct path is not expected to be collision-free, a more expensive tree-based planner is used. Our experiments show SES-based planning outperforms other methods that have high planning success in environments with 900 stochastically moving obstacles. Furthermore, our method plans trajectories with an 80% success rate for a 7 DOF robot in an environment with 250 stochastic moving obstacles and 50 obstacles with speed/position uncertainty.

Imaging sonar or forward looking sonar (FLS) is commonly used for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. An FLS provides bearing and range information to a target, but the elevation of the target is unknown within the sensor's field of view. Hence, current state-of-the-art techniques commonly make a flat surface (ground) assumption so that the FLS data can be used for navigation. Unlike other methods, our solution does not require a flat surface assumption and is capable of utilizing information from many frames, as opposed to pairwise methods that can only gather information from two frames at once. ASFM is inspired by structure from motion (SFM), the problem of recovering 3D structure from multiple camera images, while also recovering the position and orientation from which the images were taken. In this paper, we formulate and evaluate the optimization of several AUV sensor readings of the same scene from different poses, the sonar equivalent of bundle adjustment. We evaluate our approach on both simulated data and FLS sonar data with the assumption that feature extraction and data association have been completed. The acoustic equivalents of those two important features of SFM are left for future work. © 2015 IEEE.","Cameras; Optical imaging; Sonar measurements; Sonar navigation; Three-dimensional displays","Autonomous underwater vehicles; Cameras; Feature extraction; Intelligent robots; Motion analysis; Navigation; Recovery; Robots; Sonar; Underwater imaging; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV); Forward looking sonars; Optical imaging; Position and orientations; Sonar measurements; Sonar navigation; State-of-the-art techniques; Three-dimensional display; Underwater acoustics",2-s2.0-84958174876

For a given environment with a history of previous target trajectories, the goal is to establish a probabilistic framework to predict the future trajectory of currently observed targets based on their recent moves. Instead of clustering trajectories into groups, we calculate the similarity between a given test trajectory and the set of all past trajectories in a dataset. Next, we use a weighted mechanism for prediction, that can be used in target tracking and collision avoidance applications. The proposed method is compared with two other commonly used similarity models (PCA and LCSS) over a dataset of simulated trajectories, and two datasets of real observations. Results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing models for those datasets and experimental settings. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Forecasting; Intelligent robots; Statistical tests; Statistics; Target tracking; Kernel Density Estimation; Probabilistic framework; Similarity models; Simulated trajectories; Target trajectory; Trajectories",2-s2.0-84958154872

By applying a mirror transformation to the intruder's current state, a pursuit policy can be formed that always places the defender between the intruder and the asset. To apply these strategies to delayed or imperfect information environments, we present a model-predictive method of calculating defender motion goals and estimating future intruder motions.

In cardiovascular procedures interventionalists turn towards catheter-based interventions, treating patients considered unfit for classical more invasive approaches. Improvements in design and steerability of catheters could further reduce the invasiveness of these interventions. For example, by improving controllability and interaction forces with the vessels, tissue damage could be limited. Through improved steerability and coordinated control, operation times and exposure to radiation might also be reduced. Latter argument formed the original motivation for the development of teleoperated robotic catheters. Despite the large kinematic dissimilarity and thus non-trivial mapping between joystick input and catheter output motion, few investigations have been conducted to find intuitive mappings that allow straightforward catheter steering. This paper presents some recent work in this direction. Three promising mappings are proposed. The mappings were implemented and validated upon a robotic catheter moving inside an artificial aorta model. Experimental results show good steerability of the robotic catheter for all the mappings. Although superiority of one mapping with respect to the others was observed, further investigation and validation is planned. In the future, additional visual cues that increase the situational awareness of the user are expected to further simplify the steering. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Catheters; Mapping; Patient treatment; Robotic surgery; Robotics; Surgery; Active catheter; Co-ordinated control; Endovascular surgery; Interaction forces; Joystick inputs; Medical intervention; Situational awareness; Surgical instrumentation; Intelligent robots",2-s2.0-84958168614

Nonlinear springs (NLSs) potentially incorporate the benefits of both soft and stiff springs, but such springs are often large. An NLS design was recently proposed that combines a variable radius cam with a rubber elastic element, enabling a compact spring design. However, the rubber introduces hysteresis, which can lead to poor torque tracking if not accounted for in the controller. To overcome this limitation, we here propose a state observer that captures hysteretic effects exhibited by the rubber to provide an accurate estimate of actuator torque. We perform torque-control experiments with this observer on an actuator testbed and compare the performance of the NLS to both soft and stiff linear metal springs. Experiments show that the NLS exhibits improved output impedance compared to both linear springs, and comparable bandwidth to the stiff linear spring up to 1.5 Hz. However, the hysteresis in the urethane rubber introduces instability in higher-frequency conditions, suggesting that future NLS designs can be improved by use of a different rubber as the elastic element. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Actuators; Bandwidth; Design; Elasticity; Hysteresis; Intelligent robots; Rubber; Torque; Actuator torques; Control experiments; Higher frequencies; Hysteretic effects; Non-linear springs; Output impedance; Series elastic actuators; System bandwidth; Rubber products",2-s2.0-84958213020

We propose an experiential learning method for robots to build their experience online and to transfer knowledge among appropriate contexts. Experience gained through learning is used as a guide to future decisions of the robot for both efficiency and robustness. We use Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) learning paradigm to frame hypotheses represented in first-order logic that are useful for further reasoning and planning processes. Furthermore, incorporation of background knowledge is also possible to generalize the framed hypotheses. Partially specified world states can also be easily represented by these hypotheses. All these advantages of ILP make this approach superior to the other supervised learning methods. We have analyzed the performance of the learning method on our autonomous mobile robot and on our robot arm both building their experience on action executions online. It has been observed in both domains that our experience-based learning and learning-based guidance methods frame sound hypotheses that are useful for constraining and guiding the future tasks of the robots. This learning paradigm is promising especially for the contexts where abstraction is useful for efficient transfer of knowledge. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Action execution monitoring; Experiential learning in robots; Failure contexts; Learning from experience; Planning and plan execution; Real-world experimentation; Robot learning","Formal logic; Inductive logic programming (ILP); Knowledge management; Learning systems; Robot learning; Robots; Social networking (online); Action execution; Experiential learning; Learning from experiences; Plan execution; Real-world; Robot programming",2-s2.0-84944513994

In the factory of the future, it is necessary to rapidly reprogram flexible mobile manipulators to perform new tasks, when the need arises, for which a working system capable of TbD would be ideal. Contrary to current TbD approaches, that generally aim to recognize both action and where it is applied, we propose a division of labor, where the operator manually specifies the action the robot should perform, while gestures are used for specifying the relevant action parameter (e.g. on which object to apply the action). Using this two-step method has the advantages that there is no uncertainty of which action the robot will perform, it takes into account that the environment changes, so objects do not need to be at predefined locations, and the parameter specification is possible even for inexperienced users. Experiments with 24 people in 3 different environments verify that it is indeed intuitive, even for a robotics novice, to program a mobile manipulator using this method. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Gesture recognition; Industrial robots; Robot skills; Teaching by demonstration","Gesture recognition; Industrial research; Industrial robots; Robot programming; Robots; Division of labor; Environment change; Industrial use case; Mobile manipulator; Parameter specification; Robot skills; Teaching by demonstration; Two step method; Manipulators",2-s2.0-84953348846

The present systematic review was conducted to assess the available evidence on robotic-assisted HCR and explore the potential advantages and disadvantages it proposes. Methods: A comprehensive search from six electronic databases was performed for studies reporting outcomes for robotic-assisted hybrid coronary revascularisation. Eight studies were identified from six electronic databases amenable for qualitative assessment and pooled quantitative analysis. Results: There were no in-hospital deaths reported. Pooled myocardial infarction rates was 1.2% (range 0-3.7%), pooled strokes was 0.8% (range: 0-1.7%), freedom from reintervention was 92.5% (range 70.4-100%), and freedom from angina was 92.9% (range 74.3-100%).

However, there can be imprecision due to segment-to-segment variation in the soft structure, variation in actuator response to loads, or nonlinearities not compensated for in control. Here, our objective is to demonstrate how body softness with respect to frictional loads determines a tolerance for the controlled coordination of worm-like segments. To explore this, our new soft robot, compliant modular mesh worm, utilizes compliant mesh segments that are individually actuated with different waveforms that result in peristaltic locomotion. The modular mesh is constructed from 3D printed and commercially available parts, allowing for the testing of a variety of components that can be easily interchanged to vary stiffness. A series of experiments were performed to characterize the actuated mesh and the behavior of segment contact points during locomotion. In our robot, video analysis shows slip along the ground that is explained by sources of imprecision that are greater than tolerances specified by friction and compliance. The six-segment robot is faster on surfaces with greater friction (where slip is minimized) and can advance at 25.8 cm/min on a plywood surface. The data presented highlight the importance of lifting advancing segments off the ground and the role of sources of imprecision in the control of segment length.

In this study, the authors present a novel robot-assisted 3DUS system for real-time planning and guidance of breast interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment. Methods: For this work, a new computer controlled robotic 3DUS system was built to perform a hybrid motion scan, which is a combination of a 6 cm linear translation with a 30°rotation at both ends. The new 3DUS scanner was designed to fit on a modified Kuske assembly, keeping the current template grid configuration but modifying the frame to allow the mounting of the 3DUS system at several positions. A finer grid was also tested. A user interface was developed to perform image reconstruction, semiautomatic segmentation of the surgical bed as well as catheter reconstruction and tracking. A 3D string phantom was used to validate the geometric accuracy of the reconstruction. The volumetric accuracy of the system was validated with phantoms using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) images. In order to accurately determine whether 3DUS can effectively replace CT for treatment planning, the authors have compared the 3DUS catheter reconstruction to the one obtained from CT images. In addition, in agarose-based phantoms, an end-to-end procedure was performed by executing six independent complete procedures with both 14 and 16 catheters, and for both standard and finer Kuske grids. Finally, in phantoms, five end-to-end procedures were performed with the final CT planning for the validation of 3DUS preplanning. Results: The 3DUS acquisition time is approximately 10 s. A paired Student t-test showed that there was no statistical significant difference between known and measured values of string separations in each direction. Both MRI and CT volume measurements were not statistically different from 3DUS volume (Student t-test: p > 0.05) and they were significantly correlated to 3DUS measurement (Pearson test: MRI p < 0.05 and CT p < 0.001). The mean angular separation distance between catheter trajectories segmented from 3DUS and CT images was 0.42°±0.24°, while the maximum and mean trajectory separations were 0.51±0.19 and 0.37 ±0.17 mm, respectively. Overall, the new finer grid has performed significantly better in terms of dosimetric indices. The planning target volume dosimetric indices were not found statistically different between 3DUS and CT planning (Student t-test, p > 0.05). Both the skin and the pectoral muscle dosimetric indices were within ABS guidelines. Conclusions: A novel robot-assisted 3DUS system was designed and validated. To their knowledge, this is the first system capable of performing real-time guidance and planning of breast multicatheter HDR brachytherapy treatments. Future investigation will test the feasibility of using the system in the clinic and for permanent breast brachytherapy. © 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","3D ultrasound; breast; HDR brachytherapy","Article; brachytherapy; computer assisted tomography; echograph; echography; equipment design; high dose rate brachytherapy; image reconstruction; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pectoral muscle; skin; three dimensional ultrasound; treatment planning; ultrasound transducer; algorithm; brachytherapy; breast; Breast Neoplasms; devices; echography; echomammography; feasibility study; human; imaging phantom; mammography; procedures; radiation response; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; robotics; skeletal muscle; three dimensional imaging; validation study; sepharose; Algorithms; Brachytherapy; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mammography; Muscle, Skeletal; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Robotics; Sepharose; Skin; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ultrasonography, Mammary",2-s2.0-84946924712

However, the constraints imposed by the access modality and the limited available technology make NOTES very challenging for surgeons. Tools redesign and introduction of novel surgical instruments are imperative in order to make NOTES operative in a real surgical scenario, reproducible and reliable. Robotic technology has major potential to overcome current limitations. Methods: The robotic platform described here consists of a magnetic anchoring frame equipped with dedicated docking/undocking mechanisms to house up to three modular robots for surgical interventions. The magnetic anchoring frame guarantees the required stability for surgical tasks execution, whilst dedicated modular robots provide the platform with adequate vision, stability and manipulation capabilities. Results: Platform potentialities were demonstrated in a porcine model. Assessment was organized into two consecutive experimental steps, with a hybrid testing modality. First, platform deployment, anchoring and assembly through transoral–transgastric access were demonstrated in order to assess protocol feasibility and guarantee the safe achievement of the following experimental session. Second, transabdominal deployment, anchoring, assembly and robotic module actuation were carried out. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated the feasibility of inserting an endoluminal robotic platform composed of an anchoring frame and modular robotic units into a porcine model through a natural orifice. Once inserted into the peritoneal cavity, the platform provides proper visualization from multiple orientations. For the first time, a platform with interchangeable modules has been deployed and its components have been connected, demonstrating in vivo the feasibility of intra-abdominal assembly.

We report our initial experience with SLN mapping algorithm, and examine the factors predicting successful SLN mapping. Methods We analyzed all data recorded in our institute on robotic blue-dye SLN detection mapping from the time it was first introduced to our department in January 2012-December 2014. Data included patient demographics, SLN allocation, operating room times, and pathology results. Results During the study period, 74 patients had robotic assisted surgery for endometrial cancer with attempted SLN mapping. SLN was found overall in 46 patients (62.1%). At first, SLN was detected in only 50% of cases, but after performing 30 cases, detection rates rose to 84.6% (OR = 3.34, CI 1.28-8.71; p = 0.003). Univariate analysis showed a higher detection rate with methylene blue than patent blue dye, 74.3% vs. 52.3% (OR = 2.744, 95% CI 1.026-7.344; p = 0.042). In multivariate analysis, high body mass index (BMI) was associated with failed mapping (OR = 0.899; 95% CI 0.808-1.00), as was the presence of lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI) (OR = 0.126; 95% CI 0.24-0.658) and few cases per surgeon (OR = 1.083, 95% CI 1.032-1.118). Factors related to uterine pathology itself, including tumor histology, grade, method of diagnosis, the presence of an endometrial polyp, and lower uterine segment involvement were not found to be associated with successful mapping.

The study findings indicated that the robotics summer camp was different from regular science classrooms in terms of goals, practical work, and social structure. The robotics summer camp provided students with the opportunity to engage in robotics activities and have personal interactions with engineering researchers about engineering and their future career plans. The robot design experience and close relationships with engineering professionals at the camp were sources that nurtured and maintained student interest in engineering.

The sensor nodes’ mobility can easily cause changes to the structure of a network topology, and lead to the decline in the amount of transmitted data, excessive energy consumption, and lack of security. To solve these problems, a kind of efficient Topology Control algorithm for node Mobility (TCM) is proposed. In the topology construction stage, an efficient clustering algorithm is adopted, which supports sensor node movement. It can ensure the balance of clustering, and reduce the energy consumption. In the topology maintenance stage, the digital signature authentication based on Error Correction Code (ECC) and the communication mechanism of soft handover are adopted. After verifying the legal identity of the mobile nodes, secure communications can be established, and this can increase the amount of data transmitted.

It is argued that SDI will be a first concrete impact of the Softwarization trend which is starting to impact (with different expressions, e.g., SDN, NFV, Cloud and Network Computing) the Telecommunications and ICT ecosystems.In this respect, the paper proposes the model of the Universal Operating System (UOS) for SDIs as an overarching and distributed Operating System spanning from terminals through the network elements, to the Cloud/IT resources.

Conventional coalition formation architectures seek to compute efficient robot coalitions by leveraging either a single greedy, approximation, or market-based algorithm, which renders such architectures inapplicable to a variety of real-world mission scenarios. A novel, intelligent multi-criteria decision making framework is presented that reasons over a library of coalition formation algorithms for selecting the most appropriate subset of algorithm(s) to apply to a wide spectrum of complex missions. The framework is based on influence diagrams in order to handle uncertainties in dynamic real-world environments. An existing taxonomy comprised of multiple mission and domain dependent features is leveraged to classify the coalition formation algorithms. Dimensionality reduction is achieved via principal component analysis, which extracts the most significant taxonomy features crucial for decision making. A link analysis technique provides the mission specific utility values of each feature-value pair and algorithm in the library.

Recovery of sensorimotor function following stroke can vary widely, from complete recovery to modest or minimal improvements, across individuals. An important question is whether one can predict the amount of recovery based on initial examination of the individual. Robotic technologies are now being used to quantify a range of behavioral capabilities of individuals post-stroke, providing a rich set of biomarkers of sensory and motor dysfunction. The objective of the present study is to use mathematical models to identify which biomarkers best predict the ability of subjects with stroke to perform daily activities before and after rehabilitation. Methods: The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) was quantified approximately 2 weeks and three months post-stroke in 61 ischemic and 24 hemorrhagic subjects with stroke. At 2 weeks post-stroke, subjects also completed clinical assessments and robotic assessments of sensory and motor function. A computational search algorithm, known as Fast Orthogonal Search, was used to identify the robotic and clinical biomarkers that best estimated Functional Independence Measures. Results: Clinical and robot-based biomarkers were statistically similar at predicting FIM scores at 2 weeks (r = 0.817 vs. 0.774, respectively) and 3 months (r = 0.643 vs. 0.685, respectively). Importantly, robot-based biomarkers highlighted that parameters related to proprioception were influential for predicting FIM scores at 2 weeks, whereas biomarkers related to bimanual motor function were influential for predicting FIM scores at 3 months. Conclusions: The present study provides a proof of principle on the use of robot-based biomarkers of sensory and motor dysfunction to estimate present and future FIM scores. The addition of other behavioral tasks will likely increase the accuracy of these predictions, and potentially help guide rehabilitation strategies to maximize functional recovery. © 2015 Mostafavi et al.","Prognosis; Proprioception; Robotic assessment; Stroke; Stroke assessment; Upper limb","adult; aged; arm movement; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; daily life activity; female; functional assessment; Functional Independence Measure; human; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; motor performance; priority journal; proprioception; robotic exoskeleton; convalescence; procedures; robotics; stroke rehabilitation; theoretical model; very elderly; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Proprioception; Recovery of Function; Robotics; Stroke Rehabilitation",2-s2.0-84948404136

In these architectures, the emotional processes decide which behaviors the robot must activate to fulfill the objectives. The number of emotional processes increases with the complexity level of the application, limiting the processing capacity of the control processor to solve complex problems. Fortunately, the potential parallelism of emotional processes permits their execution in parallel. In this paper, different alternatives are used to exploit the parallelism of the emotional processes. On the one hand, we take advantage of the multiple cores and single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions sets already available on modern microprocessors. On the other hand, we also consider using a GPU. Different number of cores with and without enabling SIMD instructions and a GPU-based implementation are compared to analyze their suitability to cope with robotic applications. The applications are set-up taking into account different conditions and states of the robot. Experimental results show that the single processor can undertake most of the simple problems at a speed of 1 m/s. For a speed of 2 m/s, a 8-core processor permits solving most of the problems.

In this paper, we present a study on how cultural backgrounds can influence the perception and intention to use a robot as an instrument in the future practice. The study involved 37 Italian students and 37 UK students, as future professionals in the field of psychology, which experienced the actual capabilities of a humanoid robot through a live demo. In this work, we explored the main factors of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with the aim to reveal cultural differences. The instrument used was the UTAUT questionnaire, which was designed and validated to investigate the robot acceptance and use. A significant difference on the intention to use the robot is reported in our results.

You and we are morally competent in no small part because you know what you ought to do, and we know what we ought to do. A mouse, in contrast, cannot say to itself: 'I ought to share this cheese, even if my brother refuses to do so.' But can robots be self-conscious? Approaching this question from the standpoint of so-called Psychometric AI, we note that prior work by Govindarajulu and Bringsjord led to the engineering of a robot (Cogito) able to provably pass the famous mirror test of self-consciousness. But a more challenging test for robot self-consciousness has been provided by Floridi; this test is an ingenious and much-harder variant of the well-known-in-AI wise-man puzzle: Each of three robots is given one pill from a group of five, three of which are innocuous, but two of which, when taken, immediately render the recipient dumb. In point of fact, two robots (R1 and R2) are given potent pills, but R3 receives one of the three placebos. The human tester says: 'Which pill did you receive? No answer is correct unless accompanied by a proof!' Given a formal regimentation of this test previously formulated by Bringsjord, it can be proved that, in theory, a future robot represented by R3 can answer provably correctly (which for plausible reasons, explained by Floridi, entails that R3 has satisfied some of the structural requirements for self-consciousness). In this paper we explain and demonstrate the engineering that now makes this theoretical possibility actual, both in the simulator known as 'PAGI World' (used for testing AIs), and in real (= physical) robots interacting with a human tester. These demonstrations involve scenarios that demand the passing of Floridi's test for self-consciousness, where for us, passing such a test is required for an agent to be regarded morally competent. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Optical testing; Pelletizing; Human tests; Real robot; Structural requirements; Robots",2-s2.0-84954059811

The robot partner calculates its emotional state based on the utterance sentence of the human. Then, the robot partner can control its utterance sentence based on the emotional parameters. As a results, the robot partner can interact with human emotionally naturally. In this paper, we explain the three parts of the conversation system's structure. The first part is time dependent selection based on the database contents. In this mode, the robot tells timely important contents, for example schedules. The mood parameter is used to change the sentence in this mode. The second component is utterance flow learning to select the utterance contents. The robot selects utterance sentence based on the utterance flow information and using its mood value as well. The third component is sentence building based on predefined rules. The rules include personality model of the robot partner. In this paper, we use emotional parameters based on the human sentences to make a natural communication system. Finally, we show experimental results of the proposed method, and conclude the paper.

According to these recent studies, facial expressions do not possess discrete emotional meanings; rather the meaning depends on the social situation of how and when the expressions are used. These research results imply that the emotion expressivity depends on the appropriate combination of context and expression, and not the distinctiveness of the expressions themselves. Therefore, it is inferable that relying on facial expressions may not be essential. Instead, when appropriate pairs of context and expression are applied, emotional internal states perhaps emerge. This paper first discusses how facial expressions of robots limit their head design, and can be hardware costly. Then, the paper proposes a way of expressing context-based emotions as an alternative to facial expressions. The paper introduces the mechanical structure for applying a specific non-facial contextual expression. The expression was originated from Japanese animation, and the mechanism was applied to a real desktop size humanoid robot. Finally, an experiment on whether the contextual expression is capable of linking humanoid motions and its emotional internal states was conducted under a sound-context condition.

Human-human physical interaction during elderly care and in a realistic setting is studied in this work with the aim of using the learned insights to develop corresponding robot interfaces. The contribution of this work is the identification of various types of physical manipulation actions that take place when an elder is assisted in performing activities of daily living in a natural setting. As part of the RoboHelper project, it has been shown that the knowledge of actions involving physical manipulation of objects helps in understanding the spoken language. More specifically, it improves the resolution of third person pronouns/deictic words and the classification of dialogue acts. In this work we show that pressure sensor data can be used to automatically recognize such physical manipulation actions.

This artificial skin can bend and generate thrust when attached to a mechanical controller. The ability to control the manufacture of biomimetic shark skin facilitates manipulation of surface parameters and understanding the effects of changing denticle patterns on locomotion. In this paper we investigate the effect of changing the spacing and arrangement of denticles on the surface of biomimetic shark skin on both static and dynamic locomotor performance. We designed 3D-printed flexible membranes with different denticle patterns and spacings: (1) staggered-overlapped, (2) linear-overlapped, and (3) linear-non-overlapped, and compared these to a 3D-printed smooth-surfaced control. These 3D printed shark skin models were then tested in a flow tank with a mechanical flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically. We swam the membranes at a frequency of 1 Hz with different heave amplitudes (from 1 cm to 3 cm) while measuring forces, torques, self-propelled swimming speed, and cost of transport (COT). Static tests revealed drag reduction of denticle patterns compared to a smooth control at low speeds, but increased drag at speeds above 25 cm s-1. However, during dynamic (swimming) tests, the staggered-overlapped pattern produced the fastest swimming speeds with no significant increase in the COT at lower heave values. For instance, at a heave frequency of 1 Hz and amplitude of 1 cm, swimming speed of the staggered-overlapped pattern increased by 25.2% over the smooth control. At higher heave amplitudes, significantly faster self-propelled swimming speeds were achieved by the staggered-overlapped pattern, but with higher COT. Only the staggered-overlapped pattern provides a significant swimming performance advantage over the smooth control and the other two denticle patterns. Quantitative hydrodynamic comparisons among skin models where control over manufacture allows alteration of design parameters provides a useful experimental tool for future work on the considerable natural diversity of shark skin denticles both among species and on different body locations. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D printing; denticle; hydrodynamics; robot; shark skin","Artificial organs; Biomimetics; Drag; Dynamics; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Manufacture; Rigid structures; Robots; Speed; 3-D printing; denticle; Hydrodynamic functions; Mechanical controllers; Self-propelled swimmings; Shark skins; Stationary positions; Swimming performance; 3D printers",2-s2.0-84951774953

These changes however, have not been completely elucidated by neuroimaging to date, mainly due to the scarcity of long-term, follow-up investigations. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible stepper MARCOS was specifically developed to enable the investigation of the supraspinal adaptations in paretic patients undergoing gait-rehabilitation in a controlled and repeatable manner. In view of future clinical research, the present study aims at examining the test-retest reliability of functional MRI (fMRI) experiments using MARCOS. Methods: The effect of repeated active and passive stepping movements on brain activity was investigated in 16 healthy participants from fMRI data collected in two separate imaging sessions six weeks apart. Root mean square errors (RMSE) were calculated for the metrics of motor performance. Regional overlap of brain activation between sessions, as well as an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed from the single-subject and group activation maps for five regions of interest (ROI). Results: Data from eight participants had to be excluded due to excessive head motion. Reliability of motor performance was higher during passive than active movements, as seen in 4.5- to 13-fold lower RMSE for passive movements. In contrast, ICC ranged from 0.48 to 0.72 during passive movements and from 0.77 to 0.85 during active movements. Regional overlap of activations was also higher during active than during passive movements. Conclusion: These findings imply that an increased variability of motor performance during active movements of healthy participants may be associated with a stable neuronal activation pattern across repeated measurements. In contrast, a stable motor performance during passive movements may be accompanied by a confined reliability of brain activation across repeated measurements. © 2015 Jaeger et al.","Active; Brain activation; fMRI; Gait; Passive; Reliability; Stepping; Test-retest","active movement; adult; Article; controlled study; electroencephalogram; functional magnetic resonance imaging; head movement; human; human experiment; image analysis; magnetic resonance compatible stepper robot; measurement; motor performance; movement (physiology); neuroimaging; passive movement; priority journal; product development; robotics; test retest reliability; aged; artifact; devices; female; male; middle aged; motor activity; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; reproducibility; robotics; Aged; Artifacts; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Reproducibility of Results; Robotics",2-s2.0-84947073169

In this work, the possibility of detecting a sudden obstacle appearance analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is assessed. For this purpose, different features of EEG signals are evaluated during the appearance of sudden obstacles while a subject is walking on a treadmill. The future goal is to use this procedure to detect any obstacle appearance during walking when the user is wearing a lower limb exoskeleton in order to generate an emergency stop command for the exoskeleton. This would enhance the user-exoskeleton interaction, improving the safety mechanisms of current exoskeletons. Methods: In order to detect the change in the brain activity when an obstacle suddenly appears, different features of EEG signals are evaluated using the recordings of five healthy subjects. Since the change in the brain activity occurs in the time domain, the features evaluated are: common spatial patterns, average power, slope, and the coefficients of a polynomial fit. A Linear Discriminant Analysis-based classifier is used to differentiate between two conditions: the appearance or not of an obstacle. The evaluation of the performance to detect the obstacles is made in terms of accuracy, true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) rates. Results: From the offline analysis, the best performance is achieved when the slope or the polynomial coefficients are used as features, with average detection accuracy rates of 74.0 and 79.5 %, respectively. These results are consistent with the pseudo-online results, where a complete EEG recording is segmented into windows of 500 ms and overlapped 400 ms, and a decision about the obstacle appearance is made for each window. The results of the best subject were 11 out of 14 obstacles detected with a rate of 9.09 FPs/min, and 10 out of 14 obstacles detected with a rate of 6.34 FPs/min using slope and polynomial coefficients features, respectively. Conclusions: An EEG-based BCI can be developed to detect the appearance of unexpected obstacles. The average accuracy achieved is 79.5 % of success rate with a low number of false detections.

Social dominance is a highly influential factor in social interactions, expressed through both verbal and nonverbal behaviors. In this paper, we present a method for determining whether a participant is high or low in social dominance in a group interaction with children and robots. We investigated the correlation between many verbal and nonverbal behavioral features with social dominance levels collected through teacher surveys. We additionally implemented Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines models with classification accuracies of 81% and 89%, respectively, showing that using a small subset of nonverbal behavioral features, these models can successfully classify children's social dominance level. Our approach for classifying social dominance is novel not only for its application to children, but also for achieving high classification accuracies using a reduced set of nonverbal features that, in future work, can be automatically extracted with current sensing technology. © 2015 ACM.","Children; Classification; Groups; Humanrobot interaction; Social dominance","Classification (of information); Human robot interaction; Interactive computer systems; Social sciences; Teaching; Children; Classification accuracy; Educational environment; Groups; Influential factors; Logistic regressions; Social dominance; Social interactions; Robots",2-s2.0-84959269439

Here, we propose an electrical controlling method to flexibly manipulate liquid metalmotors powered with aluminium. It was discovered that adding aluminium to liquid metal droplets would significantly magnify its electric controlling capability, which provides dozens of times' driving force compared to pure GaIn10 droplets. After switching on the electrical field, the aluminium powered liquid metal droplet would accelerate its running speed to an extremely high magnitude, e.g. 43 cms-1 under 20V voltage, as measured in a channel with 1 cm width and filled with aqueous solution. In addition, we also observed that the motion trajectories of the motors in the free space of a Petri dish nearly reflect the electric field lines in the electrolyte, which suggests an important and straightforward way to visualize such complex physical property. Lastly, the oscillating motion behaviour of the motor under a small electrical voltage and its continuous running modality were experimentally discriminated and interpreted. The current findings on the Al-Ga-In motors generate profound impact on developing future microfluidic systems or tiny soft robots that are hard to achieve otherwise through conventional strategies. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The system utilises mechanomyography (MMG), a low frequency rumble produced by contracting muscle, to control grasping, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to change the hand gesture through specific arm orientations. Current gesture control systems rely on either robot vision or a user physical action, such as the prebing of a button or physical interaction with the robot, in order to change the hand gesture; both are not feasible for control in the field. Using custom made IMU and MMG sensors we combine information in order to both control a robotic hand and change its gesture remotely. The system has been tested on a prosthetic hand for grasp control, with results showing very quick user adoption to the method with minimal false commands. Furthermore, we compare our method with electromyography (EMG) methods and take into account the donning and doffing times required for both EMG and MMG sensors.

This work presents a new Null Space Optimization (NSO) strategy to constraint the position of the manipulator's elbow within predefined range of motions, according to the spatial requirements of the specific procedure, also taking into account the physical joint limits of the robotic assistant. The proposed strategy was applied to the 7 degrees of freedom (dof) lightweight robot LWR4+. The performance of the NSO was compared to two state-of-the-art null space optimization strategies, i.e. damped posture and fixed optimal posture, over a pool of three non-expert users in both strict (20deg) and negligible (100deg) angular encumbrance limitations. The NSO strategy was proved versatile in providing wide elbow mobility together with safe distance from relevant continuity null space boundaries, guaranteeing smooth guidance trajectories. Future works would be performed in order to evaluate the potential feasibility of NSO in a real surgical scenario. © 2015 IEEE.",,"body position; elbow; equipment design; hand; human; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; robotics; theoretical model; Elbow; Elbow Joint; Equipment Design; Hand; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Posture; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Robotics",2-s2.0-84953246878

The purpose of this research is to apply a symmetry-based controller of a wearable type lower limb robot, Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) to hemiplegic patients with compensatory gait, and to investigate improvement of gait symmetry. The controller is designed respectively for swing phase and support phase according to characteristics of hemiplegic gait pattern. The controller during swing phase stores the motion of the unaffected limb and then provides motion support on the affected limb during the subsequent swing using the stored pattern to realize symmetric gait based on spontaneous limb swing. Moreover, the controller during support phase provides motion to extend hip and knee joints to support wearer's body. Clinical tests were conducted in order to assess the modification of gait symmetry. Our case study involved participation of one chronic stroke patient who performs abnormally-compensatory gait for both of the affected and unaffected limbs. As a result, the patient's gait symmetry was improved by providing motion support during the swing phase on the affected side and motion constraint during the support phase on the unaffected side. The study showed promising basis for the effectiveness of the controller for the future clinical study. © 2015 IEEE.",,"biomechanics; cerebrovascular accident; complication; female; gait; hemiplegia; hip; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; middle aged; orthosis; physiology; robotics; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Gait; Hemiplegia; Hip; Humans; Knee Joint; Middle Aged; Orthotic Devices; Range of Motion, Articular; Robotics; Stroke",2-s2.0-84953333219

The perception of realism, in particular human-like features, can help facilitate mediated social interaction. The current study investigated the effects of form realism on engagement with and use intentions of social robot embodiments. We have defined (perceived) form realism as the result of the appraisal of features that are perceived as realistic contrasted with those appraised as unrealistic. To test the effects of form realism, we applied the model of interactively perceiving and experiencing fictional characters (I-PEFiC). I-PEFiC explains how users respond to interactive, fictional, humanoid characters, on social robots. In a within-subjects design, participants (N = 29; $$M_{age}$$Mage = 28.8  years, age range 18–56 years) interacted with three different robots built from LEGO Mindstorms, which differed in their degree of designed form realism. Each robot presented itself as a physiotherapy assistant and requested the participant to do several exercises. Results of a structured questionnaire indicated that form realism only played a modest role in the perception of electro-mechanical robots. Instead, the perception of affordances appeared to be crucial for determining engagement and intentions to use social robots. © 2015, The Author(s).","Design; Engagement; Realism; Social robots; Use intentions","Design; Robots; Social sciences; Affordances; Electro-mechanical; Engagement; LEGO mindstorms; Realism; Social interactions; Social robots; Use intentions; Machine design",2-s2.0-84947059822

However, very little investigation has been directed to the movements that common people expect from robots being touched. This paper provides an initial step in this direction. Responses that people expect from a humanoid being touched were collected. These responses were then classified by automatically grouping similar responses. This allows the identification of distinct types of responses. Evaluation of how this grouping matches common sense were then performed. Results showed strong correlation between the automatic grouping and common sense, providing support to the idea that the automatically identified types of responses correspond to a plausible classification of robot’s responses to touch. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Haptics; Human-robot interaction (HRI); Humanoid robot; Touch","Anthropomorphic robots; Robots; Common sense; Haptics; Human robot Interaction (HRI); Humanoid robot; Strong correlation; Tactile interaction; Tactile sensing; Touch; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-84947057490
