This problem is significantly more challenging in several settings in which this type of an inference is desirable or necessary because of heterogeneity in the diffusion process. The heterogeneity of the diffusion process in different life stages results in the inaccuracy of a common assumption of constant influence strength. In this study, a Life Stage Heuristic (LSH) method is proposed to model life stage heterogeneity by decoupling the popularity level of an item under propagation from a true strength of social ties to improve inference accuracy. The proposed LSH is incorporated into almost all existing state-of-the-art network inference algorithms to improve estimation accuracy with only minimal changes in the implementation and maintaining the same running time. Additionally, NetRate, NetInf, and ConNIe are used as three examples to demonstrate the power of the proposed method. Furthermore, clustering of cascades prior to the LSH is proposed to eliminate noise, and the optimized method is termed as Clustered Life Stage Heuristic (CLSH). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world datasets indicate that both LSH and CLSH methods significantly improve the accuracy of network inference. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","clustering cascade; information diffusion; life stage heterogeneity; network inference; social influence","Inference engines; Diffusion networks; Diffusion process; Information diffusion; Life stages; Network inference; Real-world datasets; Social influence; State of the art; Heuristic methods",2-s2.0-85032840274

Practical capability influences the transition from suicidal ideation to action and is particularly relevant to firearm suicide. Firearm ownership, experience using firearms, unsafe firearm storage, and high cultural acceptability of firearms increase risk for death by firearm suicide. Means safety strategies, which emphasize the reduction of practical capability for suicide through the limitation of access to and safe storage of firearms, are effective in preventing suicide and include interventions such as lethal means counseling, firearm legislation, and promoting safe storage practices.

The specific role of nightmares in contributing to suicide remains unclear due to the difficulty in delineating causal factors.

We represent data points as a directed graph and assume each data point belong to single cluster membership instead of multiple memberships. The method is based on the concept of ensemble group diffusion with a parameter to represent diffusion depth in clustering. The ability to modulate the diffusion-depth parameter by varying it within a certain interval allows for more accurate construction of clusters. Depending on the value of the diffusion-depth parameter, the presented approach can determine very well both local clusters and global structure of data. At the same time, the ability to combine single outcomes of the method results in better cluster segmentation. Due to this property, the proposed method performs well on data sets where other conventional clustering methods fail. We test the method with both simulated and real-world data sets. The results support our theoretical conjectures on improved accuracy compared to other selected methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering; Community structure; Diffusion; Markov chain; Social network","Directed graphs; Markov processes; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Cluster memberships; Clustering; Community structures; Conventional clustering; Diffusion depth; Ensemble clustering; Global structure; Local cluster; Diffusion",2-s2.0-85030688626

Although deep learning methods have recently produced a marked improvement in image classification there are still challenges as these methods contain myriad parameters and require large-scale training sets that are not usually available for most routine medical imaging studies. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for lung nodule classification that fuses the texture, shape and deep model-learned information (Fuse-TSD) at the decision level. This algorithm employs a gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture descriptor, a Fourier shape descriptor to characterize the heterogeneity of nodules and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to automatically learn the feature representation of nodules on a slice-by-slice basis. It trains an AdaBoosted back propagation neural network (BPNN) using each feature type and fuses the decisions made by three classifiers to differentiate nodules. We evaluated this algorithm against three approaches on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. When the nodules with a composite malignancy rate 3 were discarded, regarded as benign or regarded as malignant, our Fuse-TSD algorithm achieved an AUC of 96.65%, 94.45% and 81.24%, respectively, which was substantially higher than the AUC obtained by other approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AdaBoost, information fusion; Back propagation neural network (BPNN); Chest CT; Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN); Lung nodule classification","Adaptive boosting; Backpropagation; Biological organs; Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Convolution; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Neural networks; Torsional stress; Automated classification; Back-propagation neural networks; Chest CT; Convolutional neural network; Feature representation; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Large-scale training sets; Lung nodule; Deep neural networks",2-s2.0-85032367648

However, the real benefit is not related to the data itself, but with the algorithms that are capable of processing such data in a tolerable elapse time, and to extract valuable knowledge from it. Therefore, the use of Big Data Analytics tools provide very significant advantages to both industry and academia. The MapReduce programming framework can be stressed as the main paradigm related with such tools. It is mainly identified by carrying out a distributed execution for the sake of providing a high degree of scalability, together with a fault-tolerant scheme. In every MapReduce algorithm, first local models are learned with a subset of the original data within the so-called Map tasks. Then, the Reduce task is devoted to fuse the partial outputs generated by each Map. The ways of designing such fusion of information/models may have a strong impact in the quality of the final system. In this work, we will enumerate and analyze two alternative methodologies that may be found both in the specialized literature and in standard Machine Learning libraries for Big Data.

Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism served as exploratory events, and their detection criteria for the claims database were reported by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan. Results Most of the characteristics of sertraline-prescribed patients in the claims database did not differ markedly from those in the PMS. There was no tendency for higher risks of the exploratory events after exposure to sertraline, and this was consistent with sertraline's known safety profile. Conclusions Our results support the concept of using database research as a cost-effective pharmacovigilance tool that is free of selection bias. Further investigation using database research is required to confirm our preliminary observations. © 2017","database research; health care claim; pharmacovigilance; postmarketing surveillance; sertraline","anxiolytic agent; benzodiazepine derivative; central nervous system agents; hypnotic agent; psychotropic agent; sedative agent; sertraline; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; comparative study; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; depression; diabetes mellitus; drug cost; drug database; drug exposure; drug research; drug safety; drug surveillance program; exploratory research; female; health insurance; high risk patient; human; hyperlipidemia; hyperthyroidism; Japan; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; middle aged; postmarketing surveillance; practice guideline; preschool child; prescription; priority journal; prospective study; retrospective study; school child; unspecified side effect; very elderly; young adult",2-s2.0-85021151901

Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 221 patients with RA aged 18 years or older at a tertiary care hospital in Thailand. Data collection methods included individual patient interviews and data gathering from medical records. The correlations between the EQ-5D and HAQ scores were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results Most patients were female (78.3%), aged 41 to 60 years (57.0%), having had RA for 12 to 60 months (43.0%), and being in an active disease state (60.6%). From the EQ-5D, most patients reported no problems in each dimension, except for mobility and pain/discomfort. For the HAQ, most patients reported no difficulty for almost all activities, except for arising. The medians (interquartile ranges) for the EQ-5D utility, EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ VAS), and HAQ scores were 0.65 (0.55–0.73), 70 (50–80), and 0.25 (0.00–0.81), respectively. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were 0.42 for the EQ-5D utility and EQ VAS scores (P = 0.01), −0.65 for the EQ-5D utility and HAQ scores (P < 0.001), and −0.39 for the EQ VAS and HAQ scores (P < 0.001). Conclusions The health-related quality of life and functional ability of most patients in our study were partially affected by the disease.

While in the real-world networks, especially the spatial networks, the influence from one node to another tends to vary over both space and time due to the different space distances and propagation speeds between nodes. Thus the time lag plays an essential role in interpreting the temporal causal dependency among nodes and also brings a big challenge in network structure learning. However most of the previous researches aiming to learn the dynamic network structure only treat the time lag as a predefined constant, which may miss important information or include noisy information if the time lag is set too small or too large. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Bayesian model with adaptive lags (DBAL) which simultaneously integrates two usually separate tasks, i.e., learning the dynamic dependency network structure and estimating time lags, within one unified framework. Specifically, we propose a novel weight kernel approach for time series segmenting and sampling via leveraging samples from adjacent segments to avoid the sample scarcity. Besides, an effective Bayesian scheme cooperated with reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) and expectation propagation (EP) algorithm is proposed for parameter inference. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on both synthetic and two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to the traditional methods in learning the network structure and the temporal dependency. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","dependency network; dynamic network; time lag","Bayesian networks; Markov processes; Dependency networks; Dynamic network; Empirical evaluations; Expectation Propagation; Parameter inference; Real-world networks; Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo; Time lag; Inference engines",2-s2.0-85028950675

Sensor drift errors and distortion are the main challenges of the tracking accuracy of human motion. Traditional filtering and fusion methods, such as Kalman filter, can to some extent reduce the instantaneous error but cannot avoid sensor drift fundamentally. Physical characteristics of human body should be considered and human motion models should be exhibited to describe human motions. The existing models such as skeleton model and cylinder model are either too simple or too complicated for practical applications. In this study, we put forward a geometrical kinematic characteristics based human motion model. The whole human body is viewed as an articulated skeleton and Denavit–Hartenberg convention is adopted to describe the forward kinematics structure. Theoretical analysis is conducted with the derivation of Posterior Cramer–Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB) in human movement scenes based on proposed model. Significant superiority is shown in simulation results. An experiment on human lower limb motions is carried out to verify the validity of the proposed human motion model in practice applications, from the angles of both capturing accuracy and energy consumption. The capturing accuracy has an obvious increase in the testing results, with acceptable energy consumption. It is far more efficient than traditional methods. © 2017","Denavit–Hartenberg convention; Geometrical characteristics; Human motion; PCRLB; Wearable sensors","Energy utilization; Geometry; Kalman filters; Kinematics; Musculoskeletal system; Wearable technology; Geometrical characteristics; Human motion modeling; Human motion sensing; Human motions; Kinematic characteristics; Multi-sensor fusion; PCRLB; Physical characteristics; Wearable sensors",2-s2.0-85029681041

Methods The HRQOL of patients with HPV-related cancers (cervical, uterine, nasopharyngeal, head and neck, and anogenital cancer) was assessed using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D). Validity and reliability were assessed by means of construct validity and test-retest reliability methods, respectively. Subsequently, the EQ-5D utility index was calculated using the Thailand value set. Results The EQ-5D came out as a valid and reliable questionnaire for measuring the HRQOL of patients with HPV-related cancers in Indonesia. From a total of 520 patients diagnosed with HPV-related cancers, 404 patients were excluded because of not fulfilling the inclusion criteria, and so 116 patients finally participated in the study. The mean age of the patients was 47.5 ± 12.03 years. Most of the patients were women (56.0%) and married (97.4%), and less than half of them had finished high school (32.7%). Moreover, the proportions of nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, anogenital, and uterine cancers in the study population were 29.3%, 24.6%, 22.4%, 14.2%, and 9.5%, respectively.

Health economic evidence is important in Malaysia and yet cost and quality-of-life (QOL) data are scarce. Objectives To investigate prevalence, factors associated with anemia, and cost and QOL among T2DM patients with CKD. Here, we present the estimated 1-year cost and QOL related to anemia in this group. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was performed at 20 government clinics. Treatment cost was calculated on the basis of resource utilization ascertained through data extracted from medical records and patient recall. QOL was elicited using the short form 36 health survey version 2 questionnaire. Propensity score matching was performed and costs and QOL were analyzed by anemia status and CKD stage. Results Data for 816 patients were obtained. The propensity score matching enabled a comparison of 257 patients with and without anemia. Annual treatment costs were significantly higher for patients with anemia (Ringgit Malaysia [RM] 4219 [US $983] vs. RM2705 [US $630]; P = 0.01). QOL scores were lower for patients with anemia but not statistically significant (physical component summary score: 44.8 vs. 46.2; P = 0.052; mental component summary score: 51.3 vs. 51.7; P = 0.562). Costs were higher and QOL lower among CKD stage 5 patients. Conclusions This study was the first to examine anemia in this group of patients. Costs were significantly higher among anemic patients compared with nonanemic patients; patients with higher CKD stage 5 fared less well than did those in lower stages. This information suggests the need to increase detection, prevention, and early treatment of anemia when managing T2DM patients, particularly those with CKD. © 2017","anemia; chronic kidney disease; cost; quality of life; type 2 diabetes mellitus","adult; aged; anemia; Article; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; cost of illness; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; health care cost; health care utilization; health survey; human; major clinical study; Malaysian; male; medical record; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; prevalence; priority journal; propensity score; quality of life; risk factor; Short Form 36; very elderly",2-s2.0-85026741062

One of the most promising MCS approaches is Dynamic Selection (DS), in which the base classifiers are selected on the fly, according to each new sample to be classified. This paper provides a review of the DS techniques proposed in the literature from a theoretical and empirical point of view. We propose an updated taxonomy based on the main characteristics found in a dynamic selection system: (1) The methodology used to define a local region for the estimation of the local competence of the base classifiers; (2) The source of information used to estimate the level of competence of the base classifiers, such as local accuracy, oracle, ranking and probabilistic models, and (3) The selection approach, which determines whether a single or an ensemble of classifiers is selected. We categorize the main dynamic selection techniques in the DS literature based on the proposed taxonomy. We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis, considering a total of 18 state-of-the-art dynamic selection techniques, as well as static ensemble combination and single classification models. To date, this is the first analysis comparing all the key DS techniques under the same experimental protocol.

Hydroxylation at the 3-position increased the affinity of the phenolic acids for β-lactoglobulin, while hydroxylation at the 2- or 4-positions had a negative effect. Complete methylation of all hydroxy groups, except at the 3-position, enhanced the binding affinity. Replacing the hydroxy groups with methyl groups at the 2-position also had a positive effect.

This system was easily fabricated on a nitrocellulose membrane using a wax-printing method and then baked in an oven at 100 °C for 1 min. The four barriers of the wax-delayed channel could delay the flow time for 11 s compared to the flow time of the non-delayed channel.

For this reason, the stiffness and damping of the structure of foil bearings are problems that are the focus of many analyses. The mechanical characteristics of the foil structure (top and bump foil) are analyzed either by using a simple approach obtained for an isolated bump modeled as a beam or with more elaborate ones taking into account the three-dimensional nature of the bumps and their mutual interactions. These two kinds of models give different foil structure stiffness, with lower values for the simplified model. However, the published experimental results of the foil bearing structure tend to validate the simplified model. The present paper explains the differences between the simplified and the elaborate models by taking into account the manufacturing errors of the foil structure. A threedimensional model based on the nonlinear theory of elasticity is developed. The model offers a unique insight into the way the bearing structure deforms when the rotor is incrementally pushed into the foil structure. Three realistic manufacturing errors, bump height, bump length, and radius of the bump foil, are analyzed. Bump height and length vary following a normal distribution with a given standard deviation while the radius of the bump foil is given a waviness form with an imposed peak-to-peak amplitude. Three to five cases were calculated for each kind of error. Results show that only the manufacturing errors of the bump height affect the stiffness of the foil structure by diminishing its values. Height errors of 20 lm standard deviation (4% of the average bump height and 60% of the radial clearance) may induce a 40-50% reduction of the stiffness of the foil structure, i.e., in the range of the predictions of the simplified model.

But there is still no known method to determine the accuracy of this measure. There has been little research on the statistical properties of this quantity that characterize time series. The literature describes some resampling methods of quantities used in nonlinear dynamics - as the largest Lyapunov exponent - but these seems to fail. In this contribution, we propose a parametric bootstrap methodology using a symbolic representation of the time series to obtain the distribution of the Permutation Entropy estimator. We perform several time series simulations given by well-known stochastic processes: the 1/fα noise family, and show in each case that the proposed accuracy measure is as efficient as the one obtained by the frequentist approach of repeating the experiment. The complexity of brain electrical activity, measured by the Permutation Entropy, has been extensively used in epilepsy research for detection in dynamical changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) signal with no consideration of the variability of this complexity measure.

There are two different models that can account for one of the main predictions of interference, i.e., a slowdown at a retrieval site, when several items share a feature associated with a retrieval cue: Lewis and Vasishth's (2005) activation-based model and McElree's (2000) direct-access model. Even though these two models have been used almost interchangeably, they are based on different assumptions and predict differences in the relationship between reading times and response accuracy. The activation-based model follows the assumptions of the ACT-R framework, and its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race between accumulators of evidence with a single variance. Under this model, accuracy of the retrieval is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval time by its rate of accumulation. In contrast, the direct-access model assumes a model of memory where only the probability of retrieval can be affected, while the retrieval time is drawn from the same distribution; in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of the possibility of backtracking and repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented both models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them and compare them. The data show that correct retrievals take longer than incorrect ones, and this pattern is better fit under the direct-access model than under the activation-based model. This finding does not rule out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving as a race model with assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the ACT-R framework. By introducing a modification of the activation model, i.e., by assuming that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of incorrect items is not only slower but noisier (i.e., different variances for the correct and incorrect items), the model can provide a fit as good as the one of the direct-access model.

Cerebral injury was reversed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Here we tested if the pro-thrombotic phenotype seen in the systemic circulation and brain during diabetes was associated with increased MG-glycation of proteins, and if NAC could reverse this. Methods The streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes was used. Thrombus formation in venules and arterioles (pial circulation) was determined by intravital videomicroscopy using the light-dye method. Circulating blood platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) were analyzed by flow cytometry 1 wk before other measurements. GSH and MG levels in platelets were measured by HPLC. MG-modified proteins, glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) levels were detected in platelets by western blot at 20 weeks. Proteins involved in coagulation were quantified by ELISA. NAC (2 mM) was given in drinking water for 3 weeks before the terminal experiment. Results Thrombus development was accelerated by diabetes in a time-dependent manner. % PLAs were significantly elevated by diabetes. Plasma activated plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 levels were progressively increased with diabetes duration, with tail bleeding time reduced by 20 wks diabetes. Diabetes lowered platelet GSH levels, GPx-1 and SOD-1 expression. This was associated with higher MG levels, and increased MG-adduct formation in platelets. NAC treatment partly or completely reversed the effects of diabetes. Conclusion Collectively, these results show that the diabetic blood and brain become progressively more susceptible to platelet activation and thrombosis.

Based on the associated characteristic equation, the sum of time delays is regarded as the bifurcation parameter, and some explicit conditions for describing delay-dependent stability and emergence of Hopf bifurcation of such networks are derived. It reveals that the stability and bifurcation heavily relies on the sum of time delays for the proposed networks, and the stability performance of such networks can be markedly improved by selecting carefully the sum of time delays. Moreover, it is further displayed that both the order and the number of neurons can extremely influence the stability and bifurcation of such networks. The obtained criteria enormously generalize and improve the existing work.

Several research groups have been suggesting advanced systems based on fuel cells and have also been applying carbon capture and storage technology to satisfy the demand for clean energy. In this study, the performance of a hybrid system, which is a combination of a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) with oxy-combustion carbon capture and an indirectly fired micro gas turbine (MGT), was predicted. A 2.5 MW MCFC system that is used in commercial applications was used as the reference system so that the results of the study could be applied to practical situations. The ambient pressure type hybrid system was modeled by referring to the design parameters of an MGT that is currently being developed. A semi-closed type design characterized by flow recirculation was adopted for this hybrid system. A part of the recirculating gas is converted into liquefied carbon dioxide and captured for storage at the carbon separation unit (CSU). Almost 100% carbon dioxide capture is possible with this system. In these systems, the output power of the fuel cell is larger than in the normal hybrid system without carbon capture because the partial pressure of carbon dioxide increases. The increased cell power partially compensates for the power loss due to the carbon capture and MGT power reduction. The dependence of net system efficiency of the oxy-hybrid on compressor pressure ratio is marginal, especially beyond an optimal value. © 2018 by ASME.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas turbines; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Capture and storage technologies; Carbon dioxide capture; Commercial applications; Compressor pressure ratio; Design parameters; Flow recirculation; Liquefied carbon dioxide; Micro gas turbines; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC)",2-s2.0-85032722541

Recent work in auditory neuroscience has made substantial progress in studying how sounds are represented in the auditory system under different contexts, demonstrating that auditory processing of seemingly simple acoustic features, such as frequency and time, is highly dependent on co-occurring acoustic and behavioral stimuli.

In this study we investigate the limiting waiting time density of a general ultraslow diffusion model via the inverse Mittag-Leffler function, whose special case includes the traditional logarithmic ultraslow diffusion model. The MSD of the general ultraslow diffusion model is analytically derived as an inverse Mittag-Leffler function, and is observed to increase even more slowly than that of the logarithmic function model. The occurrence of very long waiting time in the case of the inverse Mittag-Leffler function has the largest probability compared with the power law model and the logarithmic function model.

Firstly, based on an extended integral inequality, the convex combination theorem and S-procedure, the conditions for cluster synchronization of identical Lur'e networks are derived in a convex domain. Secondly, randomly occurring adaptive pinning controllers with two independent Bernoulli stochastic variables are designed and then sufficient conditions are obtained for the cluster synchronization on complex networks consisted of nonidentical Lur'e systems. In addition, suitable control gains for successful cluster synchronization of nonidentical Lur'e networks are acquired by designing some adaptive updating laws.

The process by which ascorbate oxidizes to form H2O2 is thought to be mediated catalytically by redox active metal ions such as iron (Fe). Because intravenous iron sucrose is often administered to colon cancer patients to help mitigate anemia, the current study assessed the ability of pharmacological ascorbate to kill colon cancer cells in the presence and absence of iron sucrose. In vitro survival assays showed that 10 mM ascorbate exposure (2 h) clonogenically inactivated 40–80% of exponentially growing colon cancer cell lines (HCT116 and HT29). When the H2O2 scavenging enzyme, catalase, was added to the media, or conditionally over-expressed using a doxycycline inducible vector, the toxicity of pharmacological ascorbate was significantly blunted. When colon cancer cells were treated in the presence or absence of 250 µM iron sucrose, then rinsed, and treated with 10 mM ascorbate, the cells demonstrated increased levels of labile iron that resulted in significantly increased clonogenic cell killing, compared to pharmacological ascorbate alone. Interestingly, when colon cancer cells were treated with iron sucrose for 1 h and then 10 mM ascorbate was added to the media in the continued presence of iron sucrose, there was no enhancement of toxicity despite similar increases in intracellular labile iron. The combination of iron chelators, deferoxamine and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, significantly inhibited the toxicity of either ascorbate alone or ascorbate following iron sucrose. These observations support the hypothesis that increasing intracellular labile iron pools, using iron sucrose, can be used to increase the toxicity of pharmacological ascorbate in human colon cancer cells by a mechanism involving increased generation of H2O2. © 2017","Catalase; Chelators; Deferoxamine; Iron sucrose; Oxidative stress; Redox active iron","ascorbic acid; catalase; iron saccharate; Article; cell survival; concentration response; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug determination; drug effect; drug exposure; drug potentiation; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; HCT 116 cell line; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; priority journal; protein expression",2-s2.0-85028730181

Both Sirt1 and Sirt3 have been shown to play vital roles in resistance to cellular stress, but the interaction between these two sirtuins has not been fully determined. In this study, we investigated the role of Sirt1-Sirt3 axis in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability after ischemia in vitro. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes were co-cultured to model the BBB in vitro and oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed to mimic ischemia. The results of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) showed that suppression of Sirt1 via siRNA or salermide significantly decreased BBB permeability, whereas Sirt3 knockdown increased BBB permeability. In addition, Sirt1 was shown to regulate Sirt3 expression after OGD through inhibiting the AMPK-PGC1 pathway. Application of the AMPK inhibitor compound C partially prevented the effects of Sirt1-Sirt3 axis on BBB permeability after OGD. The results of flow cytometry and cytochrome c release demonstrated that Sirt1 and Sirt3 exert opposite effects on OGD-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, suppression of Sirt1 was shown to attenuate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which contribute to the Sirt1-Sirt3 axis-induced regulation of BBB permeability and cell damage. In summary, these findings demonstrate that the Sirt1-Sirt3 axis might act as an important modulator in BBB physiology, and could be a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke via regulating mitochondrial ROS generation. © 2017","Blood-brain barrier; Mitochondrial ROS; Sirt1; Sirt3; Stroke","hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; PGC1 protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; regulator protein; sirtuin 1; sirtuin 2; unclassified drug; AMPK PGC1 pathway; apoptosis; Article; astrocyte; blood brain barrier; brain capillary endothelial cell; cell damage; cell hypoxia; coculture; controlled study; human; human cell; in vitro study; mitochondrion; priority journal; signal transduction; transepithelial resistance",2-s2.0-85030722348

The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) represents a central cellular defense mechanism, and is a target for developing agents against oxidative insult-induced human lung diseases. Our previous study found that the EtOH extract of Cinnamomum chartophyllum protected human bronchial epithelial cells against oxidative insults via Nrf2 activation. In this study, a systemic phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of C. chartophyllum led to the isolation of thirty chemical constituents, which were further evaluated for their Nrf2 inducing potential using NAD(P)H: quinone reductase (QR) assay. Among these purified constituents, a sesquiterpenoid bearing α, β-unsaturated ketone group, 3S-(+)-9-oxonerolidol (NLD), and a diphenyl sharing phenolic groups, 3, 3′, 4, 4′-tetrahydroxydiphenyl (THD) significantly activated Nrf2 and its downstream genes, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (γ-GCS), and enhanced the nuclear translocation and stabilization of Nrf2 in human lung epithelial cells. Importantly, NLD and THD had no toxicities under the Nrf2 inducing doses. THD also demonstrated a potential of interrupting Nrf2-Keap1 protein–protein interaction (PPI). Furthermore, NLD and THD protected human lung epithelial cells against sodium arsenite [As(III)]-induced cytotoxicity.

We aim to explore the in vivo chemopreventive effect of an organoselenium-containing compound butaselen (BS) against hepatocarcinogenesis and its underlying mechanisms. Pre- and sustained BS treatment (9, 18 and 36 mg/Kg BS) could dose-dependently inhibit chronic hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC on murine models with 24 weeks treatment scheme. The thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), NF-κB pathway and pro-inflammatory factors were activated during hepatocarcinogenesis, while their expression were decreased by BS treatment. BS treatment could also significantly reduce tumor volume in H22-bearing models and remarkably slow tumor growth. HCC cell lines HepG2, Bel7402 and Huh7 were time- and dose-dependently inhibited by BS treatment. G2/M arrest and apoptosis were observed in HepG2 cells after BS treatment, which were mediated by TrxR/Ref-1 and NF-κB pathways inhibition. BS generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could be reduced by antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI. NAC could markedly increase HepG2 cells viability. TrxR activity of HepG2 cells treated with BS were significantly decreased in parallel with proliferative inhibition. The TrxR1-knockdown HepG2 cells also exhibited low TrxR1 activity, high ROS level, relatively low proliferation rate and increased resistance to BS treatment. In conclusion, BS can prevent hepatocarcinogenesis through inhibiting chronic inflammation, cirrhosis and tumor progression.

The microbial numbers as well as the microbial diversity were generally higher for the substrate, existing of remaining feed, faeces and exuviae, than for the larvae. Most of the species-level operational taxonomic units, identified using Illumina MiSeq sequencing, that were present in the feed were also detected in the larvae and vice versa. However, bacterial diversity decreased in the larvae during rearing. These results suggested that the feed is an important determinant of the insect bacterial community, but that some bacterial species show a competitive advantage inside the insect gut and become dominant. A blanching treatment of the larvae after harvest reduced most microbial counts, but the number of aerobic endospores remained at 4.0 log cfu/g. Whereas food pathogens Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus or coagulase-positive staphylococci were not detected in our study, fungal isolates corresponding to the genera Aspergillus and Fusarium were recovered. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that mycotoxins were present.

Research has shown that more than 85% of diabetic patients develop at least one of these complications. Therefore, studying comorbidities among diabetic patients using association analysis is a worthy research endeavor. Association analysis is a well-known data mining method that aims to reveal the association/affinity patterns/rules among various items (objects or events) that occur together. One of the most critical problems in association analysis is the difficulty with the identification of rare items/patterns. In ordinary association analysis, specifying a large minimum-support leads to not discovering rare rules, while setting a small minimum-support leads to over-generating rules that may not be strong and beneficial. In this study, we propose a new assessment metric, called adjusted_support, to address this problem. Applying this new metric can retrieve rare patterns without over-generating association rules. To test the proposed metric, we extracted data from a large and feature-rich electronic medical records data warehouse and performed association analysis on the resultant data set that included 492,025 unique patients diagnosed with diabetes and related complications. By applying adjusted_support, we discovered interesting associations among diabetes complications such as neurological manifestations with diabetic arthropathy and gastroparesis; renal manifestations with retinopathy; gastroparesis with ketoacidosis and retinopathy; and skin complications with hyperglycemia, peripheral circulatory disorder, heart disease, and neurological manifestations. We also performed association analysis in various demographic groups at more granular levels. Besides association analysis, we also analyzed the comorbidity situation among different demographic groups of diabetics. Finally, we studied and compared the prevalence of diabetes complications in every demographic group of patients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adjusted_support; Association rule mining; Comorbidity; Data mining; Diabetes; Rare-pattern identification","Association rules; Cardiology; Data warehouses; Diseases; Epidemiology; Eye protection; Ketones; Medical computing; Medical problems; Neurology; Patient monitoring; Population statistics; Statistical tests; Adjusted_support; Association analysis; Circulatory disorders; Co morbidities; Data mining methods; Electronic medical record; Neurological manifestations; Pattern identification; Data mining",2-s2.0-85032491288

In manufacturing processes or industrial systems, several sources of out-of-control variation, such as tool wear, gradual equipment deterioration, vibration, inconsistent material etc., often result in dynamic changes in the process parameter, or result in special residual signals of the systems. Detecting such weak or decaying signals is a challenging task. Although the window-limited generalized likelihood ratio (wl-GLR) scheme is widely used in changepoint detection and has some advantages, it may perform poorly when it is used to detect weak or decaying signals. This paper proposes a new change-detection scheme, the window-limited weighted likelihood ratio (wl-WLR) scheme, to improve the wl-GLR scheme. To do this, a new statistical distance measure called the GLR divergence is first defined and then its properties are analyzed. The wl-WLR scheme is designed to monitor the weighted average of the GLR divergences in a moving window, and the wl-GLR scheme can be viewed as a special case of the wl-WLR scheme. Two types of weight functionals are introduced and investigated for the wl-WLR scheme. Numerical algorithms to select the optimal weight parameters are provided based on a calibration sample. Extensive simulation study favors the proposed wl-WLR scheme for detecting weak or decaying signals, and its performance is robust even if the weight parameters are not accurately estimated.

The acid hydrolysis, using H2SO4 as a catalyst, increases the ionic strength of the sample impairing the electrophoretic separation. Therefore, Ba(OH)2 was used to both neutralize the medium and reduce the content of sulfate by precipitation of BaSO4. The best separation of nine determined monosaccharides (fucose, galactose, arabinose, glucose, rhamnose, xylose, mannose, fructose and ribose) plus inositol as internal standard was obtained in 500 mmol·L−1 triethylamine, pH 12.3.

The proposed method is simple, fast (&lt;12.0 min), present linear calibration curves (r2 = 0.995), and relative standard deviation for replicate injections lower than 5%. The LOQ for all monosaccharides was lower than 0.01 mmol·L−1, which is in accordance with the tolerable limits for coffee.

Finding the densest subgraphs of a graph directly maps to revealing the densest communities of a social network. Various techniques, e.g., edge density, k-core, near-cliques and k-cliques, have been developed to characterize graphs and extract the densest subgraphs of the graphs. However, as extraction of subgraphs with constraints is NP-hard, these techniques face a major difficulty of processing big and/or streaming data sets from social networks. This demands new methods from the expert and intelligent systems perspective for computation of the densest subgraph problem (DSP) with big and/or streaming data. The most recent method for this purpose is the “Sampling” method. It samples the big data sets, thus reducing the data space and consequently speeding up the DSP computation. But the sampled data inevitably miss out many useful data items. A new approach is presented in this paper for accelerated DSP computation with big and/or steaming data through data space reduction without loss of useful information. It uses a sliding window of small graphs with a fixed number of edges. Then, it filters out the least connected edges for each small graph. While the small graphs are processed, subgraphs are incrementally put together to reveal the densest subgraphs. Finally, the data space previously filtered out is checked for recovery of globally important edges. The approach is incorporated with existing subgraph extraction techniques for scalable and efficient DSP computation with improved accuracy. It is demonstrated for four subgraph extraction techniques over four Twitter data sets, and is shown to outperform the “sampling” method. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Densest subgraph; Graph; Heuristics; Sampling; Space reduction","Big data; Extraction; Graphic methods; Intelligent systems; Sampling; Densest subgraph problems; Densest subgraphs; Graph; Heuristics; Important features; Space reductions; Subgraph extraction; Subgraphs; Data reduction",2-s2.0-85032500057

G. Wolynes, J. Chem. Phys. 87, 6559 (1987)] is based on a saddle point approximation to the time integral of a reactive flux autocorrelation function in the nonadiabatic (golden rule) limit. The dominant saddle point is on the imaginary time axis at tsp=iλsp, and provided λsp lies in the range -β/2≤λsp≤β/2, it is straightforward to evaluate the rate constant using information obtained from an imaginary time path integral calculation. However, if λsp lies outside this range, as it does in the Marcus inverted regime, the path integral diverges. This has led to claims in the literature that Wolynes theory cannot describe the correct behaviour in the inverted regime. Here we show how the imaginary time correlation function obtained from a path integral calculation can be analytically continued to λsp&lt;-β/2, and the continuation used to evaluate the rate in the inverted regime.

To realize the stated objective, two driving simulators were utilized. The first simulator is located at the American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon. The second simulator is located at the George Washington University (GWU), United States of America. An elaborate experimental scheme involving the occurrence of frustrating events at signalized intersections was designed, and 35 students from GWU and 81 students from AUB participated in the experiments. Detailed trajectory data was collected, and students were compared based on three surrogate measures: number of red-light violations, time-to-junction, average and maximum velocities. The results indicated that frustrating events occurring at intersections elicit red-light violations and speeding for both samples. In addition, speeding and red-light violations follow increasing trends as students drive through successive signalized intersections and experience frustrating events. In a postdriving survey, AUB students indicated that they engage in risky driving behavior more than GWU students. On the other hand, GWU students indicated that they are more likely to violate traffic rules and also committed more red-light violations in the simulator.

Drivers also filled out a stated-preference survey, which included speed selection items and demographic characteristics. The experimental design included four scenarios of a specific risk or benefit to the driver: A daily trip, a higher speed enforcement scenario, a higher crash-risk scenario, and a scenario with high time pressure. The driver sample included 111 drivers from different ages between 20 and 65, with 44% women. The database included 9,768 observations. The largest effect on drivers' speed was under time-saving benefits with an average increase of 10 km/hr. Infrastructure effects included horizontal curves, longitudinal slope changes, and design speed. Age and gender also influenced speed selection. Thus, the most effective measures for speed reduction may be (1) enforcement, (2) design speed, and (3) horizontal curves, in contrast to (1) time-saving benefits and (2) a high average speed of close-by vehicles, which motivated drivers to increase their speed but may be reduced by counteracting policies. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee.","driving behaviour; experimental design; infrastructure design; simulation; speed selection",,2-s2.0-85017429667

Transformations to offset the bias via inflating the OLS residuals have been available in the related HC literature for some time, but these have been overlooked so far in the HAC literature.

We also study the influence this has on the survival and population size of predator phenotypes with a variety of foraging strategies. Our results indicate that the distribution of competition amongst prey is of little significance, provided that intraspecific is stronger than the interspecific, and that it is typically preferable for a predator to adopt a foraging strategy that scales linearly with prey population sizes if it is alone.

The results evidence that the multivariate statistical analysis in the Radial Basis Function is a good method to analyze the process based on correlated variables: it satisfies the assumptions required for this analysis, it determines the process variation, and it also determines the most important variable that had influence in the process used to evaluate the permanent mold casting process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","MANOVA; Multivariate statistical inference; Radial basis function","Decision making; Electron emission; Functions; Permanent mold casting; Quality control; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Statistical methods; Statistics; MANOVA; Multivariate statistical analysis; Process input variables; Quality characteristic; Radial basis function neural networks; Radial basis functions; Statistical inference; Statistical significance; Multivariant analysis",2-s2.0-85032875432

These methodologies identify outliers as a consequence of excessive deviation from a statistical-based model, derived from available observations. Among parametric techniques, the k-σ methodology demonstrates its effectiveness in the analysis of stationary time series. Furthermore, the simplicity and the clarity of this approach justify its direct application to industry. On the other hand, the k-σ methodology usually proves to be unable to adapt to dynamic time series since it identifies observations in a transient as outliers. As this limitation is caused by the nature of the methodology itself, two improved approaches are considered in this paper in addition to the standard k-σ methodology. The two proposed methodologies maintain the same rejection rule of the standard k-σ methodology, but differ in the portions of the time series from which statistical parameters (mean and standard deviation) are inferred. The first approach performs statistical inference by considering all observations prior to the current one, which are assumed reliable, plus a forward window containing a specified number of future observations. The second approach proposed in this paper is based on a moving window scheme. Simulated data are used to tune the parameters of the proposed improved methodologies and to prove their effectiveness in adapting to dynamic time series. The moving window approach is found to be the best on simulated data in terms of true positive rate (TPR), false negative rate (FNR), and false positive rate (FPR). Therefore, the performance of the moving window approach is further assessed toward both different simulated scenarios and field data taken on a GT. © 2018 by ASME.",,"Gas turbines; Statistical methods; Statistics; Time series; False negative rate; False positive rates; Mean and standard deviations; Stationary time series; Statistical inference; Statistical methodologies; Statistical parameters; True positive rates; Time series analysis",2-s2.0-85032628294

Rainfall is an important determinant of SSR as it can cause the dislocation, reorientation and packing of soil particles and may result in the formation of physical soil crusts which can, in turn, affect the roughness and hydrological properties of soils. This paper describes an experiment to investigate the impact of a multi-day rainfall event on the SSR and physical crusting of very fine soils with low organic matter content, typical of a semi-arid environment. Changes in SSR are quantified using geostatistically-derived indicators calculated from semivariogram analysis of high resolution laser scans of the soil surface captured at a horizontal resolution of 78 μm (0.078 mm) and a vertical resolution of 12 μm (0.012 mm). Application of 2 mm, 5 mm and 2 mm of rainfall each separated by a 24 h drying period resulted in soils developing a structural two-layered ‘sieving’ crust characterised by a sandy micro-layer at the surface overlying a thin seal of finer particles. Analysis of the geostatistics and soil characteristics (e.g. texture, surface resistance, infiltration rate) suggests that at this scale of enquiry, and for low rainfall amounts, both the vertical and horizontal components of SSR are determined by raindrop impact rather than aggregate breakdown. This is likely due to the very fine nature of the soils and the low rainfall amounts applied. © 2017 The Authors","Disaggregation; Geostatistics; Laser scan; Microtopography; Semivariogram; Soil surface roughness","Atmospheric movements; Rain; Soils; Surface roughness; Disaggregation; Geo-statistics; Laser scans; Micro topography; Semivariograms; Soil surface roughness; Infiltration; geostatistics; laser method; microtopography; raindrop; rainfall; sandy soil; semiarid region; soil crust; soil organic matter; soil surface; surface roughness",2-s2.0-85032724906

Despite the numerous studies conducted to assess the quality of environmental waters in many countries, limited efforts have been put on investigating the microbial quality of the sediments in developing countries and how this relates to different land uses. The present study evaluated the bacterial diversity in water and sediments in a highly used South African river to find out how the different land uses influenced the bacterial diversity, and to verify the human diseases functional classes of the bacterial populations. Samples were collected on river stretches influenced by an informal, a peri-urban and a rural settlement. Genomic DNA was extracted from water and sediment samples and sequenced on an Illumina® MiSeq platform targeting the 16S rRNA gene variable region V3-V4 from the genomic DNA. Metagenomic data analysis revealed that there was a great diversity in the microbial populations associated with the different land uses, with the informal settlement having the most considerable influence on the bacterial diversity in the water and sediments of the Apies River.

Since the time horizon of a pension fund management is relatively long, we put into consideration four background risks which include inflation, interest rate, investment and income risks. A pension plan member (PPM) is expected to contribute continuously a time-consistent proportion of his income into the scheme. These contributions are invested into a market that is characterized by multiple risk-free assets (which include riskless bonds and bank deposit accounts), stocks and index bonds. The risky assets (stocks and index bonds), interest rates and income process are assumed to follow a jump–diffusion process. Real wealth for the plan member is considered. The resulting Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation was solved using dynamic programming approach. From which, the optimal consumption and optimal investments with jump risks were obtained. Empirical data were collected from Nigeria Stock Exchange; National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria; and Bursary Department, University of Benin, Nigeria. The analyses of the data were carried out using SPSS package in order to obtain the needed information for the parameters in our derived models. The resulting models for optimal portfolio and consumption were solved using MatLab and Mathematica software. We found that inflation, interest rate and income risks have significant influence on the investor's portfolio values in the risky assets. We also found that as the risk averse coefficient increases, consumption increases and vice versa. Furthermore, we found that an increase in income can lead to an increase in the portfolio risks and vice versa. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Consumption; Income risk; Inflation environment; Jump risks; Optimal pension fund","Diffusion; Economic analysis; Financial markets; MATLAB; Pension plans; Consumption; Inflation environment; Jump risk; Mathematica- software; Optimal consumption; Optimal investments; Pension funds; Portfolio selection problems; Dynamic programming",2-s2.0-85029786159

One solution is to impose a lasso penalty to shrink parameter estimates toward zero and perform continuous model selection. The lasso-penalized mixture of linear regressions model (L-MLR) is a class of regularization methods for the model selection problem in the fixed number of variables setting. A new algorithm is proposed for the maximum penalized-likelihood estimation of the L-MLR model. This algorithm is constructed via the minorization–maximization algorithm paradigm. Such a construction allows for coordinate-wise updates of the parameter components, and produces globally convergent sequences of estimates that generate monotonic sequences of penalized log-likelihood values. These three features are missing in the previously presented approximate expectation–maximization algorithms. The previous difficulty in producing a globally convergent algorithm for the maximum penalized-likelihood estimation of the L-MLR model is due to the intractability of finding exact updates for the mixture model mixing proportions in the maximization-step. This issue is resolved by showing that it can be converted into a simple numerical root finding problem that is proven to have a unique solution.

However, these socio-professional trajectories may be subject to informative censoring due to death. This loss to follow-up which is related to an individual's survival, should not be ignored and thus, it is of interest to model jointly these professional trajectories and their survival. The main focus has been made on continuous, binary or ordinal variables while much less attention has been paid to nominal categorical data. Therefore, an extension to the joint modelling of longitudinal nominal data and survival under a likelihood-based approach is proposed. A generalized linear mixed model is considered for modelling the longitudinal nominal data, in addition to two cause-specific proportional hazards model for the survival competing risks data. The association between longitudinal and survival outcomes is captured by assuming a multivariate Gaussian distribution for the joint distribution of the random effects of two sub-models. The proposed joint model provides a robust framework for estimating longitudinal membership probabilities, accounting for informative censoring caused by individual's death. Simulations are carried out to assess the performance of this joint model comparing with the results of the separate longitudinal and competing risks analysis. A disadvantage of joint models is that they are computationally intensive. To overcome this problem, an approach mimicking a meta-analysis strategy of individual participant data is suggested. The relevance of this approach is then illustrated on a large sample of the French salaried population, which contains all employment records between 1976 and 2002. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cause-specific hazards; Generalized linear mixed model; Joint model; Large-scale data; Membership probability","Hazards; Image segmentation; Professional aspects; Random processes; Risk analysis; Trajectories; Competing risks analysis; Generalized linear mixed models; Informative censoring; Joint modeling; Large scale data; Membership probability; Multivariate Gaussian Distributions; Proportional hazards model; Risk assessment",2-s2.0-85032476733

In this work, pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) energy is obtained and used posteriorly for the reverse osmosis (RO) process for seawater desalination. Although PRO process coupled with an RO process has been studied in the past, however, in this work, there is a fundamental difference. Instead of bringing river or wastewaters with low salinity to the coast to be mixed with the seawater to run the PRO process, here is the seawater which is deliberately salinized. This technique has one important consequence, namely, that it is no longer required to be in places where rivers or wastewaters flow into the sea. This important difference eliminates this until now somehow paradoxical requirement if one considers that regions needing desalination are generally poor of water resources. On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that regions needing desalination plants are also regions with rich open salt deposits in the neighborhood; high evaporation, high concentration of salt deposits, and the need for freshwater are all of them directly correlated. Therefore, the idea proposed in the paper is consistent with the problem. The high evaporation in the region which is causing the need for desalination also is creating the solution to do this by using the salt deposits created. The economic feasibility of this method is preliminarily assessed in terms of the thermodynamic limits of extractable energy and then with the cost of the salt required to obtain this energy which is compared with the price from electrical grid. It was found that in order to reduce the amount of salt required for the process, and to make the cost of energy competitive, it is necessary to direct the hypersaline draw solution (draw solution) in a cyclic loop and to have the highest possible volume fraction for the nonsalinized solution (feed solution). Additional R&D is required to explore the possibilities of this concept. © 2018 by ASME.","desalination; pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO); reverse osmosis (RO)","Costs; Deposits; Desalination; Evaporation; Reverse osmosis; Salt deposits; Water resources; Cost of energies; Desalination plant; Draw solutions; Economic feasibilities; Electrical grids; Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO); Seawater desalination; Thermodynamic limits; Seawater",2-s2.0-85031800082

We derive the maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) of regression parameters through the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method and their asymptotic variance–covariance matrix. Furthermore, we also obtain the MLEs’ changing tendency of the lifetime parameters along with logarithmic stress level.

After reviewing and formalizing the definition of the spatially-variant dilation, erosion, opening and closing, the proposed structuring elements are described. These spatially-variant structuring elements are based on ellipses which vary over the image domain adapting locally their orientation according to the multiple orientation vector field and their shape (the eccentricity of the ellipses) according to the distance to relevant contours of the objects. The proposed adaptive morphological filters are used on gray-level images and are compared with spatially-invariant filters, with spatially-variant filters based on a single orientation vector field, and with adaptive morphological bilateral filters.

Peat volume can be calculated from the thickness map, and based on measurements of bulk density and carbon content, carbon stock for the area was estimated. The uncertainty of the estimates was calculated using error propagation rules. We demonstrated this approach in the eastern part of Bengkalis Island in Riau Province, covering an area around 50,000 ha. Results showed that digital mapping method can accurately predict the thickness of peat, explaining up to 98% of the variation of the data with a median relative error of 5% or an average error of 0.3 m. The accuracy of this method depends on the number of field observations. We provided an estimate of the cost and time required for map production, i.e. 2 to 4 months with a cost between $0.3 and $0.5/ha for an area of 50,000 ha. Obviously, there is a tradeoff between cost and accuracy. The advantages and limitations of the method were further discussed. The methodology provides a blueprint for a national-scale peat mapping. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon stock; Climate change; Digital soil mapping; Machine-learning; Open-source; Tropical peatlands","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Computer graphics; Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Costs; Ecology; Ecosystems; Errors; Information dissemination; Laws and legislation; Learning systems; Mapping; Open source software; Open systems; Peat; Software engineering; Soil surveys; Surveying; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Wetlands; Carbon stocks; Digital elevation model; Digital soil mappings; Geographical information; Machine learning models; Open sources; Peat land; Protection and management; Cost benefit analysis; bulk density; carbon sink; climate change; digital mapping; global climate; machine learning; mapping method; peatland; radar; raster; Indonesia; Riau",2-s2.0-85032299744

According to the geometric consistency of IVFPR, the max-consistency index and min-consistency index of an IVFPR are developed respectively. Combining the max-consistency index with min-consistency index, the geometric consistent index of an IVFPR is defined to measure the consistency level of the IVFPR by considering decision maker's (DM's) risk attitude. For improving the unacceptable geometric consistency of an IVFPR, a goal programming model is constructed to derive an acceptable geometric consistent IVFPR. By regarding the geometric consistent conditions of an IVFPR as fuzzy constraints, a fuzzy logarithmic program is established to generate the interval priority weights. In GDM problems, the individual interval priority weights are obtained by solving the corresponding fuzzy logarithmic programs. The similarities between DMs are calculated based on their individual interval priority weights. Subsequently the confidence degrees of DMs are defined to determine DMs' weights. To obtain the collective interval priority weights, a parametric linear program is constructed and transformed into a linear program to resolve. The order of alternatives is generated by the collective interval priority weights. Some examples are analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy logarithmic programming model; Geometric consistent index; Group decision making; Interval valued fuzzy preference relation; Parametric linear programming model","Geometry; Linear programming; Risk assessment; Fuzzy preference relations; Geometric consistent index; Group Decision Making; Parametric linear programming; Programming models; Decision making",2-s2.0-85021183634

In general, knowledge of some statistical parameters of the underlying signal and noise are required to compute the Wiener filter. These parameters are usually estimated from the corrupted image using a local neighborhood, thus assuming that the signal and noise are locally stationary. However, images corrupted by signal-dependent noise, such as Poisson noise, are not locally stationary. In this paper, we are proposing a novel Wiener filtering approach for Poisson corrupted images considering a non-local weighted parameter estimation. In the proposed method, named Poisson Non-Local Wiener filter (PNL-Wiener), filtering parameters are estimated from the degraded image considering a non-local neighborhood, where the weights of the estimation function are computed based on the stochastic distances between image patches.

Among others, these differences have been attributed to the emergence of grassroots initiatives (GIs) that develop radical ideas and sustainable practices. The goal of this paper is to understand the differences in the emergence of GIs for renewable energy in relation to the institutional characteristics of Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. We analyze the possibilities of GIs to emerge and act within three dimensions: the material-economic, the actor-institutional and discursive dimension. We conclude that conditional factors lie within the material-economic dimension in terms of the biophysical conditions, the structure of the economy, energy dependency and the energy market. Within the actor-institutional dimension, we conclude that the presence or absence of fossil fuel incumbents, such as regional utilities, strongly influence the possibilities of GIs. Within the discursive dimension, openness for alternative discourses proved to be enabling for GI-activities, as well as democratized knowledge production. In addition to these conditions of possibility, GIs can also act despite dominant institutions, albeit limited. Finally, GIs need a strong network with knowledge institutes, technology developers and political parties in order to achieve institutional change that enables GIs to flourish. Without institutional space, GIs remain subjected to the dominant power-relations, and cannot exert much influence upon the energy system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conditions of possibility; Grassroots initiatives; Institutional change; Renewable energy transition",,2-s2.0-85029802737

The most popular approach is to relax the ℓ0-optimization problem to an ℓ1-approximation. However, the strength of this convex approximation relies upon rigid properties on the system, which are not verifiable in practice. Greedy algorithms have been proposed in the past to speed up the optimization of the ℓ1 problem, but their computational efficiency comes at the expense of a larger error. In an effort to control error and complexity, this paper goes beyond the ℓ1-approximation by growing neighborhoods of the ℓ1-solution that moves towards the optimal solution. The size of the neighborhood is tunable depending on the computational resources. The proposed algorithm, termed Approximate Kernel RecONstruction (AKRON), yields significantly smaller errors than current greedy methods with a controllable computational cost. By construction, the error of AKRON is smaller than or to equal the ℓ1-solution. AKRON enjoys all the error bounds of ℓ1 under the restricted isometry property condition. We benchmarked AKRON on simulated data from several under-determined systems, and the results show that AKRON can significantly improve the reconstruction error with slightly more computational cost than solving the ℓ1 problem directly. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Compressive sensing; Linear systems; Optimization","Computational complexity; Error analysis; Errors; Linear systems; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Compressive sensing; Computational costs; Computational resources; Convex approximation; Exact reconstruction; Greedy algorithms; Reconstruction error; Restricted isometry properties; Computational efficiency",2-s2.0-85032034379

Strong structuration gives weight not only to actors’ practices, but also to their experiences. Practices and structures are viewed as mutually influencing, as in Giddens’ original conception, but the role of situated, subjective experience is also explicitly acknowledged. Applying this perspective, we show how individual attitudes and beliefs in relation to a niche energy technology are influenced by experience of national economic and innovation policy environments, with in turn implications for expectations of action by self and others. The overall aim is to illustrate a framework that connects individual psychology to practice, with implications for sociotechnical structure.

Methods: Clinical data and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads were obtained for primary HGSOC tumors sequenced by the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS; n=80). Genomic rearrangements were identified, and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to extract rearrangement signatures. The cohort was then dichotomized around the median signature contribution, and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. An independent cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer study (n490) was also examined. The TCGA cohort was dichotomized around the median similarity between tumor copy number profile and a prognostic rearrangement signature, and OS was analyzed. Outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression methods. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We identified five genomic rearrangement signatures (Ov.RS1-5) in HGSOC. Ov.RS3 exhibited 10 kilobase to 10 megabase deletions and tandem duplications, and patients whose tumors exhibited a high contribution from Ov.RS3 had poor OS. The median OS was 22.7months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.2 to 39.0 months) in the Ov.RS3-high group vs 38.2months (95% CI=22.7 to 69.1 months) in the Ov.RS3-low group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.86, 95% CI=1.12 to 3.09, P = .02). For the independent TCGA cohort, median OS rates were 38.0months (95% CI=35.3 to 41.4 months) in the Ov.RS3 highsimilarity group vs 48.9months (95% CI=44.1 to 57.1 months) in the Ov.RS3 low-similarity group (HR=1.54, 95% CI=1.21 to 1.97, P < .001).

What remains unclear is whether sports improve self-regulation or better self-regulators engage in sport. We investigated whether sport participation in early childhood (4–5 years) predicted change in children's self-regulation two years later; and early self-regulation (4–5 years) predicted change in sports participation two years later. Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, which consisted of 4385 children with valid sports participation data at age 4–5 years. Self-regulation was indexed by parent-, teacher-, and observer-report data. Results indicated that young children who participated in individual sports demonstrated marginally but significantly higher self-regulation than those who did not participate. Participation in team sports did not predict change in self-regulation. Moreover, children with poor self-regulation were less likely to participate in sports. The findings provide partial support for hypotheses of bidirectional associations between sport participation and self-regulation in young children. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Early childhood; Physical activity; Preschool; Self-regulation; Sport; Sports participation","Australian; autoregulation; child; childhood; female; human; infant; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; physical activity; preschool child; teacher; team sport; youth sport",2-s2.0-85029892494

By exploiting the quasi-stationarity and extended virtual array structure provided inherently in the nested array, a new narrowband signal model can be obtained, achieving more degrees of freedom (DOFs) than the existing solutions. A sparsity-based recovery algorithm is proposed to fully utilise these DOFs. The suggested method is based on the sparse reconstruction for multiple measurement vector (MMV) which results from the signal subspace of the new signal model. Specifically, the notable advantages of the developed approach can be attributed to the following aspects. First, through a linear transformation, the redundant components in the signal subspace can be eliminated effectively and a covariance matrix with a reduced dimension is constructed, which saves the computational load in sparse signal reconstruction. Second, to further enhance the sparsity and fit the sampled and the actual signal subspace better, we formulate a sparse reconstruction problem that includes a reweighted ℓ1-norm minimisation subject to a weighted error-constrained Frobenius norm. Meanwhile, an explicit upper bound for error-suppression is provided for robust signal recovery. Additionally, the proposed sparsity-aware DOA estimation technique is extended to the wideband signal scenario by performing a group sparse recovery across multiple frequency bins. Last, upper bounds of the resolvable signals are derived for multiple array geometries. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method in terms of DOA estimation accuracy and resolution over the existing techniques. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Direction of arrival (DOA); Nested array; Quasi-stationary signals (QSS); Sparse reconstruction","Covariance matrix; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Frequency estimation; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Recovery; Signal reconstruction; Vectors; Degrees of freedom (DoFs); Direction of arrivalestimation(DOA); Multiple measurement vector (MMV); Nested arrays; Quasi-stationary signals; Robust signal recoveries; Sparse reconstruction; Sparse signal reconstruction; Direction of arrival",2-s2.0-85030853268

This practice, commonly referred to as continuity of care (CoC), is recommended for center-based group settings to provide infants and toddlers with the sensitive, responsive care needed to promote early development. Despite widespread endorsement, there has been limited empirical examination of CoC. This study examines the extent to which CoC experienced in infant-toddler center-based care is associated with social-emotional and language development. Associations of CoC with children's social-emotional development during the infant-toddler period and with later social-emotional and language outcomes at age 3 were investigated in a large sample of children attending high-quality early childhood programs designed for young children growing up in poverty. During the infant-toddler years, CoC was related to higher teacher ratings of self-control, initiative, and attachment, and lower ratings of behavior concerns. In addition, a classroom quality × CoC interaction indicated that CoC differences were larger in higher, than lower, quality infant-toddler classrooms. In contrast, CoC in infant-toddler classrooms was not related to rates of change in teacher ratings of social skills during the infant-toddler years nor to children's vocabulary development or ratings of social skills after they transitioned to preschool. Neither were there quality × CoC interactions at preschool. These findings do not provide clear support for the current widespread recommendations for CoC, but suggest a need for additional research. The need for future research to more fully understand associations with child outcomes as well as to examine potential impacts of CoC on teachers, families, and peers is highlighted. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Child outcomes; Continuity of care; Infant-toddler center-based care","child; childhood; female; human; human experiment; human tissue; infant; language development; linguistics; male; patient care; poverty; self control; social competence; teacher; toddler",2-s2.0-85029170920

Short-texts, which are posted at unprecedented rates, accentuate both the importance of learning tasks and the challenges posed by such large feature space. A collection of social media short-texts does not only provide textual information but also topological information given by the relationships between posts and their authors. The linked nature of social data causes new complementary data dimensions to be added to the feature space, which, at the same time, becomes sparser. Additionally, in the context of social media, posts usually arrive simultaneously in streams, which hinders the deployment of efficient traditional feature selection techniques that assume a feature space fully known in advance. Hence, efficient and scalable online feature selection becomes an important requirement in numerous large-scale social applications. This work presents an online feature selection technique for high-dimensional data based on the integration of two information sources, social and content-based, for the real-time classification of short-text streams coming from social media. It focuses on discovering implicit relations amongst new posts, already known ones and their corresponding authors to identify groups of socially related posts. Then, each discovered group is represented by a set of non-redundant and relevant textual features. Finally, such features are used to train different learning models for classifying newly arriving posts. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world short-texts demonstrate that the proposed approach helps to improve classification results when compared to state-of-the-art and traditional online feature selection techniques. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Micro-blogging communities; Online feature selection","Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Classification results; High dimensional data; Micro blogging; Online feature selection; Selection techniques; Social applications; Textual information; Topological information; Feature extraction",2-s2.0-85019594702

In current analyses of ACLMS, it is implicitly or explicitly assumed that the length of the adaptive filter is equal to that of the unknown system's impulse response (optimal model order). In many applications, however, the length of the adaptive filter is smaller than required, the so called deficient length case, which renders the analysis for a ‘sufficient length’ ACLMS inadequate. To this end, we examine the statistical behaviour of the ACLMS algorithm in undermodelling situations. Exact expressions are developed to completely characterise both the transient and steady-state mean and mean square performances of the deficient length ACLMS for general second order noncircular Gaussian input signals. This is achieved using the recently introduced approximate uncorrelating transform (AUT), in order to jointly diagonalise the covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices with a single singular value decomposition (SVD), which both simplifies the analysis and enables a link between the degree of input noncircularity and the steady state mean square error (MSE) performance of the deficient length ACLMS.

Carotid arteries are located closely to bones and osteoid structures. Osteoid structures and carotid arteries are frequently confused with each other when performing vessel evaluations. This study provides a novel method for carotid artery lumen segmentation on CTA images by using automatic vessel segmentation with inverse approach, in which vessel segmentation is performed after bone region is segmented and eliminated. The region growing and random walk segmentation methods are utilized in the elimination of bone region and the vessel segmentation. The seed points in the mentioned methods are not manually determined by any starting point. In automatic segmentation, seeds are selected from the experimentally determined intervals according to the local histogram. The stages of preprocessing and post-processing are utilized for better segmentation. The tracking of vessel centers based on continuity is employed for 3D reconstruction and 3D imaging of the vessels. Experiments were conducted with different data sets including various CTA images by using the mentioned methods. As a result, dice similarity rate above 92% was achieved together with 0.16 mm Msd and 99% accuracy. It was concluded based on these results that the proposed method provides successful results in different points of common, internal, external, vertebral arteries, carotid bifurcation and locales close to osteoid structures which are deemed challenging regions for carotid artery lumen segmentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","3D vessel segmentation; Automatic segmentation; Carotid arteries; Carotid artery segmentation; Carotid lumen segmentation; CT angiography (CTA)","Bone; Computerized tomography; Inverse problems; Automatic segmentations; Carotid artery; CT angiography; Lumen segmentations; Vessel segmentation; Image segmentation",2-s2.0-85032030985

The aim of this study was to determine the demographic and angioarchitectural features associated with clinical presentation of seizures in patients with brain AVMs. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of all consecutive patients who presented to three interventional neuroradiology hospitals, with brain AVMs in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, over a period of 10 years. The demographic and clinical presentations were derived from patient's electronic medical records. Radiological features were determined using axial Computerized Topography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan.

A typical JPEG anti-forensic method is adding anti-forensic dither to DCT transform coefficients and erasing blocking artifact to remove the trace of compression history. To deal with this challenge in JPEG forensics, in this paper, we propose a novel countering method based on the noise level estimation to identify the uncompressed images from those forged ones. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several image databases with only one-dimensional feature.

A given player acts as a leader toward players in lower levels, and as a follower toward players in higher levels. We consider the case of either perfect or incomplete information, which in this context means that players either have complete information about other players within their level (perfect information) or lack information at the present timestep about other players within their level (incomplete information). Players always have perfect information about all players which are (relative) followers, and incomplete information about players which are (relative) leaders. The Cournot-type adjustment process under these information structures at each timestep results in the temporal dynamics of the game. As we consider dynamic games, we observe a variety of behaviors in time, including convergence to steady state or equilibrium quantities, cycles or periodic oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. We find that the costs facing each player strongly influence the form of the long-time dynamics, as will the information structure (perfect or incomplete) selected. One interesting finding is that under perfect information players tend to quickly converge upon their respective equilibrium values, while incomplete information can result in loss of regularity and the emergence of periodic or chaotic dynamics. However, in cases where players may be pushed out of the game in the presence of high relative costs and perfect information, we find that non-equilibrium dynamics under incomplete information allow such players to retain positive production, hence they are able to remain in the game. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Dynamic games; Information hierarchy; Leader–follower games; Nonlinear dynamics","Computational methods; Mathematical techniques; Complete information; Convergence to steady state; Dynamic game; Incomplete information; Information hierarchy; Information structures; Non-equilibrium dynamics; Perfect informations; Dynamics",2-s2.0-85030851323

Its mean squared displacement (MSD) is not a power law function of time, but instead a logarithmic function, and in some cases grows even more slowly than the logarithmic rate. The distributed-order fractional diffusion equation model simply does not work for the general ultraslow diffusion. Recent study has used the local structural derivative to describe ultraslow diffusion dynamics by using the inverse Mittag–Leffler function as the structural function, in which the MSD is a function of inverse Mittag–Leffler function. In this study, a new stretched logarithmic diffusion law and its underlying non-local structural derivative diffusion model are proposed to characterize the ultraslow diffusion in aging dense colloidal glass at both the short and long waiting times. It is observed that the aging dynamics of dense colloids is a class of the stretched logarithmic ultraslow diffusion processes. Compared with the power, the logarithmic, and the inverse Mittag–Leffler diffusion laws, the stretched logarithmic diffusion law has better precision in fitting the MSD of the colloidal particles at high densities.

Nodes are assumed to be equipped with ranging and bearing sensors with their measurement noise to be dependent on sensor to target distance. To cope with state-dependent noise of sensors, the nonlinear observation model is proposed to be rewritten into a new multiplicative form. Using unscented transformation, the linearized form of the new observation model is derived. Then, new formulations of GUIF are derived for state estimation of the target.

Microvascular reactivity, via NIRS-derived measurements of post-occlusion tissue saturation index (TSI%) and total microvascular hemoglobin + myoglobin concentration ([Hb]total), were assessed in each participant before and immediately after exposure to a 30 min retrograde shear treatment. Retrograde shear was achieved via a blood pressure cuff placed below the knee inflated to 75 mm Hg. One leg was exposed to the retrograde shear (Treatment leg) and the contralateral leg served as a non-treatment control. In the Treatment leg, significant increases in retrograde shear rate occurred during the retrograde intervention. Following the intervention, the area under the TSI% post-occlusion response curve, which represents the total microvascular reactivity response, and the absolute peak TSI% response were significantly increased compared to pre-intervention in the Treatment leg, but not the Control leg. The absolute peak [Hb]total response was significantly increased post-intervention in both legs. These results are in contrast to our hypothesis that 75 mm Hg cuff inflation, designed to increase retrograde shear rate in the femoral artery would negatively affect post-occlusive microvascular reactivity.

However, the most important component of a group recommendation involves ensuring that majority of the members in a group are satisfied with the recommended results.

This configuration maintains the properties of a single GS and at the same time provides more tunability for designing a graphene-based PCA (GPCA). When a GS is surrounded by a high-index media, propagating wave vector along the structure becomes spatially dispersive, because the group velocity of the propagating wave is greatly reduced and it becomes comparable to Fermi velocity in graphene. In this situation, it is necessary to use a nonlocal conductivity model for graphene. In this paper, a nonlocal per unit length circuit model is employed to study wave propagation in the GPCA. In the circuit model, the nonlocal behavior will be modeled via a per unit length quantum capacitance that under certain conditions it is simplified to quantum capacitance in graphene. In deep subwavelength regime, due to strong coupling between GSs in the the double stacked configuration, it can be replaced by a single GS that its conductivity is two times greater than the former case.

The forward problem is discretized using finite-difference methods and the inverse problem is formulated as a minimization problem with regularization terms. In order to overcome disturbance of local minimum, a wavelet multiscale method is applied to solve this parameter identification inverse problem. This method works by decomposing the inverse problem into multiple scales with wavelet transform so that the original inverse problem is reformulated to a set of sub-inverse problems relying on scale variables, and successively solving these sub-inverse problems according to the size of scale from the smallest to the largest. The stable and fast regularized Gauss–Newton method is applied to each scale.

We analyzed print media coverage of the project in six Canadian newspapers, including 2097 articles published from 2008 to 2014. The objectives were threefold: 1) to characterize media framing of the project using a risk/benefit framework; 2) to identify regional differences in framing between the two affected provinces; and 3) to investigate the framing of environmental risk. Our findings demonstrate that public debate is dominated by environmental risk of the project with a tendency to frame the project as a trade-off between economic benefit and environment risk. Despite a strongly regional distribution of risks and benefits, we did not find substantial differences in framing between newspapers in the two affected provinces. Finally we found that the environmental risk frame was presented predominately according to potential local impacts due to pipeline or tanker rupture.

The present study identified profiles of differential alcohol use, depression, key psychosocial indicators of drinking (e.g., normative perceptions) and examined the relationship between these profiles and alcohol-related consequences. Method Students with a history of risky drinking and elevated depressed mood (n = 311; 62.4% female) completed a web-based survey assessing typical and peak drinking, depressive symptoms, descriptive norms, drinking to cope motives, protective behavioral strategies, and alcohol-related consequences. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis was used to classify participants into distinct profiles focusing on alcohol use patterns and level of depressed mood and drinking related constructs. Profiles were then compared based on their association with reported rates of alcohol-related consequences. Four profiles emerged: 1) Mild Depression, Heavy Drinkers; 2) Mild Depression, Severe Drinkers; 3) Moderate Depression, Heavy Drinkers; and 4) Moderate Depression, Severe Drinkers. Findings revealed significant differences between the four profiles on both risky drinking and alcohol-related consequences. Conclusion These findings suggest the importance of assessing and addressing depressive symptoms among college students in order to reduce rates of risky drinking and alcohol-related consequences. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Comorbidity; Depressed mood; Drinking; Profile analysis",,2-s2.0-85032808212

Prior research provides mixed evidence about whether teachers’ education predicts early childhood education (ECE) classroom quality and children's outcomes. Data are drawn from a Midwestern study of community child care centers (typically private pay non-profit or for-profit child care centers that are not directly funded by government programs) and the children ages 3–5 in their care (N = 189 centers and 661 children). This study takes advantage of a very detailed set of teacher training measures that includes information on education degrees, ECE credit-based training, and placement on the state's 17-level professional career ladder (the Registry). Using these measures, the current study is able to examine whether variations in degrees and ECE credit-based training for teachers predict observed classroom quality and children's school readiness skills. Analyses control for a rich set of variables, including children's demographic information and fall assessment scores, teachers’ work-related characteristics (e.g., motivation for ECE work), and classrooms and programs’ features. Results from regression models suggest few associations between teachers’ education level, ECE credits, or level on the professional career ladder and observed classroom quality. The key exception is that teachers who do not have any postsecondary education and training in ECE are in classrooms of significantly lower quality compared with teachers who have a college degree. Results from hierarchical linear models indicate that teachers’ education does not predict children's early academic skills. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Child care; Classroom quality; School readiness; Teacher education and training","career mobility; child; child care; childhood; female; government; human; infant; major clinical study; male; motivation; multicenter study; profit; register; skill; teacher training",2-s2.0-85031757370

However, there have been few studies in field conditions because of experimental constraints but field data are needed to improve models that forecast the effects of climate change on SOM decomposition rates and the impact of these changing rates on atmospheric CO2 concentration. In 2009 a fire at a Eucalyptus forest site in Australia killed all standing vegetation. Trenched plots were installed in 2010, approximately 12 months after the fire, and were maintained plant-free for the subsequent year. In 2011, after forest re-growth outside the trenched plots, we compared SOM decomposition rates in the presence of plants (rooted plots) and in the absence of plants (trenched plots) using a natural abundance stable carbon isotope technique with minimal disturbance of the soil. We then compared our results to those obtained in another study conducted at the same time and the same plots using laboratory incubations of sieved soil samples. There was no difference in SOM decomposition rates between the trenched and the rooted plots estimated using our non-disruptive technique. In contrast, laboratory incubations of sieved soils highlighted a two-fold increase in SOM decomposition rates in the rooted plots compared with rates from the trenched plots. Our results suggest that rhizosphere priming may not actively influence soil carbon turnover in the undisturbed soil environment and question conclusions from laboratory incubation studies. We attribute the different findings from laboratory and field studies to the physical disturbance of the soil involved in laboratory incubations causing the release of previously protected substrates, making them available for decomposition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Decomposition; Priming effect; Rhizosphere; Soil organic matter; Stable carbon isotopes","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Climate change; Climate models; Decomposition; Forestry; Isotopes; Laboratories; Organic compounds; Eucalyptus forests; Laboratory and field studies; Physical disturbance; Priming effects; Rhizosphere; Soil carbon turnover; Soil organic matters; Stable carbon isotopes; Soils; carbon cycle; carbon isotope; climate change; climate effect; decomposition; disturbance; estimation method; evergreen forest; rhizosphere; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil organic matter; stable isotope; Australia; Eucalyptus",2-s2.0-85032265550

Human prosperity inside urban communities is unambiguously dependent on the status of urban soils and house dusts. However, environmental occurrence and sources of release of these SVOCs are challenging in Nepalese cities, as exceptionally very limited data are accessible. This motivated us to explore the environmental fate, their source/sink susceptibilities and health risk associated with PAHs. In this study, we investigated the contamination level, environmental fate and sources/sink of 16 EPA's priority pollutants in surface soil and house dusts from four major cities of Nepal. Additionally, the toxicological effect of individual PAH was studied to assess the health risk of PAHs. Generally, the concentrations of ∑16PAHs in surface soil were 1.5 times higher than house dust, and ranged 767–6770 ng/g dry weight (dw) (median 1810 ng/g dw), and 747–4910 dw (median 1320 ng/g dw), respectively. High molecular weight-PAHs both in soil and dust were more abundant than low molecular weight-PAHs, suggesting the dominance of pyrogenic source. Moderate to weak correlation of TOC and BC with PAHs in soil and dust suggested little or no role of soil organic carbon in sorption of PAHs. Source diagnostic ratio and principal component analysis indicated fossil fuel combustion, traffic/vehicular emissions and combustion of biomass are the principal sources of PAHs contamination in Nepalese urban environment. The high average TEQ value of PAHs in soil than dust suggested high risk of soil carcinogenicity compared to dust. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass combustion; Persistent organic pollutants; Petrogenic; Principal component analysis; Pyrogenic; Toxicity equivalence quantity","Air pollution; Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbon; Combustion; Dust; Environmental Protection Agency; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Health risks; Houses; Hydrocarbons; Molecular weight; Organic carbon; Organic pollutants; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Principal component analysis; Risk assessment; Soils; Volatile organic compounds; Biomass combustion; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Petrogenic; Pyrogenic; Toxicity equivalences; Soil pollution",2-s2.0-85032685728

Less is known about the relation between perceived self-efficacy and specific PTSD symptoms such as intrusions. These two experiments tested the causal relationship between perceived self-efficacy and intrusions from a trauma film. Methods In Experiment I, healthy student participants received a self-efficacy manipulation consisting of the recall of autobiographical memories of success (high self-efficacy condition), failure (low self-efficacy condition) or ‘important’ memories (control condition). Afterwards, they viewed a trauma film and recorded their intrusions of the film in the following week. In Experiment II the self-efficacy manipulation was given after the film. Results In contrast to expectations, the high self-efficacy condition reported a higher number of intrusions relative to the low self-efficacy condition in both experiments. Limitations The trauma film provides experimental control but precludes generalization to real-life trauma. The effect of the experimental manipulation was small. The control condition also affected mood and confidence. Conclusions The results suggest that the relation between self-efficacy and intrusions development is causal, but not straightforward. Recalling personal memories of success before or after a traumatic event may increase the risk of developing intrusions, at least under some circumstances. Conversely, recalling past failure experiences may be protective, perhaps by preparing the individual for adversity, or prompting them to search for coping strategies that have been successful in the past. Overall, autobiographical recall involves complex processes related to the self that could be useful but need to be more fully understood. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Autobiographical memory; Intrusions; Posttraumatic stress; Self-efficacy; Trauma film","adult; Article; autobiographical memory; avoidance behavior; coping behavior; depression; distress syndrome; female; film; human; human experiment; male; mood; posttraumatic stress disorder; randomization; recall; self concept; social desirability; social interaction; task performance",2-s2.0-85025137806

The study focused on predictors of literacy skills in children entering primary school. It examined the pathways from parental education, income and beliefs to children's literacy skills through family investments: resources available at home, joint parent-child literacy activities and access to outside-home resources and activities. As hypothesized, these investments mediated the relation of parental income and education to child literacy, with education being more strongly related to child outcomes than income. Beliefs about the importance of developing literacy skills prior to school were found to be independent of SES and linked to child outcomes through the same sorts of family investments as SES.

By investing in an electrolyzer, excess electricity from renewable production can be stored as CH4 by biological methanation of H2 with CO2 originating from the biogas plant. The main components of the system are an electrolyzer that is connected to an electric grid and an anaerobic digester where the methanation takes place as well as a biogas upgrading unit. First the energy flow of the system was studied, and secondly the operation costs of the system as well as the electrolyzer investment payback time were evaluated. The study showed that up to 40% of the electricity fed into the system can be stored as biomethane, and the system energy flow is most sensitive to the electrolyzer efficiency. The economics of the studied system depend mostly on the electrolyzer investment cost and desired target price for the CH4. The system can be run economically with current electricity prices if the electrolyzer investment costs decrease 60–72% or the price of CH4 increases 20–76% depending on the investment interest and price fluctuation scheme. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomethane; Flexibility; Integrated system; Power to biogas; Renewable power production","Biogas; Costs; Economic analysis; Economics; Electric power generation; Electrolytic cells; Hydrogenation; Investments; Methanation; Anaerobic digester; Biomethane; Feasibility analysis; Flexibility; Integrated systems; Operating principles; Renewable power production; Techno-Economic analysis; Electric power system economics; biofuel; biogas; electricity; energy efficiency; integrated approach; operations technology; power generation; power plant; price dynamics; renewable resource; technical efficiency",2-s2.0-85032006002

This paper presents a non-linear optimization model for a two-echelon supply chain, for a unique product. In addition, the model includes the consumers’ maximum willingness to pay, taking socioeconomic differences into account. To do so, the constrained multinomial logit for discrete choices is used to estimate demand levels. Then, a metaheuristic approach based on particle swarm optimization is proposed to determine the optimal product sales price and inventory coordination variables. To validate the proposed model, a supply chain of a technological product was chosen and three scenarios are analyzed: discounts, demand segmentation and demand overestimation. Results are analyzed on the basis of profits, lotsizing and inventory turnover and market share. It can be concluded that the maximum willingness to pay must be taken into consideration, otherwise fictitious profits may mislead decision making, and although the market share would seem to improve, overall profits are not in fact necessarily better. © 2018 Growing Science Ltd.

Our aim was to evaluate how different drying techniques preserve small aggregate building units after different disintegration steps. After applying fast wetting, slaking, or ultrasonic dispersion at 440 J mL− 1 to Cambisol topsoils under either long-term forest, grassland, or arable soil management, aggregate-size distributions were assessed using fast image analyses after optical particle-size assessment prior and after air- and freeze-drying. Microaggregates isolated by dry-sieving served as control. While ultrasonic dispersion significantly disintegrated soil aggregates into smaller units, slaking in water did not. Intriguingly, freeze-drying preserved the aggregate size distribution fairly well, with a reaggregation ranging between 1.2 and 10.1%. In contrast, air-drying led to substantial reaggregation of particles ranging between 20.4 and 44.9%. However, freeze-drying also led to slight deformation of particles and also to a redistribution of elements between size-fractions, the extent of which being different for the samples under different land-use. We conclude that ultrasonic treatment followed by freeze-drying is suitable to preserve the correct aggregate size of at least Cambisols, but the properties of the secondary particles may still not reflect true geometric forms and chemical properties. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cambisol; Land-use; Microaggregate-size distribution; Scanning electron microscopy; Soil aggregates","Aggregates; Agronomy; Drying; Historic preservation; Land use; Low temperature drying; Particle size; Scanning electron microscopy; Size distribution; Soil mechanics; Soils; Ultrasonic dispersion; Aggregate size distributions; Cambisol; Drying technique; Secondary particles; Slight deformations; Soil aggregate; Soil microaggregates; Ultrasonic treatments; Particle size analysis; aggregate size; Cambisol; geometry; land use change; microaggregate; particle size; scanning electron microscopy; size distribution; soil aggregate; soil management; soil property; topsoil",2-s2.0-85032491101

Consequently, anticipate its presence is a matter of importance to prevent future risks. The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of central segregation severity in continuous cast steel slabs. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, based on support vector machines (SVMs) in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, for predicting the centerline segregation from operation input parameters determined experimentally in continuous cast steel slabs. This optimization technique involves kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. Additionally, a multilayer perceptron network (MLP) and a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) approach, this last method also in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, were fitted to the experimental data with comparison purposes. To this end, the most important physical–chemical parameters of this industrial process are monitored and analyzed. The results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each physical–chemical variables on the segregation is presented through the model. Secondly, some models for predicting segregation are obtained with success. Indeed, regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and coefficients of determination equal to 0.98 for continuity factor estimation and 0.97 for average width were obtained when this hybrid PSO–SVM-based model with RBF kernel function was applied to the experimental dataset, respectively. Furthermore, the results obtained with the MLP and PSO–MARS-based models are clearly worse than those obtained with the PSO–RBF–SVM-based model. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter.

This paper draws from research previously conducted in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, economics, and cognitive science to build a case for why we would not necessarily expect the effects of explanatory variables to be stable over time. The review of this literature suggests that temporal instability is likely to exist for a number of fundamental behavioral reasons, and this temporal instability is supported by the findings of several recent accident-data analyses. The paper goes on to discuss the implications of this temporal instability for contemporary accident-data modeling methods (unobserved heterogeneity, data driven, traditional, and causal inference methods) and concludes with a discussion of how temporal instability might be addressed and how its likely presence can be accounted for to better interpret accident data-analysis findings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accident likelihood; Accident severity; Attitudes; Cognitive science; Highway safety; Statistical and econometric methods; Temporal stability; Unobserved heterogeneity",,2-s2.0-85032566625

We can think of migration as a kind of risky investment, so risk attitudes can produce an effect on the migration decision. In order to understand the relationship between risk preference and the evolution of cooperation, the spatial prisoner's dilemma game model with individual migration based on risk preference is established. By introducing the homogeneity of risk preference, we find that lower risk aversion values keep a high level of cooperation under a larger defection parameter, while the cooperation level can be raised when the whole population is risk-seeking and at lower risk aversion values under a smaller defection parameter. Under the heterogeneous risk preference assumption, simulation results indicate that the cooperation strategy is a winning strategy in a steady state for a wide parameter space and the cooperation level decreases with increasing in the variance of risk preference. From typical snapshots, we can see that co-evolution of the network structure and cooperation strategy has been realized. Cooperative clusters can also be found in the typical snapshots, which have proved the migration mechanism based on risk to be effective in favoring the evolution of cooperation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cooperation; Migration; Risk preference; Spatial prisoner's dilemma game","Game theory; Co-operation strategy; Cooperation; Evolution of cooperation; Individual migrations; Migration; Migration mechanisms; Risk preference; Spatial prisoner's dilemma game; Risk perception",2-s2.0-85032700143

Numerous studies have suggested several ecological factors that can determine species presence-absence: environmental factors (i.e. abiotic environments), interactions among species (i.e. biotic interactions) and dispersal process. While various ecological factors have been considered, less attention has been given to the problem of understanding how different dispersal patterns, in interaction with other factors, shape community assembly in the presence of priority effects (i.e. where relative initial abundances determine the long-term presence-absence of each species). By employing both local and non-local dispersal models, we investigate the consequences of different dispersal patterns on the occurrence of priority effects and coexistence in multi-species communities. In the case of non-local, but short-range dispersal, we observe agreement with the predictions of local models for weak and medium dispersal strength, but disagreement for relatively strong dispersal levels. Our analysis shows the existence of a threshold value in dispersal strength (i.e. saddle-node bifurcation) above which priority effects disappear. These results also reveal a co-dimension 2 point, corresponding to a degenerate transcritical bifurcation: at this point, the transcritical bifurcation changes from subcritical to supercritical with corresponding creation of a saddle-node bifurcation curve. We observe further contrasting effects of non-local dispersal as dispersal distance changes: while very long-range dispersal can lead to species extinctions, intermediate-range dispersal can permit more outcomes with multi-species coexistence than short-range dispersal (or purely local dispersal). Overall, our results show that priority effects are more pronounced in the non-local dispersal models than in the local dispersal models. Taken together, our findings highlight the profound delicacy in the mediation of priority effects by dispersal processes: “big steps” can have more influence than many “small steps”. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biotic and abiotic factors; Coexistence; Local and non-local dispersal; Priority effects","Bifurcation (mathematics); Ecology; Abiotic factors; Coexistence; Environmental factors; Multi-species communities; Nonlocal; Priority effects; Saddle node bifurcation; Transcritical bifurcation; Nonlinear analysis",2-s2.0-85026801871

The evaluation of these end points is important to inform clinical practice. However, although different measures can be used to describe the effect of treatment on these end points, we believe that any treatment benefit in a given trial is best reported using various absolute and relative measures. Our goal is to help clinicians understand the strengths and limitations of the traditional and novel measures used to denote the effect of treatment in randomized trials. Although none of these measures can reliably predict the outcome of individual patients, some measures could be added to the commonly used hazard ratio to provide a more patient-oriented assessment of treatment benefit. In particular, the difference of mean survival times quantifies the average survival benefit for a patient receiving a new treatment compared with a patient treated with standard of care, whereas the net benefit quantifies the probability of a patient receiving the new treatment to live longer by at leastmmonths (for any number of monthsmof interest) than a patient receiving the standard treatment. We encourage statisticians and clinical scientists to include various measures of treatment benefit in the reports of phase III trials, acknowledging that different clinical situations may call for different measures of treatment effect.

The purpose of this study was to use micromorphological analysis and NIRS techniques to assess the role of soil fauna in the recovery of soil aggregates and in the modification of soil microstructure in a chronosequence of rehabilitated areas at Cerrejon coal mine (La Guajira, Colombia). 64 soil samples were taken from rehabilitated areas (from 1 to 20 years ago) and from natural dry tropical forests Soil macroaggregates were subdivided into three categories: biogenic (BA), physical (PA), and non-aggregated soil (NAS). 32 samples were used for NIRS analysis, while ten thin sections of resin-impregnated soil blocks were micromorphologically analyzed. Principal component analysis of NIRS spectra showed a clear separation between BA, PA, and NAS. Likewise, an increase in BA was observed in the intermediate and advanced stages of rehabilitation. Respect to the micromorphological features, there was a clear change from a matrix of silt-sized quartz, unaccomodated peds, and unstructured materials with non-existent biogenic activity at the 2-year site to the formation of consolidated aggregates, more homogenized soil and increased biological activity at the 20-year site.

Through the review of CBC initiatives in developing countries, we contribute to the debate by analysing how players influence different factors that determine the outcomes of CBC. We highlight several points. First, the promise of benefits has been overshadowed by constraints on the extraction of natural resources, along with the use of governmental schemes to extract partially the rents from CBC, which has left little to share inside the communities. Second, CBC design and implementation has often overlooked the asymmetries of power within the community and at the individual level, which has produced unequal access to the design, decision-making and outcomes of this activity. While the elites have had a determinant role in shaping the governance of CBC, external agents’ promotion of CBC has tended to reproduce the existent negotiating power at the community, local and national levels. Fourth, land contestation plays a key role in the dynamics of relationship and conflict between the governments, corporate interests and the communities.

In this study, soil samples across China collected in 2011 and 2016 were used to determine the concentrations of arsenic in arable soils. The median concentration of arsenic in surface soils was 9.7 mg/kg. The inventory of arsenic in the Chinese agricultural surface soils was estimated to be 3.7 × 106 tons. In general, arsenic contamination was found higher in South and Northeast China than in other regions, with means of 18.7 and 15.8 mg/kg, respectively. Vertically, arsenic concentrations were higher in top layer (0–15 cm) soils (median of 9.8 mg/kg) and decreased with soil depth (medians of 8.9 mg/kg at 15–30 cm and 8.0 mg/kg at 30–45 cm). By comparing with published data, an increasing accumulation trend over the past decades was found and this enhancement was positively related with the long-term application of fertilizers in agricultural practice, especially phosphate fertilizers. Soil pH was found to affect the movement of arsenic in soil, and high-pH conditions enhanced the pool of arsenic. The ecological risk assessment revealed that arsenic in Chinese agricultural soil posed a low risk to the ecosystem. Regarding human health, the mean hazard indices (HIs) of arsenic were below 1, suggesting an absence of non-carcinogenic risks. In addition, the cancer risks of arsenic in all soil samples were within the acceptable range (below 1 × 10− 4), indicating low to very low risks to the exposed population.

Methods 41 overweight adolescents (aged 12–18 years) were randomly assigned to a cue exposure intervention or a lifestyle intervention (control condition). Habituation of food cue reactivity (self-reported desire to eat and salivation) and CS-US expectancy were measured during both sessions, and EAH was measured at the end of session two. Results Compared to the control condition, the cue exposure condition showed less EAH for the exposed food item as well as for the non-exposed food items. Larger within-session (WSH) and between-session habituation (BSH) of cue reactivity were not related to less EAH, change in CS-US expectancy was unrelated to EAH. Limitations The study was underpowered, and compliance to homework instructions between sessions was poor, intervention effects might have been larger when participants adhered to daily homework exercises. Conclusions Food cue exposure was effective to reduce EAH of exposed and non-exposed food items, indicating generalisability of the exposure effect.

A reliable detection of synthetic speech is key to develop countermeasure for synthetic speech based spoofing attacks. In this paper, we targeted that by focusing on three major types of artifacts related to magnitude, phase and pitch variation, which are introduced during the generation of synthetic speech. We proposed a new approach to detect synthetic speech using score-level fusion of front-end features namely, constant Q cepstral coefficients (CQCCs), all-pole group delay function (APGDF) and fundamental frequency variation (FFV). CQCC and APGDF were individually used earlier for spoofing detection task and yielded the best performance among magnitude and phase spectrum related features, respectively. The novel FFV feature introduced in this paper to extract pitch variation at frame-level, provides complementary information to CQCC and APGDF. Experimental results show that the proposed approach produces the best stand-alone spoofing detection performance using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based classifier on ASVspoof 2015 evaluation dataset. An overall equal error rate of 0.05% with a relative performance improvement of 76.19% over the next best-reported results is obtained using the proposed method.

The perturbation is in the form of first partial derivative in time term with a spatially periodic gain/loss coefficient. When the kink interacts with the perturbation, the kink's internal mode is excited with the amplitude varying in time quasiperiodically. The maximal value of the amplitude was found to grow when the kink velocity is such that it travels one period of the gain/loss prefactor in nearly one period of the kink's internal mode. It is also found that the kink's translational and vibrational modes are coupled in a way that an increase in the kink's internal mode amplitude results in a decrease in kink velocity. The results obtained with the collective variable method are in a good qualitative agreement with the numerical simulations for the continuum model. The results of the present study suggest that kink dynamics in open systems with balanced gain and loss can have new features in comparison with the case of conservative systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Kink's internal mode; PT-symmetry; Resonant effect; ϕ4 model","Continuum mechanics; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Collective variables; Conservative systems; Internal modes; PT symmetries; Resonant effect; Resonant interaction; Symmetric perturbations; Two-degree of freedom; Numerical methods",2-s2.0-85026657395

Such methods have major deficiencies, caused by time-consuming and labor-intensive incubation and purification steps. In this contribution, a novel SERS substrate for qualitative virus detection was developed and described. The substrate is composed of a thin silver film with folded surface structure containing pore-like nanoscale cavities and indentations, deposited on mica substrate by electron beam physical vapor deposition method. Pore-like structures are semi-regularly arrayed, with a rough surface in between, allowing for SERS activity, and their size and periodicity can be manipulated in the manufacturing process. It was speculated that viral particles could be trapped in these structures and would generate easily detectable enhanced Raman signals. The SERS substrate was tested against detection of four virus species – rabbit myxomatosis virus, canine distemper virus, tobacco mosaic virus and potato virus X. Specific spectra were obtained and analyzed for each virus. Data analysis demonstrated successful differentiation between tested species.

In this effectiveness study, a population-representative sample of 5436 3–6-year-old Danish children from 154 daycare centers participated in a cluster-randomized evaluation of three variations of a language-literacy focused curriculum (LEAP) comprising 40 twice-weekly 30-min lessons. LEAP-LARGE and LEAP-SMALL conditions involved educators’ implementation of a scope and sequence of objectives using scripted lessons provided to whole-class and small groups, respectively. In LEAP-OPEN, educators followed the scope and sequence but were allowed to determine the instructional activities for each of 40 lessons (i.e., they received no scripted lessons). A business-as-usual (BAU) condition served as the control. Overall, the largest effect sizes for children's language and emergent literacy outcomes were found for LEAP-OPEN, although the other two LEAP conditions had positive effects for literacy outcomes. Analysis of moderation effects showed no moderation effects for children's socioeconomic status or for non-Danish children. Finally, there was a significant association between children's amount of exposure to the program and both language and literacy outcomes, with higher exposure associated with better outcomes: specifically, non-Danish children benefitted more than native Danish children from higher exposure for language outcomes.

While relying exclusively on natural landmarks for that task is the preferred option, their use is somewhat limited because the proposed methods are complex, require high computational power, and are not reliable in all environments. On the other hand, artificial landmarks can be placed in order to alleviate these problems. In particular, square fiducial markers are one of the most popular tools for camera pose estimation due to their high performance and precision. However, the state-of-the-art methods still perform poorly under difficult image conditions, such as camera defocus, motion blur, small scale or non-uniform lighting. This paper proposes a method to robustly detect this type of landmarks under challenging image conditions present in realistic scenarios. To do so, we re-define the marker identification problem as a classification one based on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Second, we propose a procedure to create a training dataset of synthetically generated images affected by several challenging transformations. Third, we show that, in this problem, a classifier can be trained using exclusively synthetic data, performing well in real and challenging conditions. Different types of classifiers have been tested to prove the validity of our proposal (namely, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)), and statistical analyses have been performed in order to determine the best approach for our problem. Finally, the obtained classifiers have been compared to the ArUco and AprilTags fiducial marker systems in challenging video sequences.

Although electrical power utilities are required and/or encouraged to comply with these policies, their executives lack direct incentives to do so. In this study, a novel incentive mechanism is evaluated for aligning utility executive compensation with such policies. First, an overview is provided on chief executive officer (CEO) pay and the GHG emissions of utilities. The relationship between GHG emissions, renewable energy diversification, and CEO pay is examined using the case study of three of the largest electric utilities in Michigan. The results show that the regulated utility market is not consistently rewarding CEOs with higher compensation for decreasing GHG emissions and that both an approach incentivizing RETs adoption and an approach encouraging GHG emissions have deficiencies. A combined approach is then analyzed that results in a compensation equation allowing for utility executives to receive incentive pay for reducing overall emissions and increasing renewable generation. The results indicate that by careful calibration of the proposed incentive equations the harmful effects of emissions can be prevented through CEO incentive pay. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CEO compensation; Electric utility; Emissions; Executive compensation",,2-s2.0-85031737547

We apply MSEBSS to financial markets and results show American stock markets have the lowest complexity compared with European and Asian markets. There are exceptions to the regularity that stock markets show a decreasing complexity over the time scale, indicating a periodicity at certain scales. Based on MSEBSS, we introduce the modified multiscale cross-sample entropy measure based on symbolic representation and similarity (MCSEBSS) to consider the degree of the asynchrony between distinct time series. Stock markets from the same area have higher synchrony than those from different areas. And for stock markets having relative high synchrony, the entropy values will decrease with the increasing scale factor. While for stock markets having high asynchrony, the entropy values will not decrease with the increasing scale factor sometimes they tend to increase.

The goal in RGD is to tailor drug-doses to the stochastic evolution of each individual patient's disease condition over the treatment course. The hope is that this form of individualized therapy will deliver the right dose to the right patient at the right time. Several expert panels have observed that despite the excitement surrounding RGD, quantitative, data-driven decision-making approaches that learn patients’ dose–response and incorporate this information into adaptive dosing strategies are lagging behind. This situation is particularly exacerbated in clinical trials. For instance, fixed design clinical studies for estimating the key parameter of a dose–response function might not treat trial patients optimally. Similarly, the dosing strategies employed in clinical trials for RGD often appear ad-hoc.We study the problem of finding optimal RGD policies while learning the distribution of a dose–response parameter from a cohort of patients. We provide a Bayesian stochastic dynamic programming (DP) formulation of this problem. Exact solution of Bellman's equations for this problem is computationally intractable. We therefore present two approximate control schemes and mathematically analyze the monotonicity, stationarity, and separability structures of the resulting dosing strategies.

However, units of the other, non-flexible, resource type can be allocated only to units of one specific object type. The allocation probabilities are not fixed and may depend on both queue sizes of the two objects. If a resource unit is not allocated immediately, it is lost.

AlphaGo is ranked high in the current Go ranking system because it is undefeated. The objective of this paper is to propose a new ranking method for large-scale Go players by means of incomplete fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix whose priority vector is derived using a cosine similarity measure. Using match results provided by Go4Go.net, experiments are designed to rank top Go players in the past 45 years and examine the change in ranking after AlphaGo faced off against Jie Ke.

However, there are many industrial cases in which heterogeneous distance metrics may need to be used simultaneously to cater for different styles of material handling, such as the Euclidean distance metric for conveyor belts and the Tchebychev distance metric for overhead cranes. In this paper, we study the unequal area facility layout problem with heterogeneous distance metrics (UA-FLP-HDM), considering a hybrid use of three metrics, i.e., Rectilinear, Euclidean, and Tchebychev, as distance measures of different styles of material handling in the production system. We propose a β-accurate linearization method that uses a set of tangent planes to convert the non-linear Euclidean distance constraint into a set of linear constraints that guarantee the approximation error within a given percentage β e.g., as small as −0.01% in our experiments, and develop linear constraints for the Tchebychev distance metric as well. Based on these contributions, we present a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the UA-FLP-HDM. Computational experiments are carried out to test the performance of the MILP model with five benchmark problems in the literature and compare the layout designs using different distance metrics. Numerical results indicate that different distance metrics may lead to significantly different solutions and a hybrid use of heterogeneous distance metrics fits better for real industrial applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous optimization; Facilities planning and design; Linear programming; Production","Belt conveyors; Benchmarking; Integer programming; Linear programming; Linearization; Optimization; Plant layout; Production; Accurate linearizations; Computational experiment; Continuous optimization; Facilities planning and design; Facility layout problems; Material handling costs; Mixed integer linear programming model; Unequal area facility layout problems; Materials handling",2-s2.0-85027149381

The shape of the bell curve is unimodal, and its peak represents both the mode and the mean. Thomas Friedman, the famous New York Times columnist, recently asserted that we have entered a human era in which “Average is Over”. In this paper we present mathematical models for the phenomenon that Friedman highlighted. While the models are derived via different modeling approaches, they share a common foundation. Inherent tipping points cause the models to phase-shift from a ‘normal’ bell-shape statistical behavior to an ‘anomalous’ statistical behavior: the unimodal shape changes to an unbounded monotone shape, the mode vanishes, and the mean diverges. Hence: (i) there is an explosion of small values; (ii) large values become super-large; (iii) ‘middle-class’ values are wiped out, leaving an infinite rift between the small and the super large values; and (iv) “Average is Over” indeed. © 2017","Entropy maximization; Exponential growth; Lognormal statistics; Phase transitions; Power-law statistics; Tipping points","Bells; Phase transitions; Entropy maximization; Exponential growth; Log-normal; Power-law statistics; Tipping point; Statistics",2-s2.0-85032286466

Participants were randomly selected from the 2010 Electoral Roll within 64 demographic strata according to 4 age groups, 4 regions, 2 ethnic groups (Māori/non-Māori) and gender. Eligible subjects (n = 734) donated up to 30 ml of blood, after which serum was pooled (n = 49) according to demographic strata prior to analysis by GC-HRMS. Associations between demographic variables (age, region, ethnicity, gender) and serum POPs were assessed using linear regression. The weighted geometric mean (GM) of PCDD/Fs was 5.3 pg/g lipid toxic equivalents using the WHO 2005 toxic equivalence factors (TEQ05), which increased by age (3.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 8.1 pg/g lipid for the 19–24, 25–34, 35–49, and 50–64 year age groups, respectively).

Their median concentrations were below 100 ng/L and 100 ng/g in river water and sediments, respectively. The highest median concentrations were found in water (1.30–176 ng/L) and sediments (0.15–110 ng/g) in the Hai River, due to its larger population density, higher consumption of antibiotics, and lower water flow. The concentrations of TCs and FQs were higher in the Pearl River sediments, due to their extensive use in aquaculture. The Yangtze River showed lower median concentrations of antibiotics in both water (1.33–17.3 ng/L) and sediments (0.31–14.8 ng/g), resulting from its larger catchment size, and higher precipitation and water flow. The Yellow River exhibited lower median concentrations of antibiotics in sediments (0.04–9.04 ng/g), probably due to low organic matter content in sediments and high suspended particle content in water. Organic carbon normalized distribution coefficients (Koc) of antibiotics were positively correlated with the octanol/water partition coefficients (Kow) of antibiotics, and the correlation for MLs with a macrocyclic lactone ring was different from that of SAs, FQs, and TCs, likely due to their much larger molecular size.

Although classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms have been applied successfully to ecological and geomorphological modelling, their applicability to SSL estimation in rivers has not yet been investigated. In this study, we evaluated use of a CART model to estimate SSL based on hydro-meteorological data. We also compared the accuracy of the CART model with that of the four most commonly used models for time series modelling of SSL, i.e. adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and two kernels of support vector machines (RBF-SVM and P-SVM). The models were calibrated using river discharge, stage, rainfall and monthly SSL data for the Kareh-Sang River gauging station in the Haraz watershed in northern Iran, where sediment transport is a considerable issue. In addition, different combinations of input data with various time lags were explored to estimate SSL. The best input combination was identified through trial and error, percent bias (PBIAS), Taylor diagrams and violin plots for each model. For evaluating the capability of the models, different statistics such as Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and percent bias (PBIAS) were used. The results showed that the CART model performed best in predicting SSL (NSE = 0.77, KGE = 0.8, PBIAS < ± 15), followed by RBF-SVM (NSE = 0.68, KGE = 0.72, PBIAS < ± 15).

The realized volatility is a useful technique which provides a relatively accurate measure of volatility based on the actual variance which is beneficial for asset management in particular for non-speculative funds. The results show that realized volatility and correlation series are not normally distributed, with some evidence of persistence. Asymmetries are also evident in both volatilities and correlations. Both jumps and heterogeneity properties are significant; whereas, the former is more significant than the latter.

Objective Our primary goal was to investigate whether particulate matter exposure during pregnancy could affect birth weight and gestational age of neonates. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the relationship between maternal particulate matter exposure and neonatal birth weight. We collected 14,455 births records linked to hospital admission records (delivery and antenatal) from January 2013 to December 2015 in Suzhou Municipal Hospital. Air monitoring data in the same timeframe were also collected from Suzhou Environmental Protection Agency. The risk of low birth weight due to the exposure to PM2.5 (with median aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) and PM10 (with median aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm) at each trimester and throughout the entire pregnancy were assessed. Linear regression models were applied and potential confounding factors were adjusted for data analysis. Gestational age, which was another important birth outcome, and its association with maternal particulate matter exposure were also studied. Results The final analysis included 10,915 singleton live births. Using multiple linear regression models, we found that gestational exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 at 10 μg/m3 increments in the second trimester led to decreases in birth weight of 4.94 g (95% confidence interval: − 9.828, − 0.046) and 5.65 g (95% confidence interval: − 10.110, − 1.188), respectively. However, gestational age was not significantly associated with maternal particulate matter exposure in term neonates. Conclusion These findings indicate that pregnant women might be more susceptible to particulate matter during the second trimester which may lead to decreased neonatal birth weight. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Birth weight; Gestational age; Particulate matter exposure; Second trimester","Aerodynamics; Environmental Protection Agency; Hospitals; Linear regression; Particles (particulate matter); Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Birth weight; Confidence interval; Gestational age; Linear regression models; Median aerodynamic diameters; Multiple linear regression models; Particulate Matter; Second trimester; Obstetrics; cohort analysis; neonate; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pregnancy; air monitoring; air pollution; airborne particle; Article; birth weight; China; cohort analysis; female; gestational age; human; low birth weight; male; newborn; prenatal exposure; priority journal; retrospective study; second trimester pregnancy; China; Jiangsu; Suzhou",2-s2.0-85030327103

Broadcast spraying of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) has been shown to reduce these losses, but it is expensive. As an alternative, it had been demonstrated that feeding DCD to cattle (after manual mixing with supplementary feeds) was a practical, effective and cheaper method to deliver high DCD rates within urine patches. This two-year study carried out on simulated urine patches in three application seasons (spring, summer, autumn) explored the efficacy of DCD feeding to cattle to reduce N losses from grazed pasture soil in a heavy-textured soil under temperate climatic conditions. In each application season, DCD fed to cows, then excreted with urine and applied at a rate of 30 kg DCD ha− 1 (treatment U + DCD30-f) was as effective as powdered DCD mixed with normal urine and applied at the same rate (treatment U + DCD30) at reducing cumulative N2O-N emissions and the N2O-N emission factor (EF3, expressed as % of N applied). Increasing DCD loading within urine patches from 10 to 30 kg DCD ha− 1 improved efficacy by significantly reducing the EF3 from 34% to 64%, which highlights that under local conditions, 10 kg DCD ha− 1 (the recommended rate for commercial use in New Zealand) was not the optimum DCD rate to curb N2O emissions. The modelling of EF3 in this study also suggests that N mitigation should be given more attention when soil moisture is going to be high, which can be predicted with short-term weather forecasting. DCD feeding, for instance in autumn when cows are not lactating and the risk of N losses is high, could then be reduced by focusing mainly on those forecasted wet periods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Animal feeding; Dicyandiamide; Nitrate leaching; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide; Urine patch","Agriculture; Feeding; Leaching; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Soils; Water pollution; Weather forecasting; Animal feeding; Dicyandiamide; Nitrate leaching; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide; Urine patches; Body fluids; diamide; dicyandiamide; nitrous oxide; unclassified drug; cattle; emission; feeding; inhibitor; leaching; nitrate; nitrification; nitrous oxide; temperate environment; urine; air pollution control; Article; autumn; bovine; climate; concentration (parameters); feeding; forecasting; lactation; nonhuman; pasture; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil moisture; soil property; soil temperature; spring; summer; urine; weather; Animalia; Bos",2-s2.0-85031742930

In the last years, wild boar has colonized several European cities, including our study area, the city of Barcelona. It is required to identify the main factors driving wild boar into urban areas prior to establish management measures. We built Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) using 3148 wild boar presences registered in the urban area of Barcelona from 2010 to 2014 to identify the variables correlated with these presences. The variables analysed included proxies for distance to source population, urban food resources, climate and urban habitat structure. Wild boars enter the urban area from close natural habitat using corridors such as streams, preferably in fragmented urban environment, looking for food such as urban green areas or dry pet food from cat colonies. Wild boar presence is higher in spring possibly due to the births of piglets and the dispersion of yearlings during that season, and also when natural resources in the Mediterranean habitat fail to satisfy the nutritional requirements of the wild boar population during the summer season. Management measures derived from this study are currently being applied in the city of Barcelona, including vegetation clearings in the wild boar entrance areas and an awareness campaign aimed at reducing the anthropogenic food availability for wild boars. The methodology used can be applied to other cities with wild boar or even other wildlife species issues.

It is smoked using a pipe known as Midwakh. There is no scientific research published on the chemical composition of dokha and only very little was done to investigate its impact on human health. Three different types of dokha were included in this study. The trace metals content in the dokha samples were analyzed using inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy-scanning electron microscope. Dokha smoke was generated using a device that simulates human smoking/puffing. The smoke samples were collected on Tenax and activated carbon adsorbent tubes followed by chemical analysis using thermal desorption-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The results showed the presence of toxic metals in dokha samples such as cobalt, cadmium, chromium, and lead in amounts classified as harmful to human health. In addition, the presence of several potentially harmful and even toxic organic compounds in dokha smoke was identified based on the available clinical data. These included 22 irritants, 3 known carcinogens, and 5 central nervous system (CNS) depressants in addition to several other compounds with miscellaneous effects.

In particular, natural gas represents the third most consumed resource, being a significant source of electricity in many countries. Since electricity production in natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants provides some benefits with respect to other non-renewable technologies, it is often seen as a transitional solution towards a future low‑carbon power generation system. However, given the environmental profile and operational variability of NGCC power plants, their eco-efficiency assessment is required. In this respect, this article uses a novel combined Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach in order to estimate –over the period 2010–2015– the environmental impact efficiencies of 20 NGCC power plants located in Spain. A three-step LCA + DEA method is applied, which involves data acquisition, calculation of environmental impacts through LCA, and the novel estimation of environmental impact efficiency (overall- and term-efficiency scores) through dynamic DEA. Although only 1 out of 20 NGCC power plants is found to be environmentally efficient, all plants show a relatively good environmental performance with overall eco-efficiency scores above 60%. Regarding individual periods, 2011 was –on average– the year with the highest environmental impact efficiency (95%), accounting for 5 efficient NGCC plants. In this respect, a link between high number of operating hours and high environmental impact efficiency is observed. Finally, preliminary environmental benchmarks are presented as an additional outcome in order to further support decision-makers in the path towards eco-efficiency in NGCC power plants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Eco-efficiency; Electricity; Life cycle assessment; Natural gas","Carbon; Combined cycle power plants; Data acquisition; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Electricity; Environmental management; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Life cycle; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Eco-efficiency; Eco-efficiency assessments; Environmental benchmarks; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Natural gas combined cycle plants; Natural gas combined cycles; Power generation systems; Environmental impact; natural gas; data acquisition; data envelopment analysis; decision making; electricity supply; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; natural gas; Article; benchmarking; controlled study; data analysis; data envelopment analysis; electric power plant; electricity; environmental impact; information processing; life cycle assessment; natural gas combined cycle power plant; priority journal; Spain",2-s2.0-85029882394

The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) technique yielded seven distinct hydrogeochemical signature clusters; (C1&C2: Eocene brackish water invasion, C3 saltwater up-coning, C4 human inputs, C5 seawater intrusion, C6 & C7 rainfall and mixing inputs). Box plot shows a wide variation of most of the ions while Chadha's plot elucidates the predominance of Na-Cl (71.6%) and Ca/Mg-Cl (25%) water types. It is found that, the highest and the lowest levels of salinization and the highest level of nitrate pollution were recorded in the northern area. This result reflects the sensitivity of this area to the human activities and/or natural actions. Around 90.4% of the wells are nitrate polluted. The main source of nitrate pollution is the sewage inputs while the farming inputs are very limited and restricted mostly in the sensitive northern area. Among the hydrogeochemical processes, ion exchange process was the most effective process all over the study area. Carbonate dissolution was common in the study area with the highest level in clusters 6, 7, 4 and 2 in the north while Gypsum dissolution was significant only in cluster 1 in the south and limited in the other clusters. This integrated multi-techniques research should be of benefit for effective utilization and management of the Gaza coastal aquifer system as well as for future work in other similar aquifers systems. © 2017","Eocene invasion; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Saltwater up-coning; Seawater intrusion; Sewage invasion","Aquifers; Cluster analysis; Dissolution; Groundwater; Groundwater geochemistry; Hierarchical systems; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Ion exchange; Mercury (metal); Nitrates; Pollution; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; Sewage; Coastal aquifer systems; Combination approaches; Eocene invasion; Geostatistical analysis; Geostatistical techniques; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Hydrogeochemical process; Up-coning; Groundwater resources",2-s2.0-85030763790

Twenty-six quantified pharmaceuticals were classified by source and fate. The load per person (LPP) of nine pharmaceuticals, including six with observed mass balance in studied river stretch of < 80%, was appreciably lower in river water (RW) than in the effluent (EF) of STPs (RW/EF < 0.5), indicating that they were susceptible to in-stream attenuation in the study area, while the others were relatively conservative. The LPP of 12 pharmaceuticals in RW were within ± 50% of that in EF. Because their mass loadings in rivers were correlated with human population in the catchment and most people use the sewer system, the major source of the 12 pharmaceuticals was considered to be STPs. The LPP of the three most labile pharmaceuticals in STPs (caffeine, theophylline, and acetaminophen) was > 1.5 in RW/EF and < 1.0 in RW/influent (IF) of STPs. Poorly treated sewage discharged from households without using the sewer system was considered to be influential source of the three pharmaceuticals. The LPP (RW/EF) of caffeine, a pharmaceutical contained in food and beverage, was considerably higher than that of the other two, and this is attributable to untreated gray water discharged at households using the night-soil treatment system. The LPP of two veterinary drugs (sulfamonomethoxine and lincomycin) were > 1.5 (RW/EF) and > 1.0 (RW/IF). Their mass loadings in rivers showed a positive correlation with swine population in the catchment, although sulfamonomethoxine is equally used in both cattle and swine farming. This was attributable to application of cattle excrement as manure, and lability of sulfamonomethoxine during composting processes. The major source of the two veterinary drugs was considered to be on-site treatment facilities of swine urine. © 2017","Load per person; Manure; Natural attenuation; On-site treatment; Septic tank; STP","Caffeine; Catchments; Drug products; Effluents; Fertilizers; Manures; Natural attenuation; River pollution; Runoff; Septic tanks; Sewage treatment plants; Sewers; Watersheds; Composting process; Human population; Onsite treatment; Positive correlations; River watersheds; Source estimation; Sulfamonomethoxine; Veterinary drugs; Rivers; atenolol; azithromycin; caffeine; carbamazepine; clarithromycin; crotamiton; drug; furosemide; gray water; ketoprofen; lincomycin; ofloxacin; paracetamol; river water; sulfamonomethoxine; theophylline; unclassified drug; veterinary drug; water; catchment; drug; effluent; manure; pollutant source; river pollution; sewage treatment; wastewater treatment plant; watershed; Article; attenuation; cattle farming; classification; composting; controlled study; effluent; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental monitoring; field study; household septic tank; in stream attenuation; Japan; load per person; mass loading; night soil treatment; parameters; pig farming; priority journal; quantitative analysis; river; sewage treatment plant; soil treatment; source estimation; urine; water sampling; watershed; Honshu; Japan; Kinki; Yodo Basin; Bos; Suidae",2-s2.0-85030788621

In recent decades, climatic changes in Central Yakutia have resulted in important changes in environmental conditions. We use different remote-sensing instruments (Landsat 8, TerraSAR-X, ENVISAT-RA2, and Jason-2) alongside in situ observations to investigate 1) the spatial distribution and water regime of alas lakes and their relationships with climatic and geomorphologic factors, 2) the relationship of the alas’ grassland productivity with the water regime and 3) the potential of alas grasslands for local agriculture. During the 2002–2010 period, the lake water level rose by 1.3 m on average, resulting in lake expansion throughout the region. Since 2011, the lake area decreased and the water level declined by 70 cm on the middle terraces (low ground-ice content), while the wetting trend continued until 2016 at higher elevations. Small thermokarst lakes (&lt; 0.025 km2), which indicate regions of young thermokarst, comprise up to 11% of the total lake area and experience high (30%) seasonal variations. In situ observations of the grassland dynamics show their synchronous cyclic variability with the lake extent and a general increasing trend for their productivity since 1985. Around 50% of these dynamics can be explained by the amount of pre-winter precipitation with a delay of two years. We explain this delay through the buffering effect of watershed soils. The cyclic variability of alas hydro-ecosystems strongly affects the local agriculture, which is based on horse and cattle breeding. We estimate that these alas grasslands can provide enough forage supply for local communities. However, the real alas yield is several times less than the theoretical value because of grassland degradation that is caused by recent thermokarst and waterlogging in the most productive phytocenosis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alas; Fodder supply; Grasslands productivity; Lake water regime; Landsat-8; Local agriculture; Satellite altimetry; TerraSAR-X; Yakutia","Agriculture; Dynamics; Ecology; Ecosystems; Geodetic satellites; Productivity; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Water levels; Alas; Fodder supply; Lake waters; LANDSAT; Satellite altimetry; TerraSAR-X; Yakutia; Lakes; agriculture; fodder; grassland; in situ measurement; lake water; Landsat; satellite altimetry; spatial distribution; TerraSAR-X; thermokarst; agriculture; air temperature; Article; biomass; cattle farming; climate change; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; forage; geomorphology; glaciation; grassland; human; hydroecosystem; lake; land use; landscape; phytocenosis; plant community; precipitation; priority journal; radiometry; Russian Federation; salinity; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; summer; thermokarst depressions; vegetation; water cycle; waterlogging; watershed; Russian Federation; Sakha; Siberia; Bos; Equidae",2-s2.0-85031720474

However, those devices rarely accomplish commercial application due to technical issues associated with the lack of stability and high cost of the biological recognition element (enzyme). Alternatively, the biomimetic catalysts have arisen as a candidate for application in electrochemical biosensors to overcome the enzymatic drawbacks, combining low cost scalable materials with superior stability. Herein, for the first time, we propose a biomimetic biosensor for organophosphorus pesticide detection employing a functionalized polyacrylamide, polyhydroxamicalkanoate (PHA), which mimics the performance of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme. The PHA bears functional groups inserted along its backbone chain working as active sites. Thereby, PHA was immobilized on screen printed electrodes (SPE) through a blend formation with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) to prevent its leaching out from the surface. Under optimum conditions, the biomimetic sensor was employed for the amperometric detection of paraoxon-ethyl, fenitrothion and chlorpyrifos ranging from 1.0 and 10.0 μmol L−1 with a limit of detection of 0.36 μmol L−1, 0.61 μmol L−1, and 0.83 μmol L−1, respectively. Typical AChE-based interfering species did not affect the PHA performance, which endorsed its superior behavior. The proposed biomimetic biosensor, denoted as SPE/PHA/mPEG, represents a significant advance in the field, offering a new path for low cost devices by means of an artificial enzyme, simple configuration and superior stability. Moreover, the biosensor performance can be further improved by modifying the electrode surface to enhance electronic transfer rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Acetylcholinesterase; Biomimetic biosensor; Organophosphorus pesticide; Polyacrylamide; Screen printed electrode","Biomimetics; Biosensors; Chemical detection; Costs; Electrodes; Enzymes; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Pesticides; Polyacrylates; Polyethylene glycols; Acetylcholinesterase; Amperometric detection; Biological recognition; Commercial applications; Electrochemical biosensor; Electrochemical sensing; Organophos-phorus pesticides; Screen printed electrodes; Biomimetic materials; acetylcholinesterase; chlorpyrifos; fenitrothion; haloacid; macrogol; organophosphorus compound; paraoxon; paraoxon ethyl; polyacrylamide; polyhydroxamicalkanoate; thiocholine; unclassified drug; Article; biomimetic sensor; biosensor; calibration; controlled study; electrochemical analysis; electrochemistry; electrode; field emission scanning electron microscopy; hydrolysis; immobilization; limit of detection; molecular stability; poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether; process optimization; reproducibility; screen printed electrode",2-s2.0-85029586373

The necessary information on industrial pollution to set strategies, priorities and action plans on environmental protection issues is absent in Cambodia. In the absence of this data, effective environmental protection cannot be implemented. The objective of this study is to estimate industrial pollution load by employing the Industrial Pollution Projection System, a rapid environmental management tool for assessment of pollution load, to produce a scientific rational basis for preparing future policy direction to reduce industrial pollution in Phnom Penh city. Factory data between 1994 and 2014 obtained from the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft of Cambodia were used in our study. Due to the high number of employees, the total environmental load generated in Phnom Penh city was estimated to be 476,981 Mg in 2014. Phnom Penh city generated 189,109 Mg of VOC, 165,411 Mg of toxic chemicals to air, 38,523 Mg of toxic chemicals to land, and 28,968 Mg of SO2 in 2014. The results of the estimation show that the Textiles and Apparel sector was the highest generators of toxic chemicals into land and air, and toxic metals into land, air and water, while the Basic Metal sector was the greatest contributor of toxic chemicals to water. The Textiles and Apparel sector alone emitted 436,016 Mg of total pollution load. The results indicate that the Dangkao and Meanchey districts were the greatest emitters of all pollutants in Phnom Penh. The results suggest that reduction in industrial pollution could be achieved by focusing on the most polluting sectors and areas. Adopting waste minimization strategies, which include cleaner production processes, will not only reduce the cost of controlling pollution, it will also make manufacturing more efficient thereby increasing profits while reducing pollution load in the long run. © 2017","Employment; Most polluting area; Polluting industry; Pollution intensity; Pollution load","Chemicals; Conservation; Electric equipment protection; Employment; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Pollution; Projection systems; Textiles; Cleaner production; Environmental loads; Environmental management tool; Industrial pollution; Most polluting area; Pollution intensity; Pollution loads; Total pollution loads; Pollution control",2-s2.0-85030749689

Flow regime in ungauged catchments under current, future, or natural conditions can be assessed with hydrological models. Developing hydrological models is, however, resource demanding such that decision makers might revert to models that have been developed for other purposes and are made available to them (‘off-the-shelf’ models). In this study, the impact of epistemic uncertainty of flow regime indicators on flow-ecological assessment was assessed at selected stations with drainage areas ranging from about 400 to almost 90,000 km2 in four South European basins (Adige, Ebro, Evrotas and Sava). For each basin, at least two models were employed. Models differed in structure, data input, spatio-temporal resolution, and calibration strategy, reflecting the variety of conditions and purposes for which they were initially developed. The uncertainty of modelled flow regime was assessed by comparing the modelled hydrologic indicators of magnitude, timing, duration, frequency and rate of change to those obtained from observed flow. The results showed that modelled flow magnitude indicators at medium and high flows were generally reliable, whereas indicators for flow timing, duration, and rate of change were affected by large uncertainties, with correlation coefficients mostly below 0.50. These findings mirror uncertainty in flow regime indicators assessed with other methods, including from measured streamflow. The large indicator uncertainty may significantly affect assessment of ecological status in freshwater systems, particularly in ungauged catchments. Finally, flow-ecological assessments proved very sensitive to reference flow regime (i.e., without anthropogenic pressures). Model simulations could not adequately capture flow regime in the reference sites comprised in this study. The lack of reliable reference conditions may seriously hamper flow-ecological assessments. This study shows the pressing need for improving assessment of natural flow regime at pan-European scale. © 2017 The Authors","Ecohydrological assessment; Flow regime; HYPERstream; Lisflood; mHM; SWAT","Catchments; Decision making; Ecology; Hydrology; Runoff; Water conservation; Ecohydrological assessment; Flow regimes; HYPERstream; Lisflood; SWAT; Uncertainty analysis; assessment method; drainage; ecohydrology; flood; flow modeling; uncertainty analysis; Article; calibration; correlation coefficient; ecology; human impact (environment); priority journal; reliability; risk assessment; river basin; simulation; Southern Europe; stream (river); uncertainty; water flow; Adige Basin; Ebro Basin; Evrotas Basin; Greece; Italy; Peloponnisos; Sava Basin; Spain",2-s2.0-85030753966

Aim of the study To investigate the effects of Euphorbia lunulata extract on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis of multidrug resistant human gastric cancer cells; To study the mechanism of apoptosis induction by Euphorbia lunulata extract in multidrug resistant human gastric cancer cells. Materials and methods The aboveground part of fresh Euphorbia lunulata plant was extracted first with ethanol and then with n-hexane. The aseptic extract at varying concentrations was used to treat the multidrug resistant human gastric cancer SGC7901/ADR cells. After treatment, the inhibition of cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. The inhibitions of cell migration and invasion were detected by Transwell method. The alteration of cell cycle progression was studied by flow cytometry. The morphological changes of cell nuclei were observed with fluorescence microscopy following Hoechst 33258 staining and the apoptotic indexes were calculated. The activation of caspase enzymes was analyzed by spectrophotometry. The sub-cellular distribution of cytochrome complex and the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were determined by Western blot. Results The proliferation, migration, and invasion of SGC7901/ADR cells were significantly inhibited by Euphorbia lunulata extract, which showed time- and dose-dependent manners. Cell cycle was arrested in G2/M phase. Significant apoptotic morphological changes were observed in the nuclei of the treated cells, and apoptotic indexes were increased significantly; these changes were diminished when Z-VAD-FMK, a caspase inhibitor, was also presented. The activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were increased. The sub-cellular distribution of cytochrome complex was altered-reduced in the mitochondria and increased in the cytoplasm. The expression of Bax was upregulated, while that of Bcl-2 was downregulated. Conclusion Euphorbia lunulata extract inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of SGC7901/ADR cells, arrested cell cycle progression, and induced cell apoptosis; the mechanism of apoptosis induction involved both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways. © 2017","Apoptosis; Cell invasion; Cell migration; Euphorbia lunulata; Gastric cancer; Multidrug resistance","caspase 3; caspase 8; caspase 9; caspase inhibitor; cytochrome; diterpenoid; doxorubicin; Euphorbia extract; Euphorbia lunulata extract; natural product; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; unclassified drug; aerial plant part; apoptosis; Article; cell cycle arrest; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; Chinese medicine; controlled study; drug isolation; enzyme activation; flow cytometry; gastric cancer cell line; human; human cell; medicinal plant; multidrug resistance; protein expression; stomach cancer; Western blotting",2-s2.0-85031788969

Virtually, surface temperatures are different in the near-surface air temperature (Ta) measured at a screen-height of 1.5–2 m, the land surface temperature (LST) on the top canopy layer, and the ground surface temperature (GST) 0–5 cm beneath the surface cover. However, not enough attention has been concentrated on the difference in these surface temperatures. This study aims at quantifying the distinction of surface temperatures by the comparisons and numerical simulations of observational field data collected in a discontinuous permafrost region on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). We compared the hourly, seasonal and yearly differences between Ta, LST, GST, and ground temperatures, as well as the freezing and thawing indices, the N-factors, and the surface and thermal offsets derived from these temperatures. The results showed that the peak hourly LST was reached earliest, closely followed by the hourly Ta. Mean annual LST (MALST) was moderately comparable to mean annual Ta (MAAT), and both were lower than mean annual GST (MAGST). Surface offsets (MAGST-MAAT) were all within 3.5 °C, which are somewhat consistent with other parts of the QTP but smaller than those in the Arctic and Subarctic regions with dense vegetation and thick, long-duration snow cover. Thermal offsets, the mean annual differences between the ground surface and the permafrost surface, were within − 0.3 °C, and one site was even reversed, which may be relevant to equally thawed to frozen thermal conductivities of the soils. Even with identical Ta (comparable to MAAT of − 3.27 and − 3.17 °C), the freezing and thawing processes of the active layer were distinctly different, due to the complex influence of surface characteristics and soil textures. Furthermore, we employed the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab (GIPL) model to numerically simulate the dynamics of ground temperature driven by Ta, LST, and GST, respectively. Simulated results demonstrated that GST was a reliable driving indicator for the thermal regime of frozen ground, even if no thermal effects of surface characteristics were taken into account. However, great biases of mean annual ground temperatures, being as large as 3 °C, were induced on the basis of simulations with LST and Ta when the thermal effect of surface characteristics was neglected. We conclude that quantitative calculation of the thermal effect of surface characteristics on GST is indispensable for the permafrost simulations based on the Ta datasets and the LST products that derived from thermal infrared remote sensing. © 2017","Elevational permafrost; Ground surface temperature (GST); Land surface temperature (LST); Near-surface air temperature (Ta); Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP)","Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Freezing; Frozen soils; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Snow; Soils; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Thawing; Discontinuous permafrost; Ground surface temperature; Land surface temperature; Near surface air temperature; Qinghai Tibet plateau; Quantitative calculation; Surface characteristics; Thermal infrared remote sensing; Thermal conductivity; air temperature; arctic environment; climate change; climate effect; elevation; freeze-thaw cycle; frozen ground; land surface; permafrost; snow cover; subarctic region; surface temperature; temperature effect; thawing; thermal regime; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",2-s2.0-85031506047

Further, the accuracy of the approach is significantly enhanced by utilizing an adaptive basis re-weighting scheme.

Despite the steady increase in the discovery of disease-associated genes, there is still a large fraction of disease genes that remains under the tip of the iceberg. In this paper we exploit the topological properties of the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network to detect disease-related genes. We compute, analyze, and compare the topological properties of disease genes with non-disease genes in PPI networks.

However, the loss of carbon sequestration as an ecosystem service due to biomass harvest has not been considered in previous studies. To assess the impact of biomass harvest on carbon sequestration, carbon dynamics in the forests and the atmosphere were integrated. The impact of forest biomass harvests on carbon sequestration was assessed based on the difference between carbon sequestration after harvest and carbon sequestration without harvest. A Chapman-Richards function and the forest vegetation simulator (FVS) were used to simulate the growth of a forest stand. The carbon dynamics in the atmosphere were simulated by the Bern2.5CC carbon cycle model. Characterization factors of the impact were calculated in three time horizons: 20-, 100- and 500-year. According to the simulations, postponement of harvest and low harvest intensity could prolong the compensation period. The annual impact on carbon sequestration was mostly negative over a short time and became positive in the end of compensation period. The highest characteristic factors of the impact on carbon sequestration were found in rotation length of 100 years with the time horizon of 500-year in the Chapman-Richards simulation and in the lowest harvest intensity with the time horizon of 500-year in the FVS simulation. Based on the results, increasing growth rate, postponing harvest, reducing harvest intensity and increasing length of time horizon could reduce the impact of forest harvest on carbon sequestration. The method proposed in this study is more proper to assess the impact on carbon sequestration, and it has much wider applications in forest management practice. © 2017","Biomass; Carbon dynamics; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem service; Forest harvest; Life cycle assessment","Biomass; Climate change; Dynamics; Ecology; Ecosystems; Energy resources; Harvesting; Life cycle; Carbon dynamics; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Forest harvest; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Forestry; dissolved organic matter; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; forest management; growth rate; harvesting; stand dynamics; Article; atmosphere; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon dynamics; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; chemical composition; environmental impact assessment; forest; greenhouse effect; harvest; life cycle assessment; priority journal; simulation",2-s2.0-85030692557

Gg (gigagrams, 109 g or thousand tonnes) of Hg to air, land, and water up to the year 2010, most of which (97%) has occurred since 1850. The rate of release has grown by two orders of magnitude from 0.01 Gg yr− 1 in 1850 to 1 Gg yr− 1 in 2010.

By 2010, Asia was responsible for 69% of the total releases of Hg from coal combustion to the environment.

Evaluating the total environmental impacts and the real cost of Irish milk production is a key step towards understanding the possibility of sustainable production. This paper addresses two main issues: aggregation of environmental impacts of Irish milk production by monetization, to understand the real cost of Irish milk production, including the environmental costs; and the effect of the agricultural policy ‘Food Harvest 2020’ on total cost (combining financial cost and environmental cost) of Irish milk production. This study used 2013 Irish dairy farming as a baseline, and defined ‘bottom’, ‘target’ and ‘optimum’ scenarios, according to the change of elementary inputs required to meet agricultural policy ambitions. The study demonstrated that the three monetization methods, Stepwise 2006, Eco-cost 2012 and EPS 2000, could be used for aggregating different environmental impacts into monetary unit, and to provide an insight for evaluating policy related to total environmental performance. The results showed that the total environmental cost of Irish milk production could be greater than the financial cost (up to €0.53/kg energy corrected milk).

The environmental benefits from avoided fertilizer production can make an important contribution to the results, but different calculation principles and often implicit assumptions are used to estimate the amount of avoided mineral fertilizer. This may hinder comparisons between studies. The present study therefore examines how the choice of substitution principles influences LCA results. Three different substitution principles, called one-to-one, maintenance, and adjusted maintenance, are identified, and we test the importance of these in a case study on cattle slurry management. We show that the inventory of avoided mineral fertilizer varies greatly when the different principles are applied, with strong influences on two-thirds of LCA impact categories. With the one-to-one principle, there is a risk of systematically over-estimating the environmental benefits from nutrient cycling. In a sensitivity analysis we show that the difference between the principles is closely related to the application rate and levels of residual nutrients in the soil. We recommend that LCA practitioners first and foremost state and justify the substitution method they use, in order to increase transparency and comparability with other studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Life cycle assessment; Multi-functional systems; Nutrient management; Nutrient recycling; Organic fertilizer; Secondary nutrients","Fertilizers; Minerals; Nutrients; Recycling; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multifunctional systems; Nutrient management; Nutrient recycling; Organic fertilizers; Life cycle; fertilizer; fertilizer; life cycle analysis; nutrient cycling; agricultural slurry; Article; controlled study; fertilizer application; fertilizer substitution; life cycle assessment; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; soil treatment; Bos",2-s2.0-85030843190

Among them, N. latifolia, N. diderrichii and N. pobeguinii are widely used by the local population in traditional remedies. Preparation from various parts of plants (e.g. roots, bark, leaves) are indicated by traditional healers for a wide range of diseases including malaria, pain, digestive ailments or metabolic diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was conducted on African species of the genus Nauclea using scientific databases such as Google Scholar, Pubmed or SciFinder. Every document of ethnopharmacological, phytochemical or pharmacological relevance and written in English or French were analyzed. Results and discussion The Nauclea genus is used as ethnomedicine all along sub-Saharan Africa. Several local populations consider Nauclea species as a major source of remedies for malaria. In this regard, two improved traditional medicines are currently under development using extracts from N. latifolia and N. pobeguinii. Concerning the chemical composition of the Nauclea genus, indoloquinolizidines alkaloids could be considered as the major class of compounds as they are reported in every analyzed Nauclea species, with numerous structures identified. Based on traditional indications a considerable amount of pharmacological studies were conducted to ensure activity and attempt to link them to the presence of particular compounds in plant extracts. Conclusion Many experimental studies using plant extracts of the African species of the genus Nauclea validate traditional indications (e.g. malaria and pain). However, bioactive compounds are rarely identified and therefore, there is a clear need for further evaluations as well as for toxicity experiments. The sustainability of these plants, especially of N. diderrichii, a threatened species, should be kept in mind to adapt local uses and preparation modes of traditional remedies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Digestive ailments; Genus Nauclea; Indoloquinolizidines alkaloids; Infection; Malaria; N. diderrichii; N. latifolia; N. pobeguinii; Pain; Phytochemistry; Traditional medicine",,2-s2.0-85032503003

These processes lead to reduced soil fertility, increased soil loss, and reduced vegetation cover and species richness. To prevent further damage, it is recommendable to use low-cost approaches that are compatible with the European Strategy of Circular Economy guidelines. We investigated the systemic benefits from recycling of forest clearance residue by adding it to a dry Mediterranean mountainous area. More specifically, we performed afforestation without addition of residue in two control plots (C plots), and afforestation with addition of 10 Mg ha− 1 of clearance residue from a nearby region dominated by Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) in two other plots (PM plots). We conducted the experiments throughout 30 months after the afforestation process. Eighteen months after the intervention, the PM plots had significant increases in the soil organic carbon (SOC), and related increases in ecosystem productivity and stability. More generally, addition of clearance residues improved soil and vegetation recovery, and contributed to more successful afforestation. The improvements may be explained by an increase of infiltration process due to the physical changes in the soil following bio-waste addition. Addition of the forest residues increased the formation of soil macrochannels, and also increased the sink area, thereby improving the hydrodynamics of the ecosystem. Thus, soil loss was reduced by 98.2% in the PM plots relative to the C plots. Our study indicates that application of forest clearance residues to Mediterranean mountainous areas is an effective land management practice that produces very little waste, and it is in accordance with European policy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Circular Economy; Mediterranean areas; Organic mulch; Soil amendment; System restoration","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Vegetation; Waste management; Circular economy; Mediterranean areas; Organic mulch; Soil amendment; System restoration; Soils; organic carbon; afforestation; environmental restoration; forest clearance; forest soil; land management; management practice; montane forest; mulch; soil amendment; vegetation cover; afforestation; Article; controlled study; decomposition; ecosystem restoration; environmental management; forestry clearance residue; hydrodynamics; nonhuman; pine; Pinus halepensis; practice guideline; priority journal; recycling; soil chemistry; soil property; soil quality; species dominance; vegetation; Europe; Mediterranean Region; Pinus halepensis",2-s2.0-85030667409

Some congeners of PCDDs, PCDFs or PCBs have dioxin-like toxicity, whereas non-dioxin-like PCBs are considered to have different toxicity. Reports of the relationships between prenatal exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs or PCBs and thyroid homeostasis in pregnant women and infants have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of maternal serum PCDD/F or PCB levels on maternal and neonatal thyroid hormone (TH) levels in a prospective cohort. Of the 514 subjects in the prospective cohort, 386 mothers and 410 infants were included for analysis. Fifteen dioxins and seventy PCBs in maternal blood collected between 23 and 41 weeks of gestation were measured using high-resolution gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Blood samples to measure thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were obtained from mothers at an early gestational stage (median ten weeks), and from infants between four and seven days of age, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted. Median concentration of total PCBs, PCB 153 were 104,700, and 20,500 pg/g lipid, respectively. Median total dioxin-TEQ was 13.8 pg/g lipid. Total dioxin-TEQ, coplanar PCBs were positively associated with neonatal FT4 (beta = 0.224, 0.206, respectively). The association was stronger in boys (beta = 0.299, 0.282, respectively). Several PCDD/F and PCB isomers were also positively associated with neonatal FT4. Total PCBs or non-dioxin-like PCBs were not associated with any maternal or neonatal THs. No DLC grouping or congeners were associated with neonatal TSH. Non-ortho PCBs were positively associated with maternal FT4. Three PCB congeners had significant positive association(s) with maternal THs. In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that perinatal exposure to background-level DLCs increases neonatal FT4, especially in boys. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Birth cohort; Dioxins; PCBs; Prenatal exposure; Thyroid hormones","Blood; Endocrinology; Gas chromatography; Hormones; Isomers; Linear regression; Mass spectrometry; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Regression analysis; Toxicity; Birth cohort; Dioxins; High-resolution gas chromatographies; Multiple linear regression analysis; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxin (PCDDs); Prenatal exposure; Thyroid hormones; Organic pollutants; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; thyroxine; child health; cohort analysis; dioxin; hormone; neonate; PCB; PCDD; PCDF; pollution exposure; adult; Article; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); correlational study; female; gas chromatography; gestation period; human; infant; male; mass spectrometry; maternal serum; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; priority journal; prospective study; sex difference; thyroid hormone blood level; thyrotropin blood level; thyroxine blood level; Hokkaido; Japan",2-s2.0-85031120240

However, most of the regional SOC modeling often uses soil maps with a fixed scale, thus how varying map scales influence modeled SOC dynamics has rarely been quantified. Different map scales have different levels of details in describing the soil properties (e.g., soil texture, SOC content, bulk density, and pH) for a specific area, with the high resolution map having finer spatial representation. In this study, six digital upland soil databases of the northern Jiangsu Province in Eastern China at scales of 1:50,000 (P5), 1:250,000 (P25), 1:500,000 (P50), 1:1,000,000 (P100), 1:4,000,000 (P400), and 1:10,000,000 (P1000) have been used to drive the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC, version 9.5) model to quantify SOC changes for the period of 1980–2009. This suite of scales selections covers all basic soil map scales in China. Our simulations indicate that the regional total SOC changes from 1980 to 2009 in the top layer (0–50 cm) for upland soils using P5, P25, P50, P100, P400, and P1000 soil maps were 37.89, 34.91, 36.04, 37.05, 39.28 and 38.46 Tg C, respectively. Taking the regional total SOC changes based on the most detailed soil map, P5, as a reference, the relative deviation of those derived from the P25, P50, P100, P400, and P1000 were 7.86%, 4.86%, 2.21%, 3.67%, and 1.51%, respectively. Although the relative deviation of regional total SOC changes for most soil maps are low, disparities exist among SOC changes for different soil groups (i.e. 4.8 to 981%) and for administrative areas level (i.e. 0.32 to 151%). The results indicate that SOC estimates are significantly influenced by soil map scale. Lack of detailed soil information, like representation of many soil types and spatial variations in soil types, in coarse-scale maps result in the large uncertainties in the estimates of SOC changes. This study stresses the needs of detailed soil digital maps for accurate quantification of regional SOC changes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DNDC (DeNitrification and DeComposition); Mapping scale; Soil organic carbon (SOC); Upland soil","Denitrification; Landforms; Organic carbon; Uncertainty analysis; Accurate quantifications; DNDC (DeNitrification and DeComposition); Jiangsu province; Relative deviations; Soil organic carbon; Spatial representations; Spatial variations; Upland soil; Soils; agricultural land; database; decomposition; denitrification; digital map; mapping; organic carbon; scale effect; soil carbon; soil property; upland region; China; Jiangsu",2-s2.0-85032853237

In animal models, these effects can occur following PAE confined to critical developmental periods, equivalent to the third and fourth weeks of human gestation, before pregnancy is usually recognized. The current study focuses on PAE during early neurulation and examines the behavioral and brain structural consequences that appear in adulthood. On gestational day 8 C57BL/6J dams received two alcohol (2.8 g/kg, i.p), or vehicle, administrations, four hours apart. Male and female offspring were reared to adulthood and examined for performance on the elevated plus maze, rotarod, open field, Morris water maze, acoustic startle, social preference (i.e. three-chambered social approach test), and the hot plate. A subset of these mice was later evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging to detect changes in regional brain volumes and shapes. In males, PAE increased exploratory behaviors on the elevated plus maze and in the open field; these changes were associated with increased fractional anisotropy in the anterior commissure. In females, PAE reduced social preference and the startle response, and decreased cerebral cortex and brain stem volumes. Vehicle-treated females had larger pituitaries than did vehicle-treated males, but PAE attenuated this sex difference. In males, pituitary size correlated with open field activity, while in females, pituitary size correlated with social activity. These findings indicate that early neurulation PAE causes sex specific behavioral and brain changes in adulthood. Changes in the pituitary suggest that this structure is especially vulnerable to neurulation stage PAE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Behavior; Brain; Ethanol; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; Mouse",,2-s2.0-85032808357

The results classified economic benefits, intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, resource-related aspects, institutional set-up and passivity towards environmental quality as major entry points for integrated natural resource management. Although the economic benefit in the form of the affordability of nitrogenous fertilizers was found to be the most critical rationale for fertilizer use, passivity towards environmental quality emerged as a factor of interest.

Because of the uncertain and unobservable transient behaviour of servo mechanisms, it is difficult to evaluate their transient performance. Under the effects of electromechanical coupling, the stator current signals of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) potentially contain the performance information regarding servo mechanisms in use. In this paper, a novel method based on analysing the stator current of the PMSM is proposed for quantifying the transient performance. First, a vector control model is constructed to simulate the stator current behaviour in the transient processes of consecutive speed changes, consecutive load changes, and intermittent start-stops. It is discovered that the amplitude and frequency of the stator current are modulated by the transient load torque and motor speed, respectively. The stator currents under different performance conditions are also simulated and compared. Then, the stator current is processed using a local means decomposition (LMD) algorithm to extract the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency. The sample entropy of the instantaneous amplitude, which reflects the complexity of the load torque variation, is calculated as a performance indicator of smooth running. The peak-to-peak value of the instantaneous frequency, which defines the range of the motor speed variation, is set as a performance indicator of rapid response. The proposed method is applied to both simulated data in an intermittent start-stops process and experimental data measured for a batch of servo turrets for turning lathes. The results show that the performance evaluations agree with the actual performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Performance evaluation; PMSM; Servo mechanisms; Stator current; Transient motion","Benchmarking; Electromechanical coupling; Permanent magnets; Servomechanisms; Stators; Synchronous motors; Torque measurement; Vector control (Electric machinery); Instantaneous amplitude; Instantaneous frequency; Performance evaluation; Performance indicators; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; PMSM; Stator currents; Transient motions; Power quality",2-s2.0-85029697551

Countries with rapidly developing economies such as China are faced with significant soil pollution problems due to accelerated industrialization and urbanization over the last decades. This paper provides an overview of published scientific data on soil pollution across China with particular focus on organic contamination in agricultural soils. Based on the related peer-reviewed papers published since 2000 (n = 203), we evaluated the priority organic contaminants across China, revealed their spatial and temporal distributions at the national scale, identified their possible sources and fates in soil, assessed their potential environmental risks, and presented the challenges in current remediation technologies regarding the combined organic pollution of agricultural soils. The primary pollutants in Northeast China were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) due to intensive fossil fuel combustion. The concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and phthalic acid esters (PAEs) were higher in North and Central China owing to concentrated agricultural activities. The levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were higher in East and South China primarily because of past industrial operations and improper electronic waste processing. The co-existence of organic contaminants was severe in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, which are the most populated and industrialized regions in China. Integrated biological-chemical remediation technologies, such as surfactant-enhanced bioremediation, have potential uses in the remediation of soil contaminated by multiple contaminants.

PPC has inferior thermal stability which could be enhanced by synergistic blending with other polymers. Blends of PPC and the engineering thermoplastic polyoxymethylene are produced by melt compounding in various weight ratios. The compatibility of the blends is investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), density measurements, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). TGA reveals that thermal stability of the blends increases dramatically in comparison to the neat PPC. A small shift in the glass transition temperature demonstrates the immiscibility of the blends but also indicates some compatibility, attributed to potential dipole–dipole interactions which are also corroborated with the FTIR results. A deviation of the rule of mixtures for density is found for some of the blends. SEM analysis of the blends shows two phase morphology; however, the interfacial adhesion appeared to be enhanced with increasing PPC content. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Both of these properties are antagonistic, since low thermal conductivity requires high porosity whereas high mechanical properties require low porosity. Thus, experimental design was applied for the first time to this kind of formulations. Thanks to a limited number of experiments suggested by a rational mixture design, the experimental responses: thermal conductivity, elastic modulus and compressive strength were modelled and predicted based on the relative proportions of three main ingredients of the formulation. The results revealed that the formulations containing a high proportion of furfuryl alcohol, a moderate proportion of tannin and a low level of catalyst led to the best compromise between properties having opposed trends. Thus, optimised foams presented a thermal conductivity of 0.039 W m− 1 K− 1 and compression strength of 0.07 MPa. The reliability of the model used was successfully validated by additional tests.

Using a newly proposed shape-evolving function for the rate kernel, model calibration reveals that the commonly employed constant rate kernel is inappropriate for modelling the scission step, and that the apparent rate kernel of hydrolysis resembles an endothermic activation energy barrier function. Facilitated by the adoption of this non-classical rate kernel, good predictions are attained by the model at different hydrolysis conditions with a global parameter set.

The current study is therefore aimed at evaluating from a clinimetric viewpoint the severity of psychiatric symptoms affecting PD patients by using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) to show its measurement-driven construct validity (scalability). The conventional nine SCL-90-R subscales (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideas, and psychoticism), as well as the clinical most valid subscales from the SCL-28 version (depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, and neurasthenia) were analysed according to a clinimetric approach by comparing PD patients with a control group from a general population study. Scalability was tested by the non-parametric item response theory model by use of a Mokken analysis. Among the various SCL-90-R or SCL-28 subscales we identified from the clinimetric analysis that the somatization, anxiety, phobic anxiety, psychoticism, and neurasthenia (apathy), as well as the SCL-90-R GSI, were the most impaired psychiatric syndromes reaching a clinically significant effect size above 0.80, whereas the total SCL-28 GSI obtained an effect size of just 0.80.

Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on this issue in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants with MDD; and to explore potential moderators. Methodology PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched from inception up to March 15, 2017 for RCTs that investigated the efficacy of any rTMS modality compared to sham intervention in participants with acute depressive episodes. Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to estimate risks. We estimated the placebo effect size (Hedges's g, random-effects model) response using placebo groups baseline and endpoint depressive symptom scores. Meta-regressions have been employed to explore potential moderators of response. Results Sixty-one studies met eligibility criteria (N = 1328; mean age, 47 years; 57% females). Placebo response was large (g = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.65–0.95, p < 0.01) regardless of the modality of intervention. Placebo response was directly associated with publication year and depression improvement of the active group, and inversely associated with higher levels of treatment-resistant depression. Other moderators, including gender, age, and stimulator type, were not associated with the outcome. Overall, 24.6%, 67.2%, and 8.2% of studies had an overall low, unclear, and high bias risk, respectively. Conclusion Placebo response in rTMS depression trials was large and associated with depression improvement of the active treatment group. Such result suggests that excluding placebo responders with a run-in phase may not confer advantage since response to ‘active’ rTMS may decrease as well. Moreover, placebo response may be a component of therapeutic response to rTMS in MDD. In addition, placebo response increase over time could indicate improvement in rTMS trial designs, including better sham rTMS methods. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Intervention; Major depressive disorder; Meta-analysis; Placebo response; Repetitive magnetic stimulation",,2-s2.0-85032721306

Homer is a target for antidepressants and mood stabilizers. The AA risk genotype of the Homer rs7713917 A > G SNP has been associated with mood disorders and suicide, and in healthy humans with brain function. Despite the evidence linking Homer 1 gene and function to mood disorder, as well as its involvement in animal models of depression, no study has yet investigated the role of Homer in bipolar depression and treatment response. Methods We studied 199 inpatients, affected by a major depressive episode in course of BD. 147 patients were studied with structural MRI of grey and white matter, and 50 with BOLD functional MRI of emotional processing. 158 patients were treated with combined total sleep deprivation and light therapy. Results At neuroimaging, patients with the AA genotype showed lower grey matter volumes in medial prefrontal cortex, higher BOLD fMRI neural responses to emotional stimuli in anterior cingulate cortex, and lower fractional anisotropy in bilateral frontal WM tracts. Lithium treatment increased axial diffusivity more in AA patients than in G*carriers. At clinical evaluation, the same AA homozygotes showed a worse antidepressant response to combined SD and LT. Conclusions rs7713917 influenced brain grey and white matter structure and function in BD, long term effects of lithium on white matter structure, and antidepressant response to chronotherapeutics, thus suggesting that glutamatergic neuroplasticity and Homer 1 function might play a role in BD psychopathology and response to treatment. © 2017","Antidepressant; Bipolar disorder; Brain imaging; Depression; fMRI; Glutamate; Grey matter; Homer; White matter","antidepressant agent; lithium salt; protein homer 1; adult; anterior cingulate; Article; bipolar disorder; bipolar I disorder; BOLD signal; brain function; brain size; controlled study; female; fractional anisotropy; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gene; genetic variability; genotype; gray matter; Homer 1 gene; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; medial prefrontal cortex; neuroimaging; phototherapy; single nucleotide polymorphism; sleep deprivation; voxel based morphometry; white matter",2-s2.0-85032274851

Consistently, the Boltzmann factor P(ϵ)∼e−βϵ describes its equilibrium distribution of one-body energies, and its velocity distribution is Maxwellian, i.e., P(v)∼e−βv2∕2. We consider here a generalized system where the quartic coupling constant between sites decays as 1∕dij α(α≥0;dij=1,2,…). Through first-principle molecular dynamics we demonstrate that, for large α (above α≃1), i.e., short-range interactions, Boltzmann statistics (based on the additive entropic functional SB[P(z)]=−k∫dzP(z)lnP(z)) is verified. However, for small values of α (below α≃1), i.e., long-range interactions, Boltzmann statistics dramatically fails and is replaced by q-statistics (based on the nonadditive entropic functional Sq[P(z)]=k(1−∫dz[P(z)]q)∕(q−1), with S1=SB). Indeed, the one-body energy distribution is q-exponential, P(ϵ)∼eqϵ −βϵϵ≡[1+(qϵ−1)βϵϵ]−1∕(qϵ−1) with qϵ&gt;1, and its velocity distribution is given by P(v)∼eqv −βvv2∕2 with qv&gt;1.

Firstly, the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) of far-field signals are estimated using the conventional MUSIC method based on second-order statistics. Then, a special fourth-order cumulant matrix of the array output is constructed, which is only related to DOA parameters of mixed sources. After estimating the kurtosis of far-field signals, the related far-field components can be removed from the constructed cumulant matrix and the near-field components can be derived. With the near-field data in the cumulant domain, the DOA estimations of near-field sources can be performed using high-order MUSIC spectrum. Finally, with the near-field DOA estimates, the range parameters of near-field sources can be obtained via one-dimensional search. The proposed algorithm involves neither two-dimensional search nor additional parameter pairing processing. Moreover, it can achieve a more reasonable classification of the source types. Simulations results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the existing methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Far-field; Fourth-order cumulant; Mixed sources; Near-field; Source localization","Estimation; Parameter estimation; Far field; Fourth order cumulant; Near fields; Near-field source; One-dimensional search; Second order statistics; Source localization; Two-dimensional search; Direction of arrival",2-s2.0-85028704269

The complex acts as a system, in which the impounding reservoir catalyses system components related to Origin-Source-Pathways-Receptor-Consequence (OSPRC) viewed as a risk system. This ‘conceptual framework’ overlays a ‘perceptual model’ of the physical system, in which arsenic with geogenic origins diffused into the formations through extensive fractures swept through the region during the Miocene era. Impacts of arsenic anomalies were local until the provision of the impounding reservoir in the last 10 years, which transformed it into active system-wide risk exposures. The paper uses existing technique of: statistical, graphical, multivariate analysis, geological survey and isotopic study, but these often seem ad hoc and without common knowledgebase. Risk analysis approaches are sought to treat existing fragmentation in practices of identifying and mitigating arsenic anomalies. The paper contributes towards next generation best practice through: (i) transferring and extending knowledge on the OSPRC framework; (ii) introducing ‘OSPRC cells’ to capture unique idiosyncrasies at each cell; and (iii) suggesting a ‘soft modelling’ procedure based on assembling knowledgebase of existing techniques with partially converging and partially diverging information levels, where knowledgebase invokes model equations with increasing resolutions. The data samples from the study area for the period of 2002–12 supports the study and indicates the following ‘risk cells’ for the study area: (i) local arsenic risk exposures at south of the reservoir, (ii) system-wide arsenic risks at its north; and (iii) system-wide arsenic risk exposures within the reservoir even after dilution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Arsenic anomalies; Graphical method; Isotopic study; Multivariate statistics analysis; Sahand dam; Soft modelling","Arsenic; Isotopes; Multivariant analysis; Risk analysis; Risk management; Analysis approach; Conceptual frameworks; Graphical methods; Information levels; Isotopic study; Multi variate analysis; Multivariate statistics; System components; Risk assessment; arsenic; ground water; heavy metal; sodium; surface water; arsenic; graphical method; isotopic analysis; modeling; multivariate analysis; reservoir; risk assessment; water quality; alkalinity; Article; calculation; cluster analysis; correlation analysis; electric conductivity; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; geochemical analysis; health hazard; high temperature; humidity; ion exchange; low temperature; mathematical analysis; multivariate analysis; pH; porosity; priority journal; salinity; seasonal variation; soft modelling; soil pollution; spring; statistical analysis; summer; water flow; water pollution; water quality; water sampling; Azerbaijan",2-s2.0-85029487231

In these regions, inter-annual variation in climatic factors (such as rainfall) combined with anthropogenic factors (such as civil war) pose major risks to food security. Thus, an operational crop production estimation and forecasting system is required to help decision-makers to make early estimates of potential food availability. Data from NASA's MODIS with official crop statistics were combined to develop an empirical regression-based model to forecast winter wheat and barley production in Iraq. The study explores remotely sensed indices representing crop productivity over the crop growing season to find the optimal correlation with crop production. The potential of three different remotely sensed indices, and information related to the phenology of crops, for forecasting crop production at the governorate level was tested and their results were validated using the leave-one-year-out approach. Despite testing several methodological approaches, and extensive spatio-temporal analysis, this paper depicts the difficulty in estimating crop yield on an annual base using current satellite low-resolution data. However, more precise estimates of crop production were possible. The result of the current research implies that the date of the maximum vegetation index (VI) offered the most accurate forecast of crop production with an average R2 = 0.70 compared to the date of MODIS EVI (Avg R2 = 0.68) and a NPP (Avg R2 = 0.66). When winter wheat and barley production were forecasted using NDVI, EVI and NPP and compared to official statistics, the relative error ranged from − 20 to 20%, − 45 to 28% and − 48 to 22%, respectively. The research indicated that remotely sensed indices could characterize and forecast crop production more accurately than simple cropping area, which was treated as a null model against which to evaluate the proposed approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield/production forecasting; EVI; MODIS; NDVI; NPP and Iraq; Vegetation phenology","Agriculture; Arid regions; Biology; Cultivation; Decision making; Error statistics; Food supply; Forecasting; NASA; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; NPP and Iraq; Vegetation phenology; Crops; arid region; barley; crop production; crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; primary production; remote sensing; semiarid region; wheat; accuracy; Article; barley; crop production; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; food insecurity; forecasting; harvest period; Iraq; priority journal; quality control; seasonal variation; vegetation; wheat; winter; Iraq; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",2-s2.0-85029153229

The tantalum market has experienced several disruptions and subsequent price swings in the past, implying problems with its supply chain resilience and stability. In this study, we trace the entire value chain of the tantalum industry from mining to the intermediate and the downstream industries. Our interest is to see how dependent the tantalum supply chain is on specific countries and regions, how exposed primary production is to disruptions, and what mechanism counteracts disruption. This study assesses the tantalum supply chain from a resilience perspective rather than an investigation of any specific disruption in the system. We analyze several resilience-promoting mechanisms such as: (a) diversity of supply, (b) material substitution, (c) recycling and (d) stockpiling. We evaluate each of these mechanisms, and find that even though diversity of supply and stockpiling mechanisms have been decreasing for years, the tantalum supply chain has been flexible in its response to disruption. We find a much larger supply from unaccounted artisanal and small mining sources than expected based on official statistics, and estimate the unaccounted production in Africa, which shows an almost 250 percent increase from around 600 tons in 2004 to more than 2000 tons in 2014.

We extend results for testing in a classical situation with multiple deterministic change points by allowing for random exogenous change points that arise in Hidden Markov or regime switching models among others. To this end, we consider a multiple mean change model with possible time series errors and prove that the number and location of change points are estimated consistently by this procedure. Additionally, we derive rates of convergence for the estimation of the location of the change points and show that these rates are strict by deriving the limit distribution of properly scaled estimators. Because the small sample behavior depends crucially on how the asymptotic (long-run) variance of the error sequence is estimated, we propose to use moving sum type estimators for the (long-run) variance and derive their asymptotic properties. While they do not estimate the variance consistently at every point in time, they can still be used to consistently estimate the number and location of the changes. In fact, this inconsistency can even lead to more precise estimators for the change points. Finally, some simulations illustrate the behavior of the estimators in small samples showing that its performance is very good compared to existing methods. © 2018 ISI/BS.","Binary segmentation; Change point; Hidden Markov model; Moving sum statistics; Regime switching model",,2-s2.0-85026290132

It is shown that the distribution of the test statistic under stationarity can be modeled fairly well by a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) pdf, from which a threshold can be derived for testing stationarity by means of a hypothesis test.

Both warming and biotic interactions have been identified to magnify the effects of toxicants. Moreover, while biotic interactions may change the impact of toxicants, toxicants may also change the impact of biotic interactions. However, studies looking at the impact of biotic interactions on the toxicity of pesticides and vice versa under warming are very scarce. Therefore, we tested how warming (+4 °C), intraspecific competition (density treatment) and exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos, both in isolation and in combination, affected mortality, cannibalism, growth and heat tolerance of low- and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Moreover, we addressed whether toxicant exposure, potentially in interaction with competition and warming, increased the frequency of autotomy, a widespread antipredator mechanism. Competition increased the toxicity of chlorpyrifos and made it become lethal. Cannibalism was not affected by chlorpyrifos but increased at high density and under warming. Chlorpyrifos reduced heat tolerance but only when competition was high. This is the first demonstration that a biotic interaction can be a major determinant of ‘toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity’. Competition enhanced the impact of chlorpyrifos under warming for high-latitude larvae, leading to an increase in autotomy which reduces fitness in the long term. This points to a novel pathway how transient pesticide pulses may cause delayed effects on populations in a warming world. Our results highlight that the interplay between biotic interactions and toxicants have a strong relevance for ecological risk assessment in a warming polluted world. Intraspecific competition increases the impact of an organophosphate pesticide under warming by increasing the amount of autotomy and by reducing heat tolerance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Critical thermal maximum; Ecological risk assessment; Global climate change; Intraspecific competition; Organophosphates","Ecology; Pesticides; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Ecological risk assessment; Global climate changes; Intraspecific competition; Organophosphates; Thermal maxima; Climate change; chlorpyrifos; autotomy; cannibalism; climate change; damselfly; global climate; growth response; intraspecific competition; mortality; organophosphate; pesticide; risk assessment; temperature tolerance; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; autotomy; cannibalism; climate change; controlled study; damselfly; environmental exposure; female; fitness; growth rate; heat tolerance; intraspecific competition; Ischnura elegans; latitude; lethality; mortality; nonhuman; population density; predator avoidance; risk assessment; Ischnura elegans; Zygoptera",2-s2.0-85032214033

Our study is the first to survey large old trees in Eastern Europe over such a large area. We surveyed 97 wood-pastures in Transylvania (Romania) in order to (i) provide a descriptive overview of the large old tree abundance; and (ii) to explore the environmental determinants of the abundance and persistence of large old trees in wood-pastures. We identified 2520 large old trees belonging to 16 taxonomic groups. Oak was present in 66% of the wood-pastures, followed by beech (33%), hornbeam (24%) and pear (22%). For each of these four species we constructed a generalized linear model with quasi-Poisson error distribution to explain individual tree abundance. Oak trees were most abundant in large wood-pastures and in wood-pastures from the Saxon cultural region of Transylvania. Beech abundance related positively to elevation and to proximity of human settlements. Abundance of hornbeam was highest in large wood-pastures, in wood-pastures from the Saxon cultural region, and in places with high cover of adjacent forest and a low human population density. Large old pear trees were most abundant in large wood-pastures that were close to paved roads.

This paper proposes a fully automatic OCSVM hyperparameter selection method, which requires no tuning of additional hyperparameter, based on a novel self-adaptive “data shifting” mechanism: Firstly, by efficient edge pattern detection (EPD) and “negatively” shifting edge patterns along the negative direction of estimated data density gradient, a constrained number of high-quality pseudo outliers are self-adaptively generated at more desirable locations, which readily avoids two major difficulties in previous outlier generation methods. Secondly, to avoid time-consuming cross-validation and enhance robustness to noise in the given training data, a pseudo target set is generated for model validation by “positively” shifting each given target datum along the positive direction of data density gradient. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data shifting; Hyperparameter selection; One-class SVM","Image retrieval; Pattern recognition; Statistics; Data shifting; Description abilities; Hyper-parameter; One class-SVM; One-class Classification; One-class support vector machine; One-class support vector machines (OCSVM); Robustness to noise; Support vector machines",2-s2.0-85032282420

As a valid classification tool, TBSVM attempts to seek two non-parallel planes that can be produced by solving a pair of quadratic programming problems (QPPs), but this is time-consuming. Here, we solve two systems of linear equations rather than two QPPs to avoid this deficiency. Furthermore, the distance in least squares TBSVM (LSTBSVM) is measured by L2-norm, but L1-norm distance is usually regarded as an alternative to L2-norm to improve model robustness in the presence of outliers. Inspired by the advantages of least squares twin support vector machine (LSTWSVM), TBSVM and L1-norm distance, we propose a LSTBSVM based on L1-norm distance metric for binary classification, termed as L1-LSTBSVM, which is specially designed for suppressing the negative effect of outliers and improving computational efficiency in large datasets. Then, we design a powerful iterative algorithm to solve the L1-norm optimal problems, and it is easy to implement and its convergence to an optimum solution is theoretically ensured. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of L1-LSTBSVM are validated by extensive experimental results on both UCI datasets and artificial datasets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","L1-LSTBSVM; L1-norm distance; Outliers; TBSVM","Bins; Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Iterative methods; Quadratic programming; Statistics; Bounded support vector machines; L1 norm; L1-LSTBSVM; Least squares twin support vector machines; Outliers; Quadratic programming problems; Systems of linear equations; TBSVM; Support vector machines",2-s2.0-85032265090

Then we use the OMI HCHO columns from January 2006 to December 2015 to indicate the interannual variation and spatial distribution in Xishuangbanna. The HCHO concentration peaks appeared in March or April for each year significantly corresponding to the intensive fire counts at the same time, which illustrate that the high HCHO columns are strongly influenced by the biomass burning in spring. Temperature and precipitation are also the important influence factors in the seasonal variation when there is nearly no biomass burning. The spatial patterns over the past ten years strengthen the deduction from the temporal variation and show the relationship with land cover and land use, elevation and population density. It is concluded that the biogenic activity plays a role in controlling the background level of HCHO in Xishuangbanna, while biomass burning is the main driving force of high HCHO concentration.

For the first time, we satisfactorily address the risks beyond 40 years from diagnosis and beyond 40 years of age among all survivors.Methods: This largest-ever assembled cohort comprises 69 460 five-year survivors of cancer diagnosed before age 20 years. Standardized incidence ratios, absolute excess risks, and multivariable-adjusted relative risks and relative excess risks were calculated. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Overall, survivors were 21.65 times (95% confidence interval = 18.97 to 24.60 times) more likely to be diagnosed with a subsequent primary bone cancer than expected from the general population. The greatest excess numbers of bone cancers were observed after retinoblastoma, bone sarcoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. The excess number of bone cancers declined linearly with both years since diagnosis and attained age (all P < .05). Beyond 40 years from diagnosis and age 40 years, there were at most 0.45 excess bone cancers among all survivors per 10 000 person-years at risk; beyond 30 years from diagnosis and age 30 years, there were at most 5.02 excess bone cancers after each of retinoblastoma, bone sarcoma, and soft tissue sarcoma, per 10 000 person-years at risk.Conclusions: For all survivors combined and the cancer groups with the greatest excess number of bone cancers, the excess numbers observed declined with both age and years from diagnosis.

However, it is difficult to extend the exploration of biological EIS to the mechanism level on the basis of statistical results. In this study, the relationship between electrical parameters and fish spoilage stages was observed. First, the peaks in the EIS morphological characteristic curves (PEMC) were used to classify fish freshness. For samples from different origins, PEMC had 78% classification accuracy rate and the corresponding values of the conventional data fitting model were 52% (impedance modulus) and 55% (phase angle). The results showed that PEMC could significantly improve classification quality for samples with different basic electrical properties. Moreover, the proposed classification method was based on a relationship rather than on statistical data fitting, meaning that more insight on microcosmic mechanisms and universal theories of biological EIS could be obtained in follow-up studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carp; Classification quality; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Morphological characteristics parameter; Spoilage stages","Data handling; Fish; Spectroscopy; Spoilage; Statistics; Carp; Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Classification quality; Effective analysis; Electrical parameter; Microcosmic mechanism; Morphological characteristic; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85030223578

Therefore, new types of environment-friendly paints were developed to replace solvent-based paints (SBPs). Nevertheless, new types of paints containing VOCs failed to replace SBPs entirely due to certain disadvantages. Hence, five kinds of paints were employed in simulation experiments to assess the health risk of primary receptor including three kinds of water-based paints (WBPs) and two kinds of SBPs. Conclusions showed that mean TVOC concentration in breathing zone of primary receptor ranged from 9.5 to 13.6 mg/m3 and 3.4 × 103 to 1.4 × 104 mg/m3 for WBPs and SBPs, respectively. Assessments of non-cancer risk concluded that nearly one third quantified compounds exceeded corresponding thresholds for WBPs, and the maximum risk value was 101.33; for SBPs, the maximum risk value reached 50760.20, and twenty-two compounds exceeded the reference limits. The calculation of cancer risk values showed that seventeen compounds were higher than acceptable limit amongst which 1,2-dibromoethane had maximum values of 1.27 × 10−2 to 3.24 × 10−2 for WBPs; for SBPs, all quantified compounds exceeded the acceptable limit, and 82.61% VOCs were distributed in a scope larger than 1 × 10−3. Additionally, a removal efficiency of 60% was considered for primary receptor with personal protective equipment, and subsequent results confirmed its inability of lowering the risk resulted from hazardous VOCs. The calculated potential health risk could be applied to estimate the total health risk for both primary and secondary receptor based on consumed materials. The finding suggested that WBPs could improve VOCs exposure condition and reduce the direct and potential health risk significantly for primary receptor, although they might dissatisfy acceptable limit. Main finding: The new type industrial materials pose less relevant health risk to primary receptor, and high potential risk level means incremental risk for primary and secondary receptor. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Personal protective equipment; Potential health risk; Primary receptor; Risk assessment; Solvent-based paints; Water-based paints","Diseases; Health; Organic compounds; Population statistics; Protective clothing; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Solvents; Volatile organic compounds; Personal protective equipment; Potential health risks; Primary receptor; Solvent based; Water-based paints; Health risks",2-s2.0-85032655083

This study evaluates the use of a variety of univariate time series forecasting methods for forecasting intraday call arrivals in the presence of such outliers. Apart from established, statistical methods, we consider artificial neural networks (ANNs). Based on the modelling flexibility of the latter, we introduce and evaluate different methods to encode the outlying periods. Using intraday arrival series from a call centre operated by one of Europe's leading entertainment companies, we provide new insights on the impact of outliers on the performance of established forecasting methods. Results show that ANNs forecast call centre data accurately, and are capable of modelling complex outliers using relatively simple outlier modelling approaches.

At the domain boundary, we observe a marked enhancement of the predator population density. The predator correlation length displays a minimum at the boundary, before reaching its asymptotic constant value deep in the active region. The frequency of the population oscillations appears only very weakly affected by the existence of two distinct domains, in contrast to their attenuation rate, which assumes its largest value there. We also observe that boundary effects become less prominent as the system is successively divided into subdomains in a checkerboard pattern, with two different reaction rates assigned to neighboring patches.

Then we formulate this challenging problem by Gaussian Field nonparametric matching model which bases on the exponential distance loss and kernel method in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Next, We introduce a local linear constraint based on the regularization theory to preserve the topological structure of the feature points. Moreover, the sparse approximation is used to reduce the search space, in this way, we can handle a large number of points easily. Finally, we test the GFC method on several real image datasets in the presence of outliers, where the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in most test scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gaussian field; Mismatch removal; Outlier rejection; Point matching; Sparse approximation","Gaussian distribution; Geometry; Pattern recognition; Gaussian field; Outlier rejection; Point-matching; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces; Sparse approximations; State-of-the-art methods; Topological structure; Transformation functions; Statistics",2-s2.0-85032279384

Most existing scene representation methods exploit the characteristics of constituent objects in scenes with inter-class independence, which ignore the negative effects caused by the common objects among different scenes. The generic characteristics of the common objects cause some generality among different scenes, which weakens the discriminative characteristics among scenes. To address this problem, we exploit the correlations of object configurations among different scenes by the co-occurrence pattern of all objects across scenes to choose representative and discriminative objects which enhances the inter-class discriminability. Specifically, we capture the statistic information of objects appearing in each scene to compute the distribution of each object across scenes, which obtains the co-occurrence pattern of objects. Moreover, we represent the image descriptors with the occurrence probabilities of discriminative objects in image patches to eliminate the negative effects of common objects. To make image descriptors more discriminative, we discard the patches with non-discriminative objects to enhance the intra-class generalized characteristics. Experimental results on three widely used scene recognition datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Co-occurrence pattern; Deep learning; Scene recognition","Deep learning; Semantics; Co-occurrence pattern; Feature description; Generic characteristics; Occurrence probability; Scene recognition; Scene representation; State-of-the-art methods; Statistic informations; Image enhancement",2-s2.0-85032289282

The long-term response analysis is based on the upcrossing rates of the roll motion under different sea states. Generally, for nonlinear roll motion in random seas, the high-level roll response is sensitive and closely related to the nonlinear effects associated with the restoring and damping terms. Therefore, assessing the corresponding statistics of the random roll motion with low probability levels is difficult and time-consuming. In this work, the Markov theory is introduced in order to tackle this problem. Specifically, for the dead ship condition, the random roll excitation moment is approximated as a filtered white noise process by applying a second-order linear filter and an efficient four-dimensional (4D) path integration (PI) technique is applied in order to calculate the response statistics. Furthermore, the reliability evaluation is based on the well-known Poisson estimate as well as on the upcrossing rate calculated by the 4D PI method.

In the Gaussian linear model, further works have derived unconditional test statistics such as the Kac-Rice Pivot for general penalized problems. In order to test the global null, a prominent offspring of this breakthrough is the Spacing test that accounts the relative separation between the first two knots of the celebrated least-angle regression (LARS) algorithm. However, no results have been shown regarding the distribution of these test statistics under the alternative. For the first time, this paper addresses this important issue for the Spacing test and shows that it is unconditionally unbiased. Furthermore, we provide the first extension of the Spacing test to the frame of unknown noise variance. More precisely, we investigate the power of the Spacing test for LARS and prove that it is unbiased: its power is always greater or equal to the significance level α. In particular, we describe the power of this test under various scenarii: we prove that its rejection region is optimal when the predictors are orthogonal; as the level α goes to zero, we show that the probability of getting a true positive is much greater than α; and we give a detailed description of its power in the case of two predictors. Moreover, we numerically investigate a comparison between the Spacing test for LARS, the Pearson's chi-squared test (goodness of fit) and a numerical testing procedure based on the maximal correlation. When the noise variance is unknown, our analysis unleashes a new test statistic that can be computed in cubic time in the population size and which we refer to as the t-Spacing test for LARS. The t-Spacing test involves the first two knots of the LARS algorithm and we give its distribution under the null hypothesis. Interestingly, numerical experiments witness that the t-Spacing test for LARS enjoys the same aforementioned properties as the Spacing test. © 2018 ISI/BS.","1-minimization; Hypothesis testing; Power; Spacing test",,2-s2.0-85026322761

These aspects are computed by performing temperature-augmented probabilistic load flow (TPLF) using Monte Carlo simulation. For TPLF, the historical data for PV generation, ambient temperature, and load power, each collected at twelve specific time instants of a day for the past five years are pre-processed by using three linear regression models for accurate uncertainty modeling. For PV generation data, the developed model is capable of filtering out the annual predictable periodic variation (owing to positioning of the Sun) and decreasing production trend due to ageing effect whereas, for ambient temperature and load power, the corresponding models accurately remove the annual cyclic variations in the data and their growth. The simulations pertaining to the aforesaid risk assessment are performed on a PV integrated New England 39-bus test system. The system over-limit risk indices are calculated for different PV penetrations and input correlations. In addition, the changes in the values of TPLF model parameters on the statistics of the result variables are analyzed.

The colour enhancement scheme compensates for the weaknesses of greyscale-based contrast enhancement and illumination normalization algorithms by focusing on preserving/restoring or enhancing colour.

However, FTCD reliability and factor structure have been questioned and HSI psychometric properties are in need of further investigations. The present study examined the psychometrics properties of the FTCD and the HSI via the Item Response Theory. Methods The study was a secondary analysis of data collected in 862 Italian daily smokers. Confirmatory factor analysis was run to evaluate the dimensionality of FTCD. A Grade Response Model was applied to FTCD and HSI to verify the fit to the data. Both item and test functioning were analyzed and item statistics, Test Information Function, and scale reliabilities were calculated. Mokken Scale Analysis was applied to estimate homogeneity and Loevinger's coefficients were calculated. Results The FTCD showed unidimensionality and homogeneity for most of the items and for the total score. It also showed high sensitivity and good reliability from medium to high levels of cigarette dependence, although problems related to some items (i.e., items 3 and 5) were evident. HSI had good homogeneity, adequate item functioning, and high reliability from medium to high levels of cigarette dependence. Significant Differential Item Functioning was found for items 1, 4, 5 of the FTCD and for both items of HSI. Conclusions HSI seems highly recommended in clinical settings addressed to heavy smokers while FTCD would be better used in smokers with a level of cigarette dependence ranging between low and high. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cigarette; Dependence; Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence, Item Response Theory; Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence; Smoking","adult; area under the curve; Article; cigarette dependence; diagnostic accuracy; Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence; female; Heaviness of Smoking Index; human; Italian (citizen); item response theory; male; psychometry; questionnaire; reliability; sensitivity and specificity; smoking; theory; Youden index",2-s2.0-85029808757

The evacuation simulation results have been coupled with the results of a forest fire spread model and applied to the Swinley forest fire which occurred in Berkshire, UK in May 2011. Four evacuation procedures differing in the routes taken by the pedestrians were evaluated providing key evacuation statistics such as time to reach the assembly location, the distance travelled, congestion experienced by the agents and the safety margins associated with using each evacuation route.

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, t-tests, and x2-tests. The results of this study are as follows: First, correlation analysis results showed that professional identity is interrelated with career commitment and subjective well-being. Second, the results of regression analysis indicated that career commitment and subjective well-being were significant predictors of professional identity. Third, comparing art therapy students with counseling psychology students revealed that there were no significant differences in professional identity and career commitment between the two groups. However, art therapy students needed much more vocational information than counseling psychology students, and they were also more likely to complain of the economic difficulties they faced in pursuing their career. In addition, the two groups showed no difference on the overall subjective well-being scale, but the counseling psychology graduate students showed higher life satisfaction and reported more positive emotions than art therapy students. Finally, this study's implications and limitations are presented. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Art therapy graduate students; Career commitment; Professional identity; Subjective well-being",,2-s2.0-85031728021

The proposed method uses the Energy Equivalent Speed (EES) to assess the severity of an eventual accident. However, the driver behavior evaluation should take into account the parameters related to the Driver, the Vehicle and the Environment (DVE) system. For this purpose, this paper considers a two-level strategy to predict the global risk of an event using the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) and the Fuzzy Theory (FT). This paper presents two methods to develop the Expert Model-based Basic Probability Assignment (EM based BPA), which is the most important task in the DST. The first one is based on the accident statistics and the second method deals with the relationship between the Fuzzy and Belief measurements. The experimental data is collected by one driver using our test vehicle and a Micro-intelligent Black Box (Micro-iBB) to collect the driving data. The sensitivity of the developed models is analysed. Our main evaluation concerns the Usage Based Insurance (UBI) applications based on the driving behavior. So, the obtained masses over the defined referential subsets in the DST are used as a score to compute the driver’s insurance premium. © 2018, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Advanced driver assistance system; Belief theory; Driver behavior; Driver-vehicle-environment system; Fuzzy inference systems","Accidents; Automobile drivers; Behavioral research; Formal logic; Fuzzy inference; Insurance; Risk perception; Vehicles; Accident scenarios; Basic probability assignment; Belief theory; Dempster-Shafer theory; Driver behavior; Driver-vehicle-environment systems; Fuzzy inference systems; Two-level strategies; Advanced driver assistance systems",2-s2.0-85030318112

Some recent studies have shown that there is a change in seasonal patterns and an increasing frequency of extreme climatic events, adding higher risk on farming activities. Therefore, government institutions should implement agricultural risk management policies or enable the private sector to develop appropriate tools. One of the main strategies for transferring agricultural risk is crop insurance. An alternative for traditional agricultural insurance is insurance based on easily measurable indicators, which use a predetermined index value as the basis for defining the indemnities. However, index insurance cannot be based only on isolated measurements. It should also be integrated into a complete monitoring system that uses many sources of information and tools (e.g., index influence areas, crop production risk maps, crop yields, and insurance claims statistics). To establish index influence areas, it is necessary to have secondary information indicating the type of climate and soil homogeneity of the study area. Over a homogeneous area, index measurements on crops of interest will be similar, but differentiating index values for areas with different soil and climatic characteristics will reduce basis risk. This study assesses two conventional agricultural and geographic methods (control and climatic maps) based on expert criteria. They were compared with one statistical method of multi-factorial analysis (factorial map). All these methods claim to homogenise soil and climatic characteristics. The three resulting maps were evaluated by agricultural and spatial analysis. The factorial map showed more homogeneous classes than the climatic map but the later lost all the soil characteristics information that will influence the index value variations. On the other hand, the factorial map obtained fewer classes than the control map, although retaining the main information on soil variability in the study area. These results obtained from the statistical method (factorial map) demonstrate that this method has generalised efficiently climatic, topographic and soil characteristics of the complete dataset. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Homogeneous areas; Soil characteristics; Stratify sampling","Agriculture; Classification (of information); Crops; Cultivation; Insurance; Maps; Principal component analysis; Risk management; Soils; Statistical methods; Factorial analysis; Farming activities; Government institutions; Homogeneous areas; Index measurements; Soil characteristics; Soil variabilities; Sources of informations; Soil surveys",2-s2.0-85009971892

Data processing is initiated with extraction of the silhouette from the depth image and estimation of the coordinates of the center of that silhouette. Next, two groups of features to be applied for a fall/non-fall classification are extracted: kinematic features (various statistics defined on the position, velocity and acceleration trajectories of the monitored person) and mel-cepstrum-related features (components of the mel-cepstrum obtained by means of an unconventional set of mel-filters). Finally, the utility of these features in fall detection is assessed using three classification algorithms − viz. support vector machine, artificial neural network, and naïve Bayes classifier − trained and tested on two datasets consisting of, respectively, 160 data sequences (representative of 80 falls and 80 other human behaviours) and 264 data sequences (representative of 132 falls and 132 other human behaviours). The application of the combination of the kinematic and mel-cepstrum-related features yields highly accurate classification results − all classifiers achieved, depending on the dataset, 98.6–100% and 93.9–97.7% sensitivity. Thus, infrared depth sensors can be promising tools for unobtrusive fall detection. They provide data which can be in various ways preprocessed to form a basis for reliable fall detection. Appropriate selection of the feature sets directly affects the reliability of unobtrusive monitoring systems, and − indirectly − the quality of life of the monitored persons. © 2017","Classification algorithms; Data acquisition; Data processing; Event detection; Infrared image sensors; Public healthcare; Sensor systems and applications","Behavioral research; Data acquisition; Data handling; Data mining; Data processing; Feature extraction; Image processing; Image retrieval; Infrared imaging; Kinematics; Neural networks; Social sciences; Bayes Classifier; Classification algorithm; Classification results; Event detection; Measurement data; Public healthcares; Sensor systems and applications; Unobtrusive monitoring; Classification (of information); acceleration; Article; artificial neural network; classification; classification algorithm; controlled study; data analysis; kinematics; near infrared imaging system; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; sensor; signal detection; support vector machine",2-s2.0-85029698638

Here, we address this caveat by evaluating the effects of non-native tree species, in comparison to native ones, on several categories of cultural services, i.e., recreation and ecotourism, aesthetics, inspiration, and cultural heritage. We propose an indicator-based approach that includes the use of a meta-analysis statistics, the odds ratio, to evaluate photographic, internet and catalogue data, and to infer on the effects of non-native trees on cultural services. We apply our approach to the Iberian Peninsula, exploring potential environmental and socio-economic predictors of non-native tree effects across NUTS-2 administrative regions. Overall, non-native tree effects differed among categories of cultural services and varied with the data type. Non-native trees increased recreation and ecotourism services, when considering data from official tourism entities, but not from nature route users. Data from inventories of urban parks and catalogues of ornamental plant dealers suggested that non-native trees decreased aesthetics services, particularly in Spain, but not in Portugal. Non-native trees also increased cultural heritage services, but no significant effects were observed on inspiration services. Overall, non-native trees showed higher increases in cultural services across regions with lower levels of development (in terms of income, employment and education) and life satisfaction. We suggest that management should emphasise awareness on non-native trees, including the risks involved in promoting the expansion of potentially invasive species. Efforts to raise awareness should prioritise official tourism entities and ornamental plant dealers, with a special focus on less developed regions. Our proposed approach represents a pioneer assessment of the relations between non-native trees and cultural ecosystem services, supporting strategic management in Iberia.

However, the use of DNA testing to deliver legal evidence has been very limited in the agro-food chain, also because in this field, a genetic concordance is rarely sustained with indications on the interpretation and statistics of a DNA profile. Zucchini is the most important and diverse horticultural group belonging to Cucurbita pepo, a plant species that yields a large variety of edible fruits such as squashes and pumpkins. Challenges in genetic discrimination of zucchini material exiting the agro-food chain typify the problems in DNA typing of horticultural food products, because of limited allelic diversity, presence of common alleles, highly processed food and genetic similarity with other edible species. The aims of this work were to identify zucchini varieties in commercial products by a means of Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) analysis and to provide indications for the statistical interpretation of a match. We assessed the efficacy of SSRs analyzing some of the most diffused hybrids and open pollinated zucchini varieties. SSRs were also screened for transferability in DNA isolated from edible organs of different plant species that are frequently present in food products containing zucchini. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility to identify the variety in food products of different origins. The statistical evaluation on the rarity of DNA profiles in zucchini indicated that the genetic match presented in this work cannot be attributed to chance alone. Based on this evidence, the advantages and pitfalls of food DNA typing for variety identification of a horticultural crop are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cucurbita pepo; DNA profile; Molecular markers; Random match probability; SSR; STR; Traceability",,2-s2.0-85026747611

However adults and children have different usage patterns. A major challenge with research on mobile phone use is the reliability of self-reported phone activity for accurate exposure assessment. We investigated the agreement between self-reported mobile phone use data and objective mobile operator traffic data in a subset of adolescents aged 11–12 years participating in the Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (SCAMP) cohort. We examined self-reported mobile phone use, including call frequency, cumulative call time duration and text messages sent among adolescents from SCAMP and matched these data with records provided by mobile network operators (n = 350). The extent of agreement between self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data use was evaluated using Cohen's weighted Kappa (ĸ) statistics. Sensitivity and specificity of self-reported low (< 1 call/day, ≤ 5 min of call/day or ≤ 5 text messages sent/day) and high (≥ 11 calls/day, > 30 min of call/day or ≥ 11 text messages sent /day) use were estimated. Agreement between self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data was highest for the duration spent talking on mobile phones per day on weekdays (38.9%) and weekends (29.4%) compared to frequency of calls and number of text messages sent. Adolescents overestimated their mobile phone use during weekends compared to weekdays. Analysis of agreement showed little difference overall between the sexes and socio-economic groups. Weighted kappa between self-reported and mobile operator traffic data for call frequency during weekdays was κ = 0.12, 95% CI 0.06–0.18. Of the three modes of mobile phone use measured in the questionnaire, call frequency was the most sensitive for low mobile phone users on weekdays and weekends (77.1, 95% CI: 69.3—83.7 and 72.0, 95% CI: 65.0–78.4, respectively). Specificity was moderate to high for high users with the highest for call frequency during weekdays (98.4, 95% CI: 96.4–99.5). Despite differential agreement between adolescents’ self-reported mobile phone use and mobile operator traffic data, our findings demonstrate that self-reported usage adequately distinguishes between high and low use. The greater use of mobile smartphones over Wi-Fi networks by adolescents, as opposed to mobile phone networks, means operator data are not the gold standard for exposure assessment in this age group.

The cumulative residual entropy, introduced by Rao et al. (2004) is a generalized measure of uncertainty which is applied in reliability and image alignment and non-additive measures of entropy. This entropy finds justifications in many physical, biological and chemical phenomena. In this paper, we derive the weighted form of this measure and call it Weighted Cumulative Residual Tsallis Entropy (WCRTE). Being a “length-biased” shift-dependent information measure, WCRTE is related to the differential information in which higher weight is assigned to large values of observed random variables. Based on the dynamic version of this new information measure, we propose ageing classes and it is shown that it can uniquely determine the survival function and Rayleigh distribution. Several properties, including linear transformations, bounds and related results to stochastic orders are obtained for these measures. Also, we identify classes of distributions in which some well-known distributions are maximum dynamic version of WCRTE. The empirical WCRTE is finally proposed to estimate the new information measure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Characterization; Cumulative residual Tsallis entropy; Empirical entropy; Maximum Tsallis entropy; Stochastic orders; Weighted generalized entropy","Characterization; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Stochastic systems; Cumulative residual entropies; Differential information; Generalized entropies; Measure of uncertainty; Non-additive measure; Rayleigh distributions; Stochastic order; Tsallis entropies; Entropy",2-s2.0-85031744102

Zonal pricing (market coupling), which does not take the physical characteristics of transmission into account, is the most commonly used method to relieve network congestion in Europe. However, zonal pricing fails to provide adequate locational price signals regarding scarcity of energy and thus creates a large amount of unscheduled cross-border flows originating from wind-generated power. In this paper, we investigate the effects of applying a hybrid congestion management model, i.e., a nodal pricing model for one country embedded in a zonal pricing system for the rest of the market. We find that, compared to full nodal pricing, hybrid pricing fails to fully utilize all the resources in the network and some wrong price signals might be given. However, hybrid pricing still outperforms zonal pricing. The results from the study cases show that, within the area applying nodal pricing, better price signals are given; the need for re-dispatching is reduced; more congestion rent is collected domestically and the unit cost of power is reduced. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Nodal pricing; OR in energy; Re-dispatching; Renewable energy; Zonal pricing","Commerce; Electric load dispatching; Power markets; Wind power; Nodal pricing; OR in energy; Re-dispatching; Renewable energies; Zonal pricing; Costs",2-s2.0-85022039697

This paper addresses the challenging problem of determining the best configuration of available synthesis flags to optimize the designer's implementation goals. First, fractional factorial design is used to reduce the whole design space. Resulting configurations are implemented to estimate the actual impact, and statistical significance, of each considered synthesis flag. After that, multiple regression analysis techniques predict the expected outcome for each possible combination of these flags. Finally, multiple-criteria decision making techniques enable the selection of the best set of synthesis flags according to explicitly defined implementation goals. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Design space exploration; Implementation goals optimization; Multiple regression analysis; Multiple-criteria decision making; Synthesis options","Decision making; Regression analysis; Design space exploration; Design spaces; Fractional factorial designs; Multiple criteria decision making; Multiple regression analysis; Statistical significance; Synthesis options; Synthesis tool; Integrated circuit design",2-s2.0-85032806695

It is well known that qth-order regression splines have optimal rates under mild assumptions. Increasing the number of knots tends to improve the approximation error rate but worsen the estimation error rate, and the optimal rate is attained by setting the two rates to be the same. For splines that are constrained to be monotone or convex, it is straight-forward to show that the constrained estimator attains the optimal rate if the approximation in the spline space also satisfies the constraints. If the monotonicity or convexity of the true regression function holds strictly, then the spline approximation will satisfy the constraints for a fine enough knot mesh. However, if there are intervals over which the constraints do not hold strictly, there is no guarantee that the approximation satisfies the constraints even for large numbers of finely-spaced knots, and therefore convergence rates of constrained regression splines have not been fully established. In this paper, we show that when the true function satisfies the constraints, there is a sufficiently close function in the spline space that also satisfies the constraints, and hence the constrained spline estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Convergence rate; Convex; Monotone; Smoothing",,2-s2.0-85030674877

Such networks are called tree-based, and the class of phylogenetic networks that are tree-based has recently been characterised. In this paper, we establish a number of new characterisations of tree-based networks in terms of path partitions and antichains (in the spirit of Dilworth's theorem), as well as via matchings in a bipartite graph.

This problem is further compounded due to the presence of noise. In order to deal with such issues, we have proposed a Variable Variance Adaptive Mean-Shift (VVAMS) algorithm which not only removes noise but also reinforces the clustering attribute by its mode seeking ability. We have formulated the problem for jointly estimating the bias field, tissue class labels and noise free pixels. Since, all the parameters are unknown and interdependent it is hard to obtain optimal estimates. In this regard, we have proposed a recursive framework to obtain the estimates of the parameters, which are partial optimal ones. In the first step of the recursion, the possibilistic fuzzy clustering algorithms has been applied to determine different clusters and bias field. These clusters are noisy and hence in the second step of the recursion, VVAMS algorithm has been applied on each cluster to eliminate noise and reinforce the modes of the clusters. These two steps constitute one combined iteration. Theoretically, the recursive framework is supposed to converge after large number of recursions but in practice it converges after a few iterations. This proposed scheme has successfully been tested with 50 biased noisy slices from Brainweb database and some real brain MR image data from IBSR database. The results have been quantitatively evaluated by percentage of misclassification, Rand Index, t-test, fuzzy partition coefficient (Vpc), fuzzy partition entropy (Vpe) and Tanimoto index. The quantitative evaluations of the tissue class labels demonstrate the superiority of proposed scheme over the existing methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive Mean-Shift filter; Bias estimation; Fuzzy clustering; Possibilistic clustering; Segmentation","Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy filters; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Magnetic resonance imaging; Parameter estimation; Tissue; Acquisition process; Adaptive mean shift filters; Adaptive mean shifts; Bias estimation; Brain MR image segmentation; Clustering attributes; Possibilistic clustering; Quantitative evaluation; Clustering algorithms",2-s2.0-85030218390

We aimed to develop a real-time monitoring system that could promptly identify the start, and accurately predict the end, of the winter surge in a paediatric intensive care (PIC) setting. We adapted a statistical process control method from the stock market called “Bollinger bands” that compares current levels of demand for PIC services to thresholds based on the medium term average demand. Algorithms to identify the start and end of the surge were developed for a specific PIC service: the North Thames Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS) using eight winters of data (2005–12) to tune the algorithms and one winter to test the final method (2013/14). The optimal Bollinger band thresholds were 1.2 and 1 standard deviations above and below a 41-day moving average of demand respectively. A simple linear model was found to predict the end of the surge and overall demand volume as soon as the start had been identified. Applying the method to the validation winter of 2013/14 showed excellent performance, with the surge identified from 18th November 2013 to 4th January 2014. An Excel tool running the algorithms has been in use within CATS since September 2014.

The research question is empirically tested on topological and socioeconomic data extracted from the Greek Maritime Network (GMN) that is modeled as a non-directed multilayer (bilayer) graph consisting of a port-layer, where nodes represent ports, and a prefecture-layer, where nodes represent coastal and insular prefectural groups of ports. The analysis highlights that the connectivity (degree) of the GMN is the most consistent aspect of this multilayer network, which preserves both the topological and the socioeconomic information through node aggregation. In terms of spatial analysis and regional science, such effects illustrate the effectiveness of the prefectural administrative division for the functionality of the Greek maritime transportation system.

Cases of stand-alone and integrated energy systems are optimized with the linear program MODEST. The European power market is assumed to be fully deregulated. The results show clear advantages for the energy company to cooperate with these industries to produce heat for DH and process steam for industry. The cooperating industries gain advantages from heat and/or biofuel by-product supply as well. The opening to use a biofuel CHP plant for combined heat supply results in cogenerated electricity of almost 29 GWh/a with an increased biofuel use of 13 GWh/a, zero fuel oil use and CO2 emission reductions of 25,800 tons CO2/a with coal-condensing power plant on the margin and biofuel as limited resource.

A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data on the participants’ social demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, infections and coinfections, pattern of ICT use, and use and intention of using ICT in HIV and AIDS management. The data was analyzed using SPSS, version 24. The results showed 78.7% (n = 2347) never used a computer, 86.9% (n = 2587) had a cellphone, 32.7% (n = 207) owned an email account, and 85.4% (n = 544) owned a social media account. Less than half of the participants reported ever using ICTs for HIV management. Only 26.2% (n = 266) were willing to join a web-based HIV prevention program. Findings of this study suggest that there was an imbalance in the participants’ ICT device ownership and choices of media platform. Social media appeared to be a potential platform for health intervention among this group. There was a low penetration of computer use among rural participants and a large disparity between the urban and rural participants, which indicated a need to expand the current infrastructure related to ICTs and increase people's health literacy.

This study aimed to explore gender-specific effects of an acute bout of exercise on cessation-related symptoms in men and women smokers during acute abstinence. Methods We enrolled smokers (≥ 5 cigarettes/day) who were 18–40 years old for a study on exercise and smoking behavior. Participants abstained from smoking for at least 3 h, prior to measurement of their maximal oxygen consumption tested, which was the acute bout of exercise. Prior to and after the exercise, participants completed the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges – Brief and the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale. Results Participants (n = 38; 61% women) were, on average, 30.0 ± 0.9 years old and smoked 13.0 ± 0.8 cigarettes/day. All measured aspects of cessation-related symptoms significantly improved after the exercise in both men and women. In women there was a significant decline in anticipated relief from negative affect after the exercise (women: − 0.45 ± 0.20, p = 0.0322; men: − 0.41 ± 0.26, p = 0.1312).

Conclusions An acute bout of exercise reduced smoking urges in both men and women smokers during an acute state of abstinence.

The objective here is to develop a dynamic data-driven algorithm for detecting the onset of instabilities with short-length time-series data, acquired by available sensors (e.g., pressure and chemiluminescence), which will provide sufficient lead time for active decision and control. To this end, this paper proposes a Bayesian nonparametric method of Markov modeling for real-time detection of thermoacoustic instabilities in gas turbine engines; the underlying algorithms are formulated in the symbolic domain and the resulting patterns are constructed from symbolized pressure measurements as probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA). These PFSA models are built upon the framework of a (low-order) finitememory Markov model, called the D-Markov machine, where a Bayesian nonparametric structure is adopted for: (i) automated selection of parameters in D-Markov machines and (ii) online sequential testing to provide dynamic data-driven and coherent statistical analyses of combustion instability phenomena without solely relying on computationally intensive (physics-based) models of combustion dynamics. The proposed method has been validated on an ensemble of pressure time series from a laboratory-scale combustion apparatus. The results of instability prediction have been compared with those of other existing techniques.

In the portfolio optimization and risk hedging using the option, the value of the option is evaluated using the volatility model. Various attempts have been made to predict option value. Recent studies have shown that stochastic volatility models and jump–diffusion models reflect stock price movements accurately. However, these models have practical limitations. Combining them with the local volatility model, which is widely used among practitioners, may lead to better performance. In this study, we propose a more effective and efficient method of estimating option prices by combining the local volatility model with the jump–diffusion model and apply it using both artificial and actual market data to evaluate its performance. The calibration process for estimating the jump parameters and local volatility surfaces is divided into three stages.

Indices of abundance derived from fishery dependent catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data are an important input to the assessment of these stocks. Traditionally, these indices have been derived from standardized logbook data, aggregated at a coarse spatial scale, and are limited to generating predictions for observed spatiotemporal strata. Understanding how CPUE is spatially distributed, however, can help identify range contractions and avoid hyperstability or hyperdepletion, both of which can mask the true population dynamics. Vessel monitoring systems (VMS) can provide complete, high-resolution distributions of CPUE used to create abundance indices. Here we compare two methods — spatial averaging of VMS-derived catch and effort data and the result of generalized linear models applied to logbook data for generating indices, to evaluate the use of VMS-derived abundance indices in assessments of reef fish stocks. This work suggests that in fisheries where targeting occurs at very fine spatial scales, abundance indices derived from high-resolution, spatiotemporally complete data may more accurately reflect the underlying dynamics of the stock. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Abundance index; CPUE standardization; Gulf of Mexico; Reef fish; Simulation; Vessel monitoring systems",,2-s2.0-85032366186

This article focuses on Stockholm County and biogas, with the aim to increase the knowledge about regional preconditions. Biogas-related actors have been interviewed, focusing on the demand side. Biogas solutions play an essential role, especially regarding bus transports and taxis. Long-term development has created well-functioning socio-technical systems involving collaboration. However, uncertainties about demand and policy cause hesitation and signs of stagnating development. Public organizations are key actors regarding renewables. For example, Stockholm Public Transport procures biogas matching the production at municipal wastewater treatment plants, the state-owned company Swedavia steers via a queuing system for taxis, and the municipalities have shifted to “environmental cars”. There is a large interest in electric vehicles, which is expected to increase significantly, partially due to suggested national policy support. The future role of biogas will be affected by how such an expansion comes about. There might be a risk of electricity replacing biogas, making it more challenging to reach a fossil-free vehicle fleet. Policy issues strongly influence the development. The environmental car definition is of importance, but its limited focus fails to account for several different types of relevant effects. The dynamic policy landscape with uncertainties about decision makers’ views on biogas seems to be one important reason behind the decreased pace of development. A national, long-term strategy is missing. Both the European Union and Sweden have high ambitions regarding a bio-based and circular economy, which should favor biogas solutions. © 2017","Biogas; Policy instrument; Socio-technical system; Stockholm; Transition; Transport","Biofuels; Decision making; Fleet operations; Fossil fuels; Plants (botany); Wastewater treatment; Policy instruments; Sociotechnical systems; Stockholm; Transition; Transport; Biogas; biogas; natural gas; biogas; decision making; demand analysis; electric vehicle; European Union; policy analysis; policy approach; public transport; uncertainty analysis; Article; biofuel production; decision making; electricity; human; organizational policy; public sector; renewable energy; Sweden; traffic and transport; waste water treatment plant; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden",2-s2.0-85032860776

Participants were 259 young women (age 18–29; M = 22.97, SD = 3.25) who completed self-report questionnaires of SNS use and body-related and disordered eating concerns. Results showed that SNS 'selfie’ activities, rather than general SNS usage, were associated with body-related and eating concerns. Specifically, greater investment in 'selfie’ activities was associated with increased body dissatisfaction and bulimia symptomatology, even after accounting for known risk factors such as thin-ideal internalisation and body mass index (BMI). Moreover, self-objectification was found to moderate the relationship between photo investment and bulimia symptomatology. These findings indicate that active engagement with SNS photo activities, rather than general SNS use, shows an association with body-related and eating concerns.

The recognition methods commonly utilize a number of features that are extracted from a data source, frequently from the given text. Though the recognition methods and the features are well studied, we believe that to achieve the best possible performance with a learning method, different subsets of features should also be considered and the best performing subset must be selected. In this paper, we propose a procedure that covers the performance comparison of well-known feature selection methods to obtain the best feature subset in MWE recognition. The evaluation tests are performed on a Turkish MWE data set and the performance is measured by precision, recall and F1 values. The highest F1 value =0.731 is obtained by C4.5 classifier employing either wrapper or filtering method in feature selection. In the regarding setting(s), it is examined that the performance is increased by 1.11% compared to the setting where all features are employed in classification. Based on the experimental results, it may be stated that feature selection improves the performance of MWE recognition by eliminating the noisy/non-effective features. Moreover, it is obvious that proposed feature selection method contributes to the overall MWE recognition system by reducing the measurement and storage requirements due to the lower number of features in classification, providing a faster and more-cost effective learning model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Feature selection; Learning algorithms; Multiword expression; Multiword expression recognition","Character recognition; Classification (of information); Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Statistical tests; Feature selection methods; Learning methods; Multi-word expressions; Performance comparison; Recognition methods; Recognition systems; Storage requirements; Word combinations; Feature extraction",2-s2.0-85029703177

Results Overall, 42% (n = 330/780) were non-drinkers, 32% (n = 251/780) were low-risk drinkers, and 26% (n = 199/780) were high-risk drinkers. Compared to non-drinkers, low- and high-risk drinkers were significantly younger whereas a larger proportion of low-risk drinkers reported being African-American compared to non- or high-risk drinkers. High-risk drinkers reported significantly lower pain severity/interference compared to the other groups; high-risk drinkers were also less likely to be on disability compared to other groups. A multinomial logistic regression showed that patients reporting lower pain severity and less disability had greater odds of being classified a high-risk drinker. Conclusions High-risk drinking appears common among medical cannabis patients. Future research should examine whether such use is concurrent or consecutive, and the relationship of such co-use patterns to consequences. Nevertheless, individuals treating patients reporting medical cannabis use for pain should consider alcohol consumption, with data needed regarding the efficacy of brief alcohol interventions among medical cannabis patients. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohol; AUDIT-C; Cannabis; Marijuana; Medical; Risky drinking","medical cannabis; adult; African American; age; alcohol consumption; Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; anxiety; Article; cannabis use; chronic pain; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; disability; female; high risk behavior; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pain assessment; pain interference; pain parameters; pain severity; personal experience; prevalence; program efficacy; risk factor; treatment outcome",2-s2.0-85031740846

Virtual water trade can play a key role in filling the gap between local demand and supply of water-intensive commodities. This study aims to analyse the dynamics in virtual water trade of Tunisia in relation to environmental and socio-economic factors such as GDP, irrigated land, precipitation, population and water scarcity. The water footprint of crop production is estimated using AquaCrop for six crops over the period 1981–2010. Net virtual water import (NVWI) is quantified at yearly basis. Regression models are used to investigate dynamics in NVWI in relation to the selected factors. The results show that NVWI during the study period for the selected crops is not influenced by blue water scarcity. NVWI correlates in two alternative models to either population and precipitation (model I) or to GDP and irrigated area (model II). The models are better in explaining NVWI of staple crops (wheat, barley, potatoes) than NVWI of cash crops (dates, olives, tomatoes). Using model I, we are able to explain both trends and inter-annual variability for rain-fed crops. Model II performs better for irrigated crops and is able to explain trends significantly; no significant relation is found, however, with variables hypothesized to represent inter-annual variability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Commerce; Cultivation; Regression analysis; Water management; Water resources; Crop production; Demand and supply; Interannual variability; Irrigated lands; Regression model; Socio-economic factor; Virtual water trade; Water footprint; Crops; crop production; environmental factor; socioeconomic conditions; water demand; water footprint; water supply; Article; barley; case study; crop production; date (fruit); environmental factor; environmental monitoring; irrigation (agriculture); olive; potato; precipitation; priority journal; socioeconomics; tomato; Tunisia; water supply; wheat; Tunisia; Hordeum; Lycopersicon esculentum; Oleaceae; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum",2-s2.0-85029145837

Increased understanding of reasons to quit in this age group could help tailor interventions, but few studies document reasons to quit in young adults or examine reasons to quit by smoker characteristics. Methods In 2011–12, 311 current smokers (age 22–28, M = 24.1; 48.9% male, 51.1% female; 50.4% daily smokers) from the Nicotine Dependence in Teens Study completed the Adolescent Reasons for Quitting scale. We assessed differences in the importance of 15 reasons to quit by sex, education, smoking frequency, quit attempt in the past year, perceived difficulty in quitting, and motivation to quit. We also examined differences between participants who discounted the importance of long-term health risks and those who acknowledged such risks. Results Concerns about getting sick or still smoking when older were considered very important by > 70% of participants. Median scores were higher among daily smokers, those who had tried to quit or who expressed difficulty quitting, and those with strong motivation to quit. Discounters (14.5% of participants) were primarily nondaily, low-consumption smokers. Their Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence scores did not differ from non-discounters', and 11% (vs. 35.7% of non-discounters) were ICD-10 tobacco dependent. Conclusions Novel smoking cessation interventions are needed to help young adult smokers quit by capitalizing on their health concerns.

A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to induce the sequence in which fitness measures should be applied over the GP generations. Subsequently, the performance of a GP system applying the evolved fitness measure sequence is compared with the conventional GP approach. The former approach is shown to significantly outperform standard GP on varied benchmark problems. Furthermore, the evolved fitness measure sequences are shown to generalize within a problem class: therefore, the sequences can be evolved off-line for different problem classes. Critically, sequences trained on the problem classes are also shown to generalize to complex, real-world problems. Overall, the findings of the study are in favor of the hypothesis.

To improve the accuracy and applicability of mid-term, especially monthly, electricity consumption forecasting, a novel monthly electricity consumption forecasting framework (denoted as SAS-SVECM for short) based on vector error correction model (VECM) and self-adaptive screening (SAS) method is proposed in this paper, which fully explores and integrates the potential impacts from and relationships between EEFs. The SAS-SVECM firstly implements X-12-ARIMA to extract seasonal peaks from the electricity consumption and EEF time series. Second, a VECM is used to address correlations and time lag effects between electricity consumption and EEFs. And a SAS method is proposed to identify the most possible influential EEF self-adaptively, which appropriately addresses the contradiction between data quantity and data length. The SAS-SVECM achieves significant forecasting accuracy enhancement and good adaptability.

Methodological bias due to variable detectability can be critical to properly determine habitat use and, thus, for understanding species ecology, distribution, and requirements for survival. In spite of recent advances in dealing with imperfect detection through detailed modeling, this approach requires large amounts of data and usually leads to larger standard errors in parameter estimates. In this work, we explore the advantages of combining generalized linear models (GLMs) and occupancy models (OMs) for the detection of variables that may be used as indicators of habitat suitability for rodent species. As a case study, we analyzed live trapping data of three rodent species that inhabit agroecosystems at micro- and macrohabitat scales. Both methods provided complementary information: while OMs revealed that some habitat features believed to be selected by studied species actually affected detectability, some effects could only be detected by GLMs. Moreover, for some covariates apparently affecting habitat selection at both scales, comparing results between scales allowed us to determine for which it was actually relevant rather than a reflection of the other. Therefore, we advise applying complementary modeling approaches at multiple scales for habitat selection studies.

The objectives of this study were to analyse trends in the metastasis-free interval over the past 30 years and to identify the prognostic factors of survival, while accounting for time dependency. Methods A total of 1613 patients diagnosed with invasive non-metastatic breast cancer at Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital, Lille, France between 1977 and 2013, were followed for outcome (metastasis-free interval). Cohort entry time delay, a continuous temporal covariate, was defined to assess improvement of outcome. Data were analysed using the Cox proportional hazards model and presented as hazard ratio (HR). Results Metastatic disease developed during follow-up in 446 (27.6%) patients. Cohort entry time delay exhibited strong independent prognostic value while accounting for multiple prognostic factors including: tumour size (HR = 1.62, 95 %CI 1.37–1.91); rapid tumour growth (HR = 1.59, 95%CI 1.17–2.16); lymph node ratio (HR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.97–2.66); histological grade (grade 2 was significant only during the first 10 years after diagnosis, grade 3 and progesterone receptor status only during the first 5 years after diagnosis); and oestrogen receptor status (significant only during the first 8 years (HR = 0.75, 95%CI 0.58–0.96)).

For these reasons, a novel combined forecasting model, which combines hybrid models based on decomposed methods and optimization algorithms, is successfully developed with variable weighting combination theory for multi-step wind speed forecasting. In this model, three different hybrid models are proposed and to further improve the forecasting performance, a modified support vector regression is used to integrate all the results obtained by each hybrid model and obtain the final forecasting results.

A k-divisible element is a (non-commutative) random variable whose n-th moment vanishes whenever n is not divisible by k. First, we consider the combinatorial convolution ⁎ in the lattices NC of non-crossing partitions and NCk of k-divisible non-crossing partitions and show that convolving k times with the zeta function in NC is equivalent to convolving once with the zeta function in NCk. Furthermore, when x is k-divisible, we derive a formula for the free cumulants of xk in terms of the free cumulants of x, involving k-divisible non-crossing partitions. Second, we prove that if a and s are free and s is k-divisible then sps and a are free, where p is any polynomial (on a and s) of degree k−2 on s. Moreover, we define a notion of R-diagonal k-tuples and prove similar results. Next, we show that free multiplicative convolution between a measure concentrated in the positive real line and a probability measure with k-symmetry is well defined. Analytic tools to calculate this convolution are developed. Finally, we concentrate on free additive powers of k-symmetric distributions and prove that μ⊞t is a well defined k-symmetric probability measure, for all t&gt;1. We derive central limit theorems and Poisson type ones. More generally, we consider freely infinitely divisible measures and prove that free infinite divisibility is maintained under the mapping μ→μk. We conclude by focusing on (k-symmetric) free stable distributions, for which we prove a reproducing property generalizing the ones known for one sided and real symmetric free stable laws. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Free probability; Infinite divisibility; k-divisible elements; k-divisible non-crossing partitions","Convolution; Functions; Probability; Random variables; Free probabilities; Infinite divisibility; Non-crossing partitions; Primary; Secondary; Probability distributions",2-s2.0-85029494323

From a social point of view, it is extremely important to prevent heart diseases, which are the most common cause of death worldwide. According to statistical data, 50 million people are at risk for cardiac diseases worldwide. The subject of ECG signal analysis is very popular. However, due to the great difficulty of the task undertaken, and high computational complexity of existing methods, there remains substantial work to perform. This research collected 1000 fragments of ECG signals from the MIH-BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead, MLII, from 45 patients. An original methodology that consisted of the analysis of longer (10-s) fragments of the ECG signal was used (an average of 13 times less classifications). To enhance the characteristic features of the ECG signal, the spectral power density was estimated (using Welch's method and a discrete Fourier transform). Genetic optimization of parameters and genetic selection of features were tested. Pre-processing, normalization, feature extraction and selection, cross-validation and machine learning algorithms (SVM, kNN, PNN, and RBFNN) were used. The best evolutionary-neural system, based on the SVM classifier, obtained a recognition sensitivity of 17 myocardium dysfunctions at a level of 90.20% (98 errors per 1000 classifications, accuracy = 98.85%, specificity = 99.39%, time for classification of one sample = 0.0023 [s]).

Thus, attention has turned to gauging public perceptions of these autonomous vehicles. To date, surveys have focused on the public as potential passengers of autonomous cars, overlooking other road users who would interact with them. Comparisons with perceptions of other existing vehicles are also lacking. This study surveyed almost 1000 participants on their perceptions, particularly with regards to safety and acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Overall, results revealed that autonomous cars were perceived as a “somewhat low risk“ form of transport and, while concerns existed, there was little opposition to the prospect of their use on public roads. However, compared to human-operated cars, autonomous cars were perceived differently depending on the road user perspective: more risky when a passenger yet less risky when a pedestrian. Autonomous cars were also perceived as more risky than existing autonomous trains. Gender, age and risk-taking had varied relationships with the perceived risk of different vehicle types and general attitudes towards autonomous cars. For instance, males and younger adults displayed greater acceptance. Whilst their adoption of this autonomous technology would seem societally beneficial – due to these groups’ greater propensity for taking road user risks, behaviours linked with poorer road safety – other results suggested it might be premature to draw conclusions on risk-taking and user acceptance. Future studies should therefore continue to investigate people's perceptions from multiple perspectives, taking into account various road user viewpoints and individual characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Age; Autonomous vehicle; Gender; Pedestrian; Risk; Road safety","Accident prevention; Behavioral research; Motor transportation; Risk management; Risk perception; Risks; Roads and streets; Safety engineering; Surveys; Transportation; Vehicles; Autonomous technology; Autonomous Vehicles; Fully automated; Gender; Individual characteristics; Pedestrian; Public perception; Road safety; Pedestrian safety; adult; age; aged; Article; automation; autonomous vehicle; controlled study; female; high risk behavior; human; male; motor vehicle; pedestrian; priority journal; risk assessment; sex difference; traffic safety",2-s2.0-85030850240

Existing policies and management situations were investigated and analyzed based on the reduction, reuse and recycle principles. Results reveal that primary barriers of reducing CDW in China include lack of building design standard for reducing CDW, low cost for CDW disposal and inappropriate urban planning. Barriers to reuse CDW include lack of guidance for effective CDW collection and sorting, lack of knowledge and standard for reused CDW, and an under-developed market for reused CDW.

In particular the evaluation of the most appropriate hold time value for the activation step, in terms of quality and amount of activated carbons produced, and the energy balance of the overall process were performed. The hold time was choose as the best compromise between a high surface area of final product and a not excessively low burn-off value. Investigations were carried out through seven experimental tests on a pilot plant based on a rotary kiln reactor. Studies performed pointed out that, when other process parameters were kept constant (in steam gasification: temperature is 850 °C, steam to feed ratio is 1, mean residence time of material is 6 min, carrier flowrate of N2 is 0.9 Nm3h−1; in steam activation: temperature is 920 °C, steam to char ratio is 2, carrier flowrate of N2 is 1 Nm3h−1), a hold time in activation step set to 3 h is the best choice, resulting in a surface area of 786 m2·g−1 and a burn-off value equal to 78.4%. Moreover, the energy balance of the overall process which goes from waste tires to activated carbon was performed: if 1 kg·h−1 of waste tires are gasified and activated for three hours, an input power of 3.5 kW is requested. After the experimental tests, a theoretical model was developed, based on the Arrhenius equation whose parameters were determined from a sigmoidal regression of the experimental data.

A review of the extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life. BWPE will therefore provide a decision support mechanism for the architects and designers to analyse the implication of designs decision on the salvage performance of buildings over time.

Environments with reverberation that masks the DoA information are particularly challenging. Recently, a DoA estimation method that is robust to reverberation has been developed. This method identifies time-frequency bins dominated by the contribution from the direct path, which carries the correct DoA information. However, its implementation is computationally demanding as it requires frequency smoothing to overcome the effect of coherent early reflections and matrix decomposition to apply the direct-path dominance (DPD) test. In this work, a novel computationally-efficient alternative to the DPD test is proposed, based on the directivity measure for sensor arrays, which requires neither frequency smoothing nor matrix decomposition, and which has been reformulated for sound field directivity with spherical microphone arrays. The paper presents the proposed method and a comparison to previous methods under a range of reverberation and noise conditions. Result demonstrate that the proposed method shows comparable performance to the original method in terms of robustness to reverberation and noise, and is about four times more computationally efficient for the given experiment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Directivity; Reverberation; Speaker localization; Spherical microphone arrays","Acoustic field measurement; Acoustic fields; Acoustic noise; Acoustics; Computational efficiency; Direction of arrival; Microphones; Reverberation; Signal processing; Computationally efficient; Directivity; DOA estimation method; Frequency smoothing; Matrix decomposition; Noise conditions; Speaker localization; Spherical microphone array; Audio signal processing",2-s2.0-85028474893

During the two-dimensional warranty period, both renewal warranty and nonrenewal warranty are considered and a repair time threshold is pre-specified so that the failed system is either minimally repaired or is replaced depending on whether the length of repair time exceeds the repair time threshold or not. After the warranty expires, the system undergoes the preventive maintenance periodically a fixed number of times by the user to prolong the life of the system and then the system is replaced preventively by a new one. In this study, we develop an optimal post-warranty periodic preventive maintenance strategy by minimizing the expected cost rate incurred during the life cycle of the system. From the user's perspective, the system is maintained free of charge or with prorated charge on the failed system during the warranty period. Once the warranty expires, the maintenance cost of the system is entirely charged to the user. Subject to such a cost structure, we derive the formula to evaluate the expected cost rate, which is used as an objective function for the optimality. The main goal of this paper is to determine an optimal preventive maintenance cycle after the warranty expires and thus to propose an optimal post-warranty strategy for the user. The effect of several parameters on the optimal strategy is also investigated numerically in this study.

Many attempts have been made to assess the influence of urbanization on NPP at coarse resolutions (e.g., 250 m or larger), which may ignore many smaller and highly fragmented urban lands, and to a large extent, underestimate the NPP variations induced by urban sprawl. Hence, we attempted to analyze the NPP variations influenced by urban sprawl at a fine resolution (e.g., 30 m), toward which the accuracy of NPP was improved using remotely sensed data fusion algorithm. In this paper, this assumption was tested in the Pearl River Delta of China. The land cover datasets from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) were acquired to quantify the urban sprawl. The synthetic Normal Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) data was obtained by fusing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI via spatiotemporal fusion algorithm. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model was driven by land cover map, synthetic NDVI and meteorological data to estimate the 30-m resolution NPP. Then, we analyzed the influence of urban sprawl on 30-m resolution NPP during the period of 2001–2009. Additionally, we also simulated the spatiotemporal change of future urban sprawl under different scenarios using the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, and further analyzed its influence on 30-m resolution NPP. Our results showed that the accuracy of 30-m resolution NPP from synthetic NDVI is better than 500-m resolution NPP from MODIS NDVI. The loss in 30-m resolution NPP due to urban sprawl was much higher than 500-m resolution NPP. Moreover, the harmonious development scenario, characterized by a reasonable size of urban sprawl and a corresponding lower NPP loss from 2009 to 2050, would be considered as a more human-oriented and sustainable development strategy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CASA model; FLUS model; NPP; Spatiotemporal fusion algorithm; Urban sprawl","Carbon; Coastal zones; Data fusion; Ecosystems; Land use; Meteorology; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Planning; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Carnegie-ames-stanford approach (CASA); Casa models; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Net primary productivity; Spatio-temporal changes; Spatio-temporal fusions; Urban sprawl; Urban growth; accuracy assessment; algorithm; carbon cycle; future prospect; Landsat thematic mapper; MODIS; NDVI; net primary production; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; terrestrial ecosystem; urban sprawl; urbanization; algorithm; Article; China; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; human impact (environment); measurement accuracy; net primary productivity; priority journal; quantitative analysis; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; thematic analysis; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",2-s2.0-85030986782

Our aim is to obtain an averaging principle for such systems with fast–slow Markov switching processes. Under suitable conditions, it is proved that there is a limit process in which the fast changing “noise” is averaged out and the limit is an average with respect to the stationary measure of the fast-varying processes. The limit process, being substantially simpler than that of the original system, can be used to reduce the computational complexity. There are several difficulties in our problems. First, because of the use of fBm, the techniques of martingale problem formulation can no longer be used. Second, there is no strong solution available and the underlying FSPDEs admit only a unique mild solution. Moreover, although the regime-switching enlarges the applicability of the underlying systems, to treat such systems is more difficult. To overcome the difficulties, fixed point theorem together with the use of stopping time argument, and a semigroup approach are used. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Averaging principle; Fractional Brownian motion; Functional stochastic partial differential equation; Two-time-scale Markov chain","Chains; Difference equations; Fixed point arithmetic; Hybrid systems; Markov processes; Partial differential equations; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Time measurement; Averaging principle; Finite state spaces; Fixed point theorems; Fractional brownian motion; Semigroup approaches; Stationary measures; Stochastic partial differential equation; Two time scale; Brownian movement",2-s2.0-85028914231

The analysis is undertaken using a cost-minimisation model for the entire BS region, the BALTCOST model. In the present research, the model has been extended to include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions effects, enabling us to analyse the trade-offs between cost-effective GHG and nutrient load reductions. We run the model for four different scenarios in order to compare the environmental and economic consequences of contrasting strategies: single environmental objective management versus joint implementation strategy. The results show that implementing land-based measures with a sole focus on water quality (to meet the HELCOM's 2013 Baltic Sea Action Plan nutrient abatement targets) can produce climate change mitigation co-benefits equivalent to 2.3% of the 2005 emission level (from agriculture and waste water combined) for the entirety of the BS region. More interestingly, a joint implementation strategy can deliver further climate change mitigation benefit (i.e. up to 5.4%) at a marginal cost that is comparable to mitigation costs reported by other studies for efficient technologies. All in all the results demonstrate that a joint strategy to improve water quality and to reduce climate change is economically beneficial. Our findings show that the cost and the outcome of the implementation vary between countries. This illustrates the need to develop a joint regional policy for water and climate regulation that fully considers the asymmetry in both the expected effects and cost distribution across the countries in the region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Co-benefit; Cost-minimisation; Economic-hydrological model; Trade-off; Water management","climate change; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; hydrological modeling; joint implementation; mitigation; nutrient dynamics; policy implementation; trade-off; water management; water quality; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",2-s2.0-85025668059

Any classifier, or other method used for knowledge extraction, suffers a deterioration when it is applied on data with noise. Credal C4.5 (CC4.5) is a recent method of classification, that introduces imprecise probabilities in the algorithm of the classic C4.5. It is very suitable in classification noise tasks, but it has a clear dependency of a parameter. It has been proved that this parameter is related with the level of overfitting of the model on the data used for training. In noisy domains, this characteristic is important in the sense that variations of this parameter can reduce the variance of the model. Depending on the degree of noise that a data set has, the application of different values of this parameter can produce different performance of the CC4.5 model. Hence, the use of the correct parameter is fundamental to attain a high level of performance for this model. In this paper, that problem is solved via a rough procedure to estimate the level of class noise in the training data. Combining this new noise estimation process with the CC4.5, it is presented a direct method that has an equivalent performance than the one of the CC4.5 when it is used with the best value of its parameter for each level of class noise. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Decision support system; Decision tree; Imprecise probabilities; Noisy data; Uncertainty measures","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Equivalence classes; Probability; Trees (mathematics); Degree of noise; Direct method; Imprecise probabilities; Knowledge extraction; Noise estimation; Noisy data; Training data; Uncertainty measures; Data mining",2-s2.0-85030540807

We apply this method to two types of problems. First, we apply it to the real-space renormalization group (RG). We find that the obtained RG flow is sufficiently good for determining the phase boundary (within 1% of the exact result) and the critical point, but not accurate enough for critical exponents. The proposed method provides a simple way to numerically estimate amplitudes of the interactions typically truncated in the real-space RG procedure. Second, we apply this method to the dynamical system composed of self-propelled particles, where we extract the parameter of a statistical model (a generalized XY model) from a dynamical system described by the Viscek model.

While the methods removed the noise, the useful structure (such as peripheral vascular) had also been smoothed, the fundamental reason is that the denoising methods cannot efficiently distinguish structural areas from flat areas. In this paper, we have proposed a spatially adaptive image denoising (SAID) method which contains two steps: spatially adaptive gradient descent (SAGD) image denoising and dual-domain filter (DDF). The SAGD denoising method contains the following parts: first of all, the wavelet shrinkage method is used to estimate redundant information which is composed of the noise and useful structures; secondly, according to the characteristic of second order matrix, a spatially adaptive gradient factor (SAGF) has been constructed to distinguish the structure from flat areas; finally, the SAGF replaces the original gradient factor and then the SAGD image denoising method is formed. To further improve the quality of the SAGD image, the SAGD image is re-denoised by a modified DDF which is guided with a rotationally invariant non-local filter (RINLF) in spatial domain and gets structural details by wavelet shrinkage in frequency domain. The results of simulation experiments verify that the proposed SAID method can get well quantitative and qualitative results which are even superior to those using the state-of-the-art denoising methods. Even more, the fluctuation of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value is very small with a small disturbance of SAGF, which illustrates that our algorithm is more robust than the prior progressive image denoising (PID) method. Moreover, the comparison results of the extensive experiments on clinical X-ray cardiovascular angiogram images further illustrate that our method can yield clearer cardiovascular images which can provide more useful vascular information for clinicians to analyze and diagnose the cardiovascular diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gradient factor; Spatially adaptive denoising; Wavelet shrinkage; X-ray cardiovascular angiogram image","Frequency domain analysis; Shrinkage; Signal to noise ratio; Cardio-vascular disease; Gradient factor; Image denoising methods; Peak signal to noise ratio; Spatially adaptive; Structural details; Wavelet shrinkage; X-ray angiogram images; Image denoising; algorithm; angiocardiography; Article; Fourier transformation; image analysis; image quality; mathematical analysis; noise reduction; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; signal noise ratio",2-s2.0-85029812453

In 2005–2014, ≈50% of copper refined and remelted in the EU was from secondary sources (recycling input rate), ≈50–60% of which were post-consumer (old) scrap (end of life recycling input rate 25–30% depending on the assumed composition of traded scrap). Uncertainties in the input parameters were explored using a stochastic method with 10.000 simulation runs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Copper; Dynamic MFA; EU28; Recycling rates; Sensitivity analysis; Trade flows","Commerce; Copper; Economics; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; Dynamic materials; Economic growths; EU28; Input parameter; Recycling rate; Secondary sources; Stochastic methods; Western Europe; Copper scrap; copper; economic growth; European Union; material flow analysis; recycling; sensitivity analysis; trade flow; consumer; economic development; human; recycling; simulation; stochastic model; uncertainty; Western Europe; Eastern Europe; Western Europe",2-s2.0-85032347719

Analysis was limited to NADP sites in the contiguous 48 United States. The Br− concentrations for this time period had a high number of values censored at the detection limits with greater than 86 percent of sample concentrations below analytical detection. Bromide was more frequently detected at NADP sites in coastal regions. Analysis using specialized statistical techniques for censored data revealed that Br− concentrations varied by precipitation type with higher concentrations usually observed in liquid versus precipitation containing snow. Negative temporal trends in Br− wet deposition concentrations were observed at a majority of NADP sites; approximately 25 percent of these trend values were statistically significant at less than 0.05 to 0.10 significance levels. Potential causes for the negative trends were explored, including annual and seasonal changes in precipitation depth, reduced emissions of methyl bromide (CH3Br) from coastal wetlands, and declining industrial use of bromine compounds. The results indicate that Br− in non-coastal wet-deposition comes mainly from long-range transport, not local sources. Correlations between Br−, chloride, and nitrate concentrations also were evaluated.

This paper concerns the issues of how to model the degradation process and predict the remaining useful life of degrading systems subjected to imperfect maintenance activities, which can restore the health condition of a degrading system to any degradation level between as-good-as new and as-bad-as old. Toward this end, a nonlinear model driven by Wiener process is first proposed to characterize the degradation trajectory of the degrading system subjected to imperfect maintenance, where negative jumps are incorporated to quantify the influence of imperfect maintenance activities on the system's degradation. Then, the probability density function of the remaining useful life is derived analytically by a space-scale transformation, i.e., transforming the constructed degradation model with negative jumps crossing a constant threshold level to a Wiener process model crossing a random threshold level. To implement the proposed method, unknown parameters in the degradation model are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method. Finally, the proposed degradation modeling and remaining useful life prediction method are applied to a practical case of draught fans belonging to a kind of mechanical systems from steel mills. The results reveal that, for a degrading system subjected to imperfect maintenance, our proposed method can obtain more accurate remaining useful life predictions than those of the benchmark model in literature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Degradation modeling; First hitting time; Imperfect maintenance; Prognostics; Remaining useful life","Fatigue of materials; Forecasting; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Probability density function; Random processes; Repair; Degradation model; First hitting time; Imperfect maintenance; Prognostics; Remaining useful lives; Maintenance",2-s2.0-85028695485

We carried out a case study to test the hypothesized association between pond-level daily mortality of farmed grass carp and predisposing environmental and husbandry factors. Based on logbook data from a single farm in Guangdong province (China) in 2013, two-stage time-series regression (TSR) analyses were conducted to estimate the lagged effect of these predisposing factors on grass carp mortality. Factors assessed included temperature fluctuations, movement of fish into and out of ponds, and 3 types of treatments (antibiotics-antiparasitics, traditional Chinese medicine-probiotics, and chemicals to improve water quality). First, coefficients were estimated using a generalized linear negative-binomial model for each pond, and these coefficient estimates were combined using meta-analytic techniques. Sensitivity analyses were done to compare effects of changes in the 3 modeling components: distributional forms, number of spline knots, and types of autocorrelation terms. Model results in the case study indicated 2 risk factors might be associated with increased mortality of grass carp: (1) movements-in of new fish during the previous 14 days; and (2) increasing water temperature during the previous 7 days. Sensitivity analyses indicated good consistency of the estimates with different modeling components.

We study theoretically the transport of a single electron from the impurity into the lattice, at zero temperature. The transport is dominated by Anderson localization and, in general, the electron motion has a random character due to the lattice disorder. However, we show that by adjusting the impurity energy the electron can attain quasi-periodic motions, oscillating between the impurity and a small region of the lattice. This region corresponds to the spatial extent of a localized state with an energy matched by that of the impurity. By precisely tuning the impurity energy, the electron can be set to oscillate between the impurity and a region far from the impurity, even distances larger than the Anderson localization length. The electron oscillations result from the interference of hybridized states, which have some resemblance to Pendry's necklace states (Pendry, 1987) [21]. The dependence of the electron motion on the impurity energy gives a potential mechanism for selectively routing an electron towards different regions of a 1D disordered lattice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Crystal lattices; Anderson localization; Directed transport; Disordered lattices; Electron oscillations; Potential mechanism; Quasi-periodic motion; Random characters; Zero temperatures; Electrons",2-s2.0-85032873097

Our index, the indicator species score (ISS), is derived from data for indicator birds, amphibians, mammals, plants and lichens representative of the major landscape-scale habitat types in the region and a range of sensitivities to urbanization. The ISS incorporates the conservation concern scores of the species monitored. We assess the practical utility of the ISS using 10 years of data for 50 indicator species monitored at 54 fixed sites in the Toronto region, Ontario, Canada. We test the sensitivity of the ISS to temporal and spatial differences/trends. We assess its responsiveness to landscape-level habitat size and quality predictors including natural cover area and wetland area within 500 m, 1 km, and 2 km of the monitoring site centroid, as well as habitat patch score, and road density. We investigate the utility of the ISS in modelling landscape-level effects. We find that it responds to the habitat predictors, to road density and to urbanization impacts other than those tested. We conclude that the ISS supports ecologically relevant interpretation and management target setting/benchmarking. It is intuitive in nature, easily communicated to a non-scientific audience and therefore useful for management reporting. ISS results following 10 years of monitoring also lead us to consider the relative importance of the many impacts that urbanization exerts on areas of natural cover that remain within an urban matrix.

The degree of sample pre-treatment varies considerably depending on the material, the methods of processing pre-treated material vary across laboratories and the detection of 14C at low levels remains challenging. As in any complex measurement process, the questions of quality assurance and quality control become paramount, both internally, i.e. within a laboratory and externally, across laboratories. The issue of comparability of measurements (and thus bias, accuracy and precision of measurement) from the diverse laboratories is one that has been the focus of considerable attention for some time, both within the 14C community and the wider user communities. In the early years of the technique when there was only a small number of laboratories in existence, inter-comparisons would function on an ad hoc basis, usually involving small numbers of laboratories (e.g. Otlet et al, 1980). However, as more laboratories were set-up and the detection methods were further developed (e.g. new AMS facilities), the need for more systematic work was recognised. The international efforts to create a global calibration curve also requires the use of data generated by different laboratories at different times, so that evidence of laboratory offsets is needed to inform curve formation. As a result of these factors, but also as part of general good laboratory practice, including laboratory benchmarking and quality assurance, the 14C community has undertaken a wide-scale, far-reaching and evolving programme of global inter-comparisons, to the benefit of laboratories and users alike.

Proponents of automated driving (AD) are enthusiastic about its promise to transform mobility and realize impressive societal benefits. This paper is an attempt to carefully examine the potential of AD to realize safety benefits, to challenge widely-held assumptions and to delve more deeply into the barriers that are hitherto largely overlooked. As automated vehicle (AV) technologies advance and emerge within a ubiquitous cyber-physical world they raise additional issues that have not yet been adequately defined, let alone researched. Issues around automation, sociotechnical complexity and systems resilience are well known in the context of aviation and space. There are important lessons that could be drawn from these applications to help inform the development of automated driving. This paper argues that for the foreseeable future, regardless of the level of automation, a driver will continue to have a role. It seems clear that the benefits of automated driving, safety and otherwise, will accrue only if these technologies are designed in accordance with sound cybernetics principles, promote effective human-systems integration and gain the trust by operators and the public. © 2017","Automated driving; Autonomous vehicles; Driver-vehicle interaction; Psychology; Safety","Accident prevention; Vehicles; Automated driving; Automated vehicles; Autonomous Vehicles; Human systems integration; Level of automations; Psychology; Societal benefits; Vehicle interactions; Automation",2-s2.0-85031761393

Despite the relevance of such features, recent works have showed that a higher variety of patterns can be detected by combining low level and high level features. In this paper, it is proposed a supervised classification technique which applies limiting probabilities of the random walk theory over underlying networks constructed from input labeled data. The appealing feature of the proposed approach is that the adjacency matrix which carries both physical and structural information about the data. Structural information are given by features extracted from network connections. The class of a given unlabeled sample is estimated by a heuristic called ease of access, which is measured by the random walk process over the adjacency matrix. Such approach makes the technique quite general as one can put distinct data measures of interest in the connection matrix of the underlying data network to guide the random walker. Specifically, we show examples of combining low and high level features in the proposed classification scheme. Simulation results using artificial and real data sets suggest that the proposed technique is not only competitive with current and established classification techniques, but it also can reveal intrinsic structural patterns formed by the input data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data classification; High level classification; Limiting probabilities; Markov chain; Network-based learning; Random walk; Steady states; Supervised learning","Markov processes; Matrix algebra; Random processes; Supervised learning; Classification scheme; Classification technique; Data classification; Network-based learning; Random Walk; Steady state; Structural information; Supervised classification; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85030265291

We start by deriving the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator from the measurement model, since it is asymptotically efficient. However, this estimator is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly. Hence, we convert the localization problem into a generalized trust region sub-problem (GTRS) framework. Although still non-convex in general, the derived estimator is strictly decreasing over a readily obtained interval, and thus, can be solved exactly by a bisection procedure. In huge contrast to existing algorithms, which either require the knowledge about the magnitude of the NLOS bias or to a priori distinguish between line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS links, the new one does not require such prerequisites. Also, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear in the number of reference nodes, unlike the majority of existing ones. Our simulation results show that the new algorithm possesses a steady NLOS bias mitigation capacity and that it represents an excellent alternative in the sense of the trade off between accuracy and complexity. To be more specific, it not only matches the performance of existing methods (majority of which significantly more computationally complex) but outperforms them in general. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated through real-indoor experimental data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Generalized trust region sub-problem (GTRS); Non-line-of-sight (NLOS); Range-based localization; Target localization; Wireless sensor network (WSN)","Complex networks; Economic and social effects; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Asymptotically efficient; Localization problems; Maximum likelihood estimator; Non-line-of-sight environments; Nonline of sight; Range-based localizations; Sub-problems; Target localization; Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-85029803772

A known drawback about its implementation is computational complexity, above all for large set of data. Recently in Zanetti et al. [1], an efficient version of the block-coordinate descent algorithm (BCDA) has been proposed for the minimization of a second order elliptic approximation of the Blake–Zissermann functional. Although the parallelization of linear algebra operations is expected to increase the performance of BCDA when addressing the segmentation of large-size gridded data (e.g., full-scene images or Digital Surface Models (DSMs)), numerical evidence shows that this is not sufficient to get significant reduction of computational time. Therefore a novel approach is proposed which exploits a decomposition technique of the image domain into tiles. The solution can be computed by applying BCDA on each tile in parallel way and combining the partial results corresponding to the different blocks of variables through a proper interconnection rule. We prove that this parallel method (OPARBCDA) generates a sequence of iterates which converges to a critical point of the functional on the level set devised by the starting point. Furthermore, we show that the parallel method can be efficiently implemented even in a commodity multicore CPU. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the efficiency of the parallel scheme on large images in terms of computational cost and its effectiveness with respect to the behavior on the tile junctions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Blake–Zisserman functional; Block coordinate descent methods; Domain decomposition; Parallel interconnection rule; Segmentation","Approximation algorithms; Domain decomposition methods; Linear algebra; Numerical methods; Blake-Zisserman functional; Block coordinate descents; Decomposition technique; Digital surface models; Linear algebra operations; Numerical minimization; Parallel interconnection; Second order elliptic; Image segmentation",2-s2.0-85025654894

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is combined with the Powell algorithm to identify the parameters of lightning channel-base current function. The method can overcome the problem of premature convergence for PSO algorithm, and improve the analysis accuracy. The Heidler function is used to represent the lightning channel-base current. We have compared the PPSO method and genetic algorithm (GA) on reaching the desired peak value of the current I-{m} and the maximum time rate of change of current (di/dt)max. The results show that the parameters of Heidler function evaluated by the PPSO method can achieve more accurate values of I-{m} and (di/dt )max than those evaluated by GA. Also, we have compared the PPSO method, the Nelder-Mead particle swarm optimization (NMPSO) method, and PSO method using the measured channel-base current. The results show that the PPSO method is better than the NMPSO and PSO method to determine the channel-base current function parameters. The PPSO method is an efficient method to identify the channel-base function parameters, which can improve the digitalization of lightning monitoring equipment.

This is a common sense in the astrophysical community. In this work, the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model with different masses is studied. A mass segregation phenomenon (MSP) arises from this study as a dynamical feature. The MSP in the HMF model is a consequence of the Landau damping (LD) and it appears in systems that the interactions belongs to a long range regime. Actually HMF is a toy model known to show up the main characteristics of astrophysical systems due to the mean field character of the potential and for different masses, as stellar and galaxies clusters, also exhibits MSP. It is in this sense that computational simulations focusing in what happens over the mass distribution in the phase space are performed for this system. What happens through the violent relaxation period and what stands for the quasi-stationary states (QSS) of this dynamics is analyzed. The results obtained support the fact that MSP is observed already in the violent relaxation time and is maintained during the QSS. Some structures in the mass distribution function are observed. As a result of this study the mass distribution is determined by the system dynamics and is independent of the dimensionality of the system. MSP occurs in a one dimensional system as a result of the long range forces that acts in the system. In this approach MSP emerges as a dynamical feature. We also show that for HMF with different masses, the dynamical time scale is N. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hamiltonian Mean Field; Landau damping; Mass segregation; Numerical integration; Phase space","Astrophysics; Damping; Distribution functions; Mean field theory; One dimensional; Phase space methods; Plasma waves; Stars; Computational simulation; Hamiltonian mean field models; Hamiltonian mean fields; Landau damping; Mass distribution function; Mass segregation; Numerical integrations; One-dimensional systems; Hamiltonians",2-s2.0-85032015544

Fuzzy logic is used as a method for determining a set of suspicious electricity customers in the first phase of electricity fraud detecting. At this phase, every customer located in the area of increased total electricity losses is analyzed. For each customer, a time series of invoiced energy are formed. Selected time series data and their relations are used to create fuzzy sets of suspicion. Then, total suspicion value of each customer is determined by using fuzzy logic. Based on the estimated total and technical energy losses in the customer's area (region that is supplied by one or more MV/LV transformer stations) and the balance of total, invoiced and energy of losses, a boundary value of suspicion percentage is determined. All customers, whose percentage suspicion value is greater than the boundary value, are declared suspect. Thus, suspicious customers with their locations which need inspection are obtained.

URE can provide insights for applications ranging from load disaggregation and energy efficiency to condition-based maintenance of equipment-based upon detected fault conditions. URE characterization often requires subject matter expertise to tailor transforms and feature extractors for the specific electrical devices of interest. We present a novel approach, named dimensionally aligned signal projection (DASP), for projecting aligned signal characteristics that are inherent to the physical implementation of many commercial electronic devices. These projections minimize the need for an intimate understanding of the underlying physical circuitry and significantly reduce the number of features required for signal classification. We present three possible DASP algorithms that leverage frequency harmonics, modulation alignments, and frequency peak spacings, along with a two-dimensional image manipulation method for statistical feature extraction. To demonstrate the ability of DASP to generate relevant features from URE, we measured the conducted URE from 14 residential electronic devices using a 2 MS/s collection system. A linear discriminant analysis classifier was trained using DASP generated features and was blind tested resulting in a greater than 90% classification accuracy for each of the DASP algorithms and an accuracy of 99.1% when DASP features are used in combination. Furthermore, we show that a rank reduced feature set of the combined DASP algorithms provides a 98.9% classification accuracy with only three features and outperforms a set of spectral features in terms of general classification as well as applicability across a broad number of devices. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Harmonic; linear discriminant analysis (LDA); modulation; nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM); unintended radiated emissions (URE)","Computerized tomography; Discriminant analysis; Electromagnetic pulse; Electron devices; Electronic equipment; Energy efficiency; Feature extraction; Thermoelectric equipment; Classification accuracy; Commercial electronics; Condition based maintenance; Information system security; Linear discriminant analysis; Nonintrusive load monitoring; Statistical feature extractions; Two dimensional image manipulation method; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85018648873

Although the Markov blanket (MB) has been proven to be the minimal optimal set of features (variables) that does not change the original target distribution, variables selected by the existing IAMB algorithm could be redundant and/or misleading as the IAMB requires an unnecessarily large amount of learning data to identify the MB. Use of the inter-IAMB interleaving the grow phase with the shrink phase to maintain the size of the MB as small as possible by immediately eliminating invalid candidates could overcome this drawback. In this report, a likelihood-ratio (LR)-based conditional independence test, able to handle spectroscopic data normally comprising a large number of continuous variables in a small number of samples, was uniquely embedded in the inter-IAMB and its utility was evaluated. The variables selected by the inter-IAMB in complexly overlapped and feature-indistinct NIR spectra were used to determine the corresponding sample properties. For comparison, the properties were also determined using the IAMB-selected variables as well as the whole variables. The inter-IAMB was more effective in the selection of variables than the IAMB and thus able to improve the accuracy in the determination of the sample properties, even though a smaller number of variables was used. The proposed LR-embedded inter-IAMB could be a potential feature selection method for vibrational spectroscopic analysis, especially when the obtained spectral features are specificity-deficient and extensively overlapped. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conditional independence test; Diesel, Gasoline; Etchant solution; Likelihood-ratio test; Markov blanket discovery algorithm","Feature extraction; Gasoline; Infrared devices; Conditional independence tests; Continuous variables; Discovery algorithm; Etchant solution; Feature selection methods; Likelihood ratio tests; Selection of variables; Vibrational spectroscopic analysis; Spectroscopic analysis",2-s2.0-85030097025

Hence, they do not depend on human evaluation, which is often a subjective approach. Furthermore, since such techniques do not involve heuristic approaches, they may be more easily implemented and used in automatic systems. The Magnitude-Squared Coherence (MSC), together with its recently developed multivariate extension (the multiple magnitude-squared coherence – MMSC), have been pointed out as one of the most efficient ORD techniques for detecting steady-state responses in the EEG. In this work, both MSC and MMSC were applied to EEG signals collected during auditory stimulation in order to allow comparison in the detection of auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs). The stimuli consisted of 40 Hz amplitude-modulated tones delivered binaurally in the intensity of 50 dB SPL (sound pressure level). The best result was obtained by using MMSC in the two-electrode set C4 and Fz. This configuration led to a 0.92-detection ratio, within 111.55 s in average to detect each response and kept the false alarm ratio under 0.05. The average improvement in performance was about 11% when compared to the MSC. These results allow concluding that the detection protocol of 40 Hz ASSRs can be improved by using MMSC in multichannel EEG analysis when compared to the traditional univariate MSC approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Auditory steady-state responses; Electroencephalogram; Magnitude-squared coherence; Multiple magnitude-squared coherence","Heuristic methods; Amplitude modulated; Auditory stimulation; Detection protocols; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Magnitude squared coherences; Sound pressure level; Statistical criterion; Steady-state response; Electroencephalography; adult; Article; auditory evoked potential; auditory steady state response; auditory stimulation; clinical article; critical value; electroencephalogram; female; frequency; human; magnitude squared coherence; male; normal human; priority journal; signal noise ratio; sound pressure; statistical analysis",2-s2.0-85030683720

This type of noise, if not eliminated, may manifest as vertical and horizontal strips in the raw image and human observers are particularly sensitive to these types of image artifacts. In this paper we propose an effective non-uniformity correction (NUC) method to remove strip noise without loss of fine image details. This multi-scale destriping method consists of two consecutive steps. Firstly, wavelet-based image decomposition is applied to separate the original input image into three individual scale levels: large, median and small scales. In each scale level, the extracted vertical image component contains strip noise and vertical-orientated image textures. Secondly, a novel multi-scale 1D guided filter is proposed to further separate strip noise from image textures in each individual scale level. More specifically, in the small scale level, we choose a small filtering window for guided filter to eliminate strip noise. On the contrary, a large filtering window is used to better preserve image details from blurring in large scale level. Our proposed algorithm is systematically evaluated using real-captured infrared images and the quantitative comparison results with the state-of-the-art destriping algorithms demonstrate that our proposed method can better remove the strip noise without blurring image fine details. © 2017","Destriping; Fixed pattern noise; Infrared imaging; Multi-scale; Non-uniformity correction","Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Infrared radiation; Thermography (imaging); Wavelet analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Destriping; Fixed pattern noise; Longwave infrared; Multi-scale; Nonuniformity correction; Quantitative comparison; Read-out circuit; Wavelet-based images; Image texture",2-s2.0-85029481180

The role of global sensitivity analysis in this aspect is to quantify and rank the effects of input random variables and their combinations to the variance of the random output. In problems where the use of expensive computer simulations is required, metamodels are widely used to speed up the process of global sensitivity analysis. In this paper, a multi-fidelity framework for global sensitivity analysis using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is presented. The goal is to accelerate the computation of Sobol sensitivity indices when the deterministic simulation is expensive and simulations with multiple levels of fidelity are available. This is especially useful in cases where a partial differential equation solver computer code is utilized to solve engineering problems. The multi-fidelity PCE is constructed by combining the low-fidelity and correction PCE. Following this step, the Sobol indices are computed using this combined PCE. The PCE coefficients for both low-fidelity and correction PCE are computed with spectral projection technique and sparse grid integration. In order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method for sensitivity analysis, several simulations are conducted. On the aerodynamic example, the multi-fidelity approach is able to obtain an accurate value of Sobol indices with 36.66% computational cost compared to the standard single-fidelity PCE for a nearly similar accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Global sensitivity analysis; Multi-fidelity; Polynomial chaos expansion; Sobol indices","Polynomials; Uncertainty analysis; Deterministic simulation; Global sensitivity analysis; Multi fidelities; Polynomial chaos expansion; Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE); Sobol indices; Sobol sensitivity indices; Sparse grid integrations; Sensitivity analysis",2-s2.0-85032683508

However, generalizable studies specific to this age group are lacking. The current study aimed to describe the prevalence of sexual orientation disparities in prescription drug misuse among a nationally representative sample of adolescents as well as to examine key correlates of misuse. Method Using data from the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey, we conducted stepwise multivariable weighted logistic regressions, sequentially controlling for demographics, experiences of victimization, mental health, and other illicit substance use. Results Adjusting for grade and race/ethnicity, female SMA and gay and unsure males had significantly elevated odds of ever misusing a prescription drug compared to heterosexual adolescents (ORs from 1.7–2.5). Most sexual orientation disparities among females remained significant with the addition of victimization and mental health covariates but attenuated completely after controlling for other illicit drug use. The effect for unsure males attenuated when victimization variables were included, but the effect for gay males remained significant through the final model. Controlling for other illicit drug use, mental health variables remained significant correlates for females whereas only forced sex was significant for males. Conclusion These results suggest experiences of victimization and mental health partially account for the disparities in prescription drug misuse between SMA and heterosexual adolescents, and their effects may differ by sex. A combination of structural, individual coping, and universal drug prevention approaches should be used to make the largest impact on reducing these disparities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescent; Bisexual; Gay; Lesbian; Prescription drugs; Sexual minority; Victimization","adolescent; Article; bisexuality; cannabis smoking; controlled study; disease association; drug misuse; ethnic difference; female; forced sexual intercourse; high risk population; homosexual male; hopelessness; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; prevalence; race difference; sadness; sex difference; sexual intercourse; sexual minority; sexual orientation; suicidal ideation; victim",2-s2.0-85030669755

Here, we reconstructed atmospheric trace metals pollution during the past century using core sediments from a large and deep alpine lake in Southwest China. The implication of in lake and/or in watershed sediment focusing in pollution quantification is discussed by analyzing 15 sediment cores. Factor analysis and enrichment factor indicated Cd, Pb and Sb as the typical pollutants. Distinct peaks of Pb and Sb pollution were observed around the 1920s, but little Pb pollution was detected in recent decades, different from other studies in similar regions. Cadmium pollution was observed until the mid-1980s synchronized with Sb. The distinctive variations in atmospheric trace metal pollution process in Southwest China highlight the regional and sub-regional sources of metal pollutants, which should be primarily attributed to non-ferrous metal smelting emissions. Both natural and anthropogenic metals showed wide concentration ranges though exhibited similar temporal trends in the 15 cores. Spatial variations of anthropogenic metals were influenced by the in-watershed pollutants remobilization, whereas, natural metals were regulated by the detrital materials in the sub-basin. In-lake sediment focusing had little influence on the spatial distributions of all metals, different from the traditional sediment focusing pattern observed in small lakes. Anthropogenic Cd accumulation in sediments ranged from 1.5 to 10.1 mg m− 2 in a specific core with an average of 6.5 mg m− 2 for the entire lake, highlighting that a reliable whole-lake pollutant budget requires an analysis of multiple cores.

The study draws on archival and contextual research to underscore development paradoxes: the safe development paradox - federal policies aimed at making hazardous areas safer that have resulted in just the opposite - and the local government paradox - local governments permitting development of hazardous areas through lax land-use regulations and zoning while their residents bear the burden of hazards events. These paradoxes are used to illustrate the rapid development of an urban watershed and associated increase in flood risk. A chronology of development patterns from the 1930s with the expansion of the central core urbanized footprint of Columbia shows an increasing level of flood risk exposure as creeks were channelized, ornamental lakes developed, and high-end housing built, all with local government approval. In contrast, the uptake of National Flood Insurance policies remained below national averages for the level of risk in the region especially in the urbanized areas. Unabated hazard exposure and lack of mitigation set the stage for the significant losses incurred in the 2015 flood event and the uneven spatial variability in impacts. Unlike the impacts of Hurricane Katrina or the 2016 Louisiana flash floods, the burden of flood losses fell mostly on residents who could afford to bear the loss. With the exception of the discussion about buy-outs, this catastrophic flash flood event did not lead to a review of or change in land use, building, or zoning ordinances. Instead, the relatively quick residential recovery allowed the community to return to its predisaster state with seemingly few lessons learned. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Development paradoxes; Flash floods; Residential recovery; Social sciences; South Carolina","Flood damage; Flood insurance; Hazards; Housing; Insurance; Land use; Laws and legislation; Rain; Risk management; Social sciences; Urban growth; Zoning; Catastrophic consequences; Development paradoxes; Development patterns; Flash flood; Historic development; Land use regulations; South Carolina; Spatial variability; Floods",2-s2.0-85029911568

Results demonstrate that the mercury accumulation rate has steadily increased since the beginning of the 19th century, with maximum values of 9.3 μg m− 2 yr− 1 recorded ~ 1940. Lead isotopic ratios show two mixing lines: one which represents inputs from local and regional geogenic sources, and another that comprises regional geogenic and pollution sources. Detrending the Pb isotopic ratio record (thereby extracting the effect of the geogenic mixing) has enabled us to reconstruct a detailed chronology of metal pollution. The first sustained decrease in Pb isotope signals is recorded as beginning ~ 1740–1780 with the lowest values (indicating the highest pollution signature) dated to ~ 1960–1970. The 206Pb/207Pb ratio of excess Pb (measuring 1.222, and reflecting pollution-generated Pb), when compared with the Pb isotopic composition of the Sandhavn peat record since the 19th century and the timing of Pb enrichments, clearly points to the dominance of pollution sources from North America, although it did not prove possible to further differentiate the emissions sources geographically. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric deposition; Hg; Isotopic residuals; Metal pollution; Pb isotopes; Peat","Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Hydrogen bonds; Isotopes; Lead; Mercury (metal); Meteorological problems; Mixing; Peat; Pollution; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric pollutants; Atmospheric pollution; Isotopic residuals; Mercury accumulation; Mercury contamination; Metal pollution; Pb isotopes; Air pollution; coal; lead 206; lead 207; mercury; petroleum; radioisotope; unclassified drug; arctic environment; atmospheric pollution; isotopic ratio; lead isotope; long range transport; mercury (element); nineteenth century; peat; pollutant source; pollutant transport; air pollution; Article; chronology; energy consumption; Greenland; industry; isotope analysis; North America; pollution transport; priority journal; wood; Arctic; Eurasia; Greenland; North America",2-s2.0-85029672677

Patients with breast cancer are typically at risk of skeletal complications throughout their disease course. The receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANKL) inhibitor denosumab and bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid) are approved in Europe for the prevention of skeletal-related events (pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression) in adults with bone metastases secondary to solid tumours. These agents are also approved at lower doses for the treatment of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, a population largely overlapping with those in the early stages of breast cancer, and those with cancer treatment-induced bone loss, which is caused primarily by aromatase inhibitors. In this review, we consider the evidence supporting the use of therapeutic agents to protect bone health throughout the course of breast cancer. Timing of treatment initiation, dose and treatment duration may prove to be barriers to the optimization of the practical use of these agents in the management of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, with longer survival times, patients may expect to receive long-term treatment with denosumab or bisphosphonates, therefore consideration must be given to safety. Thus, we aim to summarize the recommendations for the use of these agents in management of patients with breast cancer in Europe.

Methods Adults (N = 413) averaging 36.39 (SD = 13.02) years of age completed the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol questionnaire at baseline, followed by alcohol use measures (frequency and quantity) and the Alcohol Myopia Scale one month later. Three structural equation models based on differing construct manifestations of alcohol expectancies served to longitudinally forecast alcohol use and myopia. Results In Model 1, overall expectancy predicted greater alcohol use and higher levels of all three myopic effects. In Model 2, specifying separate positive and negative expectancy factors, positive but not negative expectancy predicted greater use. Furthermore, positive expectancy and use explained higher myopic relief and higher self-inflation, whereas positive expectancy, negative expectancy, and use explained higher myopic excess. In Model 3, the seven specific expectancy subscales (sociability, tension reduction, liquid courage, sexuality, cognitive and behavioral impairment, risk and aggression, and self-perception) were simultaneously specified as predictors. Tension reduction expectancy, sexuality expectancy, and use contributed to higher myopic relief; sexuality expectancy and use explained higher myopic self-inflation; and risk and aggression expectancy and use accounted for higher myopic excess. Across all three predictive models, the total variance explained ranged from 12 to 19% for alcohol use, 50 to 51% for relief, 29 to 34% for self-inflation, and 32 to 35% for excess. Conclusions Findings support that the type of alcohol myopia experienced is a concurrent function of self-fulfilling alcohol prophecies and drinking levels.

Acidophytic lichens growing on tree trunks are known to be sensitive to both N and S deposition. Given that tree species and climatic factors affect the composition of epiphytic lichen communities and modify lichen responses to air pollution, this study focused on the impact of urban air pollution on acidophytes growing on boreal conifer trunks. The study was performed in the Helsinki metropolitan area, southern Finland, where annual mean nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations range from 4–5 μg m− 3 to &gt; 50 μg m− 3. In addition, background forest sites in southern and northern Finland were included. The results demonstrated elevated N contents (≥ 0.7%) in Hypogymnia physodes and Platismatia glauca at all the sites where the species occurred. In the Helsinki metropolitan area, a higher frequency of green algae + Scoliociosporum chlorococcum and reduced numerical frequencies of other indicator lichen species (e.g. Pseudevernia furfuracea, Bryoria spp., Usnea spp.) were associated with elevated atmospheric concentrations of NO2 and particulate matter containing N, as well as elevated concentrations of inorganic N in bark. The N isotope values (δ15N) of lichens supported the uptake of oxidized N mainly originating from road traffic. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) also negatively affected the most sensitive species, despite the current low levels (1–4 μg m− 3 yr− 1). Critical levels of 5 μg NO2 m− 3 yr− 1 and 0.5 μg NH3 m− 3 yr− 1, and a critical load of 2–3 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 are proposed for protecting the diversity of boreal acidophytes. This study calls for measurements of the throughfall of various N fractions in urban forest ecosystems along precipitation and temperature gradients to verify the proposed critical levels and loads. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Acidophyte frequencies; Ammonium; Bark N; Lichen N; Nitrate; Nitrogen dioxide","Air pollution; Algae; Deposition; Ecosystems; Forestry; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Acidophyte frequencies; Ammonium; Atmospheric concentration; Elevated concentrations; Nitrogen dioxides; Numerical frequencies; Pseudevernia furfuracea; Urban forest ecosystems; Fungi; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; ammonium; lichen; nitrate; nitrogen dioxide; urban area; air pollution; Article; bark; Bryoria; conifer; controlled study; Finland; forest; green alga; Hypogymnia physodes; lichen (organism); national park; nitrogen deposition; particulate matter; Platismatia glauca; priority journal; Pseudevernia furfuracea; Scoliociosporum chlorococcum; Scots pine; tree trunk; urban area; Usnea; Finland; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi; Bryoria; Chlorococcum; Chlorophyta; Coniferophyta; Hypogymnia physodes; Pinus sylvestris; Platismatia glauca; Pseudevernia furfuracea; Usnea",2-s2.0-85029511017

There is increasing interest in the role of the cerebellum in these processes and the potential involvement of GABAergic pathways in neurodevelopmental disorders. We propose that preterm birth, and the associated loss of the trophic intrauterine environment, alters the development of the cerebellum, contributing to ongoing neurobehavioral disorders. Methods Guinea pigs were delivered preterm (GA62) or spontaneously at term (GA69), and tissues collected at corrected postnatal day (PND) 28. Neurodevelopmental and GABAergic markers myelin basic protein (MBP), neuronal nuclei (NeuN), calbindin (Purkinje cells), and GAD67 (GABA synthesis enzyme) were analysed in cerebellar lobules IX and X by immunohistochemistry. Protein expression of GAD67 and GAT1 (GABA transporter enzyme) were quantified by western blot, whilst neurosteroid-sensitive GABAA receptor subunits were measured by RT-PCR. Results MBP immunostaining was increased in lobule IX of preterm males, and reduced in lobule X of preterm females when compared to their term counterparts. GAD67 staining was decreased in lobule IX and X of the preterm males, but only in lobule X of the preterm females compared to term cohorts for each sex. Internal granule cell layer width of lobule X was decreased in preterm cohorts of both sexes compared to terms. There were no differences between gestational age groups for NeuN staining, GAD67 and GAT1 protein expression as measured by western blotting, or GABAA receptor subunits as measured by RT-PCR between preterm and term for either sex. Conclusions The present findings suggest that components of the cerebellar GABAergic system of the ex-preterm cerebellum are disrupted. The higher expression of myelin in the preterm males may be due to a deficit in axonal pruning, whereas females have a deficit in myelination at 28 corrected days of age. Together these ongoing alterations may contribute to the neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders observed in those born preterm. © 2017 ISDN","ADHD; Cerebellum; GABA; GAD67; Juvenile; Myelin; Neurodevelopment; Neurosteroids; Preterm","calbindin; GABA transporter 1; glutamate decarboxylase 67; myelin basic protein; neuron specific nuclear protein; neurosteroid; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; behavior disorder; brain development; cell component; cerebellum; cerebellum granular layer; controlled study; enzyme subunit; female; GABAergic system; gestational age; guinea pig; immunohistochemistry; male; myelination; nerve cell differentiation; nonhuman; perinatal period; piglet; premature labor; prematurity; priority journal; protein expression; Purkinje cell; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; term birth; uterus; Western blotting",2-s2.0-85031755264

The staggered array with decreased streamwise spacing is shown to have the highest total power per ‘footprint’ area among the layouts tested. For the staggered arrays, increased downstream separation had little effect on total power generated, while decreasing the lateral spacing below 2 rotor diameters decreased the power.

Using a sequence of frequency stepping sinusoidal pulses as the excitation signal, a set of transient responses in the vicinity of the resonant frequency are obtained. The envelopes of the time-domain response signals are calculated by Hilbert transform. The location of the resonant frequency, as well as whether the gyroscope is working in linear or nonlinear region, can be approximately assessed from the waveform of the envelopes. In order to obtain the dynamic parameters of the gyroscope, a modified FREEVIB algorithm is designed for analyzing the free damped oscillation signals. The instantaneous amplitudes and instantaneous frequencies that extracted by Hilbert transform are further processed by singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Numerical simulation results indicate that the algorithm behaves better anti-noise performance and can be practically used for processing the experimentally sampled transient signals. Vibrating ring microgyroscopes are experimentally tested under different air pressure (10–100 Pa). From the largest response segment of the response sequences, qualification of the operation state, i.e. whether the gyroscope is working in the nonlinear region, is obtained from the envelope of the forced transient signal.

Once it hybridizes with miR-16, the hairpin structure is unlocked so that the terminal modified signal molecule (methylene blue, MB) would give a decreased electrochemical signal. Meanwhile, once it recognizes AFP, concanavalin A (ConA) modified silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can bind to AFP at the sensing surface. An obvious electrochemical signal of AgNPs can thus be generated for AFP detection. In this way, one-step and simultaneous detection of miRNA-16 and AFP can easily be realized by collecting the two sensitive and non-interfering electrochemical signals. Compared with traditional single biomarker detection methods, this assay strategy can improve the accuracy of HCC by monitoring two kinds of serological biomarkers species. Besides, this novel electrochemical biosensor based on ESP is simple, low-cost and efficient, which make it promising to improve the accuracy and specificity for the diagnosis HCC in the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alpha fetoprotein (AFP); Electrochemical biosensor; Hairpin-structured DNA probe; Hepatocellular carcinoma biomarkers; microRNA-16","Aromatic compounds; Biosensors; DNA; Oligonucleotides; Probes; RNA; Silver; Alphafetoprotein (AFP); DNA Probe; Electrochemical biosensor; Hepatocellular carcinoma; MicroRNAs; Biomarkers",2-s2.0-85029168340

Even if WPG is forecasted to deal with such a problem, the uncertainty of WPG cannot be fully resolved because of its randomness and intermittent nature. This paper proposes a two-step energy-storage system (ESS) sizing and operation strategy for enhancing the WPG reliability. From the analysis of WPG data, it is determined that the uncertainty that leads to deterioration in reliability affects the instantaneous changes in WPG significantly. In this regard, ESS sizing and operation strategies are designed based on the frequency-domain analysis using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The ESS sizing is firstly determined to filter out high-frequency components, and the ESS operation is determined considering the ESS sizing constraints for reducing the difference between the actual WPG and its forecasting. A case study is presented using the data from a large-scale wind farm with 4782 MW total capacity of 42 plants located in Columbia River Gorge, United States. The numerical results obtained demonstrate that the proposed ESS method can reduce the root-mean-squared error by up to 26% and further reduce by about 3% compared to the conventional method with the ESS. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete Fourier transform (DFT); Energy-storage system (ESS); Forecast; Operation; Sizing; Uncertainty; Wind-power generation (WPG)","Digital storage; Electric power generation; Energy storage; Forecasting; Frequency domain analysis; Mean square error; Numerical methods; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Energy storage system sizing (ESS); Energy storage systems; High frequency components; Large-scale wind farms; Operation; Root mean squared errors; Sizing; Uncertainty; Discrete Fourier transforms; error analysis; forecasting method; Fourier transform; numerical method; operations technology; power generation; power plant; size; storage; uncertainty analysis; wind farm; Columbia River Gorge; Oregon; United States; United States",2-s2.0-85031761940

Temporal variability of drought is calculated for various time scales (3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months) for 20 weather stations over the 1961–2012 period. The spatial patterns of drought were identified by applying a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the SPI and SPEI values at different time scales. The results revealed three heterogeneous and spatially well-defined regions with different temporal evolution of droughts: 1) Northeastern (inland desert); 2) Southern (mountainous landscape); 3) Northwestern (Mediterranean coast). The evolutionary characteristics of drought during 1961–2012 were analysed including spatial and temporal variability of SPI and SPEI, the frequency distribution, and the drought duration. The results of the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test applied to the SPI and SPEI series indicate prevailing significant negative trends (drought) at all stations. Both drought indices have been correlated both on spatial and temporal scales and they are highly comparable, especially, over a 12 and 24 month accumulation period. We concluded that the temporal and spatial characteristics of the SPI and SPEI can be used for developing a drought intensity - areal extent - and frequency curve that assesses the variability of regional droughts in Syria. The analysis of both indices suggests that all three regions had a severe drought in the 1990s, which had never been observed before in the country. Furthermore, the 2007–2010 drought was the driest period in the instrumental record, happening just before the onset of the recent conflict in Syria. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate regionalization; Drought; SPEI; SPI; Syrian conflict","Principal component analysis; Spatial variables measurement; Time measurement; Climate regionalization; Frequency distributions; Spatial and temporal analysis; Spatial and temporal scale; Spatial and temporal variability; Spatiotemporal characteristics; SPEI; Syrian conflict; Drought",2-s2.0-85032732134

Understanding the structure and stability of turbulent flames in this mode has been the aim of many research groups who employed special burner designs to control the fuel and air mixing process. In this work, a modified design inspired by the Wolfhard-Parker slot burner was developed for planar turbulent flames with inlet conditions that are overall lean yet either compositionally inhomogeneous or partially premixed. The new burner is referred as the Concentric Flow Slot Burner (CFSB). The stability characteristics and flame structure are investigated for methane and natural gas fuels using planar laser induced fluorescence of C2Hx and high speed PLIF-OH. The effects of the jet equivalence ratio, the level of inhomogeneity, and the Reynolds number are investigated in this work. The data show that the flames with inhomogeneous mixture are more stable than fully premixed flames. Lean flames are stabilized in the CFSB burner. Stability is significantly improved by the use of a hollow truncated rectangular pyramid nozzle at the burner exit. The reaction zone structure varies significantly in the current burner from thin structures in rich flames to distributed with thick preheat zones in lean flames. The effect of the level of inhomogeneity on the reaction zone structure is presented and discussed. The new CFSB burner is able to generate a wide range of turbulent planar flames spanning the entire range from non-premixed to fully premixed flames. In addition, the high stability level of the burner allows for the study of highly turbulent flames of practical interest. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","C2Hx-PLIF; Gaseous fuels; Inhomogeneous mixtures; OH-PLIF; Slot burner; Turbulent combustion","Air; Fuels; Gas fuels; Mixtures; Reynolds number; Stability; C2Hx-PLIF; Gaseous Fuel; Inhomogeneous mixtures; OH-PLIF; Slot burner; Turbulent combustion; Combustion",2-s2.0-85032340552

Estimates are obtained to value a supplier quality improvement activity and assess if it is worth gaining more information to reduce epistemic uncertainty. The theoretical properties of our model provide new insights about the relationship between the degree of epistemic uncertainty, the effectiveness of development programmes, and the levels of investment. We find that the optimal level of investment does not have a monotonic relationship with the rate of effectiveness. If investment is deferred until epistemic uncertainty is removed then the expected optimal investment monotonically decreases as prior variance increases but only if the prior mean is above a critical threshold.

Safe operation is dependent on how technology is used, so it is important to take human factors issues into consideration. During design or modification of the control room system, its ability to support safe operation must be assessed to ensure that safety-critical discrepancies are eliminated before implementation. Methods are a necessary tool in human factors evaluation, and there are many to choose from. One prerequisite for evaluation is knowing what to evaluate, and this knowledge determines which methods are most suitable. The purpose of this paper is to identify categories of measures that can guide the choice of evaluation methods for assessing nuclear power plant control room systems. Measures targeted by human factors evaluation methods were compared with aspects that contribute to safe operation and measures proposed and used by other researchers. The conclusion of this paper is that measures targeted by human factors evaluation methods can be grouped into six categories: system performance, task performance, teamwork, use of resources, user experience, and identification of design discrepancies. These six categories can guide the choice of human factors evaluation methods to assess socio-technical systems.

Methods Participants were 894 college students enrolled at a large, Midwestern university. Participants completed measures of WTS frequency and quantity and perceived/actual descriptive and injunctive norms of WTS. Results Over one-third of the sample reported ever trying WTS, while only 2% reported current (past month) use. When comparing ever and never WP smokers, ever smokers reported greater perceived peer approval of WTS. Both males and females overestimated WTS frequency of same-sex students at their university. Discussion The current study is one of the first to investigate descriptive and injunctive norms of WTS among college students. Students who report WTS are more likely to overestimate descriptive norms of WTS among their peers, suggesting corrective normative feedback regarding actual use by peers may be an important target for WTS intervention among college students.

In order to collect the multipath diversity, a simple rotation matrix is designed, independent of the number of subchannels at the transmitter. For the rotated V-OFDM receiver, a partial intersection sphere decoding with weighted voting method is proposed by exploiting the sparse nature of the multipath channel. The proposed receiver chooses the transmitted vector from the set with the maximum likelihood estimation generated using the partial intersection sphere decoding method. For an extreme case, such as when a candidate set is empty, which usually occurs at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), an efficient weighted voting system is used to estimate the transmitted vectors symbol-by-symbol.

The battery installed at customer premises is shared between customers and local distribution network operators (DNOs) to achieve two goals-minimizing energy costs for customers and releasing distribution network constraints for DNOs. The two objectives are realised through a new concept - “charging envelope”, which dynamically allocates storage capacity between customers and the DNO. Charging envelope first reserves a portion of storage capacity for network operator's priority to mitigate network problems caused by either thermal or voltage limit violation in order to defer or even reduce network investment. Then, the remaining capacity is used by customers to respond to energy price variations to facilitate in-home PV penetration. Case study results show that the concept can provide an attractive solution to realise the dual conflicting objectives for network operators and customers. The proposed concept has been adopted by the Western Power Distribution (UK) in a smart grid demonstration project SoLa Bristol. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Charging envelope; Demand response; Energy management; Energy storage; PV; Tariff",,2-s2.0-85030713786

Classical deterministic modeling approach explains the dynamical behavior of such systems by using impulsive differential equations. This modeling strategy assumes that the dynamical behavior of the whole system is deterministic, continuous, and it adds jumps to the state vector at certain times. Although deterministic approach is satisfactory in many cases, it is a well-known fact that stochasticity or uncertainty has crucial importance for dynamical behavior of many others. In this study, we propose to include this abrupt change in the stochastic modeling approach, beside the deterministic one. In our model, we introduce jumps to chemical master equation and use the Gillespie direct method to simulate the evolutionary system.

Most adolescents will engage in some form of substance use, and a sizeable minority will transition to using multiple substances. An emerging body of research takes a person-centered approach to model adolescent substance use over time; however, the findings have been equivocal. Our study modeled adolescent substance use transition patterns over three years based on a comprehensive list of substances and examined gender as a moderator. Methods We used three annual waves of data (Time 2, Time 3, and Time 4) from an ongoing longitudinal study of an ethnically diverse sample of 1042 adolescents originally recruited from multiple high schools in southeast Texas. Participants were 56% female, 32% Hispanics, 30% Whites, 29% African Americans, and 9% other with an average of 16.1 years (SD = 0.79) at Time 2. Data were analyzed using latent transition analyses. Results The study identified three substance use statuses (Mild Alcohol Use, Alcohol and Moderate Marijuana Use, and Polysubstance Use) and suggested that adolescents generally remained in the same statuses over time. When they did transition, it was typically to a more harmful substance use status. Further, males were more likely than females to be polysubstance users and had higher probabilities of transiting to and remaining in a more harmful drug use status. Conclusions The study identifies overall and gender specific adolescent substance use transition patterns, which are vital to informing intervention development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescents; Gender; Latent transition analysis; Substance use","alcohol; cannabis; adolescent; alcohol consumption; Article; cannabis use; controlled study; drug use; ethnicity; female; gender; human; latent class analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; prevalence; sex difference; substance use",2-s2.0-85031753451

Assuming that communities are working under limited resources available to improve their resilience, an important focus of this paper is on prioritizing performance gaps such that those with the greatest negative effect on the current level of resilience may be addressed with mitigation first. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted on alternative mitigation actions for each priority performance gap. The result is a set of cost-effective mitigation actions to be implemented that will address prioritized performance gaps between the community's target and current levels of resilience, thus improving community resilience. The resilience evaluation methodology is demonstrated on a case study of the City of Boston using scenario hazard events simulated. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Community resilience; Cost-benefit; Engineering; Performance gap; Prioritization","Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Costs; Economics; Engineering; Hazards; Community resiliences; Cost benefits; Cost effective; Economic activities; Evaluation methodologies; Infrastructure systems; Performance gaps; Prioritization; Cost benefit analysis; action plan; community development; cost-benefit analysis; economic analysis; engineering; hazard assessment; infrastructure planning; methodology; natural hazard; prioritization; resource availability; Boston; Massachusetts; United States",2-s2.0-85032634419

Moss and soil samples collected in 2010 and 2005, respectively, show both a distinct long-range atmospheric transport PMF factor including a dominant Pb loading along with smaller loadings of Mo, Cd, Sb, and As, and a geogenic factor dominated by Ce, La, and Y. Other PMF factors for moss and soil are mainly anthropogenic except for two soil factors, a Cr, Co, Ce dominated factor, and an Eu factor. The source area of Eu is mainly inland consistent with its divalent oxidation state. A significant advantage of PMF factors is that their loadings are scaled according to their relative factor contributions. The PMF air pollution factor F3 in moss with average contribution of 7.11 μg/g produces an air pollution input of 5.0 μg/g which compares well with literature values for the total Pb concentration in moss for 2005 in southern Norway.

The suggested method evaluates not only the voltage magnitude, but also the voltage stability condition of each node in a probabilistic manner. Furthermore, the uncertainties of distributed generation and load demand are taken into account by this index. The proposed methodology is applied to IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus distribution test systems, and the results are interpreted. Four scenarios are studied to assess the impacts of substation voltage changes and different probability density functions of load on the distribution functions of voltage and VSI.

The viscoelastic models are derived by expanding thermodynamic balance equations for both fractal and non-fractal media. The order of the fractional time derivative is shown to strongly affect the accuracy of the viscoelastic constitutive predictions. Model validation uses experimental data describing viscoelasticity of the dielectric elastomer Very High Bond (VHB) 4910. Since these materials are known for their broad applications in smart structures, it is important to characterize and accurately predict their behavior across a large range of time scales. Whereas integer order viscoelastic models can yield reasonable agreement with data, the model parameters often lack robustness in prediction at different deformation rates. Alternatively, fractional order models of viscoelasticity provide an alternative framework to more accurately quantify complex rate-dependent behavior. Prior research that has considered fractional order viscoelasticity lacks experimental validation and contains limited links between viscoelastic theory and fractional order derivatives. To address these issues, we use fractional order operators to experimentally validate fractional and non-fractional viscoelastic models in elastomeric solids using Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The fractional order model is found to be advantageous as predictions are significantly more accurate than integer order viscoelastic models for deformation rates spanning four orders of magnitude. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fractal media; Fractional order; Parameter estimation; Viscoelasticity","Behavioral research; Deformation; Elastomers; Forecasting; Fractals; Parameter estimation; Uncertainty analysis; Experimental validations; Fractal media; Fractional order; Fractional order derivatives; Fractional order models; Rate-dependent behaviors; Thermodynamic balance; Uncertainty quantifications; Viscoelasticity",2-s2.0-85032822667

In order to achieve this goal, a virtual multibody dummy of the pedestrian was developed and multiple simulations of accidents were performed using vehicles with different frontal profile geometry, from different classes. The type of accidents considered is characteristic for urban areas and occur at relatively low speed (around 30 km/h) when an adult pedestrian is struck from the rear and the head acceleration variation are the measurement of the accident severity. In the accident simulation 3D meshes were applied on the geometry of the vehicles, in order to define the contact surface with the virtual dummy, similar with real vehicles. The validation of the virtual pedestrian dummy was made by performing two crash-tests with a real dummy, using the same conditions as in the simulations. The measured accelerations in the tests were the linear and angular accelerations of the head during the impact, and these were compared with the ones from the simulations. After validating the virtual model of the car-to-pedestrian accident, we were able to perform multiple simulations with different vehicle shapes. These simulations are revealing how the geometric parameters of the vehicle’s frontal profile are influencing the head acceleration. This paper highlights the main geometric parameters of the frontal profile design that influence the head injury severity and the way that the vehicles can be improved by modifying these parameters.

Spring wheat is widely grown in this region, but the negative impacts of climate change have seriously threatened spring wheat production in recent years. To adapt to these changes, it is imperative to study the influence of climate change on spring wheat production. We employed a vulnerability assessment method to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of climate change on spring wheat production in Inner Mongolia and recommended specific countermeasures based on the results. The average temperature and precipitation during the spring wheat growing season was 16.5 °C and 224 mm, respectively, from 1961 to 2012. Northeastern Inner Mongolia was characterized by lower temperature and higher precipitation; the eastern region had both higher temperature and precipitation; and the southwestern area had higher temperature and lower precipitation. The climate in this region showed a warming and drying trend from 1961 to 2012, with average temperature during the spring wheat growing season increasing with an average rate 0.3 °C/10a and average precipitation decreasing with an average rate 4.3 mm/10a. Over the study period (from 1996 to 2012), the vulnerability of spring wheat in the eastern, central, and southwestern areas of Inner Mongolia was high, whereas that in the northeast was relatively low. Assuming the adaptive capacity of spring wheat is stable, the comprehensive unit vulnerability of spring wheat production is expected to significantly increase under the investigated climate change scenarios (based on historical climate trends and RCP4.5, RCP8.5 scenarios) relative to average values over the study period.

However, until now there is little literature considering these effects on optimization and vibration isolation. In this paper, a new decoupling condition of stiffness matrix is proposed base on elegant algebraic approach, with which the dynamic isotropy index can be expressed in terms of natural frequencies. When the height of the mass center of the payload is zero, dynamic decoupling as well as translational and combined dynamic isotropy can be satisfied at the same time. Since the dynamic mass matrix is coupled when the height is not zero, an objective function that concerns the dynamic isotropy index and strut masses is formulated. The effects of the strut masses and payload on the natural frequencies and dynamic isotropy index are discussed. The genetic algorithm and differential evolution algorithm are implemented to obtain the suitable parameters for optimization design and vibration isolation purpose. That the optimization results of the two algorithms are nearly the same indicates that the optimized configurations are convincible. On the basis of the optimization process, we take into account a real link and fabricate a real optimized configuration in our laboratory.

Therefore new algorithms and techniques that enable more efficient computations are needed to extend the applicability of SDP based AC OPF algorithms to very large power networks. This paper proposes a three-stage algorithm for AC OPF based storage placement in large power systems. The first step involves network reduction whereby a small equivalent system that approximates the original power network is obtained. The AC OPF problem for this equivalent system is then solved by applying an SDR to the non-convex problem. Finally, the results from the reduced system are transferred to the original system using a set of repeating optimizations. The efficacy of the algorithm is tested through case studies using two IEEE benchmark systems and comparing the solutions obtained to those of DC OPF based storage allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces more accurate results than the DC OPF based algorithm. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Equivalent power system; Large power system planning; Optimal Power Flow (OPF); Semi-Definite Programming (SDP); Storage allocation","Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Storage allocation (computer); Ac optimal power flows; Equivalent power system; Global optimal solutions; Large power systems; Optimal power flows; Semi-definite program (SDP); Semi-definite programming; Semidefinite relaxation; Optimization",2-s2.0-85027683518

This paper explores how one of these tools could be made interactive in order to increase its effectiveness. In particular, we use Virtual Reality (VR) techniques, adapting them to the constraints imposed by on-board aircraft use, such as usage on non-immersive, small displays. As a practical application, the paper examines aviation life preserver donning, which the literature has shown to be particularly difficult for passengers. To evaluate the proposed mobile VR tool, we contrasted it with the traditional safety briefing card in a between-groups study with 68 participants, age 20–24, focusing on different aspects of effectiveness. The results of the study show that the participants who used the mobile VR tool were able to transfer the presented safety knowledge to the real world, and don an aviation life preserver significantly faster and with fewer errors than participants who used the traditional briefing card. Moreover, these objective results were consistent with subjective ratings by participants; the mobile VR tool was perceived as significantly more engaging, simpler, and more effective than the traditional briefing card. Finally, participants who used the mobile VR tool attained a higher level of self-efficacy. The generalizability of these results would benefit with additional work aimed at an older age cohort that would ostensibly be less familiar with interactive VR technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation safety; Mobile devices; Safety education; Safety training; Virtual reality","Fighter aircraft; Knowledge management; Mobile devices; Safety engineering; Training aircraft; Transportation; Virtual reality; Aviation safety; Safety education; Safety knowledge; Safety training; Self efficacy; Small display; Subjective rating; VR technology; Safety factor; adult; aircraft; analytical error; Article; aviation; briefing card; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; female; human; knowledge; male; priority journal; self concept; simulation training; traffic safety; virtual reality; young adult",2-s2.0-85032438643

Since the late 2000s, the Beijing government began forced redevelopment of urban villages at prime and strategically located sites. Potential of high value returns has enabled the municipal government to offer relatively high compensation rates, creating hence a new multimillion “propertied” class. While new estates have edged out low-income tenants, they have created “gentrified” resettlement communities with predominantly middle- to high-income high-tech tenants or owner-occupiers. Supported by site surveys, this paper examines this state-dominated property formalization and regularization process, and the ways in which informalities have been replaced by a sharp value uplift shared between local governments and local peasants. It is also noted that such replacement has created a new frontier of social inequalities where dislocated low-wage tenants have been eliminated and have to source affordable residence in more remote places.

It was found that the more complicated the mapping for the discrete spatial compatibility response task, the more severe the interference with the tracking task. Although performance on both the tracking and spatial response tasks was impaired, the magnitude of impairment was not as great as expected, implying that focal and ambient vision required for the tracking task and spatial task, respectively, might be deployed, at least partly, from separate resources.

This study is the first to assess potential adverse human health effects in the Chemical Valley Sarnia (CVS) area, around the St. Clair River, using health risk models, ecological and pollution indices. Large quantities of particulate matters (PM) are generated from anthropogenic activities, which contain several heavy metals in trace quantities with potentially adverse effects to humans and environmental health. The distribution, and human health impact assessment of trace element concentrations in PM fractions were examined. Elemental concentrations of As, Cd, Cr (VI), Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ni, Zn were determined in the PM size-segregated samples collected from the CVS area between 2014 and 2017. The results showed relatively high concentration of PM&lt;2.5 (87.19±8.1([formula presented])) which is approximately 4 times the WHO air quality guidelines. Pb concentration (143.03 ± 46.87 ηg/m3) was 3.6 times higher than the air quality standards of NAAQS. Cr (VI) showed moderate to considerable contamination (Cf=4) in the CVS while Cr (VI), Pb, and Ni had enrichment factor Ef &lt; 3 (minimal), signifying contributions from anthropogenic activities. Pollution load index (PLi) value observed was 1.4 indicating human health risk from the PM, especially for the children in the area. The deposition fluxes (DΦ) showed that PM-bound metals could potentially bypass the head airways and cause damages to the tracheobronchial tree, increasing the human health risks of nephroblastomasis development. The main route of entry for the heavy metal bound PM in humans were observed as through ingestion and inhalation. The highest total excess cancer risks observed for children (6.7×10−4) and adult (1.0×10−4) indicating potential cancer effects. The Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) increased from Pb &lt; Ni &lt; Cd &lt; Cr (VI) &lt; As.

Background Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the primary cause of death worldwide. AMI is the most common consequence of CHD. Depressive symptoms are an important risk factor for CHD and increased risk of AMI. Understanding the relationship between depressive symptoms and short term complications for patients with AMI is important for determining their needs, developing interventions, and evaluating the outcomes of interventions. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted with 175 patients who were admitted to the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of four large hospitals in Jordan. During the interview, within 72 h (mean, 38 ± 16 h) of admission to the hospital, participants completed the sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory Scale. Results The mean age was 66.9 ± 11.0 years. The number of patients with mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms who developed complications was significantly higher than those with minimal depressive symptoms, p ˂ 0.001. Patients with mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms had longer lengths of stay in the ICU and in hospital than patients with minimal depressive symptoms. Patients with mild, moderate and severe depressive symptoms were at 1.22 times higher risk for developing complications than patients with minimal depressive symptoms. Moreover, previous AMI history increased the risk for developing complication by 150%. Conclusions Depressive symptoms were an independent predictor of complications and increased length of stay after AMI.

Understanding public health opinions on social media, such as Twitter, offers a unique approach to characterizing common health issues such as diabetes, diet, exercise, and obesity (DDEO); however, collecting and analyzing a large scale conversational public health data set is a challenging research task. The goal of this research is to analyze the characteristics of the general public's opinions in regard to diabetes, diet, exercise and obesity (DDEO) as expressed on Twitter. A multi-component semantic and linguistic framework was developed to collect Twitter data, discover topics of interest about DDEO, and analyze the topics. From the extracted 4.5 million tweets, 8% of tweets discussed diabetes, 23.7% diet, 16.6% exercise, and 51.7% obesity. The strongest correlation among the topics was determined between exercise and obesity (p <.0002). Other notable correlations were: diabetes and obesity (p <.0005), and diet and obesity (p <.001). DDEO terms were also identified as subtopics of each of the DDEO topics. The frequent subtopics discussed along with “Diabetes”, excluding the DDEO terms themselves, were blood pressure, heart attack, yoga, and Alzheimer. The non-DDEO subtopics for “Diet” included vegetarian, pregnancy, celebrities, weight loss, religious, and mental health, while subtopics for “Exercise” included computer games, brain, fitness, and daily plan. Non-DDEO subtopics for “Obesity” included Alzheimer, cancer, and children.

In this study we present the seasonal impacts irrigation practices can have on groundwater resources in a temperate humid region, where the average annual rain/PET ratio is 1.0. In this system the irrigation expansion is solely supported by groundwater pumping, but despite this only 5 boreholes are monitored for hydraulic head data. In this study, we compensate the scarce hydrophysical dataset by incorporating environmental tracers (major ions, δ18O, δ2H and δ13C) and dating tracers (3H, CFC, SF6 and 14C). Results indicate that at 9 of the 15 irrigation sites investigated, groundwater pumping for irrigation has induced the mixing of recent groundwater (up to &lt; 1 year) with older waters. The origin of the older waters was from either the deeper marl aquifer, or the shallow sand-clay aquifer (SCB) that has a 14C mean residence time (MRT) of up to 9700 years. Secondly, although high nitrate loads in infiltrating waters were being diverted via the artificial subsurface drainage system, increases in fertiliser loads have resulted in higher NO3 concentrations in younger groundwater (NO3: 9–45 mg/L, MRT &lt; 20 years), compared with older groundwater (NO3 ≤ 9 mg/L, MRT &gt; 20 years). The changes in flow pathways, induced by irrigation, also results in seasonal declines in groundwater NO3 concentrations due to mixing with older waters. In temperate humid areas, such evaluations of the seasonal evolution of water residence time, mixing process, and agrochemical contaminants are an important contribution to real water resources management in irrigated catchments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater quality; Groundwater resources; Irrigated agriculture; Mixing; Water age","Agriculture; Aquifers; Boreholes; Catchments; Drainage; Fertilizers; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Irrigation; Mixing; Water quality; Water resources; Environmental tracers; Groundwater irrigation; Irrigated agriculture; Irrigation expansions; Irrigation practices; Subsurface drainage system; Water ages; Water resources management; Groundwater resources; carbon 13; carbon 14; chlorofluorocarbon; deuterium; fertilizer; ground water; nitrate; oxygen 18; pesticide; rain; sulfur hexafluoride; surface water; tritium; agricultural practice; aquifer; groundwater; humid environment; irrigation system; mixing; water quality; water resource; aquifer; Article; clay; controlled study; deeper marl aquifer; environmental impact; evapotranspiration; France; geochemistry; humidity; hydrodynamics; irrigation (agriculture); mean residence time; priority journal; river; sand; seasonal variation; water quality; water sampling; water supply",2-s2.0-85029945174

Comparisons among the multifractal spectrums (MFS) estimated indicated that the reduction in resolution affected more in Molboard image in which the minimum scale included in the analysis was one voxel and it was almost imperceptible in the Chisel image. The three multifractal spectrums were quite distinctive when the maximum resolution was chosen and the GC method was used, meanwhile the CC method obtained the MFS of Chisel and Roller too close to be differentiated. The amplitude and symmetry of the multifractal spectrums point out the influence of each tillage tool in the hierarchy of soil structure. Moldboard creates a higher complexity in soil structure as it physically removes the soil. Chisel tends to destruct the aggregates homogenizing soil structure and presents a weak multifractal nature. Finally, Roller is an intermediate case with a scaling character mainly in the lower gray values of the soil image. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","3D-images; Cube Counting; Gliding method; Multifractal; Spatial distribution","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Bins; Compaction; Fractals; Geometry; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Soils; Spatial distribution; Tools; 3-D image; Cube Counting; Gliding method; Multi fractals; Multi-fractal spectrum; Multifractal analysis; Structure characterization; X ray microtomography; Image analysis",2-s2.0-85014115811

In our conclusion, we suggest the use of effective mesh size (MESH), mean patch size (AREA_MN), landscape patch index (LPI), COHESION, and aggregation index (AI). While MESH, AREA_MN, and LPI could be appropriate for assessing ecosystem services in our African landscapes, COHESION and AI could represent the most plausible utility metrics for application in spatial planning because they were less redundant.

There is a multitude of empirical studies examining this relationship using various measures of governance and study designs, coming to diverse conclusions. In order to identify the source of variation across studies, this article conducts a meta-analysis of 32 empirical cross-country studies in the field of economics, containing 227 estimates of the impact of different governance measures on deforestation. Using an ordered probit model, we find that the choice of the governance measure is the main factor in explaining variations in the outcomes of the studies. In particular, studies using environmental policy, ownership rights, presence of environmental NGOs, and rule of law as measures of governance, are more likely to find that better governance reduces deforestation. In contrast, studies using democracy and rights as a measure of governance are more likely to find that deforestation increases, when governance is improved. The finding that not all aspects of governance improvements are equally supportive of forest conservation suggests that more nuanced analyses of specific aspects of environmental governance are required to guide evidence-based policy making. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Deforestation; Governance; Institutions; Meta-analysis",,2-s2.0-85027578298

The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) levels and brain reactivity to provocations. We quantified regional 5-HT1BR binding using [11C]AZ10419369 positron emission tomography (PET) and measured brain activation following provocations with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in eighteen violent offenders and 25 healthy control subjects. The point-subtraction aggression paradigm (PSAP) was used in fMRI to elicit provocations in terms of monetary subtractions from a fictive opponent. We estimated global 5-HT1BR binding using a linear structural equation model, with a single latent response variable (LV1B) modelling shared correlation between 5-HT1BR binding across multiple brain regions (neocortex, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, raphe, amygdala, hippocampus and striatum). We tested whether the LV1B was associated with amygdala, striatal and prefrontal reactivity to provocations, adjusting for age, injected mass and group. Across participants, LV1B was statistically significantly positively associated with amygdala (p = 0.01) but not with striatal (p = 0.2) or prefrontal reactivity to provocations (p = 0.3). These findings provide novel evidence that 5-HT1BR levels are linked to amygdala reactivity to provocations in a cohort of men displaying a wide range of aggressive behavior.

Using the lens of Self-Presentation Theory, results found that for those who had not already ‘Liked’ Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, their intention to do so before the election was negatively associated with the diversity of their Facebook audience. This relationship was mediated by their expected degree of social anxiety from ‘Liking’ the candidate. A comparison of audience diversity of participants who had ‘Liked’ a candidate vs. those who had not ‘Liked’ a candidate also showed that increased audience diversity hinders ‘Liking’.

The species farmed have been diversified, and a large amount of ‘trash fish’ is directly used as feed or is processed into fishmeal for fish feed. The use of locally available food waste as an alternative protein source for producing fish feed has been suggested as a means of tackling the problem of sourcing safe and sustainable feed. This paper reviews the feasibility of using locally available waste materials, including fish waste, okara and food waste. Although the fishmeal derived from fish waste, okara or food waste is less nutritious than fishmeal from whole fish or soybean meal, most fish species farmed in China, such as tilapia and various Chinese carp, grow well on diets with minimal amounts of fishmeal and 40% digestible carbohydrate.

Ecological sanitation (ecosan) systems that allow safe agricultural reuse of nutrients in human waste have been promoted in these areas, as a way to meet sanitation needs while contributing to food security. However, little is known about the success of these interventions in terms of both sustained use of the toilet and safe excreta reuse practices. We assessed the use of ecosan systems in 44 rural communities where such interventions had taken place. Structured interviews and observations conducted at 520 randomly selected concessions (residential properties), suggested a large-scale shift from open defecation to ecosan toilet use. However, only 58% of surveyed concessions reported ever emptying the ecosan toilet vault, which is required for optimal long-term functioning. Concessions that received ecosan training programmes with a greater emphasis on agricultural reuse were more strongly associated with toilet use and emptying than those that whose training focused more on sanitation access and health benefits.

Among 551,232 infants born alive in 2006, 1.45% (n = 7994) were diagnosed with prenatal substance exposure at birth; 61.2% of those diagnosed were reported to CPS before age 1 and nearly one third (29.9%) were placed in foster care.

Using a sliding window, we extract time-dependent point cloud data sets, to which we associate a topological space. We detect transient loops that appear in this space, and we measure their persistence. This is encoded in real-valued functions referred to as a ’persistence landscapes’. We quantify the temporal changes in persistence landscapes via their Lp-norms. We test this procedure on multidimensional time series generated by various non-linear and non-equilibrium models. We find that, in the vicinity of financial meltdowns, the Lp-norms exhibit strong growth prior to the primary peak, which ascends during a crash. Remarkably, the average spectral density at low frequencies of the time series of Lp-norms of the persistence landscapes demonstrates a strong rising trend for 250 trading days prior to either dotcom crash on 03/10/2000, or to the Lehman bankruptcy on 09/15/2008.

We formulate this decision problem as a discrete-time, discrete state Markov decision process that considers stochastic supply, deterministic demand and an equity-based objective. We investigate three different allocation rules and describe the optimal policy as a function of available inventory. We also provide county level estimates of unmet need and determine the probability distribution associated with the number of underserved counties. A numerical study is performed to show how the allocation policy and unmet need are impacted by uncertain supply and deterministic, time-varying demand. We also compare different allocation rules in terms of equity and effectiveness. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Donations; Dynamic programming; Equity; Food insecurity; Markov decision processes","Dynamic programming; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Stochastic systems; Allocation policies; Deterministic demand; Donations; Equity; Food insecurity; Markov decision process models; Markov Decision Processes; Time varying demand; Probability distributions",2-s2.0-85026307025

However, little is known about whether stressful military experiences are associated with tobacco use and alcohol misuse among military spouses. Methods: Using 9872 Service member–spouse dyads enrolled in the Millennium Cohort Family Study, we employed logistic regression to estimate the odds of self-reported cigarette smoking, risky drinking, and problem drinking among spouses by Service member deployment status, communication regarding deployment, and stress associated with military-related experiences, while adjusting for demographic, mental health, military experiences, and Service member military characteristics. Results: Current cigarette smoking, risky drinking, and problem drinking were reported by 17.2%, 36.3%, and 7.3% of military spouses, respectively. Current deployment was not found to be associated with spousal smoking or drinking behaviors. Communication about deployment experiences with spouses was associated with lower odds of smoking, but not with risky or problem drinking. Spouses bothered by communicated deployment experiences and those who reported feeling very stressed by a combat-related deployment or duty assignment had consistently higher odds of both risky and problem drinking. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that contextual characteristics about the deployment experience, as well as the perceived stress of those experiences, may be more impactful than the simple fact of Service member deployment itself. These results suggest that considering the impact of deployment experiences on military spouses reveals important dimensions of military community adaptation and risk. © 2017","Mental health; Military family; Problem drinking; Risky drinking; Smoking","alcohol abuse; cohort analysis; drinking behavior; human; mental health; military family; military spouse; smoking; stress",2-s2.0-85030720580

The aim of this work is to propose a method that helps to resolve these problems by extracting diagnostic rules that can be easily interpreted and verified by experts. The rules can be obtained from data, even if the latter are imperfect, which is usual in medical databases. Next, intuitively clear reasoning is suggested to elaborate on the diagnosis. Rules are focal elements in the framework of the Dempster–Shafer theory. They include fuzzy sets in their premises. Thus, a measure of imprecision as a fuzzy membership function and a measure of uncertainty as the basic probability value are used. Moreover, a rule selection algorithm and a rule evaluation method that prevent some of the imperfections of the existing methods are proposed. Particular attention is paid to the evaluation of the extracted rule set according to its reliability and clarity for a human user. Experimental results obtained for popular medical data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. For each data set, simple and readable rule sets are determined.

In this article the effects of nanoscale pore structure (0.01 < Kn < 0.1) on permeability and permeability damage were studied by the GPU enhanced Multiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM). Six mono-sized-bead packed nanoscale pores and six two-sized-bead packed same porosity different structure (SPDS) nanoscale pores were made to analyze scale and pore structure effects on permeability. The water predicted permeability and air predicted permeability in these nanoscale pores were estimated, and a modified slip boundary condition was implemented to mimic rarified gas effect in this scale. Simulation results are coherent with Klinkenberg effect that air predicted permeability is larger than water predicted permeability in every pore sample. Further analyses showed that pore dimension evenness degree (PDED, the ratio of max pore diameter to min pore diameter) is an essential factor of permeability. Larger PDED increases pore structure complexity, total surface area and tortuosity, but decreases permeability; smaller PDED has opposite effects. PDED is a new pore structure parameter presented in this article. GPU speed up results showed that CUDA parallel significantly accelerated calculation.

Results School-related cognitive and psychological engagement and close friends' smoking were significantly associated with smoking intention after controlling for covariates, such as personal and familial factors. Of the familial factors, mothers' previous or current smoking status were significantly associated with smoking intention. In addition, for personal factors, smoking experience was associated with smoking intention. The explanatory power of these variables in the predictive model was 36.0%.

As a result, interactive video lectures are increasingly being adopted in digital learning contexts for increasing interactivity. However, conventional video lecture lacks interactive learning activities (ILAs) that are an indispensable component of interactivity. Interactive video lectures can provide learners opportunities to obtain timely constructive support to produce effective learning outcomes because of ILAs. In order to carefully design and create ILAs for effective learning, instructors need to invest substantial efforts for conceiving the content and interactions of ILAs. This study proposed an approach to design the content of ILAs by leveraging collective intelligence (CI) gathered from the discussion forums specifically related to the content of video lectures. When learners exercised ILAs, meaningful interactions by speaking and gesturing worked as learning support to improve comprehension of learning materials. To evaluate the effects of the CI-based ILAs, an experiment was conducted with 90 university students, who were randomly and equally assigned to three different groups (i.e., embodied interactive, non-embodied interactive, and conventional video lectures). The results show that learners who learned with the embodied interactive video lecture performed better in comprehension and retention of learning contents than the other two counter groups. The findings also revealed that this approach does not impose any additional cognitive load on learners. The design guidelines derived in this study can serve as reference for instructors to create interactive video lectures with CI-based ILAs in digital learning contexts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Architectures for educational technology system; Human-computer interface; Interactive learning environments; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategies","Computer aided instruction; Computer graphics; E-learning; Educational technology; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Teaching; Architectures for educational technology system; Human computer interfaces; Interactive learning environment; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategy; Education",2-s2.0-85032475969

In the absence of experimental data, EQS for sediments can be estimated by the equilibrium partitioning approach. The present study investigates whether this approach is protective of benthic organisms against pentachlorophenol (PCP), a legacy contaminant and EU priority substance still used in some parts of the world. Three freshwater species of invertebrates with different life cycles and feeding behaviors (the oligochaetes Lumbriculus variegatus, Tubifex tubifex and the dipteran insect Chironomus riparius) were exposed to PCP spiked sediments (2.10–46.03 mg PCP/kg d.w. plus controls) in laboratory standard tests. Exposure duration was 28 days for T. tubifex and L. variegatus and 10 and 28 days for C. riparius; according to the corresponding OECD guidelines. For each investigated end-point, dose-response data were normalized to the mean control and fitted to a four-parameter log-logistic model for calculating the corresponding EC50 and EC10. The ranges for EC50 and EC10 estimates were 4.39 (Chironomus riparius-emergence)–27.50 (Tubifex tubifex–cocoon) and 0.30 (T. tubifex–young worms) –16.70 (T. tubifex–cocoon) mg/kg d.w., respectively. The EC50 and the EC10 values of L. variegatus were within these ranges. Following the EU Technical Guidance for deriving EQS, the lowest EC10 value of 0.30 mg/kg (T. tubifex–young worms) resulted in a PCP quality standard (QS) for sediments of 30 ng/g, about one fourth of the tentative QS of 119 ng/g estimated by the equilibrium partitioning (EqP) approach. The response of benthic biota to PCP varied across organisms and across end-points for the same organism, so that the use of sediment PCP-QS calculated using the EqP-approach may be under-protective of the most sensitive organisms. Information on the possible effects of PCP on resident organisms must therefore be collected for appropriately managing aquatic systems. © 2017","Chironomus riparius; Lumbriculus variegatus; Pentachlorophenol; REACH regulation; Sediments ecotoxicological tests; Tubifex tubifex; Water Framework Directive","Animals; Aquatic organisms; Biology; Environmental regulations; Herbicides; Life cycle; Phenols; Point contacts; Quality control; Risk management; Water conservation; Chironomus riparius; Ecotoxicological tests; Lumbriculus variegatus; Pentachlorophenol; REACH regulation; Tubifex tubifex; Water Framework Directives; Sediments; pentachlorophenol; toxic substance; annelid; benthos; ecotoxicology; environmental quality; fly; freshwater sediment; PCP; standard (regulation); toxicity test; water management; Article; benthos; Chironomus riparius; cocoon; controlled study; Diptera; EC10; EC50; ecotoxicity; feeding behavior; freshwater species; insect; invertebrate; laboratory test; life cycle; Lumbriculus variegatus; Oligochaeta; phase partitioning; priority journal; risk assessment; risk management; sediment; Tubifex tubifex; water contamination; worm; Europe; Chironomus riparius; Diptera; Hexapoda; Invertebrata; Lumbriculus variegatus; Oligochaeta (Metazoa); Tubifex; Tubifex tubifex",2-s2.0-85028970095

By the stability analysis of the differential inequalities, the sufficient conditions to ensure the robust exponential stability of the switched interconnected systems (SIS) under arbitrary switching are obtained. The proposed method, which neither requires the individual subsystems to share a common Lyapunov function (CLF), nor needs to know the values of individual Lyapunov functions at each switching time, would provide a new mentality for studying stability of arbitrary switching. In addition, by resorting to average dwell time approach, conditions for guaranteeing the robust exponential stability of SIS under constrained switching are derived.

Concerns have been expressed that this may hamper the transition to a low-carbon economy. We estimate the required extraction of Fe, Al, Cu, Ni, Cr, In, Nd, Dy, Li, Zn, and Pb until 2050 under several technology-specific low-carbon scenarios. Annual metal demand for the electricity and road transportation systems may rise dramatically for indium, neodymium, dysprosium, and lithium, by factors of more than three orders of magnitude. However, in the base year 2000 the dominant uses were often in other sectors. Since growth in these other, previously dominant sectors has been less pronounced, the overall growth in society's metal needs is much less dramatic than in the electricity and transportation sectors. Total annual demand for the researched metals would rise by a factor of 3–4.5, corresponding to compound growth rates of between 2% and 3%. Such growth rates are similar or lower compared with historical growth rate levels over the last few decades. Prolonged higher levels have existed for copper, for example, with production rising by 8% per year from 1992 to 2006. Yet this state of affairs does not give cause for complacency. The richest resources may have been used, production is showing a tendency towards becoming very large-scale, and development times have increased, all leading to greater risks of disruption. It is therefore crucial, when developing specific technologies, that the resource-specific constraints are analyzed and options for substitution are developed where risks are high. © 2017 The Authors","Constraints; Energy; Metals; Resources; Transition","Environmental management; Growth rate; Lead; Renewable energy resources; Constraints; Energy; Low-carbon energy systems; Resources; Road transportation; Three orders of magnitude; Transition; Transportation sector; Metals",2-s2.0-85032706817

Furthermore, Partial Least Squares-regression (PLS-regression) was trained to correlate VE-tongue data with the reference measurement in order to build and validate a prediction model for UCC determination. The obtained results demonstrate that PCA and SVMs could classified urine samples into three classes according to low, medium and high creatinine levels (CLs).

A field study with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) was conducted to understand the impact of furrow tillage practices and nitrogen (N) fertilizer placement on characteristics of runoff water quality during the growing season. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block design with conventional (CT) and conservation furrow tillage (FT) in combination with either urea (URN) broadcast or 32% urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) injected, each applied at 101 kg N ha− 1. Concentrations of ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), nitrite (NO2-N), and dissolved phosphorus (P) in irrigation runoff water and lint yields were measured in all treatments. The intensity and chemical form of nutrient losses were primarily controlled by water runoff volume and agronomic practice. Across tillage and fertilizer N treatments, median N concentrations in the runoff were &lt; 0.3 mg N L− 1, with NO3-N being relatively the highest among N forms. Concentrations of runoff dissolved P were &lt; 0.05 mg P L− 1 and were affected by volume of runoff water. Water pH, specific electrical conductivity, alkalinity and hardness were within levels that common to local irrigation water and less likely to impair pollution in waterways. Lint yields averaged 1111 kg ha− 1 and were higher (P-value = 0.03) in FT compared to CT treatments. Runoff volumes across irrigation events were greater (P-value = 0.02) in CT than FT treatments, which increased NO3-N mass loads in CT treatments (394 g NO3-N ha− 1 season− 1). Nitrate-N concentrations in CT treatments were still low and pose little threat to N contaminations in waterways. The findings support the adoption of conservation practices for furrow tillage and N fertilizer placement that can reduce nutrient runoff losses in furrow irrigation systems. © 2017","Cotton; Furrow irrigation; Lint yield; N; Runoff losses; Water quality","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Alkalinity; Cotton; Cultivation; Fertilizers; Irrigation; Metabolism; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrients; Urea; Water pollution; Water quality; Agronomic practices; Conservation practices; Dissolved phosphorus; Furrow irrigation; Furrow-irrigation systems; Lint yield; Specific electrical conductivity; Urea ammonium nitrates; Runoff; concentration (composition); cotton; crop yield; furrow irrigation; nitrogen; runoff; tillage; water quality; agronomic trait; alkalinity; Article; cotton; electric conductivity; environmental monitoring; furrow irrigation (agriculture); irrigation (agriculture); lung flow volume curve; nitrate metabolism; nitrate uptake; priority journal; seasonal variation; United States; water analysis; water content; water hardness; water quality; watershed; Arkansas; United States; Gossypium hirsutum",2-s2.0-85029082283

Three different IR 780 weight percentages were used for micelle formation with loading content of 4.6%, 7.9%, and 10.3% respectively.

Upon irradiation of the tumor site with an 808-nm laser (2Wcm−2) for 2 min, the temperature in the tumor in the HA-IR 780-treated groups reached 49.9 °C which exceeds the temperature threshold to induce irreversible tissue damage. Toxicity studies showed that HA-IR 780 does not cause any adverse effects in organs, including heart, liver, lungs, kidney and spleen, although it selectively caused cell damage in the tumor region upon laser irradiation.

During an echocardiographic exam, geometry and blood flow are quantified in order to assess cardiac function. In clinical practice, these image-based measurements are currently performed manually. An automated approach is needed if more advanced analysis is desired. In this article, we propose a new hybrid framework for the construction of a disease-specific atlas to improve Doppler aortic outflow velocity profile segmentation. The proposed method is based on combining realistic computational simulations of the cardiovascular system for common cardiac conditions (using CircAdapt) with a validated image-based atlas construction method. The coupling is realized via model-based generation of echocardiographic images of virtual populations with a statistically approved parameter variation. We created virtual populations of 100 healthy individuals and 100 patients with aortic stenosis, synthesized their aortic Doppler velocity images and constructed the corresponding atlases. We validated atlases’ performances by comparing their segmentation of real clinical images with the manually segmented ground truth. The experimental results show that the segmentation accuracy obtained using the proposed atlases is comparable to the accuracy obtained using classical clinical image-based atlases. Moreover, this framework eliminates the time-consuming acquisition of a sufficient number of representative images in clinical practice, offering a substantial time efficiency and flexibility in creating a disease specific atlas and ensuring an observer-independent automated segmentation. The proposed approach can easily be extended towards the creation of atlases for segmenting any Doppler trace in the cardiovascular circulation in a specific disease. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aortic valve; Atlas; CircAdapt; Echocardiography; Image registration; Image segmentation; Velocity profile; Virtual population","Blood vessels; Cardiovascular system; Echocardiography; Image registration; Velocity; Aortic valves; Atlas; CircAdapt; Velocity profiles; Virtual population; Image segmentation; aortic valve; Article; blood flow; blood flow velocity; computer model; computer simulation; data analysis software; echocardiography; image segmentation; priority journal; virtual reality",2-s2.0-85029388765

This approach was applied on a sample with 9886 unique simcard IDs in Shenzhen, China, on one mid-week day in October 2013. Hourly ambient concentrations of six chosen pollutants were simulated by the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model fused with observational data, and matched with detailed location data for these IDs. The results were compared with exposure estimates using home addresses to assess potential exposure misclassification errors. We found the misclassifications errors are likely to be substantial when home location alone is applied. The CDR based approach indicates that the home based approach tends to over-estimate exposures for subjects with higher exposure levels and under-estimate exposures for those with lower exposure levels. Our results show that the cell phone location based approach can be used to assess exposure misclassification error and has the potential for improving exposure estimates in air pollution epidemiology studies.

With the help of Fog Computing, the transmission latency, monetary spending and application loss caused by Cloud Computing can be effectively reduced. However, as the processing capacity of fog nodes is more limited than that of cloud platforms, running all applications indiscriminately on these nodes can cause some QoS requirement to be violated. Therefore, there is important decision-making as to where executing each application in order to produce a cost effective solution and fully meet application requirements. In particular, we are interested in the tradeoff in terms of average response time, average cost and average number of application loss.

The unit-slot optimization is a quantified near-optimal online solution to balance the three-way tradeoff among average response time, average cost and average number of application loss. We evaluate the performance of the unit-slot optimization algorithm by a number of experiments.

Despite being implicated in between-hand movement selection and preparation, the role that interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) may play in this ‘impulse control’ mechanism is not known. Participants performed a warned, between-hand, choice reaction time (RT) task in which the informativeness of the WS (with regards to which hand would be required to respond) was manipulated. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) assessed CSE of the right primary motor cortex (M1) and IHI from left to right M1 with 10 (IHI10) and 40 (IHI40) msec interstimulus intervals during movement selection and preparation. Consistent with impulse control, CSE was initially suppressed prior to both left and right hand actions, irrespective of WS informativeness. Subsequent CSE increases occurred in the responding hand which were larger, and occurred earlier, following an informative WS. Importantly, these increases strongly predicted response times. In contrast to the generic CSE suppression, an informative WS permitted a hand-specific release of IHI10 in the responding hand, whereas IHI40 was released in both hands. As releases of IHI cannot explain a simultaneous suppression of CSE, this suggests several distinct movement preparation mechanisms are at play with IHI modulation occurring independently from impulse control. Notably, the findings support the notion that IHI10 and IHI40 between contralateral motor regions are mediated by discrete transcallosal pathways, and are differently modulated by specific motor and cognitive attributes of a rapid choice task. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Choice reaction time; Impulse control; Interhemispheric inhibition; Movement preparation; Stimulus-response congruency","adult; cognition; excitability; female; hand movement; human; human experiment; male; modulation; primary motor cortex; response time; stimulus response; transcranial magnetic stimulation",2-s2.0-85032806354

Six heavy metals were analyzed, and the RDS index model was adopted to estimate the potential heavy metal load washed off by stormwater runoff. Analysis of variance revealed that the excavation and gravel filling of rain gardens and excavation of porous pavements were critical LID construction stages that contributed the largest masses of RDS per unit area to road surfaces. Although the concentration of heavy metals at LID construction sites was lower than at sites without LID construction, the load of heavy metals washed off from LID construction was much higher.

Therefore, alternative targeted therapies are required against ER-negative breast cancers. Coumestrol, a phytoestrogen inhibits cell growth of ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells; the exact mechanism has not yet been reported. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells contain elevated copper which play an integral role in angiogenesis. The current focus of the work was to identify any possible role of copper in coumestrol cytotoxic action against breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Results demonstrated that coumestrol inhibited cell viability, induced ROS generation, DNA damage, G1/S cell cycle arrest, up-regulation of Bax and apoptosis induction via caspase-dependent mitochondrial mediated pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, addition of copper chelator, neocuproine and ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine were ineffective in abrogating coumestrol-mediated apoptosis. This suggests non-involvement of copper and ROS in coumestrol-induced apoptosis. To account for coumestrol-mediated up-regulation of Bax and apoptosis induction, direct binding potential between coumestrol and Bax/Bcl-2 was studied using in silico molecular docking studies. We propose that coumestrol directly enters cells and combines with Bax/Bcl-2 to alter their structures, thereby causing Bax binding to the outer mitochondrial membrane and Bcl-2 release from the mitochondria to initiate apoptosis. Thus, non-copper targeted ROS independent DNA damage is the central mechanism of coumestrol in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings will be useful in better understanding of anticancer mechanisms of coumestrol and establishing it as a lead molecule for TNBC treatment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Apoptosis; Coumestrol; DNA damage; ROS; Triple negative breast cancer","2,9 dimethyl 1,10 phenanthroline; acetylcysteine; copper; coumestrol; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; reactive oxygen metabolite; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cell viability; controlled study; DNA damage; drug cytotoxicity; drug protein binding; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; MDA-MB-231 cell line; mitochondrial membrane; molecular docking; protein binding; protein modification; protein secretion; protein structure; triple negative breast cancer; upregulation",2-s2.0-85030830547

Constitutive modeling of the detailed structure obtained by using advanced imaging modalities has been investigated extensively in the last decade. In particular, our group has previously proposed a fiber dispersion model based on a generalized structure tensor. However, the fiber tension–compression switch described in that study is unable to exclude compressed fibers within a dispersion and the model requires modification so as to avoid some unphysical effects. In a recent paper we have proposed a method which avoids such problems, but in this present study we introduce an alternative approach by using a new general invariant that only depends on the fibers under tension so that compressed fibers within a dispersion do not contribute to the strain-energy function. We then provide expressions for the associated Cauchy stress and elasticity tensors in a decoupled form. We have also implemented the proposed model in a finite element analysis program and illustrated the implementation with three representative examples: simple tension and compression, simple shear, and unconfined compression on articular cartilage. We have obtained very good agreement with the analytical solutions that are available for the first two examples. The third example shows the efficacy of the fibrous tissue model in a larger scale simulation.

In this paper, a fast inter CU decision algorithm is proposed, with the motion correlations between neighboring CUs discussed. Decision for splitting of collocated CU has a strong impact on current CU, high-motion CUs are early split by means of calculating motion diversity of collocated CUs. On the other hand, SKIP mode indicates a motion sharing relation among neighboring CUs and it can be used to early determine CU termination. A discriminant function minimizing expected risk is defined for both early SKIP mode detection and SKIP mode based termination decision. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce computational complexity by 48.2% with only 0.46% BDBR increase for random access configuration. For the low-delay B configuration, it can reduce complexity by 45.9% with 0.55% BDBR increase penalty.

Recently Nonparametric Bayesian Gaussian Process (GP) models have also been adapted to MTL and exhibit enough flexibility due to its non-parametric nature, thus can exempt from the assumption about the probability distributions of variables. To date, there have had two approaches proposed to implement GP-based MTL, i.e., cross-covariance-based and joint feature learning methods. Although successfully applied in scenarios such as face verification and collaborative filtering, these methods have their own drawbacks, for example, the cross-covariance-based method suffers from poor scalability because of the large covariance matrix involved; while the joint feature learning method can just implicitly incorporate relation between tasks, thus leading to a failure in explicitly exploiting the prior knowledge like correlation between tasks, which is crucial for further promoting MTLs. To address both issues, in this paper, we establish a two layer unified framework called Hierarchical Gaussian Process Multi-task Learning (HGPMT) method to jointly learn the latent shared features among tasks and a multi-task model. Furthermore, since the HGPMT does not need to involve the cross-covariance, its computational complexity is much lower. Finally, experimental results on both toy multi-task regression dataset and real datasets demonstrate its superiority in performance of multi-task learning to recently proposed approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Feature learning; GP-LVM; Hierarchical model; Multi-task learning","Collaborative filtering; Covariance matrix; Gaussian noise (electronic); Hierarchical systems; Learning systems; Linearization; Probability distributions; Face Verification; Feature learning; Gaussian Processes; Hierarchical model; Improve performance; Multitask learning; Non-parametric Bayesian; Unified framework; Gaussian distribution",2-s2.0-85032284296

Suitable host plants occur in Tasmania but detections are restricted to adults, mostly in one long-term light trap. A combination of methods is used to determine whether this pest is a non-breeding vagrant, a breeding migrant or resident in Tasmania. A degree-day development model for E. behrii showed that warmer source areas outside Tasmania better explained flight seasonality observed by light trapping in Tasmania than local source areas. Pest records of 119 Lepidoptera associated with Tasmanian Medicago plants do not include Etiella. The absence of records of larvae, the coincidence of adults with migratory insects and northerly airflows, flight seasonality and a requirement for a six month non-developmental period in the cool season indicate that E. behrii migrates to Tasmania where any breeding is below detection although two generations seem possible based on thermal requirements. The results provide another example of a pest that fails to establish, even ephemerally, in Tasmania despite repeated migration from mainland Australia. The precise impediments to seasonal establishment of E. behrii remain unclear but this would most likely occur in north-west or north-east Tasmania, which receive most migratory moths. E. behrii is one of a suite of native Australian pests that may extend its breeding range to Tasmania with global warming.

In field trials with two shading levels amaranth biomass was similar, demonstrating that light interception by CC was not the primary mechanism responsible for amaranth growth suppression. We could show that below a threshold of 3 t/ha of CC biomass, amaranth growth suppression was negatively correlated with CC biomass (R2 = 0.41) and that this correlation was influenced by the CC species. Brassicaceae and black oat (Avena strigosa) did not follow this relation and effectively controlled amaranth even with a low biomass. The effects of root interactions between amaranth and CC on amaranth growth were further tested in the absence of competition for light, water and nutrients under controlled conditions. We could show that phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) had no growth repressive effect, whereas buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), black oat and forage radish (Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus) significantly suppressed amaranth growth by 46, 37 and 49% through indirect root interactions and by 68, 41 and 62% through direct root interactions.

We examined the hypothesis that farmers take erosion into account in their farming decisions and switch to farming practices with lower erosion risk the higher the site-specific hazard becomes. Erosion since the last tillage was observed from aerial orthorectified photographs for 8100 fields belonging to 1879 farmers distributed across Bavaria (South Germany) and it was modeled by the Universal Soil Loss Equation using highly detailed input data (e.g., digital terrain model with 5 × 5 m2 resolution, rain data with 1 × 1 km2 and 5 min resolution, crop and cropping method from annual field-specific data from incentive schemes). Observed and predicted soil loss correlated closely, demonstrating the accuracy of this method. The close correlation also indicted that the farmers could easily observe the degree of recent erosion on their fields, even without modelling. Farmers clearly did not consider erosion in their decisions. When natural risk increased, e.g. due to steeper slopes, they neither grew crops with lower erosion potential, nor reduced field size, nor used contouring. In addition, they did not compensate for the cultivation of crops with higher erosion potential by using conservation techniques like mulch tillage or contouring, or by reducing field size. Only subsidized measures, like mulch tillage or organic farming, were applied but only at the absolute minimum that was necessary to obtain subsidies. However, this did not achieve the reduction in erosion that would be possible if these measures had been fully applied. We conclude that subsidies may be an appropriate method of reducing erosion but the present weak supervision, which assumes that farmers themselves will take erosion into account and that subsidies are only needed to compensate for any disadvantages caused by erosion-reducing measures, is clearly not justified. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aerial photograph; Field layout; Hops; Organic farming; Soil loss; Tillage","Aerial photography; Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Crops; Photography; Sediment transport; Soils; Aerial Photographs; Field layout; Hops; Organic farming; Soil loss; Tillage; Erosion; aerial photograph; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; organic farming; tillage; Universal Soil Loss Equation; water erosion; agricultural worker; Article; conservation tillage; controlled study; cropping system; farming system; Germany; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; priority journal; sample size; soil erosion; Bavaria; Germany; Humulus",2-s2.0-85028992752

For this purpose, metformin-loaded PLGA-PEG NPs were synthetized and characterized using DLS, FE-SEM and FTIR. Then, the inhibitory effects of free and nano-encapsulated forms of metformin on growth and expression levels of hTERT in two breast cancer cell lines, T47D and MDA-MB-231, were evaluated using MTT and qPCR assays, respectively. Assessment of drug toxicity revealed that metformin-loaded NPs had more cytotoxic effects than free form in both cell lines at a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC50s of free and nanoformulated metformin for MDA-MB-231 cells were lower than T47D cells, indicating the higher sensitivity of the triple-negative phenotype. Also, it was found that nanoformulated metformin than free metformin could further decline the expression levels of hTERT in both cell lines, especially MDA-MB-231 (p < 0.05).

In this paper, we discuss five stochastic models that capture qualitatively different disordered structures, notably concerning the connectivity and the tortuosity of the phases. The models are two variants of the Boolean model, a dead leaves model, as well as two clipped Gaussian field models. The paper is illustrated with the SAXS analysis of a polymer xerogel, of a fumed silica as well as of a mesoporous alumina, and the fitted models are compared with pore size distributions derived from nitrogen adsorption. In the case of the xerogel and silica it is possible to pinpoint a single model that describes the structure best. In the case of the alumina, however, the scattering cannot discriminate the models. Even so, the models are useful because they enable one to quantitate the structural ambiguity of the SAXS data. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Mesoporous materials; Pore size distribution; Small-angle scattering; Stochastic models; Tortuosity",,2-s2.0-85027998790

The typical objectives pursued in the design of power generating unit maintenance schedules do not take these difficulties into account. A new scheduling criterion is therefore proposed in this paper. The occurrences of power generating unit failures may be estimated using methods from reliability theory in which the aim is typically to quantify the probability of a system completing its intended function for a specific duration of time. Based on this theory, our new scheduling objective seeks to maximise the probability of no power generating units in the power system failing during the scheduling window, weighted by the rated power generating capacity of each unit. The feasibility and effectiveness of this new objective is analysed by applying it, in conjunction with an exact solution approach, to two well-known generating maintenance scheduling test systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Power systems; Preventative generator maintenance scheduling; Reliability; Unit failure","Developing countries; Energy management; Maintenance; Reliability; Reliability theory; Repair; Scheduling; Standby power systems; Exact solution; Generating maintenances; Generator maintenance scheduling; Power generating capacity; Power generating units; Preventative maintenance; System Capacity; Unexpected Failures; Outages",2-s2.0-85027530498

To handle this difficulty, we propose a nonsmooth convex optimization model based on ℓ1 shearlet regularization, whose solution is addressed by means of the variable metric inexact line search algorithm (VMILA), a proximal-gradient method that enables the inexact computation of the proximal point defining the descent direction. We compare the reconstruction performance of our strategy against a smooth total variation (sTV) approach, by using both Poisson noisy simulated data and real data from fan-beam CT geometry. The results show that, while for synthetic data both shearets and sTV perform well, for real data, the proposed nonsmooth shearlet-based approach outperforms sTV, since the localization and directional properties of shearlets allow to detect finer structures of a textured image.

This work proposes a new approach based on “contextual information”, in which users receive information not only about the current time step, but also about the past (how the target force has changed over time) and the future (how the target force will change). A test was run to compare the performance of the contextual approach in relation to the punctual information, in which each participant had to memorize and then reproduce a pattern of force after training with a multimodal system. The findings suggest that the contextual approach is a useful strategy for force pattern learning. The advantage of the contextual information approach over the punctual information approach is that users receive information about the evolution of their performance (helping to correct the errors), and they also receive information about the next forces to be exerted (providing them with a better understanding of the target force profile). Finally, the contextual approach could be implemented in medical training platforms or surgical robots to extend the capabilities of these systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Force skill training; Motor skill training; Multimodal training; Virtual training","Engineering; Hardware; Contextual information; Medical training; Motor skills; Multi-modal; Multimodal system; Pattern Learning; Skill training; Virtual training; Personnel training",2-s2.0-85032707375

The system is perturbed at one end by a harmonic disturbance irradiating at a frequency in the forbidden band-gap of the classical regime, and a nonlocal coupling between the oscillators is considered using discrete Riesz fractional derivatives. We propose fully discrete expressions to approximate an energy functional of the system, and we use them to calculate the total energy of fractional chains over a relatively long period of time [Fract.

For this reason, the present study sought to examine the degree to which children's expectancies and motives relating to gambling explain, at least in part, the intergenerational transmission of problem gambling. Methods Participants (N = 524; 56.5% male) were recruited from educational institutions, and retrospectively reported on parental problem gambling. Problem gambling was measured using the Problem Gambling Severity Index and a range of positive and negative expectancies and gambling motives were explored as potential mediators of the relationship between parent-and-participant problem gambling. Results The relationship between parent-and-participant problem gambling was significant, and remained so after controlling for sociodemographic factors and administration method. Significant mediators of this relationship included self-enhancement expectancies (feeling in control), money expectancies (financial gain), over-involvement (preoccupation with gambling) and emotional impact expectancies (guilt, shame, and loss), as well as enhancement motives (gambling to increase positive feelings) and coping motives (gambling to reduce or avoid negative emotions). All mediators remained significant when entered into the same model. Conclusions The findings highlight that gambling expectancies and motives present unique pathways to the development of problem gambling in the offspring of problem gambling parents, and suggest that gambling cognitions may be potential candidates for targeted interventions for the offspring of problem gamblers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitions; Expectancies; Motives; Offspring; Parents; Problem gambling","child; cognition; expectancy; female; gambling; human; major clinical study; male; mediator; money; progeny; retrospective study; school; shame",2-s2.0-85029670167

The biologically inspired self-organized neural networks with neural plasticity can enhance the capability of computational performance, with the characteristic features of dynamical memory and recurrent connection cycles which distinguish them from the more widely used feedforward neural networks. Despite a variety of computational models for brain-like learning and information processing have been proposed, the modeling of self-organized neural networks with multi-neural plasticity is still an important open challenge. The main difficulties lie in the interplay among different forms of neural plasticity rules and understanding how structures and dynamics of neural networks shape the computational performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to develop the models of LSM with a biologically inspired self-organizing network based on two neural plasticity learning rules. The connectivity among excitatory neurons is adapted by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning; meanwhile, the degrees of neuronal excitability are regulated to maintain a moderate average activity level by another learning rule: intrinsic plasticity (IP). Our study shows that LSM with STDP+IP performs better than LSM with a random SNN or SNN obtained by STDP alone. The noticeable improvement with the proposed method is due to the better reflected competition among different neurons in the developed SNN model, as well as the more effectively encoded and processed relevant dynamic information with its learning and self-organizing mechanism.

Racial differences in molecular subtype within clinically defined subgroups are not well understood. Methods: Using data and biospecimens from the population-based Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS) Phase 3 (2008-2013), we classified 980 invasive breast cancers using RNA expression-based PAM50 subtype and recurrence (ROR) score that reflects proliferation and tumor size. Molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Basal-like) and ROR scores (high vs low/medium) were compared by race (blacks vs whites) and age (≤50 years vs≥50 years) using chi-square tests and analysis of variance tests. Results: Black women of all ages had a statistically significantly lower frequency of Luminal A breast cancer (25.4% and 33.6% in blacks vs 42.8% and 52.1% in whites; younger and older, respectively). All other subtype frequencies were higher in black women (case-only odds ratio [OR] = 3.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.22 to 4.37, for Basal-like; OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.02 to 2.06, for Luminal B; OR=2.04, 95% CI=1.33 to 3.13, for HER2-enriched). Among clinically HR+/HER2- cases, Luminal A subtype was less common and ROR scores were statistically significantly higher among black women. Conclusions: Multigene assays highlight racial disparities in tumor subtype distribution that persist even in clinically defined subgroups. Differences in tumor biology (eg, HER2-enriched status) may be targetable to reduce disparities among clinically ER+/HER2- cases. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

The influence of Cr doping on thermal, microstructural, electrical and magnetic properties was investigated in TiO2 host matrix. The surface morphology has revealed less agglomeration and considerable reduction in particle size in case of Cr doped TiO2 as compared to undoped TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) established high purity, appropriate stoichiometry and oxidation states of the compositions. The dielectric properties of the nanoparticles were altered by the doping concentration, applied frequency as well as temperature variation. The variation in dielectric constant (ε′), dielectric loss (δ) and ac conductivity as a function of frequency and temperature at different doping concentration of Cr were interpreted in the light of Maxwell Wagner theory, space charge polarization mechanism and drift mobility of charge carriers. Both undoped and Cr doped TiO2 samples exhibit room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) that remarkably influenced by means of the Cr content. The significant enhancement in the magnetization was observed at 4% Cr doping. However, decrease in magnetization for higher doping signify antiferromagnetic interactions between Cr ions or superexchange mechanism.

Based on national survey data, we found that social comparison-based emotions mediated the relationships between Facebook users' social comparison orientations and psychological well-being. If Facebook users have a stronger ability-based social comparison orientation, their psychological well-being decreases via upward contrastive emotions (e.g., depression and envy) toward the comparison other; however, it increases via downward assimilative emotions (e.g., worry and sympathy). By contrast, if Facebook users have a stronger opinion-based social comparison orientation, their psychological well-being increases via increased feelings of upward assimilative emotions (e.g., optimism and inspiration) or decreased feelings of upward contrastive emotions (e.g., depression and envy) towards the comparison other.

The interest of both the stochastic (in particular, metaheuristic) and mathematical programming (in particular, deterministic) communities to the comparison of metaheuristic and deterministic classes of methods is well recognized. Although both the communities have a huge number of journal and proceedings papers, a few of them are really dedicated to a systematic comparison of the methods belonging to these two classes.

The incorporation of uncertainties in the operational parameters during the optimization process is very important to ensure that the fuel cell can operate reliably in real-life deployment. Unfortunately, no attention has been given thus far on studying the effects of parameter uncertainties on the fuel cell performance. In this paper, the output power and hydrogen flow rate are being optimized under uncertain conditions of the stack current, stack temperature, oxygen excess ratio, hydrogen excess ratio and inlet air humidity of the PEM fuel cell. The effective application of a new analytical moment-based uncertainty evaluation technique proposed in combination with response surface methodology provides an accurate and numerically efficient evaluation of the fuel cell performance. The paper has demonstrated that the optimal mean output power under uncertainty is 1329.56 W and its corresponding operating point is different from that of the optimal output power 1545.25 W calculated assuming all parameters are fixed. The results show that, for the selected PEM fuel cell model, meeting probabilistic constraints makes the fuel cell less susceptible to input variations, but this can only be achieved at the expense of optimal output power.

Global sensitivity analysis for these models is very useful for simplifying the model, improving the model performance, etc. The existent covariance decomposition based global sensitivity analysis method combines the variance based sensitivity analysis results of the model output at all the instants, which just utilizes the information of the time-dependent output in time domain. However, many significant features of time-dependent output may not be obtained from the time domain. Thus, performing global sensitivity analysis for dynamic models just with the information in time domain may be incomplete. In this paper, a new kind of sensitivity indices based on wavelet analysis is proposed. The energy distribution of model output over different frequency bands is extracted as a quantitative feature of the time-dependent output, and it contains the information of model output in both time and frequency domains. Then, a vector projection method is utilized to measure the effects of input variables on the energy distribution of model output. An efficient algorithm is also proposed to estimate the new sensitivity indices. The numerical examples show the difference between the new sensitivity indices and the covariance decomposition based sensitivity indices. Finally, the new sensitivity indices are applied to an environmental model to tell the relative importance of the input variables, which can be useful for improving the model performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic model; Energy distribution; Global sensitivity analysis; Wavelet analysis","Decision making; Dynamic models; Frequency bands; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Wavelet analysis; Covariance decompositions; Different frequency; Energy distributions; Environmental model; Global sensitivity analysis; Quantitative features; Time and frequency domains; Variance-based sensitivity analysis; Time domain analysis",2-s2.0-85032014238

We have observed the Payne effect (referred to the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior) at strong interfacial interaction. Payne-effect magnitude gradually increases with the interfacial interaction and the NR volume fraction. To understand the origin of Payne-effect, we examine the NR microstructures and their evolution during the shear field. We find that at low interfacial interaction, the probability of forming NR network is nearly unchanged with the shear strain amplitude; while at strong interfacial interaction, on the contrary the probability significantly decreases with the shear strain amplitude. We infer that various interfacial interactions change the NR network, influencing their evolution behavior under the shear flow. Meanwhile, we calculate the main cluster size and the total number of clusters for the NR network at different shear strain amplitudes, which is consistent with the probability of forming NR network. Thus, the original NR microstructure is significantly broken down under the external shear field, which can also be reflected by the number for polymer-mediated NR network bridged by glassy chains and the connected polymer beads between NRs. In addition, the polymer chains can slip on the filler surface under the shear field. As a result, the observed Payne effect comes from the slippage of the interfacial chains and breakage of the polymer-mediated NR network bridged by glassy chains at strong interfacial interaction. While at low interfacial interaction, it exhibits a weak non-linear behavior. Additionally, both reinforcement and Payne-effect magnitude exhibit a linear dependence on the inverse of the aspect ratio of the NRs. At last, different contributions to reinforcement due to hydrodynamic effects, “occluded rubber”, and “filler network” are quantified where the “filler network” is the main contribution.

In this context, this paper addresses the kinematical and dynamical model identification of the multipurpose rehabilitation robot, Universal Haptic Pantograph (UHP), and present experimental validations of the identified models. The UHP is a Pantograph based innovative robot actuated by two SEAs (Series Elastic Actuator), aiming at training impaired upper limbs after a stroke. This novel robot, thanks to its lockable/unlockable joints, can change its mechanical structure so that it enables stroke patient to perform different training exercises of the shoulder, elbow and wrist. This work focuses on the ARM mode, which is a training mode used to rehabilitate elbow and shoulder. The kinematical model of UHP is identified based on the loop vector equations, while the dynamical model is derived based on the Lagrangian formulation. To demonstrate the accuracy of the models, several experimental tests were performed. The results reveal that the mean position error between estimated values with the model and actual measured values stays in 3 mm (less than 2% of the maximum motion range). Moreover, the error between estimated and measured interaction force is smaller than 10% of maximum force range. So, the developed models can be adopted to estimate motion and force of UHP as well as control it without the need of additional sensors such as a force sensor, resulting in the reduction of total robot cost. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamical modeling; Experimental validation; Force estimation; Kinematical modeling; Rehabilitation robots; Upper limb rehabilitation","Biological organs; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Pantographs; Dynamical model; Experimental validations; Force estimation; Kinematical models; Rehabilitation robot; Upper-limb rehabilitation; Robots",2-s2.0-85027835209

The concentrations of CO and CO2 in the emissions from the combustion of filter cakes have been measured directly for the first time. They are the biggest volume of coal processing wastes. There have been many discussions about using these wastes as primary or secondary components of coal-water slurries (CWS) and coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals (CWSP). Boilers have already been operationally tested in Russia for the combustion of CWSP based on filter cakes. In this work, the concentrations of hazardous emissions have been measured at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000°С. The produced CO and CO2 concentrations are shown to be practically constant at high temperatures (over 900°С) for all the coal processing wastes under study. Experiments have shown the feasibility to lowering the combustion temperatures of coal processing wastes down to 750–850°С. This provides sustainable combustion and reduces the CO and CO2 emissions 1.2–1.7 times. These relatively low temperatures ensure satisfactory environmental and energy performance of combustion. Using CWS and CWSP instead of conventional solid fuels significantly reduces NOx and SOx emissions but leaves CO and CO2 emissions practically at the same level as coal powder combustion.

Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of classifying cerebral responses due to MI, mostly based on the power spectral density of the mu and beta bands; however, no optimum manner of proceeding through the fundamental steps of a MI-BCI has yet been established. In this work, we explored a relatively novel approach regarding feature generation for a MI-BCI by assuming that functional connectivity patterns of the brain are altered during hand MI. We modelled interactions among EEG electrodes by a graph, extracted metrics from it during left and right hand MI from eight subjects and classified the signals using commonly employed techniques in the BCI community (LDA and SVM). We also compared this approach to the more established method of using the signal power spectral density as the classifier features. With the graph method, we confirmed that only specific electrodes provide relevant information for data classification. A first approach provided maximum average classification rates across all subjects for the graph method of 86% for the mu band and 87% for the beta band. For the PSD method, average rates were of 98% and 99% for the mu and beta bands, respectively. However, a much larger number of features was needed: (130 ± 44) and (273 ± 89) for the mu and beta bands, respectively. Aiming to reproduce these rates using the graph method, pairwise inputs combinations of graph metrics were tested. They proved to be sufficient to obtain essentially the same classification accuracy rates, but with a considerably smaller number of features – about 60 features, for both bands. We thus conclude that the graph method is a feasible option for classification of hand MI signals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","BCI; Brain-computer interface; EEG; Graph theory; Graphs; Motor imagery; Signal analysis","Biomedical signal processing; Classification (of information); Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Graph theory; Interfaces (computer); Power spectral density; Signal analysis; Spectral density; Classification accuracy; Classification rates; Data classification; Feature generation; Functional connectivity patterns; Graphs; Hand motor imageries; Motor imagery; Brain computer interface; adult; Article; brain computer interface; classifier; clinical classification; comparative study; controlled study; discriminant analysis; electroencephalogram; female; functional connectivity; hand motor imagery; hemisphere; human; human experiment; imagery; linear discriminant analysis; male; normal human; priority journal; spectrometry; support vector machine",2-s2.0-85031770767

Based on a broad and interdisciplinary literature review, we develop a conceptual framework of multiple selves, each representing a stage in the consolidation of experience accessed by self-report. We explore the use of this framework to support the interpretation of user experience, provide insight into users’ evaluations of their own experiences, and emphasise the importance of design for experience as lived and reflected upon.

We assessed the relationship between terrestrial vertebrate species richness (total and taxonomic) and structural landscape heterogeneity, testing the impact of using different spatial analytical units in three mountain systems in Spain. Landscape heterogeneity was quantified through an additive partitioning of the Shannon diversity index of landscape classes. Both landscape heterogeneity and species richness were calculated using two spatial analytical unit approaches: eco-geographic vs. arbitrary (i.e., watersheds vs. square windows of different sizes 20 × 20 km, 50 × 50 km, 100 × 100 km). We predicted species richness on the basis of landscape heterogeneity by fitting separate linear models for each spatial analytical unit approach. The main results obtained showed that landscape heterogeneity influenced terrestrial vertebrate species richness. However, the emerging relationships were dependent on the spatial analytical unit approach. The eco-geographic approach showed significant relationships between landscape heterogeneity and total and taxonomic species richness in almost all cases (except mammals). Considering the arbitrary approach, landscape heterogeneity appeared as a predictor of species richness only for mammals and breeding birds and at the coarsest spatial scales. Our results claim for further consideration of eco-geographical spatial analytical unit approaches in biodiversity studies and show that the methods of this study offer a valuable cost-effective framework for biodiversity management and spatial modeling, with potential to be adapted to national and global applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Birds; Habitat diversity; Mammals; Reptiles; Terrestrial vertebrates; Watersheds","Biodiversity; Birds; Cost effectiveness; Mammals; Watersheds; Additive partitioning; Biodiversity managements; Global applications; Habitat diversity; Landscape heterogeneities; Reptiles; Structural landscapes; Terrestrial vertebrates; Forestry; biodiversity; bird; diversity index; global perspective; habitat quality; landscape change; mammal; quantitative analysis; reptile; spatial analysis; species richness; surrogate method; taxonomy; vertebrate; watershed; Spain; Aves; Mammalia; Reptilia; Vertebrata",2-s2.0-85032441718

Thus, both the research community and the major AM system developers have focused an increasing attention on in situ sensing and monitoring tools in the last years. However, there is still a lack of statistical methods to automatically detect the onset of a defect and signal an alarm during the part's layer-wise production. This study contributes to this framework with two levels of novelty. First, it presents an in situ monitoring method that integrates the acquisition of infrared images with a data mining approach for feature extraction and a statistical process monitoring technique to design a data-driven and automated alarm rule. Second, the method is aimed at monitoring powder bed fusion processes for difficult-to-process materials like zinc and its alloys, which impose several challenges to the process stability and quality because of their low melting and boiling points. To this aim, the proposed approach analyzes the byproducts generated by the interaction between the energy source and the material. In particular, it detects unstable behaviors by analyzing the salient properties of the process plume to detect unstable melting conditions. This case study entails an SLM process on zinc powder, where different sets of process parameters were tested leading either to in-control or out-of-control quality conditions.

Identifying those students who are less responsive can help to guide intervention refinement. Therefore, we examined demographic, personality, and cognitive factors hypothesized to influence change after a BMI. Method Students mandated for intervention following a campus alcohol violation (N = 568; 28% female, 38% freshmen) completed a baseline assessment, then received a BMI, and then completed a 1-month follow-up. At both assessments, alcohol use (i.e., drinks per week, typical BAC, binge frequency) and alcohol-related problems were measured. Results Latent change score analyses revealed significant decrease in both alcohol use and problems 1 month after the BMI. In the final model that predicted change in alcohol use, four factors (male sex, a “fun seeking” disposition, more perceived costs and fewer perceived benefits of change) predicted smaller decreases in alcohol use over time. In the final model that predicted change in alcohol-related problems, three factors (stronger beliefs about the centrality of alcohol to college life, more perceived costs and fewer perceived benefits of change) predicted smaller decreases in problems over time. Conclusions Participation in a BMI reduced alcohol use and problems among mandated college students at 1-month follow-up. We identified predictors of these outcomes, which suggest the need to tailor the BMI to improve its efficacy among males and those students expressing motives (pro and cons, and fun seeking) and beliefs about the centrality of drinking in college. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohol abuse prevention; Brief motivational intervention; College students; Drinking","academic achievement; adult; alcoholism; Article; binge drinking; brief motivational intervention; cognition; college drinking; controlled study; demography; drinking behavior; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; motivation; personality; sensation seeking; sex difference; short term psychotherapy; therapy effect",2-s2.0-85031718374

To characterize mixtures of dissolved-phase pesticides and degradates in Midwestern streams, a synoptic study was conducted at 100 streams during May–August 2013. In weekly water samples, 94 pesticides and 89 degradates were detected, with a median of 25 compounds detected per sample and 54 detected per site. In a screening-level assessment using aquatic-life benchmarks and the Pesticide Toxicity Index (PTI), potential effects on fish were unlikely in most streams. For invertebrates, potential chronic toxicity was predicted in 53% of streams, punctuated in 12% of streams by acutely toxic exposures. For aquatic plants, acute but likely reversible effects on biomass were predicted in 75% of streams, with potential longer-term effects on plant communities in 9% of streams. Relatively few pesticides in water—atrazine, acetochlor, metolachlor, imidacloprid, fipronil, organophosphate insecticides, and carbendazim—were predicted to be major contributors to potential toxicity. Agricultural streams had the highest potential for effects on plants, especially in May–June, corresponding to high spring-flush herbicide concentrations. Urban streams had higher detection frequencies and concentrations of insecticides and most fungicides than in agricultural streams, and higher potential for invertebrate toxicity, which peaked during July–August. Toxicity-screening predictions for invertebrates were supported by quantile regressions showing significant associations for the Benthic Invertebrate-PTI and imidacloprid concentrations with invertebrate community metrics for MSQA streams, and by mesocosm toxicity testing with imidacloprid showing effects on invertebrate communities at environmentally relevant concentrations. This study documents the most complex pesticide mixtures yet reported in discrete water samples in the U.S. and, using multiple lines of evidence, predicts that pesticides were potentially toxic to nontarget aquatic life in about half of the sampled streams. © 2017","Benchmark; Degradate; Invertebrate toxicity; Pesticide Toxicity Index; Screening assessment; Stressor","Agriculture; Animals; Aquatic organisms; Benchmarking; Herbicides; Insecticides; Mixtures; Pesticides; Rivers; Toxicity; Benthic invertebrates; Degradate; Herbicide concentration; Invertebrate communities; Organophosphate insecticides; Screening assessment; Stressor; Toxicity index; River pollution; acetochlor; atrazine; carbendazim; fipronil; herbicide; imidacloprid; metolachlor; organophosphate insecticide; pesticide; aquatic organism; benchmarking; complexity; degradation; environmental stress; pesticide residue; stream; toxicity; acute toxicity; aquatic environment; Article; benchmarking; benthos; biomass; chemical composition; chronic toxicity; concentration (parameters); controlled study; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental stress; fish; macroinvertebrate; mesocosm; nonhuman; phytotoxicity; plant community; pollution monitoring; prediction; priority journal; quality control; stream (river); toxicity testing; United States; urban area; water sampling; Midwest; United States; Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85027284577

The effect of aging on bioaugmentation efficacy was comparatively tested in a soil with similar physicochemical properties and soil microbiota, which was artificially, contaminated with the same TBZ levels (ACS). The impact of bioaugmentation and TBZ on the bacterial diversity in the NCS was explored via amplicon sequencing. Bioaugmentation effectively removed TBZ from both soils at levels up to 400 mg kg−1 but failed at the highest contamination level (12000 mg kg−1). Dissipation of TBZ in bioaugmented samples showed a concentration-dependent pattern, while aging of TBZ had a slight effect on bioaugmentation efficiency. Bioaugmentation had no impact on the soil bacterial diversity, in contrast to TBZ contamination. Soils from the hotspots of TBZ contamination (12000 mg kg−1) showed a drastically lower α-diversity driven by the dominance of β- and γ-proteobacteria at the expense of all other bacterial phyla, especially Actinobacteria. Overall, bioaugmentation with specialized microbial inocula could be an effective solution for the recovery of disposal sites contaminated with persistent chemicals like TBZ.

We recorded sixty-four channels EEG from two groups of participants, musicians and non-musicians, during the presentation of BB, and systematically varied the frequency difference from 1 Hz to 48 Hz. Participants were also presented non-binuaral beat (NBB) stimuli, in which same frequencies were presented to both ears. Across groups, as compared to NBB, (i) BB conditions produced the most robust changes in the MIC values at the whole brain level when the frequency differences were in the classical alpha range (8–12 Hz), and (ii) the number of electrode pairs showing nonlinear associations decreased gradually with increasing frequency difference. Between groups, significant effects were found for BBs in the broad gamma frequency range (34–48 Hz), but such effects were not observed between groups during NBB.

Each may have a different impact on individuals, populations and ecosystems, but still the wide variety of methods used in beach sediment sampling inhibit comparisons among studies and therefore hampers a risk assessment. A large portion of the uncertainties is due to differing sampling strategies. By quantifying the alongshore distribution of macro- and microplastic particles within five beaches of Lake Garda, we aim to shed light on the accumulation behavior of microplastic particles at an exemplary lake which might give indications for potential sampling zones. The identification of plastic at the single particle level with a spatial resolution down to 1 μm was performed by Raman microspectroscopy. Given the time consuming approach we reduced the number of samples in the field but increased the spatial area where a single sample was taken, by utilizing a transect approach in combination with sediment cores (5 cm depth). The study revealed that, in comparison to the water line and the high-water line, the drift line of all five beaches always contained plastic particles. Since the drift line accumulate particulate matter on a relatively distinct zone, it will enable a comparable sampling of microplastic particles. The applied sampling approach provided a representative method for quantifying microplastic down to 1 μm on a shore consisting of pebbles and sand. Hence, as first step towards a harmonization of beach sediment sampling we suggest to perform sampling at the drift line, although further methodological improvements are still necessary. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Beach sediment; Freshwater; Lake; Microplastic; Plastic debris; Sediment sampling","Beaches; Lakes; Risk assessment; Sediments; Water; Water piping systems; Beach sediments; Freshwater; Microplastic; Plastic debris; Sediment sampling; Particles (particulate matter); plastic; water; lacustrine deposit; lake; particulate matter; plastic waste; sampling; Article; freshwater environment; lake; lake sediment; marine environment; microscopy; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Raman spectrometry; risk assessment; sampling; sand; seashore; Italy; Lake Garda",2-s2.0-85029538531

The MIP film was prepared by electrochemical polymerization of β-cyclodextrins (β-CD) and MTX on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the first time, wherein β-CD served as the functional monomer, MTX as the template that was extracted afterwards, thereby creating the imprinted cavities complementary to the template in the polymer matrix. MTX could be specifically recognized and binding by the imprinted cavities. The developed MIP sensor exhibits a rapid electrochemical response, high sensitivity and selectivity for the determination of MTX in pharmaceutical formulations and spiked urine samples. Moreover, the proposed approach presents distinct advantages over reported electrochemical methods for determination of MTX because it is a one-step preparation and the template molecule could be easily removed by cyclic voltammetry scans, and no elution reagent is required. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the linear response range for MTX concentrations by the MIP sensor was 6 × 10−8 M–1 × 10−5 M with a detection limit of 3 × 10−8 M (S/N = 3), showing a good sensitivity and low LOD for MTX detection.

We analyze the spatial distribution of the concentrations of soil heavy metal and relationship with natural or anthropogenic origin. The analysis was performed in Principality of Asturias (mountain region of NW of Spain), where soil heavy metal pollution has become a severe problem. First, a standard Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed over a population of 334 soil samples to identify the sources of fourteen heavy metal and metalloids (Ag, As, Ba, Hg, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Zn). Due to the high geological heterogeneity of the territory, the PCA analysis was improved using a variant of PCA known as Geographically Weighted Principal Components Analysis (GWPCA). The first six principal components in a standard PCA account for about 57% of soil heavy metal variability but when GWPCA is performed this figure increases to > 80% in some areas. We conclude that GWPC1 corresponds to a geogenetic component with changing winning variables adapted to the geological characteristics of the territory (lithology and mining), while GWPC2 corresponds to a factor related to atmospheric pollution including heavy metal released from vegetation cover via wildfires. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Diffuse pollution sources; Geographically Weighted Principal Components Analysis (GWPCA); Principal Components Analysis (PCA); Soil heavy metal; Wildfires","Biology; Cadmium; Copper; Fires; Geology; Heavy metals; Lead; Lithology; Manganese; Mercury (metal); Metal analysis; Molybdenum; Pollution; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Soils; Water pollution; Atmospheric pollution; Diffuse pollution; Geological characteristics; Geological heterogeneities; Heavy metal pollution; Principal components analysis; Soil heavy metals; Wildfires; Principal component analysis; anthropogenic effect; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; heavy metal; metalloid; mountain region; pollutant source; principal component analysis; spatial distribution; vegetation cover; wildfire; Asturias; Spain; Spain",2-s2.0-85006765766

A laboratory simulation of Ni-polluted farmland soil study, in the presence or absence of earthworm, was carried out to investigate the toxic responses of soil microorganisms, including microbial biomass C (MBC), soil basal respiration (SBR), metabolic quotient (qCO2), urease (UA) and dehydrogenase activities (DHA). Additionally, the variations of Ni bioavailability were also explored. Results manifested that MBC and SBR were stimulated at 50 and 100 mg·kg−1 of Ni but inhibited by further increasing Ni level, showing a Hormesis effect. Earthworm input delayed the occurrence of a maximum SBR inhibition rate under the combined double-factors of time and dose. No specific effect of Ni concentration on the qCO2 was observed. UA was significantly suppressed at 800 mg·kg−1 Ni (P &lt; 0.05 or 0.01), whereas DHA was more sensitive and significantly inhibited throughout all the treatments (P &lt; 0.01), indicating a pronounced dose-response relationship. The addition of earthworm facilitated all the biomarkers above.

The blocked cyclic naming paradigm (BCNP) has been used to investigate such context effects. Typical results on production latencies showed semantic facilitation (or no effect) during the first presentation cycle, and interference emerging in subsequent cycles. Even if semantic contexts might be just as facilitative as interfering, previous BCNP studies focused on interference, which was interpreted as reflecting lemma selection and self-monitoring processes. Facilitation in the first cycle was rarely considered/analysed, although it potentially informs on word production to the same extent as interference. Here we contrasted the event-related potential (ERP) signatures of both semantic facilitation and interference in a BCNP. ERPs differed between homogeneous and heterogeneous blocks from about 365 msec post picture onset in the first cycle (facilitation) and in an earlier time-window (270 msec post picture onset) in the third cycle (interference). Three different analyses of the ERPs converge towards distinct processes underlying semantic facilitation and interference (post-lexical vs lexical respectively). The loci of semantic facilitation and interference are interpreted in the context of different theoretical frameworks of language production: the post-lexical locus of semantic facilitation involves interactive phonological-semantic processes and/or self-monitoring, whereas the lexical locus of semantic interference is in line with selection through increased lexical competition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ERP; Language production; Picture naming; Semantic facilitation; Semantic interference","competition; conceptual framework; event related potential; evoked response; facilitation; human; human experiment; language; self monitoring",2-s2.0-85032813491

The Mediterranean diet seems to be an important dietary pattern, which reduces the incidence of MetS. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) - a simple phenol found in olive oil - has received increased attention for its antioxidant activity. Recently, the European Foods Safety Authority (EFSA) claimed that dietary consumption of HT exhibits a protective role against cardiovascular disease. In this study, an experimental protocol has been setup, including isolated HT administration in a diet induced model of MetS in young Wistar rats, in order to find out whether HT has a protective effect against MetS. Rats were randomly divided into two groups nurtured by high-carbohydrate high-fat (H) (MetS inducing diet) and high-carbohydrate high-fat + HT (HHT). HT (20 mg/kg/d oral gavage, water vehicle) was administered for 8 weeks on the basal diet. Previous pharmacological evaluation of HT showed that hepatic steatosis was reduced and the inflammatory cells into the liver were infiltrated. These indicate that HT shows bioactivity against metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the metabolomics evaluation of liver extracts would indicate the putative biochemical mechanisms of HT activity. Thus, the extracts of liver tissues were analyzed using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography – High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS, Orbitrap Discovery) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker Avance III 600 MHz). Multivariate analysis was performed in order to gain insight on the metabolic effects of HT administration on the liver metabolome. Normalization employing multiple internal standards and Quality Control–based Robust LOESS (LOcally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) Signal Correction algorithm (QC-RLSC) was added in the processing pipeline to enhance the reliability of metabolomic analysis by reducing unwanted information. Experimentally, HHT rats were clearly distinguished from H in PLS-DA, showing differences in the liver metabolome between the groups and specific biomarkers were determined supporting the pharmacological findings. More specifically, HT has shown to be effective towards the mobilization of lipids as various lipid classes being differentially regulated between the H and HHT groups.

We conducted principal component analyses on demographic, temperament, and cognitive measures differentiating 506 FH + and 528 FH − young adults. Three principal components were identified, and these component scores were then used to predict the odds of being FH + and the odds of having an alcohol or other drug use disorder. Component 1 consisted of measures indexing internalizing traits, with higher component scores indicating greater depressive, anxious, and emotional instability tendencies. Component 2 consisted of measures of externalizing traits as well as exposure to early life adversity (ELA), with higher scores indicating less impulse control, more antisocial behavior, and greater ELA exposure. Component 3 consisted of estimated intelligence, delay discounting, and demographic characteristics, with higher scores indicating lower estimated intelligence, greater discounting of delayed rewards, less education, and lower childhood socioeconomic status. For each 1-point increase in the Component 1, 2, and 3 scores, the odds of being classified FH + increased by 2%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. Similar findings were observed when individuals with alcohol or other drug use disorders were removed from the analyses. Finally, greater Component 2 scores were also associated with increased odds of having an alcohol or other drug use disorder. Collectively, these findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the FH + phenotype in young adults and help form a basis for further studies on biological mechanisms underlying risk for substance use disorders.

From May 2016 to April 2017, a total of 823 eligible participants were consecutively enrolled in our study in Wuhan, China. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP (SBP) of ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) of ≥90 mmHg, a self-reported physician diagnosis, or current use of antihypertensive medication. We used urine samples as biomarkers to reflect the levels of environmental exposure to 20 metals. Multivariable regression models were applied to assess the potential association. Multi-metal models were conducted to investigate the impacts of co-exposure to various metals. Based on the results from various models, positive trends for increased odds of hypertension with increasing quartiles of vanadium (V), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se) were suggested. Compared with those in the lowest quartiles, participants in the highest quartiles of V, Fe, Zn and Se had a 4.4-fold, 4.9-fold, 4.2-fold and 2.5-fold increased odds of having hypertension, respectively. High urinary Hg level was found to increase the levels of DBP. Individuals in the highest group of Hg were found to have a 4.3 mmHg higher level of DBP. Our findings suggest that environmental exposure to V, Fe, Zn, Se and Hg might increase the risk of hypertension or elevate the levels of BP.

These range from straightforward Fourier transform techniques to more sophisticated modal decomposition approaches. In particular Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is shown to provide valuable insight into the time-spatial structure of the combustion flow field, allowing the establishment of correlations between pressure modes and physical parameters of the combustion, such as the injection timing or the chamber geometry. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) on the other hand is proven to successfully highlight the link between the frequency of the unsteady energy components and their spatial distribution within the chamber. Advantage is then taken of the modal characterization of the unsteady behaviour in the chamber to showcase how physical parameters such as the spray angle can be modified to optimize the acoustic signature of the combustion process, helping CI internal combustion engines reduce their acoustic environmental impact. © 2017 The Combustion Institute","CFD; DMD; ICE; Noise; NVH; POD","Combustion chambers; Engines; Environmental impact; Flow fields; Ice; Internal combustion engines; Principal component analysis; Unsteady flow; Combustion flow field; Combustion simulations; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Dynamic mode decompositions; Experimental validations; Noise; Proper orthogonal decompositions; Time-spatial structure; Computational fluid dynamics; Article; chemical reaction kinetics; combustion; compression; computational fluid dynamics; controlled study; decomposition; dynamic mode decomposition; environmental impact; flow kinetics; fluid flow; Fourier transformation; geometry; injection; mathematical analysis; physical parameters; pressure; priority journal; workload",2-s2.0-85032269450

This paper developed a game-theory model in the context of rural China, which describes the endogenous formation of land rights as a bargaining process between ordinary villagers and village leaders. This model gave rise to theoretical predictions pertaining to the implications of two PES schemes in China for land tenure, namely the Sloping Land Conversion Programme (SLCP) and the Ecological Public-Benefit Forest Compensation Programme (EPBFCP). The theoretical predictions were tested using primary data collected through large-scale field surveys. These data were analysed using the Propensity Score Matching method and panel data models. Both the theoretical analysis and the empirical results find that the SLCP has likely enhanced land tenure security by increasing the bargaining costs of village leaders’ attempts to reallocate SLCP lands to other households. On the other hand, villagers tend to have less motivation to de-collectivise those forest lands enrolled in the EPBFCP, which somewhat stands in the way of the country's agenda to further de-collectivise communal forests and allocate them to individual households. © 2017","Game-theory model; Land tenure; Panel data analysis; Payments for Environmental Services (PES); Policy impact evaluation; Propensity Score Matching",,2-s2.0-85027565740

The formulation is based on the displacement and stress boundary integral equations of solid mechanics and it has the advantage of expressing the polycrystalline problem in terms of grain boundary variables only. The individual grains within the polycrystalline morphology are modelled as generally anisotropic linear elastic domains with random spatial orientation. Transgranular micro-cracking is assumed to occur along specific cleavage planes, whose orientation in space within the grains depend upon the crystallographic lattice. Both intergranular and transgranular micro-cracking are modelled using suitably defined cohesive laws, whose parameters characterise the behaviour of the two mechanisms. The algorithm developed to track the inter/transgranular micro-cracking history is presented and discussed. Several numerical tests involving pseudo-3D and fully 3D morphologies are performed and analysed.

Data to calculate fish biomass is routinely collected using either underwater visual census (UVC) or stereo diver operated video (DOV), although the compatibility of UVC and DOV based estimates are yet to be assessed. Accordingly, we calculated and compared community level measures of coral reef fish biomass at Ningaloo reef (Western Australia) using both UVC and DOV. The UVC based biomass estimates were 788 kg/Ha, which was ∼50% greater than those from DOV (500 kg/Ha). Differences between the methods were primarily due to DOV measuring the length of only ∼40% of fish detected by video, preventing fish specific weight calculations for all fish encountered. When the size of unmeasured fish was assumed to be the median value of fish measured by DOV, revised DOV+ estimates of community biomass (778 kg/Ha) were similar to those from UVC. However, even when unmeasured fish were included in DOV calculations, biomass of some families (serranids) were still higher when using UVC. Conversely, DOV adjusted estimates of pomacentrid biomass were higher than those from UVC, due to DOV measuring fewer small bodied fish (<3 cm), thus having a larger median size for the high number of unmeasured pomacentrids compared to UVC. Our results suggest that community measures of fish biomass from DOV and UVC are broadly comparable once weights of unmeasured fish are incorporated into DOV estimates. This may increase the spatial and temporal scales at which fish biomass can be monitored, although compatibility of data will depend on the composition and size distribution of the fish assemblages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coral reef monitoring; Digital image techniques; Fisheries management; Methodological comparison; Size distribution","Biomass; Ecology; Ecosystems; Reefs; Size distribution; Coral reef; Digital image technique; Fisheries management; Methodological comparison; Small bodied fish; Spatial and temporal scale; Weight calculation; Western Australia; Fish; biomass; community composition; comparative study; coral reef; digital image; fishery management; numerical method; size distribution; Australia; Ningaloo Reef; Western Australia; Anthozoa; Pomacentridae; Serranidae",2-s2.0-85032002133

Nevertheless, few smallholders completely replaced nutrients from vegetation with fertilizers. Instead, we found that a hybrid system that combines nutrients from vegetation and fertilizers was approximately twice as common as exclusive fertilizer use. We suggest that the option for this diversified “nutrient portfolio” may result not only from a lack of capital or knowledge regarding return on fertilizer use, but also from the need to adapt to the economic constraints facing smallholders and minimize risk. Results indicate that a rural extension program aimed at supporting a rapid and complete replacement of ashes from vegetation by fertilizers could prove unsuccessful for Amazonian smallholders. © 2017",,"agricultural economics; economic activity; education; farm size; fertility; fertilizer application; land tenure; market conditions; smallholder; Amazonia; Brazil",2-s2.0-85028642785

The current paper strives to overcome this research gap by focusing on uncivil commenting intentions in public Facebook discussions. We presented controversial online comments to a convenient student sample of 256 Facebook users asking them to consider their likely response on several scales ranging from a functional to an uncivil style of reasoning. Users' intended commenting was then linked to several personality traits (Big Five, Dark Triad, sensation seeking, and impulsivity) and their Facebook intensity. Analyses revealed openness, agreeableness, and experience seeking as negative predictors of participants' intention to comment uncivilly, whereas attentional impulsivity, boredom susceptibility as well as intense Facebook use emerged as positive predictors. No connections were found for the Dark Triad.

Patagonia is a vast sparsely-populated in which ponds are a key component of rural and urban landscapes because they provide several ecosystem services such as habitat for wildlife and watering for livestock. Integrating field-based and geospatial data of 109 ponds sampled across the region, we identified spatial trends and assessed the effects of anthropogenic and natural factors in pond water quality. The studied ponds were generally shallow, well oxygenated, with maximum nutrient values reported in sites used for livestock breeding. TN:TP ratio values were lower than 14 in > 90% of the ponds, indicating nitrogen limitation. Water conductivity decreased from de east to the west, meanwhile pH and dissolved oxygen varied associated with the latitude. To assess Patagonian ponds water status we recommend the measure of total suspended solids and total nitrogen in the water, and evaluate the mallín (wetland vegetation) coverage in a 100 m radius from the pond, since those features were significantly influenced by livestock land use. To evaluate the relative importance of natural variability and anthropogenic influences as driving factors of water quality we performed three generalized linear models (GLM) that encompassed the hydrology, hydroperiod and biome (to represent natural influences), and land use (to represent anthropogenic influences) as fixed effects. Our results revealed that at the Patagonian scale, ponds water quality would be strongly dependent on natural gradients. We synthetized spatial patterns of Patagonian pond water quality, and disentangled natural and anthropic factors finding that the dominant environmental influence is rainfall gradient. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Eutrophication; Hydrology; Land cover; Land use; Mallines; Wetlands","Agriculture; Dissolved oxygen; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Hydrology; Lakes; Land use; Nitrogen; Ponds; Quality control; Rain; Water quality; Wetlands; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenic influence; Environmental influences; Generalized linear model; Land cover; Mallines; Natural variability; Total suspended solids; Biochemical oxygen demand; dissolved oxygen; lake water; nitrogen; rain; anthropogenic effect; dissolved oxygen; ecosystem service; environmental gradient; eutrophication; human activity; land cover; land use change; pond; water quality; wetland; air temperature; Article; conductance; controlled study; hydrology; land biome; landscape; latitude; nutritional value; periodicity; pH; precipitation; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; suspended particulate matter; water quality; water sampling; wetland; Patagonia",2-s2.0-85029579906

The mean content of Tl in rice was 1.42 mg kg−1, which exceeded the German maximum permissible level (0.5 mg kg−1) of Tl in foods and feedstuffs by a factor of nearly 3. The hazard quotient value via rice intake was 57.6, indicating a high potential health risk to the local residents. The distribution of various Tl fractions followed the order of easily reducible fraction (40.3%) &gt; acid exchangeable fraction (30.5%) &gt; residual fraction (23.8%) &gt; oxidizable fraction (5.4%). Correlation analyses showed that the easily reducible fraction correlates positively with the soil Fe and Mn contents, whereas the acid exchangeable fraction is significantly correlated with the S content. The soil pH was negatively correlated with the Tl content in both soil and rice. The Tl content in rice was more strongly correlated with the exchangeable fraction than the total Tl content in the soil. Overall, the bioavailability of Tl in more acidic soil is higher, and is strongly dependent on the speciation of Tl, especially the content of acid exchangeable fraction. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Biological availability; Metals; Paddy soil; Rice contamination; Soil contamination; Thallium","iron; manganese; thallium; agricultural soil; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; paddy field; rice; soil pollution; spatial distribution; thallium; topsoil; Article; bioavailability; China; concentration (parameters); extraction; food intake; food safety; hazard assessment; health hazard; human; land use; maximum permissible dose; nonhuman; paddy soil; pH; rice; soil; soil acidity; soil pollution; China; Guangdong",2-s2.0-85032307636

Numerical examples are presented and validated with results from different sources, and the advantage of the FEM-DEM modelling on the impact failure of laminated glass over its parent FEM and DEM is demonstrated. The influences of Young's modulus of interlayer are further discussed, showing that a stiff resin can effectively improve the deformation performance at little expense of energy absorption.

Cordycepin, extracted from Cordyceps ssp., has been revealed as a strong anticancer agent through several ways; however, the mechanism, by which cordycepin counteracts brain cancers, is still poorly understood. In this study, the underlying mechanisms of cordycepin against human brain cancer cells were explored. SH-SY5Y and U251 cells were being a model to represent human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma, respectively. Here, it was found that cordycepin inhibited cell growth, and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in both SH-SY5Y and U-251 cell lines. The expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including P53, BAX, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9, were upregulated, whereas the expression of anti-apoptotic gene, BCL-2, was suppressed. Besides, cordycepin induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with the suppression of antioxidant genes, including GPX, SOD, and Catalase. Importantly, cordycepin was shown to involve in the activation of autophagy, which was evidenced by the increment of LC3I/II. The combination of cordycepin with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, further inhibited the growth, and enhanced the death of brain cancer cells. Altogether, this finding suggested that cordycepin induced apoptosis of human brain cancer cells through mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway and the modulation of autophagy. Therefore, cordycepin could be a promising candidate for the development of anticancer drugs targeting human brain cancers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Apoptosis; Autophagy; Brain cancer; Cordycepin","antioxidant; caspase 3; caspase 9; catalase; chloroquine; cordycepin; glutathione peroxidase; microtubule associated protein 1; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein p53; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; brain cancer; cancer inhibition; concentration response; controlled study; drug potentiation; drug structure; gene expression; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; mitochondrion; neuroblastoma cell line; proto oncogene; SH-SY5Y cell line; tumor suppressor gene; upregulation",2-s2.0-85030855378

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may account for metastasis and recurrence. However, the association between TAMs and EMT is not clarified in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of TAMs on EMT in TNBC. Material and methods We studied specimens from 278 patients with TNBC. TAMs marker cluster of differentiation 163 and EMT-related marker E-cadherin were detected by immunohistochemistry in TNBC tissues, and their clinical significance was evaluated from the patients' medical records. Results TNBC patients with polarized cluster of differentiation 163+ TAMs infiltration and low level of E-cadherin had a significantly higher risk of aggressive features, including recurrence, histologic differentiation, and lymph node metastasis. Infiltration of TAMs was also negatively correlated with E-cadherin in TNBC tissues. Multivariate analysis indicated that infiltration of TAMs and low expression of E-cadherin were independent prognostic factors of overall survival and disease-free survival in TNBC patients. Conclusions High infiltration of TAMs was associated with low expression of E-cadherin and could be used as an unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with TNBC. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Breast cancer; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Prognosis; Triple-negative; Tumor-associated macrophages",,2-s2.0-85032659927

All these processes lead to changes in the Arctic landscape. They influence the hydrochemistry of streams and rivers fed by glaciers and thawing permafrost. In this study, we examine eighty two water samples from two non-glaciated catchments with snow-permafrost regime: the Tyvjobekken Creek and the Reindeer Creek (NW Wedel-Jarlsberg Land, Spitsbergen). We cover hydrometeorological measurements, fluctuations of physicochemical parameters (pH, specific electrolytic conductivity (SEC)), and the presence of selected organic compounds (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), formaldehyde (HCHO), ∑ phenols). The obtained levels of DOC (0.061–0.569 mg C L− 1) and HCHO (&lt; LOD-0.140 mg L− 1) in water samples of these two high Arctic creeks confirm the role of the melting permafrost as a rich source of terrestrial organic carbon and organic pollutants, as well as the impact of rainfall on surface water chemistry. It was found that fluctuations of physicochemical indices (pH, SEC, DOC) were related to changes in mean daily discharge of Reindeer Creek (0.012–0.034 m3 s− 1) and Tyvjobekken Creek (0.011–0.015 m3 s− 1) (r &gt; 0.40). The Tyvjobekken Creek catchment, in contrast to Reindeer Creek catchment, turned out to be resistant to rapid changes in meteorological conditions (r &lt; 0.10) and surface runoff. The processes of permafrost thawing, calcium carbonate dissolution, and biogeochemical “breathing” of soils proved to be crucial for the development of water chemistry. In conclusion, the surface water chemistry of the Reindeer Creek was found to result from the mutual influence of hydrometeorological indices and the biogeochemical environment of the catchment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Dissolved organic carbon; Formaldehyde; Permafrost; Surface water","Biogeochemistry; Calcium carbonate; Catchments; Climate change; Degradation; Formaldehyde; Hydrochemistry; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Organic pollutants; Runoff; Stream flow; Surface waters; Thawing; Water pollution; Water treatment; Arctic; Dissolved organic carbon; Electrolytic conductivity; Meteorological condition; Permafrost thawing; Physicochemical indices; Physicochemical parameters; Surface-water chemistry; Permafrost; calcium carbonate; formaldehyde; organic carbon; organic compound; phenol derivative; rain; surface water; biogeochemistry; catchment; comparative study; dissolved organic carbon; formaldehyde; glacier; hydrometeorology; organic compound; permafrost; surface water; transport process; water chemistry; Arctic; Article; catchment; controlled study; electric conductivity; hydrology; meteorology; organic pollution; permafrost; pH; physical chemistry; Poland; pollution transport; priority journal; runoff; surface water hydrology; water sampling; Arctic; Bellsund; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Wedel Jarlsberg Land; Rangifer tarandus",2-s2.0-85029694406

A comprehensive research model was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). The validity of the extended UTAUT2 model was tested on a new form of technology use which is not only timely but is much desired by the scholars engaged in information systems research. The research model investigates the role of habit, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions, social influence, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social presence, social status, and self-efficacy in influencing the user intentions to engage in photo-tagging. The research model was tested using a cross-sectional study of 780 adolescent Facebook users. The findings suggest that only habit and hedonic motivation have a significant direct influence on the user's intentions to tag photos.

The natural food industry continues to grow in response to rising consumer demand. This qualitative study explored mothers’ motivations for purchasing and consuming natural food products for themselves and their families. Mothers are an important population because of their disproportionate influence on household food consumption. We employed participant photography and a series of three weekly focus groups to derive a rich understanding of the activities surrounding and motivations behind seeking natural in everyday buying decisions. Five major themes were identified. First, natural nurtures well-being: physical, psychological, social, and emotional health. Second, natural behaves “supernaturally,” allowing positive attributes to be transmitted from the source to the recipient. Third, natural is associated with authenticity, providing a sense of trust, transparency, and control. Fourth, consuming natural reinforces the socially constructed idea of a good mother. Lastly, the preference for natural does not always translate into purchase; mothers face compromises because of conflicting priorities and resources. Understanding mothers’ multiple motivations provides deeper insight into the attraction for natural products. The findings have application in positioning interventions for more nutritional eating and revising regulations on the food label natural. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"adult; controlled study; eating; emotional stability; female; household; human; human experiment; information processing; mother; motivation; photography; recipient; trust; wellbeing",2-s2.0-85032794328

The high-salt environment of the outside layer caused a sharp decrease in L. helveticus viability as measured by traditional plate counts. Remarkably, this was associated with lower release of intracellular enzymes (LDH), reduced levels of proteolysis and larger membrane integrity as measured by flow cytometry (FC) following classical Live/Dead staining. FC analysis of light scattering properties highlighted a significant reduction in size and granularity of the microbiota located in the cheese surface, suggestive of cell shrinkage and condensation of internal macromolecules probably due to hyperosmotic stress. The microbiota of the cheese surface were found to experience greater oxidative stress, as measured by FC analysis of the total levels of reactive oxygen species, compared to that of the interior layer. These results lead us to postulate that the physiology and health status of the microbiota were significantly different in the outer and inner layers of the cheese. The hyperosmotic environment of the outer layer resulted in reduced cell lysis, as measurable by assays based upon membrane integrity, but rather triggered cell death via mechanisms involving cell shrinkage and ROS-mediated damage of vital intracellular components. This study challenges the current thinking on how salt controls microbial activity in ripening cheese, especially in cheeses which are brine salted as local variations in biochemical ripening indices can differ significantly from the outside to the inside of a ripening cheese. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Flow cytometry; Membrane integrity; Osmotic pressure; Salt concentration; Starter viability",,2-s2.0-85028511247

Disaster management attracts many organisations working alongside each other and sharing resources to cope with an emergency. Consequently, successful operations rely heavily on the collaboration of different organisations. Despite this, there is little research considering the appropriate management of resources from multiple organisations, and none optimising the number of actors required to avoid shortages or convergence. This research introduces a disaster preparedness system based on a combination of multi-objective optimisation and geographical information systems to aid multi-organisational decision-making. A cartographic model is used to avoid the selection of floodable facilities, informing a bi-objective optimisation model used to determine the location of emergency facilities, stock prepositioning, resource allocation and relief distribution, along with the number of actors required to perform these activities. The real conditions of the flood of 2013 in Acapulco, Mexico, provided evidence of the inability of any single organisation to cope with the situation independently. Moreover, data collected showed the unavailability of enough resources to manage a disaster of that magnitude at the time. The results highlighted that the number of government organisations deployed to handle the situation was excessive, leading to high cost without achieving the best possible level of satisfaction.

Following the guidelines of the UNESCO-2001 Convention for the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, a holistic and interdisciplinary approach based on the development of four of the thirty-six Rules of this international agreement was applied. A non-destructive survey technique was developed to obtain information from the scattered cannons and anchors without altering their condition (Rule 4). The work performed provided information about the origin of both wrecks, the Fougueux and the Bucentaure, two ships of the line of the French Navy, and allowed to characterize the state of conservation at each site without jeopardizing their future conservation in the marine environment. In addition, measurements of the main physical, chemical and biological variables allowed correlating the conservation status at each site with the marine environmental conditions (Rule 15). Thus, in Fougueux shipwreck large iron objects are corroding at a higher rate (between 0.180 and 0.246 mmpy) due to high sediment remobilization and transport induced by waves at this site, causing damage by direct mechanical effect on metallic material and by removing the layer of corrosion products developed on the artefacts. Meanwhile artillery on Bucentaure site, covered with thick layers of biological concretion, is well preserved, with lower corrosion rates (0.073 to 0.126 mmpy), and archaeological information is guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness of the cathodic protection as a temporary measure for in situ conservation (Rule 1) was evaluated on a cannon. The use of a sacrificial anode after 9 months reduced the average corrosion rate (from 0.103 to 0.064 mmpy) and the percent of corrosion rate in 37.9%.

After outlining the history of the substantive vs. formal dichotomy, we point out that socio-metabolic analyses are ecological economics' most significant contribution towards substantive economics. The core of this article then compares what could be today's two best candidates for offering a distinctive foundation to ecological economics as substantive economics: Material and Energy Flows Analyses (MEFA) and Multi-Scale Integrated Analyses of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM). While MEFA is more easily comparative and historical, MuSIASEM is more integrative and comprehensive. Yet we also argue that socio-metabolic analyses represent one of the three pillars of substantive economics and that both MEFA and MuSIASEM are still weak in integrating the politico-institutional structure (second pillar) and a theory of needs (third pillar).

To assess the sustainability performance of sugarcane biofuel production in Brazil, we utilised an extended multi-region input-output (MRIO) matrix to determine the multipliers of carbon emissions, primary energy use, labour, imports and economic stimulus, and their relationship to the Brazilian economic system. Furthermore, we performed a hybrid input-output (IO) life cycle assessment to analyse the triple bottom line (TBL) aspects of sugarcane production in São Paulo state. In particular, we appraised differences between land used for sugarcane or pasture, and between two distinct sugarcane production systems: 1) in which a mill purchases or rents an area and employs its own labourers and machinery (so-called owners), and 2) in which sugarcane is produced and directly sold by farmers to a mill (so-called suppliers). Our results suggest that if areas that were initially used as pasture for cattle are replaced to sugarcane production, energy consumption is increased by a factor of 3.7, employment is reduced by a factor of 5.4 and GHG emissions are reduced to only 2% for every monetary unit (R$) produced. Our assessments concerning Supplier- and Owner-sugarcane producers demonstrate that the total amount of imports required for both scenarios is similar. The owner scenario results in more direct full-time jobs in comparison to the Supplier scenario. For both scenarios, most of the employment is generated by the upstream sectors of their supply chains.

The indenter size effect and the effect of loading rate were related to the ease of rotation of the underlying Si and Al tetrahedra in conjunction with the breaking of bridging Si[sbnd]O and Al[sbnd]O bonds. Further, for a given indenter size, increasing the Si/Al ratio increased the hardness and Young's modulus of the GB, which was correlated to higher strength of Si[sbnd]O bonds as compared to Al[sbnd]O bonds present in the GB. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Geopolymer; Indentation size effect; Molecular dynamics; Nanoindentation","Aluminum; Amorphous silicon; Binders; Bins; Elastic moduli; Geopolymers; Hardness; Inorganic polymers; Molecular dynamics; Nanoindentation; Silicon; Geopolymer; Geopolymer binders; Hardness values; Indentation size effects; Indenter size; Indenter size effects; Mechanical response; Molecular dynamics simulations; Loading",2-s2.0-85031822035

The size of these datasets creates a need for automated clustering methods to group the streamlines into meaningful bundles. Conventional clustering techniques group streamlines based on their spatial coordinates. Neuroanatomists, however, define white-matter bundles based on the anatomical structures that they go through or next to, rather than their spatial coordinates. Thus we propose a similarity measure for clustering streamlines based on their position relative to cortical and subcortical brain regions. We incorporate this measure into a hierarchical clustering algorithm and compare it to a measure that relies on Euclidean distance, using data from the Human Connectome Project. We show that the anatomical similarity measure leads to a 20% improvement in the overlap of clusters with manually labeled tracts. Importantly, this is achieved without introducing any prior information from a tract atlas into the clustering algorithm, therefore without imposing the existence of any named tracts. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Diffusion MRI; Hierarchical clustering; Normalized cuts; Tractography",,2-s2.0-85032745260

Little is known about fate, cycling, and sources of SCCPs in the Bohai Sea biotic and abiotic environment. In this study, we combined a marine food web model with a comprehensive atmospheric transport-multiple phase exchange model to quantify SCCPs in the biotic and abiotic environment in the Bohai Sea. We performed multiple modeling scenario investigations to examine SCCP levels in water, sediment, and phytoplankton. We assessed numerically dry and wet depositions, biomagnification and bioaccumulation of SCCPs in the Bohai Sea marine food web. Results showed declining SCCP levels in water and sediment with increasing distance from the coastline, and so do dry and wet depositions. The net deposition overwhelmed the water-air exchange of SCCPs due to their current use in China, though the diffusive gas deposition fluctuated monthly subject to mean wind speed and temperature. A risk assessment manifests that SCCPs levels in the Bohai Sea fish species are at present not posing risks to the residents in the Bohai Sea Rim region. We identified that the SCCP emission sources in the south of the Bohai Sea made a primary contribution to its loadings to the seawater and fish contamination associated with the East Asian summer monsoon. In contrast, the SCCP emissions from the north and northwest regions of the Bohai Sea were major sources contributing to their loading and contamination to Bohai Sea food web during the wintertime, potentially driven by the East Asian winter monsoon.

Existing literature on the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and environmental pollution has, however, seldom taken into account spatial effects. Addressing this gap, this paper investigated the spatial agglomeration effects and dynamics at work in FDI and environmental pollution (namely, in waste soot and dust, sulfur dioxide, and wastewater) in 285 Chinese cities during the period 2003–2014, using global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation. Our results showed significant spatial autocorrelation in FDI and environmental pollution levels, both of which demonstrated obvious path dependence characteristics in their geographical distribution. A range of agglomeration regions were observed. The high-value and low-value agglomeration areas of FDI were not fully consistent with those of environmental pollution. This result indicates that higher inflows of FDI did not necessarily lead to greater environmental pollution from a geographic perspective, and vice versa. Spatial panel data models were further adopted to explore the impact of FDI on environmental pollution. The results of a spatial lag model (SLM) and a spatial error model (SEM) revealed that the inflow of FDI had distinct effects on different environmental pollutants, thereby confirming the Pollution Heaven Hypothesis and Pollution Halo Hypothesis. The inflow of FDI was found to have reduced waste soot and dust pollution to a certain extent, while it increased the degree of wastewater and sulfur dioxide pollution.

Application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the field of transient diagnosis and condition assessment of electrical and other equipment has been a promising technique; however the use of ANN for reliability prediction of I&C cables has not yet been studied. This paper presents an integrated approach to predict the lifetime and reliability of I&C cables by ANN from the accelerated aging data. In order to validate the proposed methodology for use in probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) of NPP to account for the cable failures, ALT data on a typical cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated I&C cable has been referred from the literature.

It remains unclear, if research evidence from these interventions is generalizable to university and college students of legal drinking age, e.g., in Europe. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a translated and adapted version of the eCHECKUP TO GO, applied as stand-alone web-based electronic screening and brief intervention (e-SBI), in German university students at risk for hazardous drinking. Methods A fully automated web-based two-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomized to an e-SBI or assessment-only (AO) condition. The current paper analyzed students with baseline AUDIT-C scores ≥ 3 for women and ≥ 4 for men (sample at baseline: e-SBI [n = 514], AO [n = 467]; 3-month follow-up: e-SBI [n = 194], AO [n = 231]; 6-month follow-up: e-SBI [n = 146], AO [n = 200]). The primary outcome was prior four weeks’ alcohol consumption. Secondary outcomes were frequency of heavy drinking occasions, peak blood alcohol concentration, and number of alcohol-related problems. Results Mixed linear model analyses revealed significant interaction effects between groups and time points on the primary outcome after 3 and 6 months. Compared to students in the AO condition, students in the e-SBI condition reported consuming 4.11 fewer standard drinks during the previous four weeks after 3 months, and 4.78 fewer standard drinks after 6 months. Mixed results were found on secondary outcomes. Conclusions The results indicate that evidence on and knowledge of web-based e-SBIs based on US college student samples is transferable to German university students of legal drinking age. However, knowledge of what motivates students to complete programs under voluntary conditions, although rare, is needed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohol; e-SBI; Legal drinking age; Personalized feedback; Prevention; Students","alcohol; adult; age; alcohol blood level; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; Article; automation; controlled study; diagnostic test; disease association; drinking behavior; drug dependence treatment; electronic screening and brief intervention; electronics; female; follow up; German (citizen); human; Internet; legal aspect; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; parallel design; program effectiveness; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; social problem; therapy effect; university student",2-s2.0-85030245178

Hospital admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) from 1 January 2014 through 31 December 2015 were identified from electronic Hospitalization Summary Reports. Conditional logistic regression was used to explore the relation between PM2.5 and hospital admissions for AMI. Individuals discharged alive following STEMI in 2014 were followed up for subsequent readmissions through 31 December 2015. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the effect of PM2.5 pollution on subsequent cardiac and STEMI readmissions. Hospital admissions for STEMI (n = 106,467) and NSTEMI (n = 12,719) were examined separately. Exposure to an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 concentration (47.5 μg/m3) at lags 2, 3, 4 and 0–5 days corresponded with 0.6% (95% CI, 0.1%–1.1%), 0.8 (95% CI, 0.3%–1.3%), 0.6% (95% CI, 0.1%–1.1%) and 0.9% (95% CI, 0–1.8%) increases in STEMI admissions, respectively. For NSTEMI, no significant association was observed with PM2.5. We also observed significant associations of PM2.5 concentration with both subsequent cardiac and STEMI readmissions among STEMI survivors. In conclusion, short-term elevations in PM2.5 concentration may increase the risk of STEMI but not NSTEMI, and the association appeared to be more evident among STEMI survivors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acute myocardial infarction; China; Hospitalization; PM2.5; Readmission","Cardiology; Hospitals; Pollution; Acute myocardial infarction; China; Hospitalization; PM2.5; Readmission; Particles (particulate matter)",2-s2.0-85032704116

Well known examples include the global carbon cycle, or the cycles of the ‘grand nutrients’ nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. More recently, efforts have increased to better understand the natural cycling of technology critical elements (TCEs), i.e. elements with a high supply risk and economic importance in the EU. On the other hand, tools such as material-flow analysis (MFA) can help to understand how substances and goods are transported and accumulated in man-made technological systems (‘anthroposphere’). However, to date both biogeochemical cycles and MFA studies suffer from narrow system boundaries, failing to fully illustrate relative anthropogenic and natural flow magnitude and the degree to which human activity has perturbed the natural cycling of elements. We discuss important interconnections between natural and anthropogenic cycles and relevant EU raw material dossiers. Increased integration of both cycles could help to better capture the transport and fate of elements in nature including their environmental/human health impacts, highlight potential future material stocks in the anthroposphere (in-use stocks) and in nature (e.g., in soils, tailings, or mining wastes), and estimate anticipated emissions of TCEs to nature in the future (based on dynamic stock modeling). A preliminary assessment of natural versus anthropogenic element fluxes indicates that anthropogenic fluxes induced by the EU-28 of palladium, platinum, and antimony (as a result of materials uses) might be greater than the respective global natural fluxes. Increased combination of MFA and natural cycle data at EU level could help to derive more complete material cycles and initiate a discussion between the research communities of biogeochemists and material flow analysts to more holistically address the issues of sustainable resource management. © 2017 The Authors","Anthropogenic cycles; Elemental cycles; EU raw materials information systems; EU raw materials policy; Material flow analysis; Natural cycles","Antimony; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Fluxes; Information management; Soil pollution; Anthropogenic cycles; Anthropogenic elements; Elemental cycles; Material flow analysis; Natural cycle; Preliminary assessment; Sustainable resource management; Technological system; Characterization; antimony; element; palladium; platinum; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; environmental monitoring; European Union; holistic approach; information system; material flow analysis; resource management; sustainable development; anthropogenic cycle; Article; biogeochemical cycle; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; Europe; life cycle assessment; natural cycle; priority journal; resource management; risk management; waste management; Europe",2-s2.0-85029544490

Data collected from 213 system users was analyzed using partial least squares (PLS). The results show that perceived need (positively) and inertia (negatively) influenced users’ behavioral intentions to upgrade to a new generation system. The indirect effects of inertia mediated the impact of incumbent system habit, procedural switching costs, and benefit loss costs on the behavioral intention to upgrade. In addition, perceived need mediated the impacts of procedural switching costs, benefit loss costs, and social norms on the behavioral intention to upgrade. Finally, inertia significantly weakened the positive relationship between perceived need and behavioral intention to upgrade.

This study describes the design of an injectable cell delivery platform, based on biomaterial-guided morphogenesis principles. Soft high-mannuronic acid alginate microgels, oxidized and functionalized with integrin-binding peptides, provided adequate biochemical/biomechanical cues for the co-assembly of mesenchymal stem cells and outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC) into pre-vascularized microtissues. In vitro priming conditions regulated OEC tubulogenesis, which only occurred under normoxia (+O2) in the presence of angiogenic factors (+GF) and, importantly, did not revert in an ischemic-like environment. Primed (+O2+GF) microgel-entrapped cells secreted a large variety of angiogenesis-related proteins and produced endogenous extracellular-matrix, rich in fibronectin and collagen type I, fostering cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions and establishing a stable angiogenic niche. Extending the pre-culture time resulted in higher cell outward migration and in vivo angiogenic potential. Microgels partially disintegrated upon implantation in chick embryos, promoting interaction between pre-vascularized microtissues and the host. Preserved human vascular structures were still detected in vivo, and human cells showed the ability to migrate and integrate with the chick vasculature. Our results suggest that an integrated approach combining pro-angiogenic cells, cell-instructive microgels and adequate in vitro priming may provide the basis for successful therapeutic angiogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cell therapy; Cell-instructive; Injectable biomaterial; Microtissue; Pre-vascularization","Biomaterials; Cell culture; Cells; Endothelial cells; Gels; Molecular interactions; Morphology; Proteins; Stem cells; Cell therapy; Extracellular matrices; Injectable biomaterials; Mesenchymal stem cell; Microtissue; Pro-angiogenic therapies; Therapeutic angiogenesis; Vascularization; Cytology",2-s2.0-85032820887

The aim of this study was to research on the accumulation and potential sources of heavy metals in the fish of the Yellow River Estuary. Arsenic, Hg, V and stable isotope ratios (δ15N and δ13C) in 11 species of 129 fish were analyzed. Results showed that the concentrations of As and Hg were all lower than the guideline levels established by international organizations and legal limits by several countries. The mean concentrations of V in samples in this study were significantly higher than the results of previous studies on other regions. Arsenic, Hg and V significantly differed across species (P &lt; 0.05), which might be due to the different foraging habitats and dietary habits of the studied fish. Values of δ15N and δ13C in fish from the study area ranged from 5.1‰ to 14.6‰ and from − 27.6‰ to − 14.5‰, indicating a wide range of trophic positions and energy sources. There was evidence of bioaccumulation of Hg, which could be explained by the positive correlation between Hg concentrations and δ15N in fish. Through estimation of daily intake of inorganic As (iAs), Hg and V via fish consumption, the heavy metal contamination level of fish samples fell in an acceptable range, indicating no potentially hazardous for human health. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fish; Heavy metals; Stable isotope ratios; Yellow River Estuary","Arsenic; Biochemistry; Estuaries; Fish; Health risks; Heavy metals; Isotopes; Mercury (metal); Rivers; Heavy metal contamination; International organizations; Mean concentrations; Positive correlations; Potential health risks; Potential sources; Stable isotope ratios; Yellow River Estuary; River pollution; arsenic; carbon 13; mercury; nitrogen 15; vanadium; bioaccumulation; biological uptake; concentration (composition); fish; guideline; health risk; heavy metal; isotopic ratio; stable isotope; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; body height; body weight; carp; Channa argus; China; crucian carp; estuary; fish; foraging behavior; geographic distribution; habitat; health hazard; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix; Lateolabrax japonicus; Liza haematocheila; Megalobrama amblycephala; Mugil cephalus; nonhuman; Pelteobagrus fulvidraco; priority journal; Silurus asotus; species difference; Synechogobius hasta; trophic level; China; Shandong; Yellow River Estuary",2-s2.0-85029386770

These water bodies contribute flow to the Schuylkill River, one of the major drinking water sources for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Effluent was observed to be a significant source of nutrients, human and non-specific fecal associated taxa. There was an observed increase in the alpha diversity at locations immediately below effluent outflows, which contributed many taxa involved in wastewater treatment processes and nutrient cycling to the stream's microbial community. Unexpectedly, modeling of microbial community shifts along the stream was not controlled by concentrations of measured nutrients. Furthermore, partial recovery, in the form of decreasing abundances of bacteria and nutrients associated with wastewater treatment plant processes, nutrient cycling bacteria, and taxa associated with fecal and sewage sources, was observed between effluent sources, which we hypothesize is controlled by distance from effluent source. Antecedent moisture conditions were observed to impact overall microbial community diversity, with higher diversity occurring after rainfall.

Study of such an area in Malawi has allowed understanding of risks posed to groundwater from the recent implementation of a typical developing-country pit-latrine sanitation policy to be gained. This has assisted the development of a risk-assessment framework approach pragmatic to regulatory-practitioner management of this issue. The framework involves water-supply and pit-latrine mapping, monitoring of key groundwater contamination indicators and surveys of possible environmental site-condition factors and culminates in an integrated statistical evaluation of these datasets to identify the significant factors controlling risks posed. Our approach usefully establishes groundwater-quality baseline conditions of a potentially emergent issue for the study area. Such baselines are foundational to future trend discernment and contaminant natural attenuation verification critical to policies globally. Attribution of borehole contamination to pit-latrine loading should involve, as illustrated, the use of the range of contamination (chemical, microbiological) tracers available recognising none are ideal and several radial and capture-zone metrics that together may provide a weight of evidence. Elevated, albeit low-concentration, nitrate correlated with some radial metrics and was tentatively suggestive of emerging latrine influences. Longer term monitoring is, however, necessary to verify that the commonly observed latrine-borehole separation distances (29–58 m), alongside statutory guidelines, do not constitute significant risk. Borehole contamination was limited and correlation with various environmental-site condition factors also limited. This was potentially ascribed to effectiveness of attenuation to date, monitoring of an emergent problem yet to manifest, or else contamination from other sources. High borehole usage and protective wall absence correlated with observed microbiological contamination incidence, but could relate to increased human/animal activity close to these poorly protected boreholes. Additional to factors assessed, a groundwater-vulnerability factor is recommended that critically relies upon improved proactive securing of underpinning data during borehole/latrine installations.

The work focuses on the character of PM concentration dynamics indoors, in the vicinity of emission source. The objective was to recognize between the homogeneous or heterogeneous dynamics. The goal was achieved by detecting normal and anomalous diffusion in fluctuations of PM concentration. For this purpose we used anomalous diffusion exponent, β which was derived from Mean Square Displacement (MSD) analysis. The information about PM concentration dynamics may be used to design sampling strategy, which serves to attain representative information about PM behavior in time. The data analyzed in this work was collected from single-point PM concentration monitoring in the vicinity of seven emission sources in industrial environment.

A characterization of the chemical composition and the source apportionment of PM10 at an urban background site in Bogota was carried out in this study. Daily samples were collected from June 2015 to May 2016 (a total of 311 samples). Organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble compounds (SO4 2−, Cl−, NO3 −, NH4 +), major elements (Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, K, P) and trace metals (V, Cd, Pb, Sr, Ba, among others) were analyzed. The results were interpreted in terms of their variability during the rainy season (RS) and the dry season (DS). The data obtained revealed that the carbonaceous fraction (∼51%) and mineral dust (23%) were the main PM10 components, followed by others (15%), Secondary Inorganic Compounds (SIC) (11%) and sea salt (0.4%). The average concentrations of soil, SIC and OC were higher during RS than DS. However, peak values were observed during the DS due to photochemical activity and forest fires. Although trace metals represented &lt;1% of PM10, high concentrations of toxic elements such as Pb and Sb on RS, and Cu on DS, were obtained. By using a PMF model, six factors were identified (∼96% PM10) including fugitive dust, road dust, metal processing, secondary PM, vehicles exhaust and industrial emissions.

Therefore, integrity and availability of computer networks become priorities, making it a fundamental resource to be managed. In this work, a scheme combining Genetic Algorithm and a Fuzzy Logic for network anomaly detection is discussed. The Genetic Algorithm is used to generate a Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow Analysis, where information extracted from network flows data is used to predict the networks traffic behavior for a given time interval. Furthermore, a Fuzzy Logic scheme is applied to decide whether an instance represents an anomaly or not, differing from some approaches present in the literature. Indeed, it is proposed an expert system with the capability to monitor the network's traffic with IP flows while expected behaviors are generated in a regular time interval basis, issuing alarms when a possible problem is present. The proposed anomaly detection system exposes network problems autonomously. The results acquired from applying the proposed approach in a real network traffic flows achieve an accuracy of 96.53% and false positive rate of 0.56%.

The recent research progress in this subject has led to an improved understanding of the experimental, analytical and numerical observations. This review focuses on the aspects of phenomena, mechanisms and modelling on the concerned subject. Attention is paid to linking macroscopic dynamic compressive behaviour with the subscale influential factors. The characteristics of cellular materials at different spatial scales and their compressive behaviours at different loading rates are introduced, based on experimental observations in the quasi-static, transitional dynamic and shock regimes of compression. Then a comprehensive discussion about the roles of the micro- and meso-scale mechanisms in the dynamic compressive behaviour is presented. Finally, important modelling approaches and results are reviewed and commented. The main conclusions are: (1) the strain-rate sensitivity of cellular materials is closely associated with base material properties (both quasi-static and dynamic ones) and cell structure; (2) the compaction shock in cellular materials has mesoscopic structural causes and its formation leads to unique deformation mode, load transmission and stress–strain states; (3) shock initiation requires sufficient loading rate or intensity, and its critical condition can be described based on impact velocity; (4) cell-based modelling is useful for the identification and examination of the underpinning mechanisms, while continuum-based modelling is necessary for the analysis of structures made of cellular materials.

In this work, the influence of growth temperature on EPS production was evaluated, as well as the consequences of these changes in the probiotic properties of the strains. All Lactobacillus paracasei strains used in the study showed changes in EPS production caused by growth temperature, evidenced by the appearance of a high molecular weight fraction and an increment in the total amount of produced EPS at lower temperature.

In the present study, by combining diffusion tensor imaging and functional interaction analysis, we aim to provide new insights on the organisation of the structural and functional pathways connecting the multiple nodes of the identified semantic system -shared by vision and language (Jouen et al., 2015). We investigated a group of 19 healthy human subjects during experimental tasks of reading sentences or seeing pictures. The structural connectivity was realised by deterministic tractography using an algorithm to extract white matter fibers terminating in the selected regions of interest (ROIs) and the functional connectivity by independent component analysis to measure correlated activities among these ROIs. The major connections link ventral neural stuctures including the parietal and temporal cortices through inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculi, the retrosplenial and parahippocampal cortices through the cingulate bundle, and the temporal and prefrontal structures through the uncinate fasciculus. The imageability score provided when the subject was reading a sentence was significantly correlated with the factor of anisotropy of the left parieto-temporal connections of the middle longitudinal fasciculus. A large part of this ventrally localised structural connectivity corresponds to functional interactions between the main parietal, temporal and frontal nodes. More precisely, the strong coactivation both in the anterior temporal pole and in the region of the temporo-parietal cortex suggests dual and cooperating roles for these areas within the semantic system.

Currently, they are not fully utilised due to low biofuel yields from biological processes while thermo-chemical conversion technologies and transesterification processes suffer from certain drawbacks of conventional heating. Consequently, several technologies have been studied to improve biofuel production from lignocellulosic and waste materials, with microwave (MW) irradiation gaining increased interests over the years. This study reviewed the use of MW irradiation for assisting biofuel production from biological and thermo-chemical conversion processes as well as biodiesel production from the transesterification process. The principles underlying MW irradiation were initially described followed by the several benefits of MW over conventional heating and the different effects of MW irradiation on pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass and waste materials such as defragmentation of lignocellulosics, organic matter solubilisation and enhanced hydrolysis. Although MW irradiation generally enhanced biofuel production from biological processes, the extra biofuel (bio-ethanol, bio-methane or bio-hydrogen) produced could not compensate for the energy input due to MW irradiation, resulting in negative efficiencies for the pre-treatment technique. Regarding MW-assisted thermo-chemical conversion of biomass and waste materials to biofuels, it can be deduced that MW-heating is much more beneficial as opposed to conventional heating based on the products quality and yields obtained but the energy efficiency aspects of MW-heating are contradictory among studies. As for MW-assisted biodiesel production from the transesterification process, studies are almost unanimous as to the benefits of MW-heating over conventional heating such as reduced processing times or increased biodiesel yields. Finally, this article discussed some of the challenges of MW irradiation such as formation of inhibitors on biological processes, energy efficiency of the technology, technical aspects viz. poor dielectric properties of some substrates as well as difficulties for large-scale implementation of the technology before concluding on the future directions of MW-irradiation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biodiesel production; Fermentation; Lignocellulosic biomass; Microwave pre-treatment; Thermo-chemical conversion techniques",,2-s2.0-85030839050

In European countries, 36% of total greenhouse gas emissions is attributed to buildings. In this respect, green roofs are considered to be one of the most appropriate sustainable solutions to resolve the urban heat island-related issues. Roofs account for nearly 20–25% of overall urban surface areas. Energy saving, thermal insulation, shading and evapotranspiration features highlight the key role of green roofs in overall thermal performance of buildings and microclimatic conditions of indoor environments. Within the scope of this research, the concept of green roofs and facades is comprehensively analysed in a holistic and thematic way. Following a historical overview of the technology, the research is split into various subfields such as energy saving in buildings through greenery systems, multifunctional thermal benefits including evapotranspiration, thermal insulation, shading and thermal comfort features, evaporative cooling for reducing cooling demand and minimising wind driven convection losses. The results achieved from the literature survey clearly indicate that green roofs and facades are key solutions to mitigate building-related energy consumptions and greenhouse gas emissions. According to the previous works, heat flow through the building roofs in summer can be reduced by approximately 80% via green roofs. The green roofs are reported to consume less energy in the range of 2.2–16.7% than traditional roofs during summer time. A similar tendency is observed for the winter season depending on regional and climatic conditions. The temperature difference between conventional and greens roofs in winter is found to be about 4 °C, which is remarkable. Energy demand of buildings in summer is highly dependent on the plant intensity as it is reported to be 23.6, 12.3 and 8.2 kWh/m2/year for extensive, semi-intensive and intensive greenery surface, respectively. Greenery systems are also capable of providing thermally comfortable indoor and outdoor conditions. It is underlined that the annual average accumulation of CO2 reaches the level of 13.41–97.03 kg carbon/m2 for 98 m2 of vertical greenery system. The results of this research can be useful for dwellers, builders, architects, engineers and policy makers to have a good understanding about the potential of green roofs and facades to mitigate building-related energy consumptions and carbon emissions in a renewable, sustainable, energy-efficient and cost effective way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Energy saving; Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Green roofs; Urban heat island",,2-s2.0-85030704488

Specific leaf area (SLA) and SPAD chlorophyll meter reading (SCMR) were measured over the experimental period. Their relationships with physiological traits and with each other were also tested. Three-year-old plants in pots were subjected to control regime (CI replaced daily water use), sustained deficit regime (SDI was applied daily at 35% of CI), and five successive drought cycles of 30 days followed by rewatering (CDI). In all cultivars, SDI decreased stem water potential compared to CI. Under CDI, stem water potential reached the minimum, ∼–8 MPa, but all cultivars recovered to potentials similar to the rewatering period. Stomatal conductance was significantly reduced in both deficit irrigation regimes compared to the control. Rewatering caused a slower recovery of stomatal conductance in ‘Selección Mendoza’ ‘Villalonga’ and ‘Arbequina’ than in the rest of cultivars. Across cultivars, specific leaf area decreased with water deficit, while SCMR increased. Specific leaf area was positively related with stem water potential (R2 = 0.60), stomatal conductance (R2 = 0.44) and trunk growth (R2 = 0.31). In contrast, SCMR values were negatively related with stem water potential (R2 = 0.59), stomatal conductance (R2 = 0.52) and trunk growth (R2 = 0.62). ‘Changlot’ ‘Arauco’ and ‘Nevadillo Blanco’ cultivars maintained lower SLA and higher SCMR under both deficit irrigation regimes and higher stomatal conductance recovery after rewatering.

Few studies, however, have assessed the applicability of AquaCrop for cotton under film-mulched drip irrigation in salt-affected soil. The objectives of this study were to test AquaCrop performance and to determine the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton under several scenarios of initial soil-water content (SWC) and soil salinity for two typical soils in a saline region of southern Xinjiang of China with film-mulched drip irrigation. A four-year irrigation experiment was conducted in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 growing seasons for cotton, covering full (100%), over (115 and 145% of full) and deficit (55–90% of full) irrigation treatments. Based on the recommended parameters for cotton in AquaCrop manual, the model was calibrated using 2016 data sets and validated using the data sets from the other three years. Simulations of canopy cover, soil water storage of the root zone and aboveground biomass fitted well with the field observations with coefficient of determination r2 &gt; 0.77 and the index of agreement d &gt; 0.92 and slightly underestimated yield. As for soil salinity, the model gave a reliable simulation for less than 80% of full irrigation treatments, while underestimated for over 80% of full irrigation treatments. Overall, AquaCrop can be used as a feasible tool to predict cotton growth response to water under film-mulched drip irrigation in this region. According to the principle of high yield and WUE, the simulation results showed that the appropriate irrigation amounts were recommended at 358–457 mm for silty loam and 406–462 mm for sandy loam in this region, which can provide a reference for irrigation optimization under film-mulched drip irrigation in southern Xinjiang and other similar regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AquaCrop model; Cotton growth; Film-mulched drip irrigation; Soil salinity; Soil water","Climate models; Cotton; Cultivation; Digital storage; Film growth; Saline water; Soil moisture; Soils; Above ground biomass; Coefficient of determination; Cotton growth; Irrigation optimization; Irrigation treatments; Mulched drip irrigations; Soil salinity; Soil water; Irrigation; Gossypium hirsutum",2-s2.0-85032789601

High cost and lack of oral formulation of existing drugs, rapid developments of resistance by the parasite coupled with serious side effects require new treatments to augment or replace currently available therapies. The major merits of herbal medicine seem to demonstrate perceived efficacy, low incidence of serious adverse effects and low cost. Erythrophleum plants possess beneficial biological properties and, as such, characterization of the bioactive components of these plants is imperative. Previous work has shown an overwhelming presence of cassaine alkaloids in these plants. However, amongst these plants, the African based specie (Erythrophleum ivorense) is the least studied. Objective In the current study, the in vitro anti-leishmanial activity of the crude extract, its fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated using direct counting assay of promastigotes of Leishmania donovani using amphotericin B as positive control. Materials and methods The anti-leishmanial activity of E. ivorense extract was evaluated in vitro against the promastigote forms of Leishmania Donovani using a direct counting assay based on growth inhibition. Different crude extracts from ethyl acetate, pet-ether, and methanol as well as pure isolated compounds of E. ivorense: Erythroivorensin, Eriodictyol and Betulinic acid were screened. To know the possible components of the active methanolic extract, attempt was made to elucidate the extract using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). Results This afforded a weak pet-ether fraction, a moderately active ethyl acetate fraction and a significantly active methanol fraction (IC50 = 2.97 μg/mL) compared to Amphotericin B (IC50 = 2.40±0.67 μg/mL). The novel diterpene erythroivorensin, betulinic acid and the flavanone Eriodictyol, from the ethyl acetate fraction, showed weak activity. UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS was used to identify the cassaine diterpenoids from the active methanol fraction. Here, 10 compounds of this type were putatively identified from the ethanol crude extract. Conclusion The fragmentation mechanism of these metabolites is also proposed and are expected to serve as reference template for identification of these and related compounds in future.

Recently, patients have begun to use Chinese medicine to strengthen the immune system and alleviate side effects. Aim of the study We aimed to evaluate the association between mortality rate and early use of Chinese herbal products (CHPs) among patients with lung cancer. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan Cancer Registry, and Cause of Death Data. Patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer between 2002 and 2010 were classified as either the CHP (n = 422) or the non-CHP group (n = 2828) based on whether they used CHP within 3 months after first diagnosis of lung cancer. A robust Cox regression model was used to examine the hazard ratio (HR) of death for propensity score (PS) matching samples. Results After PS matching, average survival time of the CHP group was significantly longer than that of the non-CHP group. The adjusted HR (0.82; 95% CI: 0.73–0.92) in the CHP group was lower than the non-CHP group. Stratified by clinical cancer stages, CHP group had longer survival time in stage 3 subgroup. When the exposure period of CHP use was changed from 3 to 6 months, results remained similar (HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76–0.95). Conclusion Results indicated that patients with lung cancer who used CHP within 3 months after first diagnosis had a lower hazard of death than non-CHP users, especially for stage 3 lung cancer. Further experimental studies are needed to examine the causal relationship. © 2017","Chinese herbal products; Hazard ratio; Lung cancer; Mortality rate; Propensity score","antineoplastic agent; Chinese drug; herbaceous agent; adult; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cancer staging; cause of death; Chinese medicine; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; follow up; human; hypertension; longitudinal study; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; outcome assessment; retrospective study; survival time",2-s2.0-85029700126

In the first experiment, naive rats were trained in the AvRM and then subjected to TGCI. The EAF was administered orally 30 min before and 1 h after TGCI, and administration continued once per day for 7 days post-ischemia.

Retrograde memory performance was assessed 8, 15, and 21 days post-ischemia. Ischemia caused persistent retrograde amnesia, and this effect was prevented by T. catigua. This memory protection (or preservation) persisted even after the treatment was discontinued, despite the absence of histological neuroprotection. Protein carbonyl group content and MPO activity increased around 43% and 100%, respectively, after TGCI, which were abolished by the EAF of T. catigua.

Forkhead box O (FoxO) 3a, as transcription factor, has been confirmed to modulate autophagic process. Moreover, FoxO3a is expressed throughout the brain including the hippocampus. However, the role of FoxO3a in the pathophysiology of TBI is unclear. The present study is designed to investigate whether FoxO3a has the neuroprotective effects on rats subjected to TBI, and further to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Thus, a rat model of TBI was created by using a modified weight-drop device to mimic the insults of TBI. The results showed that FoxO3a was significantly increased in the serum of patients with TBI as well as in experimental animals. Furthermore, our data also demonstrated that TBI stimulated the translocation of FoxO3a from the cytosol to the nucleus. Additionally, we found that knockdown of FoxO3a by siRNA silencing significantly improved neurobehavioral dysfunctions and conferred a better neuroprotective effects after TBI, evidenced by promoting motor behavioral recovery, attenuating learning and memory impairments, and partially reversing neuronal damage in the hippocampus. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection, we identified that nuclear accumulation of Foxo3a could induce highly expression of autophagy pathway genes including LC-3, Beclin-1, p62, ATG12, and ATG14, and finally initiate neurological impairments. Interestingly, silencing FoxO3a by siRNA remarkably inhibited the induction of neuronal autophagy after TBI, and activated autophagy was closely related to TBI-induced neurological deficits. Taken together, these findings indicated that FoxO3a knockdown conferred neuroprotective effects after TBI through inhibiting the activation of neuronal autophagy. © 2017","Autophagy; FoxO3a; Neurobehavioral deficits; Neuron; Traumatic brain injury","autophagy related protein; autophagy related protein 12; beclin 1; protein ATG14; sequestosome 1; transcription factor FKHRL1; unclassified drug; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autophagy; behavior disorder; controlled study; convalescence; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; gene translocation; hippocampus; human; learning disorder; locomotion; major clinical study; male; memory disorder; mouse; neuroprotection; nonhuman; priority journal; protein blood level; protein function; signal transduction; traumatic brain injury; upregulation",2-s2.0-85029542384

This issue is apparent in research on externalizing, a heritable predisposition to disinhibitory psychopathology and personality traits. Numerous studies have shown that P3 amplitude reduction (P3AR) reliably reflects externalizing, implicating P3AR as a candidate endophenotype for externalizing psychopathology. However, this endophenotype has not been connected directly to a key deficit in executive function (e.g., inhibitory control) commonly related to externalizing. Using a modified oddball task in a sample (N = 74) of at-risk adolescents and young adults, we examined the associations among externalizing, P3AR, and inhibitory control. We also examined the associations of P3AR and inhibitory control with frequency of real-world disinhibited behavior. Results indicated that externalizing related to P3AR, which in turn related to deficient inhibitory control. Additionally, there were both unique and interactive associations of P3 amplitude and inhibitory control with indicators of real-world behavior. These findings provide the first direct evidence that P3AR reflects deficits in inhibitory control, thus linking this externalizing-related endophenotype to a specific cognitive process. Moreover, the results highlight the value of considering psychobiological measures alongside behavioral measures for indexing risk for externalizing behavior and psychopathology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Endophenotype; Event-related potential (ERP); Externalizing; Inhibitory control; P3",,2-s2.0-85030459737

Moreover, the brains of these rats are abnormally developed, compared to brains of rats reared in more complex/enriched environments. Repetitive behaviors are commonly observed in individuals with developmental disorders. Some of these repetitive behaviors could be maintained by the reinforcing effects of the sensory stimulation that they produce. Therefore, rearing rats in impoverished conditions may provide an animal model for certain repetitive behaviors associated with developmental disorders. We hypothesize that in rats reared in simple/impoverished environments, the normal habituation process to sensory reinforcers is impaired, resulting in high levels of repetitive behaviors. We tested the hypothesis using an operant sensory reinforcement paradigm in rats reared in simple/impoverished (IC), standard laboratory (SC), and complex/enrichened conditions (EC, treatments including postnatal handling and environmental enrichment). Results show that the within-session habituation of the reinforcer effectiveness of light onset was slower in the IC and SC rats than in the EC rats. A dishabituation challenge indicated that within-session decline of responses was due to habituation and not motor fatigue or sensory adaptation. In conclusion, rearing rats in simple/impoverished environments, and comparing them to rats reared in more complex/enriched environments, may constitute a useful approach for studying certain repetitive behaviors associated with developmental disorders. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Autism; Environmental enrichment; Operant; Reinforcer effectiveness; Sensory reinforcement; Stereotypic behavior","adaptation; amplitude modulation; animal experiment; animal model; Article; compulsion; controlled study; developmental disorder; disease association; environmental enrichment; female; habituation; male; neuropathology; noise; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; rearing; reinforcement; sensory stimulation; stimulus response",2-s2.0-85030477962

Multimodal MRI techniques and analyses were used to assess obese patients, including the functional connectivity (FC), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), graph theoretical analysis (GTA), and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Correlations between brain circuit segregation and obesity were also calculated. In the VBM, obese patients showed altered gray matter volumes in the amygdala, thalamus and putamen. In the FC, the obesity group showed increased functional connectivity in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and decreased functional connectivity in the frontal gyrus of default mode network. The obesity group also exhibited altered ALFF and ReHo in the prefrontal cortex and precuneus.

Although previous studies have analyzed brain regions associated with processing visual information of motion, motor control and visuomotor integration with static objects, less is known about visuomotor integration with moving objects. In the present study we used an event-related fMRI experiment to investigate brain areas integrating visual information of motion with motor action in response to moving objects. Twenty healthy volunteers performed an interceptive task where they had to press a button in synchrony with the arrival of a horizontally moving target at a predefined location.

Based on the assumption that metal clusters have regular cuboctahedral geometry, it was possible to develop a model that describes how three dimensional aspects of the metal clusters may affect the TPD profiles. Depending on the way that the metal clusters are assumed to be arranged in the surface, two different approaches are described to account for desorption. The first one, named Monocluster Model, considers a surface with a narrow cluster size distribution in which an average cluster diameter reasonably well describes the cluster population. A more complete approach, named Multicluster Model, explains desorption based on the cluster size distribution of the metal sites. TPD curves of ammonia from different platinum supported carbon materials were numerically treated and compared with the geometrical information obtained from Transition Electron Microscopy. The results displayed a reasonable agreement, indicating that TPD curves should be interpreted taking into account the metal cluster size. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Modelling; Structure sensitivity; Temperature programmed desorption","Carbon; Cluster analysis; Desorption; Metals; Models; Size distribution; Carbon material; Cluster diameter; Cluster-size distribution; Cuboctahedral; Geometrical informations; Metal cluster; Metal sites; Structure sensitivity; Temperature programmed desorption",2-s2.0-85032711614

As the first objective of this paper, the grids were constructed based on a primary RANS simulation and then refined relative the Kolmogorov length scale using a field function. This greatly aided the construction of a very fine and effective grid whereby all the required criteria for an LES could be met. For the sake of validation, results in terms of mean structures were compared to existing 2D PIV experimental data using water as the working fluid. The achievement of very good agreement between the results has presented the opportunity to study the flow behavior in unsteady state conditions. The available experimental facility suffers from a similar drawback and always results in measurements a few millimeters after the flare down to downstream, while the region before the flare with high swirling interaction remains inaccessible. The second objective of this study was to study the flow behavior merely within the region before the flare location. Previous investigations have shown that the inner axial swirler greatly reduces the interaction with the outer counter-rotating swirler; a few millimeters away from the swirler, there is no sign of the inner swirler motion. Additionally, previous studies have related the formation of Precessing Vortex Core (PVC) within the central core to the peaks of the pressure or axial velocity spectrum. In addition, in some cases, up to two distinct peaks have been reported at the swirler mouth [1–3]. However, the spectrum analysis under iso-thermal conditions at the region inside the swirler, where the inner swirler dominates the flow, showed a higher potential for instabilities, with three to four distinct peaks. It was observed that, moving forward, the number of peaks is decreased, and in certain areas where the experimental measurement is applicable, the number of peaks decreased to two and one distinct points. In addition, the co-variance of the identified regions of axial and tangential velocity showed a higher correlation. The data show that the central axis corresponds to a lack of peaks of instabilities, whereas further away in the radial direction, several peaks exist. These results both emphasize the importance of the region inside the swirler where the primitive mixture of fuel and swirling air is constructed and aid in identifying the source of instabilities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Correlation coefficient; Inner swirler flow; LES WALE; Power spectral density (PSD)","Spectral density; Spectrum analysis; Correlation coefficient; Experimental facilities; LES WALE; Power spectral densities (PSD); Precessing vortex core; Rectangular configuration; Swirlers; Unsteady state conditions; Vortex flow",2-s2.0-85031763090

Recently, the phase equilibrium calculation at specified moles, volume and temperature (NVT-flash) becomes an attractive issue. In this paper, capillarity is incorporated into the phase equilibrium calculation at specified moles, volume and temperature. A dynamical model for such problem is developed for the first time by using the laws of thermodynamics and Onsager's reciprocal principle. This model consists of the evolutionary equations for moles and volume, and it can characterize the evolutionary process from a non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium state in the presence of capillarity effect at specified moles, volume and temperature. The phase equilibrium equations are naturally derived. To simulate the proposed dynamical model efficiently, we adopt the convex-concave splitting of the total Helmholtz energy, and propose a thermodynamically stable numerical algorithm, which is proved to preserve the second law of thermodynamics at the discrete level. Using the thermodynamical relations, we derive a phase stability condition with capillarity effect at specified moles, volume and temperature. Moreover, we propose a stable numerical algorithm for the phase stability testing, which can provide the feasible initial conditions.

In statistics, graphical models have been identified as a useful and powerful tool for covariance estimation in high dimensional problems and it is an area that has recently experienced a great expansion. In particular, Gaussian concentration graph models (GCGM) have been widely studied. These are models in which the distribution of a set of random variables, the marker effects in this case, is assumed to be Markov with respect to an undirected graph G. In this paper, Bayesian (Bayes G and Bayes G-D) and frequentist (GML-BLUP) methods adapting the theory of GCGM to genome-wide prediction were developed. Different approaches to define the graph G based on domain-specific knowledge were proposed, and two propositions and a corollary establishing conditions to find decomposable graphs were proven. These methods were implemented in small simulated and real datasets. In our simulations, scenarios where correlations among allelic substitution effects were expected to arise due to various causes were considered, and graphs were defined on the basis of physical marker positions. Results showed improvements in correlation between phenotypes and predicted additive genetic values and accuracies of predicted additive genetic values when accounting for partially correlated allele substitution effects. Extensions to the multiallelic loci case were described and some possible refinements incorporating more flexible priors in the Bayesian setting were discussed. Our models are promising because they allow incorporation of biological information in the prediction process, and because they are more flexible and general than other models accounting for correlated marker effects that have been proposed previously. © 2017","Correlated allele substitution effects; Genome-enabled prediction; Graphical models; Sparse covariance estimation","allele; Bayesian analysis; concentration (composition); covariance analysis; Gaussian method; genome; graphical method; phenotype; prediction; Article; Bayes theorem; chromosome; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic distance; genome-wide association study; genotype; human; Markov chain; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; nonhuman; normal distribution; phenotype; prediction; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; systematic error",2-s2.0-85032297433

Neutron radiography is one of the first non-distractive post-irradiated examination methods, which is applied to gain an overview of the integrity of irradiated nuclear fuel and other nuclear materials. However, very powerful gamma radiation emitted by the samples is damaging to the electronics of digital imaging detectors and has so far precluded the use of modern detectors. Here we describe a design of a neutron microscope based on focusing mirrors suitable for thermal neutrons. As in optical microscopes, the sample is separated from the detector, decreasing the effect of gamma radiation. In addition, the application of mirrors would result in a thirty-fold gain in flux and a resolution of better than 40 μm for a field-of-view of about 2.5 cm. Such a thermal neutron microscope can be useful for other applications of neutron radiography, where thermal neutrons are advantageous. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Neutron focusing optics; Neutron radiography; Post-irradiation examination","Focusing; Fuels; Gamma rays; Heavy metals; Microscopes; Mirrors; Neutron radiography; Neutrons; Nuclear fuel cladding; Radioactive materials; Digital imaging; Examination methods; Focusing mirrors; Neutron focusing; Nuclear material; Optical microscopes; Post irradiation examinations; Thermal neutrons; Neutron irradiation",2-s2.0-85032672404

Previous studies have shown that the reorganization of interactions among co-occurring species can modulate their chances to adapt to novel environmental conditions. Moreover, empirical evidence has shown that these ecological dynamics typically facilitate the persistence of groups of species rather than entire communities. However, so far, we have no systematic methodology to identify those groups of species with the highest or lowest chances to adapt to new environments through a reorganization of their interactions. Yet, this could prove extremely valuable for developing new conservation strategies. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to estimate the effect of the reorganization of interactions on the adaptability of a group of species, within a community, to novel environmental conditions. We introduce the concept of the adaptation space of a group of species based on a feasibility analysis of a population dynamics model. We define the adaptation space of a group as the set of environmental conditions that can be made compatible with its persistence thorough the reorganization of interactions among species within the group. The larger the adaptation space of a group, the larger its likelihood to adapt to a novel environment. We show that the interactions in the community outside a group can act as structural constraints and be used to quantitatively compare the size of the adaptation space among different groups of species within a community. To test our theoretical framework, we perform a data analysis on several pairs of natural and artificially perturbed ecological communities. Overall, we find that the groups of species present in both control and perturbed communities are among the ones with the largest adaptation space. We believe that the results derived from our framework point out towards new directions to understand and estimate the adaptability of species to changing environments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Changing environments; Feasibility; Network reorganization; Species coexistence","adaptation; coexistence; community ecology; environmental change; environmental conditions; feasibility study; population dynamics; adaptation; Article; community; conceptual framework; environmental change; feasibility study; nonhuman; organismal interaction; population dynamics; priority journal; simulation",2-s2.0-85032330630

A dynamic, heterosexual core group model with risk of infection through both vaginal and anal pathways is formulated and comprehensively analysed. The model is coupled to a general population model and fitted to HIV prevalence data for Zimbabwe in order to explore the parameter space related to heterosexual AI. The model fit supports a core group size ranging between 5−20% and exposure risk to AI in excess of 50%. The control effort quantified by the reproductive number (RA) at commencement of the epidemic corresponds to R0=4.40. With the contribution of heterosexual AI to Zimbabwe's (and that of the sub-Saharan African region) epidemic unknown, the study apportioned infections between the two infection pathways. New infections due to VI ranged from 2−4.5% and 0.5−2.7% from heterosexual AI. The study estimates infection probabilities ranging from 0.15 to 0.35 for both receptive and infective AI. By quantifying the incidence due to VI and AI risks, we put emphasis on the necessity for targeted interventions. To project the potential impact of heterosexual AI in high HIV prevalence settings, we raised the core group size to 20% in the year 2010 coinciding with reported heterosexual AI prevalence outside of Africa and allowed the proportion of infection risk associated with AI to vary. Prevalence and incidence projections were made up to the year 2020 starting from a baseline value of zero exposure to AI transmission risk per sex act, progressively increasing exposure to 50% and 70% respectively. A 50% exposure to AI would result in HIV prevalence scaling up by 23% from the baseline values in year 2020. Increasing exposure to 70% was projected to increase HIV prevalence by 38% in year 2020. The HIV infection risks associated with AI are recognised and inform HIV policy for men who have sex with men, yet the same risks are ignored in HIV intervention programmes for heterosexuals. This study highlights the potential danger of increasing prevalence of heterosexual AI in settings with high HIV prevalence.

Increasing myxosporidiosis of cultured marine fish expedite us to initiate a project of investigating the myxosporean diversity of marine fish in China.

The parasite generally produced white and usually round plasmodia, up to 3 mm in diameter. Mature spores with a bifurcated equal caudal appendage were elongated ellipsoidal in frontal view, with blunted round anterior end, measuring 15.8 ± 0.9 (14.7–17.1) μm in total spore length, 6.9 ± 0.3 (6.1–7.1) μm in spore body length, 3.3 ± 0.2 (2.9–4.1) μm in width, 2.9 ± 0.1 (2.8–3.3) μm in thickness. The caudal appendages were 8.9 ± 0.3 (8.1–9.6) μm in length. Two equal pyriform polar capsules situated in the plane of the suture line at the anterior end of spores, measuring 2.7 ± 0.1 (2.6–2.9) μm in length and 1.2 ± 0.1 (0.9–1.3) μm in width and occupied about half of the spore body length. Polar filaments wounded in 3 to 4 coils and situated perpendicularly of the longitudinal axis of the polar capsules. Morphological comparisons showed that the present species was smaller than most of reported Henneguya species. Under ultrastructural observations, numerous projections could be seen in the plasmodial wall toward host tissue. The obtained partial 18S rDNA gene sequences, 1675 bp in length, did not match any of myxosporeans available in the GenBank, but was most similar to two Trachinotus-infecting Henneguya species (about 91%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the parasite clustered within the marine Henneguya-Myxobolus clade infecting fish of the order Perciformes. Therefore, our results strengthened again the contention that the host affinity was the strongest among evolutionary signals to infer the phylogeny of myxosporeans of the family Myxobolidae. However, spore morphology and tissue tropism could represent well phylogenetic relationships among species of myxobolid group of within a short evolutionary history.

However, pavement diseases (cracks, pitted surface, potholes and slurry) caused by the degradation of pavement performance have shortened the service life of the asphalt pavement and increased maintenance and repair costs, seriously affected the smooth flow of traffic and traffic safety. In this study, the sum of the different absorption peak areas of the asphalt binder spectroscopy was selected as a reference. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) quantitative analysis was carried out on the Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO) test with different aging cycles and Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV) test of the asphalt binder after aging. Based on the above analysis, the author tries to establish a reliable FT-IR quantitative analysis method. An FT-IR specimen which could be subjected to multiple freeze-thaw cycles could be prepared by the self-designed test sample preparation device. By carrying out the freeze-thaw cycle aging test of asphalt binder for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 times, combining FT-IR and Dynamic Shear Rheological (DSR) testing techniques, the author explored the relationship between chemical composition and rheological performance parameters of asphalt binder in cold region, which were based on the Levenberg-Macquarie method and test data of universal global optimization algorithm regression analysis. The results show that FT-IR can not only qualitatively analyze and study the structure and chemical composition of asphalt binder before and after aging on a micro level, but also quantitatively represent the changes of characteristic functional groups before and after aging of asphalt binder. It is feasible to calculate the absorption peak area for FT-IR quantitative analysis using the tangent at the lowest point on both sides of the spectral absorption peak as the calibration baseline. It is recommended to use the range of 2000–650 cm−1 absorption peak area sum as a benchmark for FT-IR quantitative analysis. The complex shear modulus of the asphalt binder shows a linear growth with the increase of freeze-thaw cycles, and phase angle of asphalt binder also shows a linear growth with the increase of Ln T.

Recent studies indicate that the immersion treatment of oysters in low salinity seawater (25 psu) in a tank for 8 days just after the implantation of nuclei has a positive effect on the production of high-quality pearls compared to the suspension of oysters in the sea (33 psu), so-called the “conventional method”, throughout two weeks of the post-operative care. However, a mechanism to increase the proportion of high-quality pearls in low salinity seawater is not fully known. In this study, we compared the periods from the implantation of nuclei to the completion of pearl-sac formation among implanted pearl oysters nursed in tanks containing low salinity (25 psu) or normal salinity (33 psu) seawater in tanks and in the sea (33 psu). After the immersion of the implanted oysters in 25 or 33 psu seawater in the tanks for 8 days, animals were suspended from a raft in an inland bay for the remainder of post-operative care period. The implanted oysters treated with the conventional method were all fastened from the raft throughout the post-operative care period. The oysters from the three treatments were 10% formalin-fixed at periodic intervals and thin slices of the nucleus-implanted part of body were prepared for the examination of the process of pearl-sac formation. The oysters suspended from the raft in the sea throughout the post-operative care period showed the shortest interval from the implantation to the pearl-sac formation, followed by those in normal salinity and low salinity treatments, respectively. This trend corresponds well to that in the proportion of high-quality pearls among the three treatments.

High content of recycled wood in the MPC particleboards (20 wt%) should be accomplished without compromising their mechanical strength and durability. In this study, the addition of 2% (v/v) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibre significantly reinforced flexural strength and fracture energy of particleboards, as high as 56.5% and 891.9%, respectively. The characteristics of PVA fibre determined the efficiency of reinforcement. At the same dosage, addition of shorter fibre (3 mm in length) presented higher strength, whereas incorporation of longer fibre (12 mm) improved fracture energy. Thinner fibre (35 µm in diameter) showed a larger increase in both flexural strength and fracture energy. Surface morphology of PVA fibre played an important role in determining the reinforcement mechanisms and reinforcing efficiency. Under stress, hydrophobic fibres (oil-treated) were pulled out from MPC matrix, whereas hydrophilic fibres (untreated) were ruptured. The former showed higher reinforcing efficiency for MPC particleboards. The fibre-reinforced particleboards maintained sufficient mechanical strength and dimensional stability after 24-h water immersion or 1-h heating at 100 °C, which fulfilled the standard requirements.

Then, the SSR method clusters the MSI into superpixels, whose shape and size can be adaptively adjusted according to the local structures. Since pixels within each superpixel have strong similarities, the SSR method simultaneously decomposes them on the transformed dictionary to generate the corresponding fractional abundance coefficient matrix, which can exploit the similarities within the superpixel to improve the sparse decomposition. Finally, the high resolution hyperspectral image can be reconstructed with the obtained fractional abundance coefficient matrix. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is superior to some well-known HSI super-resolution methods. © 2017","Hyperspectral image; Sparse representation; Super-resolution; Superpixel","Hyperspectral imaging; Image resolution; Optical resolving power; Spectroscopy; High spatial resolution; Multispectral images; Sparse decomposition; Sparse representation; Spatial resolution; Super pixels; Super resolution; Superresolution methods; Pixels",2-s2.0-85028339091

However, these models are not efficient enough for the image SR task. Firstly, we find that generic deep CNNs learn the low frequency features in all layers, which is redundant and leads to a slow training speed. Secondly, rectified linear unit (ReLU) only activate the positive response of the neuron, while the negative response is also worth being activated. In this paper, we propose a novel joint residual network (JRN) with three subnetworks, in which two shallow subnetworks aim to learn the low frequency information and one deep subnetwork aims to learn the high frequency information. In order to activate the negative part of the neurons and to preserve the sparsity of activation function, we propose a paired ReLUs activation scheme: one of the ReLUs is for positive activation and the other is for negative activation. The above two innovations lead to a much faster training, as well as a more efficient local structure. The proposed JRN achieves the same accuracy of a generic CNN with only 10.5% training iterations. The experiments on a wide range of images show that JRN is superior to the state-of-the-art methods both in accuracy and computational efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image restoration; Image super-resolution","Computational efficiency; Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image reconstruction; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Activation functions; Convolutional neural network; High-frequency informations; Image super resolutions; Local structure; Low frequency features; State-of-the-art methods; Training speed; Chemical activation",2-s2.0-85029211934

We use a natural dominance relation, generalised Lorenz dominance, used in welfare comparisons in economic theory. In some settings there may be additional information about preferences (for example, if there is policy statement that one distribution is preferred to another) and any dominance relation should respect such preferences. However, characterising this sort of conditional dominance relation (specifically, dominance with respect to the set of all symmetric increasing quasiconcave functions in line with given preference information) turns out to be computationally challenging. This challenge comes about because, through the assumption of symmetry, any one preference statement (“I prefer giving $100 to Jane and $110 to John over giving $150 to Jane and $90 to John”) implies a large number of other preference statements (“I prefer giving $110 to Jane and $100 to John over giving $150 to Jane and $90 to John”; “I prefer giving $100 to Jane and $110 to John over giving $90 to Jane and $150 to John”).

Replacing the lower level problem by its optimality condition yields a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC). Then, all strategic producers are jointly considered. Representing their interaction requires solving jointly the interrelated MPECs of all producers, which results in an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC).

In this paper, we consider ordered decision systems, where the preference order, a fundamental concept in dominance-based rough set approach, plays a critical role. In recent literature, based on the greedy hill climbing method, many heuristic attribute reduction algorithms are proposed by utilizing significance measures of attributes, and they are extended to deal with ordered decision systems. Unfortunately, they are often time-consuming, especially when applied to deal with large scale data sets with high dimensions. To reduce the complexity, a novel accelerator is introduced in heuristic algorithms from the perspectives of objects and criteria. Based on the new accelerator, the number of objects and the dimension of criteria are lessened thus making the accelerated algorithms faster than their original counterparts while maintaining the same reducts.

We then address a portfolio problem with two risky assets, and provide comparative statics with respect to the investor's risk aversion (framework of Ross (1981)).

It typically refers to forecasts up to 12 months ahead. Traditional forecasting models take into account univariate information extrapolating from the past, but cannot anticipate macroeconomic events, such as steep increases or declines in national economic activity. In practice this is countered by using managerial expert judgement, which is well known to suffer from various biases, is expensive and not scalable. This paper evaluates multiple approaches to improve tactical sales forecasting using macro-economic leading indicators. The proposed statistical forecast selects automatically both the type of leading indicators, as well as the order of the lead for each of the selected indicators. However as the future values of the leading indicators are unknown an additional uncertainty is introduced. This uncertainty is controlled in our methodology by restricting inputs to an unconditional forecasting setup. We compare this with the conditional setup, where future indicator values are assumed to be known and assess the theoretical loss of forecast accuracy. We also evaluate purely statistical model building against judgement aided models, where potential leading indicators are pre-filtered by experts, quantifying the accuracy-cost trade-off. The proposed framework improves on forecasting accuracy over established time series benchmarks, while providing useful insights about the key leading indicators. We evaluate the proposed approach on a real case study and find 18.8% accuracy gains over the current forecasting process. © 2017","Forecasting; LASSO; Leading indicators; Tactical planning; Variable selection","Economics; Sales; Scheduling; Supply chain management; Economic activities; Forecasting accuracy; LASSO; Leading indicators; Macroeconomic indicators; Statistical model buildings; Tactical planning; Variable selection; Forecasting",2-s2.0-85021969734

This study is based on the solving the linearized Vlasov equation and Maxwell's equations by employing the general method of characteristics, i.e., integrating along unperturbed orbits. Three types of plasma modes are confirmed: two of them are electrostatic waves with Landau damping, i.e., ion plasma waves (IPWs) and ion-acoustic waves (IAWs); and one mode is the transverse electromagnetic waves (light waves) without Landau damping. Our analysis shows that the Landau damping time for IAWs is negligible for most of wave lengths, and so these modes are heavily damped. Furthermore, Landau damping time for IPWs are considerable and these modes are of a great importance. Comparison of Landau damping in the case of a supra-thermal background distribution (confirmed by considering q<1 for spectral index) with the ones for a Maxwellian plasma in thermal equilibrium (confirmed by considering the asymptotic limit q→1) shows that the supra-thermal background makes the Landau damping more effective and prominent and also shifts the normal modes to the regions with less wave numbers.

These zones can be useful to improve natural resource management. The aim of this work was to develop a statistical protocol for multivariate zoning at regional scales. A zoning of Córdoba, Argentina, was generated using data from a sample of 355 sites involving edaphic and climatic data (pH, TN, TOC, Na, K, CEC, Cu, Clay, Sand, WHC, elevation, annual precipitation and mean temperature). We proposed a two-step algorithm that considers the spatial correlation of these variables in a clustering of sites. The protocol was run after modeling the spatial pattern of each soil variable to adapt information from different sources and formats to a fine grid. In the first step of the protocol, MULTISPATI-PCA, an extension of the principal component analysis that considers the spatial co-variability between variables, was used to obtain linear combinations of original data. In the second step, such synthetic variables (spatial principal components) were used as input of the fuzzy k-mean clustering method to delineate homogeneous zones. The number of clusters was established by internal validation indices. The use of MULlTISPATI-PCA was compared with the more conventional and non-spatial PCA.

Spearman rank correlation, Principal Component Analysis, and Mann-Kendall trend tests were applied to long-term time series of water quality data during the period 1990–2015 in order to investigate the relationships between water quality parameters and the main factors controlling them. Results show that air temperature, considered as a proxy of climatic change, has a significant impact, in particular in the Adige and Ebro: positive trends of water temperature and negative of dissolved oxygen are correlated with upward trends of air temperatures. The aquatic ecosystems of these rivers are, therefore, experiencing a reduction in oxygen, which may exacerbate in the future given the projected further increase in temperature. Furthermore, monthly streamflow has been shown to reduce in the Ebro, thereby reducing the beneficial effect of dilution, which appears evident from the observed upward patterns of chloride concentrations and electrical conductivity. Upward trends of chloride and biological oxygen demand in the Adige and Sava, and of phosphate in the Adige appears to be related to increasing human population density, whereas phosphates in the Sava and biological oxygen demand in the Ebro are highly correlated with agricultural land use, considered as a proxy of the impact of agricultural practises.

However, little is known about the controlling factors of pedodiversity, especially in mountain regions with a highly heterogeneous environment. This paper analyzed pedodiversity (soil taxa diversity) and the influencing factors in Taihang Mountain region in China. The richness (S), Menhinick's index (M), Shannon index (H), maximum Shannon index (Hmax) and evenness index (E) were used to explain pedodiversity in the study area. The influences of natural factors (including elevation, slope gradient, precipitation and temperature) and anthropogenic factors (including population density and percentage of farmland) were analyzed using partial correlation analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. The results showed that for the 101 counties in Taihang Mountain, average H was 1.69, which suggested a relatively low pedodiversity (normal H range is 1.5–3.5, and rarely exceeds 4.5) in the study area. Logarithmic normal distribution had the best fit for the abundance distribution model, indicating that intermediate abundance of soil type was most common. The best fit Logarithmic function was for the relationship between richness and area. Soil taxa richness increased significantly for areas less than 1000 km2, but increased gradually for areas larger than 1000 km2. This suggested that 1000 km2 was the breakthrough point on the richness-area curve, and that the effect of area on pedodiversity could be negligible for regions larger than 1000 km2. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the influence of these factors on pedodiversity decreased in the order of: elevation &gt; percent farmland &gt; slope gradient &gt; population density &gt; precipitation. This suggested that elevation and farming had the highest effect on pedodiversity. The study provided further insight into pedodiversity in mountain regions, which is critical for the protection of soil resources and pedodiversity. © 2017","Anthropogenic factor; Canonical correspondence analysis; Heterogeneous environment; Pedodiversity; Shannon index","Correlation methods; Farms; Landforms; Normal distribution; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Soils; Anthropogenic factors; Canonical Correspondence Analysis; Heterogeneous environments; Pedodiversity; Shannon index; Factor analysis; agricultural land; anthropogenic effect; index method; mountain region; population density; precipitation (climatology); soil management; soil type; species richness; China; Taihang Mountains",2-s2.0-85030095309

At monthly intervals, some agents migrate and these migratory acts change the social network by turning within-nonmigrant connections to between-migrant-nonmigrant connections, turning local connections to nonlocal connections, and adding among-migrant connections. In turn, the changing social network structure updates migratory propensities of those well-connected nonmigrants who become more likely to move. These two processes iterate over time. Using a core–periphery method developed from the k-core decomposition method, we identify and quantify the network structural changes and map these changes with the migration acceleration patterns.

This paper addresses vulnerabilities created by fragmented policy measures between rural development, urban and irrigation water supply and downstream consequences for people and wildlife. Perpetuating narrowly technocentric approaches to resource exploitation is likely only to compound emerging problems. Alternatively, restoration or innovation of groundwater recharge practices, particularly in the upper catchment, can represent a proven, ecosystem-based approach to resource regeneration with linked beneficial socio-ecological benefits. Hybridising an ecosystem-based approach with engineered methods can simultaneously increase the security of rural livelihoods, piped urban and irrigation supplies, and the vitality of river ecosystems and their services to beneficiaries. A renewed policy focus on local-scale water recharge practices balancing water extraction technologies is consistent with emerging Rajasthani policies, particularly Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan (‘water self-reliance mission’). Policy reform emphasising recharge can contribute to water security and yield socio-economic outcomes through a systemic understanding of how the water system functions, and by connecting goals and budgets across multiple, currently fragmented policy areas. The underpinning principles of this necessary paradigm shift are proven and have wider geographic relevance, though context-specific research is required to underpin robust policy and practical implementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Banas; Bisalpur; Community-based recharge; Ecosystem services; Vulnerability; Water resources","Budget control; Climate change; Developing countries; Ecology; Ecosystems; Extraction; Flood control; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Population statistics; Recharging (underground waters); Regional planning; River diversion; Runoff; Rural areas; Urban growth; Water supply; Banas; Bisalpur; Community-based; Ecosystem services; Vulnerability; Water resources; ground water; ecosystem service; governance approach; landscape; recharge; semiarid region; vulnerability; water management; water resource; Article; case study; catchment; climate change; controlled study; environmental policy; feasibility study; India; irrigation (agriculture); landscape; limit of quantitation; population growth; priority journal; rural area; urban area; water security; water supply; Banas River; Bisalpur Dam; India; Rajasthan",2-s2.0-85028838330

However, it only takes into account the information of mean values (first moment) in coarse-graining procedure. Then generalized multiscale entropy (MSEn) considering higher moments to coarse-grain a time series was proposed and MSEσ2 has been implemented. However, the MSEσ2 sometimes may yield an imprecise estimation of entropy or undefined entropy, and reduce statistical reliability of sample entropy estimation as scale factor increases. For this purpose, we developed the refined model, RMSEσ2, to improve MSEσ2. Simulations on both white noise and 1∕f noise show that RMSEσ2 provides higher entropy reliability and reduces the occurrence of undefined entropy, especially suitable for short time series. Besides, we discuss the effect on RMSEσ2 analysis from outliers, data loss and other concepts in signal processing. We apply the proposed model to evaluate the complexity of heartbeat interval time series derived from healthy young and elderly subjects, patients with congestive heart failure and patients with atrial fibrillation respectively, compared to several popular complexity metrics. The results demonstrate that RMSEσ2 measured complexity (a) decreases with aging and diseases, and (b) gives significant discrimination between different physiological/pathological states, which may facilitate clinical application. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Complexity; Data loss; Heart rate; Multiscale entropy; Outlier","Physiology; Signal analysis; Signal processing; Statistics; Time series; White noise; Complexity; Data loss; Heart rates; Multi-scale entropies; Outlier; Entropy",2-s2.0-85029520880

Secondly, the adaptive network is formulated by rewiring the links. Theoretical analysis is developed to show that the population in NGBA will eventually reach global consensus on either A or B. Numerical simulation results show that the larger strength of biased assimilation on both words, the slower convergence speed, while larger strength of biased assimilation on only one word can slightly accelerate the convergence; larger population size can make the rate of convergence slower to a large extent when it increases from a relatively small size, while such effect becomes minor when the population size is large; the behavior of adaptively reconnecting the existing links can greatly accelerate the rate of convergence especially on the sparse connected network. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive network topology; Biased assimilation; Collective behavior; Two-word naming game","Approximation theory; Adaptive networks; Biased assimilation; Collective behavior; Connected networks; Convergence speed; Population sizes; Rate of convergence; Two-word naming game; Population statistics",2-s2.0-85028512481

The algorithm offers the possibility to use different metrics and summary statistics representative of the data to carry out Bayesian inference. The efficacy of the algorithm in structural dynamics is demonstrated through three different illustrative examples of nonlinear system identification: cubic and cubic-quintic models, the Bouc-Wen model and the Duffing oscillator.

Stressful life events are an important research focus and a psychometrically valid measure could provide useful clinical information. The purpose of the study was to develop a reliable and valid measurement of stressful life events and to assess its reliability and validity using established measures of social support, stress, depression, anxiety and maternal and child health. Methods The authors used an adaptation from the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) to describe the prevalence of life events; they developed a 4-factor stressful life events subscales and used Medical Outcomes Social Support Scale, Social Support Scale, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and 14 general health items for validity analysis. Analyses were performed with descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, Spearman's rho, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon 2-sample test. Results The 4-factor stressful life events subscales showed acceptable reliability. The resulting subscale scores were significantly associated with established measures of social support, depression, anxiety, stress, and caregiver health indicators. Limitations The study presented a number of limitations in terms of design and recall bias.

Measurements of coupling or correlation are very useful to study the difference of brain activities. In this study, EEG signals were collected from ten subjects under two conditions, i.e. eyes closed state and idle with eyes open. We propose a nonlinear algorithm, symbolic joint entropy, to compare the coupling strength among the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes and between two different states. Instead of decomposing the EEG into different frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, gamma etc.), the novel algorithm is to investigate the coupling from the entire spectrum of brain wave activities above 4Hz. The coupling coefficients in two states with different time delay steps are compared and the group statistics are presented as well. We find that the coupling coefficient of eyes open state with delay consistently lower than that of eyes close state across the group except for one subject, whereas the results without delay are not consistent. The differences between two brain states with non-zero delay can reveal the intrinsic inter-region coupling better. We also use the well-known Hénon map data to validate the algorithm proposed in this paper.

Analytical formulas for the cross-spectral density matrix elements of a radially polarized MCGSM beam in non-Kolmogorov turbulence are derived. Numerical results show that lattice-like intensity pattern of the beam, which keeps propagation-invariant in free space, is destroyed by the turbulence when it passes at sufficiently large distances from the source.

This case mimicks conditions of a pulverized coal flame stabilized by hot products such as found in industrial furnaces. Particles are heated up by the hot gases and devolatilize, followed by volatile combustion in the gas phase. The carrier-phase DNS resolves all relevant scales of the fluid phase except the boundary layers around individual particles. The simulation results are assessed in terms of instantaneous contour plots of relevant quantities, spatially averaged statistics, scatter plots and (pseudo-)flamelets. The analysis provides insight into the mechanisms of solid particle ignition and burning stabilized by hot combustion products, as well as the flame structure and combustion mode. It is shown that ignition initially occurs at very lean conditions when particles are entrained in the hot gases. Subsequently volatile combustion proceeds in non-premixed as well as premixed combustion modes, characterized by means of the flame index, with an overall higher heat release in non-premixed zones. At late times two flames can be clearly distinguished, an upper flame burning into the air carrying the particles and a lower flame burning into the lean products. The latter flame shows a pure non-premixed behavior, while the former illustrates a complex flame structure with both premixed and non-premixed modes, as well as flame quenching.

(1977) derived a nonlinear differential equation to determine the spread of innovations within a social network across space and time. This model depends upon the imitators and the innovators within the social system, where the imitators respond to internal influences, whilst the innovators react to external factors. Here, this differential equation is applied to simulate the uptake of a low-carbon technology (LCT) within a real local electricity network that is situated in the UK. This network comprises of many households that are assigned to certain feeders. Firstly, travelling wave solutions of Haynes’ model are used to predict adoption times as a function of the imitation and innovation influences. Then, the grid that represents the electricity network is created so that the finite element method (FEM) can be implemented. Next, innovation diffusion is modelled with Haynes’ equation and the FEM, where varying magnitudes of the internal and external pressures are imposed.

These costs should be compared to the potential costs resulting from ANS transfer between the basin, a significant portion of which would be costs to recreational fisheries. In this study, a recreational behavior model is developed for sport anglers in an eight-state region. It models how angler behavior would change in response to potential changes in fishing quality resulting from ANS transfer. The model also calculates the potential loss in net economic value that anglers enjoy from the fishery. The model is estimated based on data on trips taken by anglers (travel cost data) and on angler statements about how they would respond to changes in fishing quality (contingent behavior data). The model shows that the benefit to recreational anglers from re-establishing hydrologic separation exceeds the costs only if the anticipated impacts of ANS transfer on sport fish catch rates are large and widespread. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Asian Carp; Great Lakes; Invasive species; Recreational fishing; Travel cost model","cost analysis; cyprinid; fishing; hydrology; invasive species; outdoor recreation; recreational activity; river basin; sport fishing; travel time; waterway transport; behavior; carp; fishery; fishing; invasive species; lake; Mississippi; nonhuman; Ohio; river basin; sport; travel; Chicago; Illinois; Mississippi River; Ohio River; United States; Cyprinidae",2-s2.0-85032363528

Analogously, probabilistic decision making involves choices between options whose consequences differ in relation to their probability of receiving. In Economics, the expected utility theory (EUT) and the discounted utility theory (DUT) are traditionally accepted normative models for describing, respectively, probabilistic and intertemporal decision making. A large number of experiments confirmed that the linearity assumed by the EUT does not explain some observed behaviors, as nonlinear preference, risk-seeking and loss aversion. That observation led to the development of new theoretical models, called non-expected utility theories (NEUT), which include a nonlinear transformation of the probability scale. An essential feature of the so-called preference function of these theories is that the probabilities are transformed by decision weights by means of a (cumulative) probability weighting function, w(p). We obtain in this article a generalized function for the probabilistic discount process. This function has as particular cases mathematical forms already consecrated in the literature, including discount models that consider effects of psychophysical perception. We also propose a new generalized function for the functional form of w. The limiting cases of this function encompass some parametric forms already proposed in the literature. Far beyond a mere generalization, our function allows the interpretation of probabilistic decision making theories based on the assumption that individuals behave similarly in the face of probabilities and delays and is supported by phenomenological models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Complex systems; Cumulative probability weighting function; Generalized functions; Prospect theory; Utility theory","Decision making; Equipment testing; Functions; Large scale systems; Mathematical transformations; Probability; Risk perception; Cumulative probabilities; Expected utility theory; Generalized functions; Non-linear transformations; Phenomenological models; Probabilistic decision making; Prospect theory; Utility theory; Decision theory",2-s2.0-85028508135

To test associations between phthalate exposures, estimated from urinary phthalate metabolites, and insulin resistance, β-cell function and glucose control. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, nationally representative study; the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS, 2009–2011). Participants under the age of 12, those with diabetes, who were pregnant or who had not fasted overnight were excluded. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels were measured in a subset of participants, and urine was collected for creatinine and phthalate metabolites. We tested associations between these variables using linear regression analysis. Of 4437 participants (12–79 years old), 2119 had fasting glucose measurements and at least one phthalate metabolite above detection limits. MBzP, MCPP, MEHP, MEHHP, MiBP, and the sum of DEHP metabolites were positively associated with increased HbA1C (p &lt; 0.05). DEHP metabolites were positively associated with increased fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and HOMA-β. An interquartile increase in the sum of log transformed DEHP metabolites was associated with increases in HOMA-IR and HOMA-β of 0.15 (95% CI 0.04, 0.26) and 10.24 (95% CI 3.71, 16.77) respectively. Increased concentrations of all measured phthalate metabolites were associated with reduced blood glucose control.

Such data are often multi-scale and non-stationary, leading to a poor accuracy of the resulting regression models and therefore to results with moderate reliability. To deal with this issue, the present paper introduces the EMD-regression methodology consisting in applying the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm on data series and then using the resulting components in regression models. The proposed methodology presents a number of advantages. First, it accounts of the issues of non-stationarity associated to the data series. Second, this approach acts as a scan for the relationship between a response variable and the predictors at different time scales, providing new insights about this relationship. To illustrate the proposed methodology it is applied to study the relationship between weather and cardiovascular mortality in Montreal, Canada. The results shed new knowledge concerning the studied relationship. For instance, they show that the humidity can cause excess mortality at the monthly time scale, which is a scale not visible in classical models. A comparison is also conducted with state of the art methods which are the generalized additive models and distributed lag models, both widely used in weather-related health studies. The comparison shows that EMD-regression achieves better prediction performances and provides more details than classical models concerning the relationship. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cardiovascular mortality; Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Environmental epidemiology; Lasso; Regression; Weather-related health","Signal processing; Time series analysis; Cardiovascular mortality; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Environmental epidemiology; Lasso; Regression; Regression analysis; algorithm; cardiovascular disease; epidemiology; mortality; numerical model; regression analysis; Article; Canada; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; climate change; controlled study; empirical mode decomposition algorithm; empirical mode decomposition regression; greenhouse effect; human; humidity; lasso regression; methodology; priority journal; regression analysis; summer; temperature; weather; winter; Canada; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]",2-s2.0-85028774225

This paper investigates the local variance and the interconnection between the stock, gold, oil, Forex and the implied volatility markets in the time/frequency domains using the wavelet methodology, including the wavelet power spectrum, the wavelet squared coherence and phase difference, the wavelet multiple correlation and cross-correlation. The univariate analysis reveals that, in some crisis periods, underlying asset markets present the same pattern in terms of the wavelet power spectrum indicating high volatility for the medium scale, and that for the other market stress periods, volatility behaves differently. Moreover, unlike the underlying asset markets, the implied volatility markets are characterized by high power regions across the entire period, even in the absence of economic events. Bivariate results show a bidirectional relationship between the underlying assets and their corresponding implied volatility indexes, and a steady co-movement between the stock index and its corresponding fear index. Multiple correlation analysis indicates a strong correlation between markets at high scales with evidence of a nearly perfect integration for a period longer than a year. In addition, the hedging strategies based on the volatility index lead to an increase in portfolio correlation. On the other hand, the results from multiple cross-correlations reveal that the lead–lag effect starts from the medium scale and that the VIX (stock market volatility index) index is the potential leader or follower of the other markets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fear indexes; Financial crisis; Global macro markets; Wavelet coherence; Wavelet multiple correlation and cross correlation","Economics; Finance; Financial markets; Investments; Power spectrum; Wavelet analysis; Cross correlations; Fear indexes; Financial crisis; Multiple correlation; Stock market volatility; Univariate analysis; Wavelet coherences; Wavelet power spectra; Commerce",2-s2.0-85029486804

The obtained results show that multifractals exist in both types of EEG signals. Particularly, it was found that the degree of fractal is more pronounced in short variations of normal EEG signals than in short variations of EEG signals with seizure free intervals. In contrary, it is more pronounced in long variations of EEG signals with seizure free intervals than in normal EEG signals. Importantly, both parametric and nonparametric statistical tests show strong evidence that estimated GHEs of normal EEG signals are statistically and significantly different from those with seizure free intervals.

A wide range of experimental results for 12 hydraulic conditions with different Froude numbers (0.375 to 1.71) and flow depths (20.3 to 201.5 mm) were used to validate the derived shear stress distribution.

For example, in Big Data problems where a set of different computational tasks is divided between a set of computers each with its own resources, or between employees and employers where both parties are ranked, the employees by their fitness and the employers by their package benefits. The allocation process can be viewed as a repeated game where in each iteration the strategy is decided by a meta-rule, based on the ranks of both parties and the results of the previous games. We show the existence of a phase transition between an absorbing state, where all demands are satisfied, and an active one where part of the demands are always left unsatisfied. The phase transition is governed by the ratio between supplies and demand. In a job allocation problem we find positive correlation between the rank of the workers and the rank of the factories; higher rank workers are usually allocated to higher ranked factories. These all suggest global emergent properties stemming from local variables. To demonstrate the global versus local relations, we introduce a local inertial force that increases the rank of employees in proportion to their persistence time in the same factory. We show that such a local force induces non trivial global effects, mostly to benefit the lower ranked employees. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Game theory; KPR; Non equilibrium phase transition; Resource allocation","Computation theory; Game theory; Industrial relations; Resource allocation; Allocation process; Computational task; Demand and supply; Emergent property; Nonequilibrium phase transitions; Persistence time; Positive correlations; Resource allocation problem; Big data",2-s2.0-85028988087

Objectives To quantify the associations between daily temperature and clinical visits due to cardiovascular and/or respiratory disease in rural villages in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China over 2012–2015. Methods Daily data on clinical visits and weather conditions were collated from 203 villages. A quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the associations between daily temperature and clinical visits up to 28 days, after controlling for potential confounders. Results Over three years, 158,733 and 1,272,212 clinical visits were recorded for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively. Both low and high temperatures were associated with an increased risk of clinical visits for cardiovascular-related conditions, whereas only low temperatures were associated with increased clinical visits related to respiratory illness. The cold effect on cardiovascular visits appeared at the lag 6th day and persisted until the 22nd day, resulting in a cumulative relative risk (RR) 1.55 (95% CI: 1.26–1.92), compared with the minimum-clinical visit temperature. The cold effect on respiratory visits appeared immediately and lasted over the lag 0–28 days, with a cumulative RR 2.96 (2.74–3.21). Suboptimal temperature accounted for approximately 13% and 26% of clinic visits due to cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, respectively, with the majority of cases attributable to moderate – rather than extreme – cold temperature. Conclusions In rural settings, sub-optimal temperatures explained nearly one quarter of all clinical visits due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Although extreme cold temperature had a stronger, more immediate, prolonged effect on respiratory disease than for cardiovascular disease, moderately cold temperatures accounted for most of the overall burden of clinical visits. © 2017","Ambient temperature; Cardio-respiratory diseases; Distributed lag non-linear model; Rural China","Climate change; Cold effects; Diseases; Nonlinear systems; Pulmonary diseases; Rural areas; Temperature; Cardio-vascular disease; Limited information; Non-linear model; Optimal temperature; Poisson regression; Respiratory disorders; Respiratory illness; Rural chinas; Atmospheric temperature",2-s2.0-85028350790

At the same time, obtaining proper long-term instrumental oxygen records is difficult, thus reducing the possibility of recording long-term changes in oxygen shifts that can be related with climate or human influence. Varved lake sediments provide the better time frame to study this phenomenon at high resolution. We tracked the oxic/anoxic shifts of the varved Lake Montcortès since 1500 CE, and tried to recognise anthropogenic and climatic influences combining biological and geochemical proxies. Four main scenarios emerged: 1) years with abrupt sediment inputs (A); 2) years with outstanding mixing and oxygenation of the water column (B); 3) years with strong stratification, anoxia, intense sulfur bacterial activity and increased biomass production (C); 4) years with stratification and anoxia, but relatively less biomass production (D). In line with current limnologic trends, high supra-annual variability in the occurrence of oxygenation events was observed. Interestingly, at least 45.3% of the years were mixing years and, like the meromictic ones, were mostly clustered into groups of consecutive years, thus alternating years of monomixis with years of meromixis. Most years of D belong to the period 1500–1820 CE, when human activities were the most intense. Most years of A belonged to the climatic unstable period of 1850–1899 CE. Years of B were irregularly distributed but were best represented in the period 1820–1849 CE. Most years of C belonged to the 20th century. More than 90% of the years with climatic instrumental records belonged to B and C. Current climate warming seems to be taking control over the oxygenation capacity of the lake, especially since the second half of the 20th century.

We computed a rolling-window wavelet correlation for the market returns and applied a non-linear Granger causality test to the wavelet decomposition coefficients of these stock market returns. Our results show that the correlation is stronger for the crisis than for the pre-crisis period. The stock market indices from Portugal, Italy and Spain were more interconnected among themselves during the crisis than with the SPEURO. The stock market from Portugal is the most sensitive and vulnerable PIIGS member, whereas the stock market from Greece tends to move away from the European benchmark market since the 2008 financial crisis till 2011. The non-linear causality test indicates that in the first three wavelet scales (intraweek, weekly and fortnightly) the number of uni-directional and bi-directional causalities is greater during the crisis than in the pre-crisis period, because of financial contagion. Furthermore, the causality analysis shows that the direction of the Granger cause–effect for the pre-crisis and crisis periods is not invariant in the considered time-scales, and that the causality directions among the studied stock markets do not seem to have a preferential direction.

Riparian tree planting is a practical climate change mitigation measure, but it is often unclear where to focus effort for maximum benefit. Recent developments in data collection, monitoring and statistical methods have facilitated the development of increasingly sophisticated river temperature models capable of predicting spatial variability at large scales appropriate to management. In parallel, improvements in temporal river temperature models have increased the accuracy of temperature predictions at individual sites. This study developed a novel large scale spatio-temporal model of maximum daily river temperature (Twmax) for Scotland that predicts variability in both river temperature and climate sensitivity. Twmax was modelled as a linear function of maximum daily air temperature (Tamax), with the slope and intercept allowed to vary as a smooth function of day of the year (DoY) and further modified by landscape covariates including elevation, channel orientation and riparian woodland. Spatial correlation in Twmax was modelled at two scales; (1) river network (2) regional. Temporal correlation was addressed through an autoregressive (AR1) error structure for observations within sites. Additional site level variability was modelled with random effects. The resulting model was used to map (1) spatial variability in predicted Twmax under current (but extreme) climate conditions (2) the sensitivity of rivers to climate variability and (3) the effects of riparian tree planting. These visualisations provide innovative tools for informing fisheries and land-use management under current and future climate. © 2017","Climate sensitivity; Fisheries management; Generalized additive mixed model; Maximum river temperature; Spatio-temporal model","Climate models; Fisheries; Forestry; Land use; Random processes; Reforestation; Rivers; Climate sensitivity; Fisheries management; Mixed modeling; River temperature; Spatio-temporal models; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; climate variation; fishery management; numerical model; river water; salmonid fishery; spatiotemporal analysis; water temperature; air temperature; Article; catchment; climate change; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; land use; landscape; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; quality control; riparian ecosystem; riparian species; river ecosystem; Salmo salar; Scotland; sensitivity analysis; statistical model; Scotland; United Kingdom; Salmo salar",2-s2.0-85029120759

To attack this problem, a generalized quantification function is proposed for community in weighted networks, which provides a framework that unifies several well-known measures. Then, we prove that the trace optimization of the proposed measure is equivalent with the objective functions of algorithms such as nonnegative matrix factorization, kernel K-means as well as spectral clustering. It serves as the theoretical foundation for designing algorithms for community detection. On the second issue, a semi-supervised spectral clustering algorithm is developed by exploring the equivalence relation via combining the nonnegative matrix factorization and spectral clustering. Different from the traditional semi-supervised algorithms, the partial supervision is integrated into the objective of the spectral algorithm.

In order to effectively measure the running status of China's consumer market and analyze the dynamic evolution characteristics of regional economic consumption in China, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random matrix are proposed to quantitatively describe the evolution relationship of provincial and regional CPI in China. Based on the provincial data of China's CPI, system risk entropy, synchronicity ratio, stability and market induction are introduced to characterize the market evolution characteristics, and analyze the regional differences and synchronicity of the consumer price index of China and evaluate the development of China's consumer market. The results show that the average system risk entropy of China's consumer market for the period 2000–2015 is 0.1646, fluctuating in the range of 0.0512–0.3288, indicating a higher system risk of China's consumer market. The system risk of China's consumer market is still higher than the average in nearly 15 years. Fluctuating in the range of 0.3871–0.9355, the market synchronicity ratio has a mean of 0.7225, which reveals a higher market consistency level, a rising trend in fluctuation but an increasing tendency in the degree of unbalanced regional development. Evolution results of market induction demonstrate that the evolution of China's consumer market has experienced four stages. The market induction has possessed a sustained growth trend since August 2010. Scenario analysis indicates that the key to effectively improve China's consumer market system is to solve the lagging issue of China's western region market on the basis of controlling and resolving of the existing risk. © 2017","China's consumer market; CPI; Market induction; Stability; Synchronicity ratio; System risk entropy","Convergence of numerical methods; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Entropy; Regional planning; Risk assessment; Risk perception; System stability; Comprehensive indices; Consumer market; Consumer price index; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Regional development; Regional differences; Synchronicity ratio; System risk; Commerce",2-s2.0-85028998452

By reducing the sample size, this intermittent activity becomes increasingly apparent and can be routinely observed through small-scale mechanical testing. In some cases, the intermittent activity was shown to exhibit aspects of scale-free behavior, prompting a paradigm shift away from traditional microstructure-dependent unit mechanisms that may be associated with a well-defined length and stress scale.

When the state space is finite, the latter consists in finding an eigenpair (u,λ) solution of T(u)=λe+u, where T:Rn→Rn is the Shapley (or dynamic programming) operator, λ is a scalar, e is the unit vector, and u∈Rn. The scalar λ yields the mean payoff per time unit, and the vector u, called bias, allows one to determine optimal stationary strategies in the mean-payoff game. The existence of the eigenpair (u,λ) is generally related to ergodicity conditions. A basic issue is to understand for which classes of games the bias vector is unique (up to an additive constant). In this paper, we consider perfect-information zero-sum stochastic games with finite state and action spaces, thinking of the transition payments as variable parameters, transition probabilities being fixed. We show that the bias vector, thought of as a function of the transition payments, is generically unique (up to an additive constant). The proof uses techniques of nonlinear Perron–Frobenius theory.

Within this context, energy policy-makers face the need to move from economy- to sustainability-oriented schemes. Beyond the integration of the sustainability concept into energy policies through the implementation of techno-economic, environmental and/or social restrictions, other approaches propose the use of externalities –based on life-cycle emissions– to deeply take into account sustainability in the design of the future energy system. In this sense, this work evaluates the consequences of internalising socio-environmental externalities associated with power generation. Besides the calculation of external costs of power generation technologies and their implementation in an energy systems optimisation model for Spain, the life-cycle consequences of this internalisation are explored. This involves the prospective analysis of the evolution of the sustainability indicators on which the externalities are founded, i.e. climate change and human health. For the first time, this is done by endogenously integrating the life-cycle indicators into the energy systems optimisation model. The results show that the internalisation of externalities highly influences the evolution of the electricity production mix as well as the corresponding life-cycle profile, hastening the decarbonisation of the power generation system and thus leading to a significant decrease in life-cycle impacts. This effect is observed both when internalising only climate change externalities and when internalising additionally human health external costs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Electricity; Energy systems modelling; Externalities; Human health; Life cycle assessment","Climate change; Economics; Electricity; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Health; Optimization; Sustainable development; Energy systems; Energy systems optimisation; Externalities; Human health; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Power generation systems; Power generation technology; Sustainability indicators; Life cycle",2-s2.0-85028337692

In general, such problems pose issues for standard finite difference solvers, as the inherent discontinuity in the solution results in erroneous derivative information wherever the stencils straddle the given interface. Here, however, the recently proposed Correction Function Method (CFM) is used, in which correction terms are computed from the interface conditions, and added to affected nodes to compensate for the discontinuity. In contrast to existing methods, these corrections are not simply defined at affected nodes, but rather generalized to a continuous function within a small region surrounding the interface. As a result, the correction function may be defined in terms of its own governing partial differential equation (PDE) which may be solved, in principle, to arbitrary order of accuracy. The resulting scheme is not only arbitrarily high order, but also robust, having already seen application to Poisson problems and the heat equation. By extending the CFM to this new class of PDEs, the treatment of wave interface discontinuities in homogeneous media becomes possible. This allows, for example, for the straightforward treatment of infinitesimal source terms and sharp boundaries, free of staircasing errors. Additionally, new modifications to the CFM are derived, allowing compatibility with explicit multi-step methods, such as Runge–Kutta (RK4), without a reduction in accuracy. These results are then verified through numerous numerical experiments in one and two spatial dimensions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Correction function method; High order; Immersed method; Interface jump; Maxwell's equations; Wave equation",,2-s2.0-85032198496

Then, the soft thresholding technique is applied to the irrelevant modes, and the roughness penalty technique is applied to the relevant modes to extract as much information as possible.

Traditional methods, such like stochastic resonance (SR), which using noise to enhance weak signals instead of suppressing noise, failed in chaotic background. Neural network, which use reference sequence to estimate and reconstruct the background noise, failed in white Gaussian noise. To solve these problems, a novel weak signal detection method aimed at the problem of detecting impact signal buried under heavy chaotic and Gaussian background noise is proposed. First, the proposed method obtains the virtual reference sequence by constructing the Hankel data matrix. Then an M-order optimal FIR filter is designed, which can minimize the output power of background noise and pass the weak periodic signal undistorted. Finally, detection and reconstruction of the weak periodic signal are achieved from the output SBNR (signal to background noise ratio).

The only existing sources identifying the by artillery destroyed landscape are maps indicating destruction at the level of administrative communities, based on war damage inventories. Even a century after the war, there is a need to gain more detail in the historical destruction at a landscape or parcel scale. Unlike in neighboring country France, the Belgian authorities allowed a complete repopulation of the front zone, which results in an ongoing confrontation between ground workers (farmers, construction workers, archaeologists, etc.), the war's heritage (trenches, bunkers, graves, etc.) and its dangers (unexploded ordnances, UXO). Metal shrapnel and the high rate of unexploded shells (up to 30% of the fired projectiles) are typical remnants of this trench warfare. The localization of these phenomena is also useful to simulate the extent of the war's environmental impact and the intensity of possible UXO-finds. To inventorize destruction and the related metal shrapnel pollution (MSP), we propose a new mapping method based on a sampling strategy to digitize shelling densities, derived from historical aerial photographs. This data source allows us to characterize almost every single parcel in this mainly agricultural area. By classifying the derived shelling densities, destruction classes can be distinguished to describe the impact on landscape and soil archive. The translation of the destruction map into a map indicating the level of buried metal shrapnel, was possible due to the direct relation between shells, metal shrapnel and shell holes. A validation with the buried metal objects was performed with metal parameters derived from electromagnetic induction field surveys. These scan results indicated a strong relation between shelling densities and the buried metal clutter.

The phases of the complex amplitudes calculated from interferometric holograms are disturbed by speckle noise, thus reliable unwrapping results are difficult to be obtained. Most of existing unwrapping algorithms implement denoising operations first to obtain noise-free phases and then conduct phase unwrapping pixel by pixel. This approach is sensitive to spikes and prone to unreliable results in practice. In this paper, a robust unwrapping algorithm based on the non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) is developed. The multiscale and directional decomposition of NSCT enhances the boundary between adjacent phase levels and henceforth the influence of local noise can be eliminated in the transform domain. The wrapped phase map is segmented into several regions corresponding to different phase levels. Finally, an unwrapped phase map is obtained by elevating the phases of a whole segment instead of individual pixels to avoid unwrapping errors caused by local spikes. This algorithm is suitable for dealing with complex and noisy wavefronts. Its universality and superiority in the digital holographic interferometry have been demonstrated by both numerical analysis and practical experiments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Contourlet; Digital holography; Interferometry; Phase unwrapping; Speckle","Holograms; Holography; Image enhancement; Interferometry; Pixels; Speckle; Contourlets; Digital holographic interferometry; Digital holography; Directional decomposition; Holographic measurement; Non subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT); Non-sub-sampled contourlet transforms; Phase unwrapping; Holographic interferometry",2-s2.0-85030868275

The heterogeneity of networks’ degree may be an effective mechanism for harvesting the cooperation expectation in many cases, however, we find that heterogeneity does not definitely mean the high frequency of cooperators in a population under group learning rules.

Traditional approaches, such as runoff plots and water weirs in a watershed, provide reliable spatially averaged soil erosion data but cannot validate process-based erosion prediction models for dynamic soil erosion evaluation. Erosion tracer techniques are capable of quantitatively determining spatial distribution of soil erosion. Ideal tracers are expected to provide highly contrasting values compared with background ones, and be analyzed efficiently and acquired cost-effectively. In this laboratory study, magnetite powder was selected as an erosion tracer to test. The tracer was implanted into loessial soils from the Loess Plateau using a wet soil-tracer mixing procedure. The effectiveness of magnetite powder as an erosion tracer was evaluated in aspects of basic magnetic features between the tracer and soils, distribution under different soil aggregate sizes, mobility along soil profiles, and detachment of tracer-labeled loessial soils by shallow surface flow along a slope. Results showed that magnetite powder was bound tightly to loessial soil aggregates, with no noticeable vertical mobility under long-term leaching conditions, and almost synchronous detachment with the eroded soils. Furthermore, the tracer is an inexpensive tracer (approximately 0.08 US$·kg− 1), which has higher magnetic susceptibility over two or three orders of magnitude than ordinary soils and high sensitivity of analysis (&lt; 1% measuring error). It can also provide quick measurement (&lt; 15 s) with equipment expenditure at relatively low price (approximately 5000 US$). The work demonstrates that magnetite powder as a promising erosion tracer will be great potential on the Loess Plateau region.

The purpose of this paper is to show that the strong metric subregularity shares the main features of these two most popular regularity properties and is not less instrumental in applications. We show that the strong metric subregularity of a mapping F acting between metric spaces is stable under perturbations of the form f+F, where f is a function with a small calmness constant. This result is parallel to the Lyusternik–Graves theorem for metric regularity and to the Robinson theorem for strong regularity, where the perturbations are represented by a function f with a small Lipschitz constant. Then we study perturbation stability of the same kind for mappings acting between Banach spaces, where f is not necessarily differentiable but admits a set-valued derivative-like approximation. Strong metric q-subregularity is also considered, where q is a positive real constant appearing as exponent in the definition. Rockafellar's criterion for strong metric subregularity involving injectivity of the graphical derivative is extended to mappings acting in infinite-dimensional spaces. A sufficient condition for strong metric subregularity is established in terms of surjectivity of the Fréchet coderivative, and it is shown by a counterexample that surjectivity of the limiting coderivative is not a sufficient condition for this property, in general. Then various versions of Newton's method for solving generalized equations are considered including inexact and semismooth methods, for which superlinear convergence is shown under strong metric subregularity. As applications to optimization, a characterization of the strong metric subregularity of the KKT mapping is obtained, as well as a radius theorem for the optimality mapping of a nonlinear programming problem. Finally, an error estimate is derived for a discrete approximation in optimal control under strong metric subregularity of the mapping involved in the Pontryagin principle. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Generalized derivatives; Newton's method; Nonlinear programming; Optimal control; Perturbations and approximations; Strong metric subregularity",,2-s2.0-85007288963

State space modelling of linear Brownian motion was proposed to make the drift coefficient adaptive and incorporate on-line measurements into the first hitting time distribution. Here, the drift coefficient followed the Gaussian distribution, and it was iteratively estimated by using Kalman filtering once a new measurement was available. Then, to model nonlinear degradation, linear Brownian motion with adaptive drift was extended to nonlinear Brownian motion with adaptive drift. However, in previous studies, an underlying assumption used in the state space modelling was that in the update phase of Kalman filtering, the predicted drift coefficient at the current time exactly equalled the posterior drift coefficient estimated at the previous time, which caused a contradiction with the predicted drift coefficient evolution driven by an additive Gaussian process noise. In this paper, to alleviate such an underlying assumption, a new state space model is constructed. As a result, in the update phase of Kalman filtering, the predicted drift coefficient at the current time evolves from the posterior drift coefficient at the previous time. Moreover, the optimal Kalman filtering gain for iteratively estimating the posterior drift coefficient at any time is mathematically derived. A discussion that theoretically explains the main reasons why the constructed state space model can result in high remaining useful life prediction accuracies is provided.

Elemental concentration was determined, by ion beam analysis, for PM2.5 samples from Suva, spanning one year. Sources of PM2.5 have been quantified by positive matrix factorisation. A review of recent literature has been carried out to delineate the mortality risk associated with these sources. Risk factors have then been applied for Suva, to calculate the possible mortality reduction that may be achieved through reduction in pollutant levels. Higher risk ratios for black carbon and sulphur resulted in mortality predictions for PM2.5 from fossil fuel combustion, road vehicle emissions and waste burning that surpass predictions for these sources based on health risk of PM2.5 mass alone.

Hence, there is an urgent need of new technology that facilitates accurate diagnostic prediction of OSF prior to biopsy. Here, we used FTIR spectroscopy coupled with chemometric techniques to distinguish the serum metabolic signatures of OSF patients (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30). Serum biochemical analyses have been performed to further support the FTIR findings. Absorbance intensities of 45 infrared wavenumbers differed significantly between OSF and normal serum FTIR spectra representing alterations in carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Nineteen prominent significant wavenumbers (P ≤ 0.001) at 1020, 1025, 1035, 1039, 1045, 1078, 1055, 1100, 1117, 1122, 1151, 1169, 1243, 1313, 1398, 1453, 1544, 1650 and 1725 cm− 1 provided excellent segregation of OSF spectra from normal using multivariate statistical techniques. These findings provided essential information on the metabolic features of blood serum of OSF patients and established that FTIR spectroscopy coupled with chemometric analysis can be potentially useful in the rapid and accurate preoperative screening/diagnosis of OSF. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Metabolite profiling; Multivariate analysis; Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF)","Biopsy; Body fluids; Diagnosis; Metabolism; Multivariant analysis; Nucleic acids; Absorbance intensity; Biochemical analysis; Chemometric analysis; Chemometric techniques; Metabolite profiling; Multi variate analysis; Multivariate statistical techniques; Oral Submucous Fibrosis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85027495121

The lack of a clear flow-concentration relationship may have been due to greater water fluxes from less-contaminated headwaters during high flows diluting downstream concentrations, the importance of persistent point sources of E. coli both anthropogenic and agricultural, and possibly the temporal resolution of the dataset. Point sources and year-round grazing of livestock probably obscured clear seasonality in concentrations. Multiple linear regression models identified potential for contamination by anthropogenic point sources as a significant predictor of long-term spatial patterns of low, average and high concentrations of E. coli. Neither arable nor pasture land was significant, even when accounting for hydrological connectivity with a topographic-index method. However, this may have reflected coarse-scale land-cover data inadequately representing “point sources” of agricultural contamination (e.g. direct defecation of livestock into the stream) and temporal changes in availability of E. coli from diffuse sources. Spatial-stream-network models (SSNMs) were applied in a novel context, and had value in making more robust catchment-scale predictions of concentrations of E. coli with estimates of uncertainty, and in enabling identification of potential “hot spots” of faecal contamination. Successfully managing faecal contamination of surface waters is vital for safeguarding public health. Our finding that concentrations of E. coli could not clearly be associated with flow or season may suggest that management strategies should not necessarily target only high flow events or summer when faecal contamination risk is often assumed to be greatest. Furthermore, we identified SSNMs as valuable tools for identifying possible “hot spots” of contamination which could be targeted for management, and for highlighting areas where additional monitoring could help better constrain predictions relating to faecal contamination. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","E. coli; Faecal indicator organism; Microbial pollution; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Surface water; Water quality","Agriculture; Catchments; Contamination; Escherichia coli; Forecasting; Land use; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Risk perception; Rivers; Runoff; Surface waters; Uncertainty analysis; Water pollution; Water quality; Agricultural contamination; E. coli; Faecal indicator organisms; Hydrological connectivity; Management strategies; Microbial pollution; Multiple linear regression models; Spatio-temporal dynamics; River pollution; catchment; coliform bacterium; concentration (composition); feces; land use; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water; water pollution; water quality; Article; catchment; defecation; Escherichia coli; land use; nonhuman; pastureland; priority journal; Scotland; seasonal variation; statistical model; summer; water analysis; water contamination; water flow; water quality; Scotland; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85028704114

At that time the fresh new leaves are at a vulnerable stage and risk to be readily killed by the freezing temperatures. The ability to identify late spring frost spatial dynamics is a key issue for understanding forest patterns and processes linked to such extreme event. The aim of this study is to detect, map and quantify the vegetation anomalies that occurred in the mono-specific beech forest of the Lazio, Abruzzo and Molise National Park (Italy) after an exceptional spring frost recorded on the 25th of April 2016. Results showed that, beech forests at lower elevations that had an early greening process were subject to spring frost damage (SFD pixels) and their productivity performance strongly decreased with respect to the previous 15 years; to the contrary the beech forests located at higher elevations did not suffer the spring frost effects (NSFD pixels) thanks to their delayed leaf unfolding phase. The duration of the effects of freezing stress for the SFD pixels was about two months, until the end of June, confirmed by Net Ecosystem Exchange measurements. This greening hiatus led to an average 14% loss of productivity compared to the previous 15 years. Elevation had a significant role on the probability of occurrence of SFD pixels. Productivity loss in SFD pixels was more severe at elevations in the range 1500–1700 m, on steeply terrains and North aspects. This study represents a step forward the systematic use of automated techniques to study areas subject to stress or anomalies from multitemporal satellite imagery and to identify break points and recovery of the greening process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Common beech forest; MODIS EVI; Net ecosystem exchange; Spring frost","Fagus",2-s2.0-85030677072

The development of this model has allowed us to answer the following questions: Does the consideration of the indirect links between anthropogenic pressures and stream ecological status modify the hierarchy of pressure types impacting benthic invertebrates? Do the different nested scales play different roles in the anthropogenic pressures/ecological status relationship? Does this model lead to better understanding of the specific role of hydromorphology in the evaluation of stream ecological status? To achieve that goal, we used the Partial Least Square (PLS) path modelling method to develop a structural model linking variables describing (i) land use and hydromorphological alterations at the watershed scale, (ii) hydromorphological alterations at the reach scale, (iii) nutrients-organic matter contamination levels at the site scale, and (iv) substrate characteristics at the sampling site scale, to explain variation in values of a macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index: the French I2M2. We have highlighted the importance of land use effects exerted on both hydromorphological and chemical characteristics of streams observed at finer scales and their subsequent indirect impact on stream ecological status. Hydromorphological alterations have an effect on the substrate mosaic structure and on the concentrations of nutrients and organic matter at site scale. This result implies that stream hydromorphology can have a major indirect effect on macroinvertebrate assemblages and that the hierarchy of impacts of anthropogenic pressures on stream ecological status generally described in the literature - often determining strategic restoration priorities - has to be re-examined. Finally, the effects of nutrients and organic matter on macroinvertebrate assemblages are lower than expected when all the indirect effects of land use and hydromorphological alterations are taken into account. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Benthic macroinvertebrates; Chemical pressure; Ecological status; Multiple stressors; Physical pressure; Structural equation modelling","Animals; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Ecology; Hierarchical systems; Land use; Least squares approximations; Nutrients; Organic compounds; Watersheds; Benthic macroinvertebrates; Chemical pressures; Ecological status; Multiple stressors; Structural equation modelling; Computer hardware description languages; anthropogenic effect; benthos; chemical composition; ecological impact; environmental stress; fluvial geomorphology; functional change; land use change; least squares method; macroinvertebrate; streamwater; watershed; anthrpogenic pressure; Article; ecosystem; environmental impact; environmental parameters; environmental stress; land use; macroinvertebrate; mosaicism; nonhuman; organic nutrient; partial least squares regression; priority journal; reach scale; site scale; spatial scale; stream (river); structural equation modeling; substrate concentration; watershed; Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85028573375

Blood samples collected at age 13 years were used to measure blood lead levels. Seventeen items characterizing aggression from the Youth Self Report questionnaire were used to examine aggressive behavior. Principal Component Analysis was used to derive composite variables from the original data for aggressive behavior; and data were examined for an association between blood lead levels and dimensionality of direct and indirect aggression and disobedience during mid-adolescence. We also examined the dimensions of aggression during mid-adolescence in relation to gender and socio-demographic factors. Blood lead levels ranged from 1 to 28.1 μg/dL. Seventy two percent of males and 47.7% of females in the study had blood lead levels ≥ 5 μg/dL. There was a positive association between elevated blood lead levels and direct aggression (p < 0.05). Being male was positively associated with direct aggression (p < 0.001) but, negatively associated with indirect aggression (p < 0.001). Maternal education and age at birth were negatively associated with direct aggression during mid-adolescence.

However, as yet, there has been little research on this relation in adults of all ages or whether there are sex differences in this association. The current study examined these issues using data from a national population-based sample. Methods Data were analyzed from 5095 adults aged 25–84 collected during the Estonian Health Interview Survey 2006. Information was obtained on the frequency of going to bed hungry in childhood and on depressive symptoms using the Emotional State Questionnaire (EST-Q). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between hunger and depression while controlling for other demographic, socioeconomic and health-related variables. Results In a fully adjusted model, going to bed hungry in childhood either sometimes or often was associated with significantly increased odds for depressive symptoms. When the analysis was stratified by sex the association was more evident in men where any frequency of childhood hunger was linked to adult depression while only women who had experienced hunger often had higher odds for depressive symptoms in the final model. Limitations Data on childhood hunger were retrospectively reported and may have been affected by recall bias. We also lacked information on potentially relevant variables such as other childhood adversities that might have been important for the observed associations. Conclusion Childhood hunger is associated with an increased risk for depressive symptoms among adults.

We further tested if family environment mediated the relationship between bipolar risk status and internalizing and externalizing problems. Method High-risk (n = 90) BD offspring and control (n = 56) offspring aged 12–21 years old, and their parents, completed questionnaires on family cohesion and offspring internalizing and externalizing problems. Offspring also completed a parental bonding questionnaire. Group differences were examined, followed by multi-level mediation analysis with maximum likelihood and robust standard errors. Results Both offspring and parents in the high-risk group reported higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems than controls. According to offspring reports, high-risk status, lower maternal and paternal care in parental bonding, was independently associated with internalizing problems. Lower maternal care alone predicted externalizing problems. Family environment did not mediate the relationship between bipolar risk status, and offspring problems. Limitations Due to rates of missing data from parent reports of offspring psychopathology, mediation analysis was completed using offspring reports. Conclusions The offspring-report data presented indicate that low parental warmth and connection were associated with internalizing and externalizing problems as an independent risk factor, in addition to bipolar risk status. The parent-child relationship therefore warrants attention as a potential target for prevention strategies with such families. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bipolar disorder; Family functioning; High-risk studies; Offspring outcomes; Psychopathology","adolescent; adult; Article; bipolar disorder; child; child parent relation; controlled study; externalizing problem; family; female; high risk population; human; internalizing problem; major clinical study; male; maternal care; mental disease; parent; perception; priority journal; progeny; questionnaire",2-s2.0-85029620484

A total of 148 intact soil cores (8.4 cm internal diameter and 40 cm long) collected from paddy fields in Yujiang, China were used as the dataset for the calibration-validation procedure. The Vis–NIR spectra were measured on flat, horizontal surfaces of soil core sections at four depths (i.e., 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm) in the laboratory.

The four signals sent by both indicators are able to warn the drop of future oil prices and the signal only sent by the network density is followed by a huge rise of oil prices. Our results deepen the application of network measures on building early warning models of systemic risks and can be applied to predict the trends of future prices in financial markets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Early warning model; Modularity; Network density; Systemic risk","Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Finance; Financial markets; Forecasting; Crude oil market; Early-warning models; Modularity; Network density; Network measures; Network tools; Risk indicators; Systemic risks; Risk assessment",2-s2.0-85029598120

This paper incorporates the choice of service windows into a queueing model with a floor represented by discrete cells. We contrived a logit-based choice algorithm for agents considering the numbers of agents and the distances to all service windows. Simulations were conducted with various parameters of agent choice preference for these two elements and for different floor configurations, including the floor length and the number of service windows. We investigated the model from the viewpoint of transit times and entrance block rates. The influences of the parameters on these factors were surveyed in detail and we determined that there are optimum floor lengths that minimize the transit times. In addition, we observed that the transit times were determined almost entirely by the entrance block rates. The results of the presented model are relevant to understanding queueing systems including the choice of service windows and can be employed to optimize facility design and floor management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetric simple exclusion process; Choice of service windows; Queueing model","Floors; Information dissemination; Queueing networks; Asymmetric simple exclusion process; Choice behaviors; Different floors; Facility designs; Floor management; Multiple services; Number of services; Queueing model; Queueing theory",2-s2.0-85029715652

Here, we analyze data collected at 0.13 h, 0.83 h, and 1.13 h (canopy height; h = 21 m) as the surrounding loblolly pine stand was progressively thinned three times. The first thinning removed the understory and the two subsequent thinnings removed whole trees leading to a 60% reduction in the overall stand density. As the forest was thinned, turbulence and wind speed near the surface (0.13 h) increased and became more connected with above the canopy (1.13 h). The variation of the three-dimensional wind components increased for 0.13 h when the understory was thinned. Turbulence at 0.83 h and 1.13 h increased when whole trees were removed (2nd and 3rd thinning). An increase in the peak spectral power of the 0.13 h vertical velocity indicated an increase in the influence of larger eddies surviving through the canopy, but these did not affect the vertical turbulence or momentum transfer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Stand thinning; Sub-canopy turbulence; Wavelet spectra","coniferous forest; eddy; forest canopy; momentum transfer; spectrum; stand dynamics; thinning; turbulence; turbulent flow; understory; vegetation; wavelet; wind velocity; Pinus taeda",2-s2.0-85031768904

Previous studies have identified many potential impacts, including alterations to the hydrological functions and soil processes upon which ecosystems depend. However, these impacts have seldom been quantified at a regional level, particularly in arid and semi-arid systems where the gap in knowledge is the greatest, and impacts potentially the most severe. To explore the effects of extensive track, road, and rail networks on surface hydrology at a regional level we assessed over 1000 km of linear infrastructure, including approx. 300 locations where ephemeral streams crossed linear infrastructure, in the largely intact landscapes of Australia's Great Western Woodlands. We found a high level of association between linear infrastructure and altered surface hydrology, with erosion and pooling 5 and 6 times as likely to occur on-road than off-road on average (1.06 erosional and 0.69 pooling features km−1 on vehicle tracks, compared with 0.22 and 0.12 km−1, off-road, respectively). Erosion severity was greater in the presence of tracks, and 98% of crossings of ephemeral streamlines showed some evidence of impact on water movement (flow impedance (62%); diversion of flows (73%); flow concentration (76%); and/or channel initiation (31%)). Infrastructure type, pastoral land use, culvert presence, soil clay content and erodibility, mean annual rainfall, rainfall erosivity, topography and bare soil cover influenced the frequency and severity of these impacts. We conclude that linear infrastructure frequently affects ephemeral stream flows and intercepts natural overland and near-surface flows, artificially changing site-scale moisture regimes, with some parts of the landscape becoming abnormally wet and other parts becoming water-starved. In addition, linear infrastructure frequently triggers or exacerbates erosion, leading to soil loss and degradation. Where linear infrastructure densities are high, their impacts on ecological processes are likely to be considerable. Linear infrastructure is widespread across much of this relatively intact region, but there remain areas with very low infrastructure densities that need to be protected from further impacts. There is substantial scope for mitigating the impacts of existing and planned infrastructure developments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Great Western Woodlands; Road ecology; Road impacts; Semi-arid; Soil erosion; Surface hydrology","anthropogenic effect; arid region; bare soil; clay soil; ephemeral stream; erodibility; infrastructural development; infrastructure planning; landscape; rainfall; road; semiarid region; soil cover; soil degradation; soil erosion; streamflow; woodland; Australia",2-s2.0-85032675793

However, vehicle dynamics have a strong influence on both transport behaviour and noise emission. One of the most relevant elements of traffic design is the intersection, where replacement of crossing intersections with roundabouts is common. In order to understand the features of these two traffic configurations, microscopic approaches are needed, making it possible to study time-pattern fluctuations relevant for the urban sound environment perception. A model based on individual-vehicle characteristics as function of time is developed and implemented in a real case study at a development stage. The model incorporates state-of-art microscopic traffic simulation software combined with the recent noise emission model, CNOSSOS-EU, applied through an in-house developed dynamic traffic noise tool, including both internal combustion engine and all-electric vehicles at different traffic flows. The tool is described in general terms incorporating the randomisation of source power. The propagation considers a flat-city configuration up to 100 m range. The tool enables study of different statistical indicators, including descriptors of probability density functions, calm periods through the novel indicator Centre of Mass Time (CMT) and noise events. The outcomes are presented through graphs and maps explaining traffic disruptions, acceleration effects, vehicle configurations and flows, source strengths, contribution and difference maps. Among the results, it is shown that, for the signalised crossing, the acceleration of the simulated traffic has a large effect on the source strength. It is however also shown that, for an unbalanced roundabout intersection leading to congestions, it can become noisier than the signalised crossing. It is furthermore shown that, when reducing the traffic flow, the two intersection types behave more similarly; however the roundabout having the best performance for the majority of the studied analysis. Further results are shown, e.g. for removing heavy vehicles, removing also medium heavy vehicles and assuming only all-electric light vehicles, including analysis from using various indicators. A discussion about the presented tool, the current results and ideas for future work concludes the paper.

It is important to further our understanding of physical mechanisms that govern SUHI phenomenon to enhance our ability to model future SUHI characteristics under changing geophysical conditions. In this study, SUHI phenomenon is quantified and modelled at 20 cities distributed across Canada. By analyzing MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensed surface temperature at the cities over 2002–2012, it is found that 16 out of 20 selected cities have experienced a positive SUHI phenomenon while 4 cities located in the prairies region and high elevation locations have experienced a negative SUHI phenomenon in the past. A statistically significant relationship between observed SUHI magnitude and city elevation is also recorded over the observational period. A Physical Scaling downscaling model is then validated and used to downscale future surface temperature projections from 3 GCMs and 2 extreme Representative Concentration Pathways in the urban and rural areas of the cities. Future changes in SUHI magnitudes between historical (2006–2015) and future timelines: 2030s (2026–2035), 2050s (2046–2055), and 2090s (2091–2100) are estimated. Analysis of future projected changes indicate that 15 (13) out of 20 cities can be expected to experience increases in SUHI magnitudes in future under RCP 2.6 (RCP 8.5). A statistically significant relationship between projected future SUHI change and current size of the cities is also obtained. The study highlights the role of city properties (i.e. its size, elevation, and surrounding land-cover) towards shaping their current and future SUHI characteristics.

The dependency between the diffusion dynamics and structure of the network can be utilized to retrieve the connection pattern from the diffusion data. Information of the network structure can help to devise the control of dynamics on the network. In this paper, we consider the problem of network reconstruction from the available status-time-series (STS) data using matrix analysis. The proposed method of network reconstruction from the STS data is tested successfully under susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) diffusion dynamics on real-world and computer-generated benchmark networks. High accuracy and efficiency of the proposed reconstruction procedure from the status-time-series data define the novelty of the method.

Our main tool of investigation is a 3D lattice model provided by a ten-letter alphabet, the stereochemical model. This minimalist model was conceived for Monte Carlo (MC) simulations when one keeps in mind the kinetic behavior of protein-like chains in solution. We have three central goals here. The first one is to characterize the folding time (τ) by two distinct sampling methods, so we present two sets of 103 MC simulations for a fast protein-like sequence. The resulting sets of characteristic folding times, τ and τq were obtained by the application of the standard Metropolis algorithm (MA), as well as by an enhanced algorithm (MqA). The finding for τq shows two things: (i) the chain-solvent hydrophobic interactions {hk} plus a set of inter-residues steric constraints {ci,j} are able to emulate the conformational search for the native structure. For each one of the 103MC performed simulations, the target is always found within a finite time window; (ii) the ratio τq∕τ≅1∕10 suggests that the effect of local thermal fluctuations, encompassed by the Tsallis weight, provides to the chain an innate efficiency to escape from energetic and steric traps. We performed additional MC simulations with variations of our design rule to attest this first result, both algorithms the MA and the MqA were applied to a restricted set of targets, a physical insight is provided. Our second finding was obtained by a set of 600 independent MC simulations, only performed with the MqA applied to an extended set of 200 representative targets, our native structures. The results show how structural patterns should modulate τq, which cover four orders of magnitude; this finding is our second goal. The third, and last result, was obtained with a special kind of simulation performed with the purpose to explore a possible connection between the hydrophobic component of protein stability and the native structural topology. We simulated those same 200 targets again with the MqA, only. However, this time we evaluated the relative frequency {ϕq} in which each target visits its corresponding native structure along an appropriate simulation time. Due to the presence of the hydrophobic effect in our approach we obtained a strong correlation between the stability and the folding rate (R=0.85). So, as faster a sequence found its target, as larger is the hydrophobic component of its stability. The strong correlation fulfills our last goal. This final finding suggests that the hydrophobic effect could not be a general stabilizing factor for proteins. © 2017",,"Chains; Monte Carlo methods; Proteins; Respiratory mechanics; Stability; Conformational search; Hydrophobic components; Hydrophobic interactions; Hydrophobic stability; Metropolis algorithms; Stereochemical models; Structural topologies; Thermal fluctuations; Hydrophobicity",2-s2.0-85029481046

Although that hypothesis is appropriate for quantities with growth directly restricted to themselves, it requires the solution of differential equations that are difficult to be derived. However, for quantities of growth that are indirectly related to themselves, and for quantities that exhibit cumulative growth, such as growth of diameter or volume of trees with lignification, ordinary growth models with assumptions that include self-referencing or implied catabolism terms might not be appropriate. For such quantities, the author proposes an approach for derivation of growth models based on stochastic and microscopic interpretation. Results show that ordinary growth models can be interpreted from the perspective. The approach enables one to derive growth functions without solving differential equations. Based on that approach, growth functions are derived by integrating cumulative distribution functions. Three growth functions are generated using reasonable probability distributions. The fitness of the generated growth functions for real diameter growth data was compared with that of generalized ordinary growth models. Results show that the presented approach has high ability to generate growth models that fit data much better than ordinary growth models for a given number of parameters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cumulative distribution function; Cumulative growth; Differential equation; Growth function; Tree diameter","Differential equations; Forestry; Probability distributions; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Cumulative distribution function; Diameter growth; Growth equation; Growth functions; Growth models; Microscopic interpretation; Self-referencing; Tree diameter; Distribution functions",2-s2.0-85029520325

As one of the most important components of financial market, stock market has been attracting more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a threshold model to build Chinese stock market networks and study the topological properties of these networks. To be specific, we compare the effects of different crises, namely the 2008 global crisis and the stock market disaster in 2015, on the threshold networks. Prices of the stocks belonging to the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index are considered for three periods: the global crisis, common period and the stock market disaster. We find the probability distribution of the cross-correlations of the stocks during the stock market disaster is fatter than that of others. Besides, the thresholds of cross-correlations are assigned to obtain the threshold networks and the power-law of degree distribution in these networks are observed in a certain range of threshold values. The networks during the stock market disaster also appear to have larger mean degree and modularity, which reveals the strong correlations among these stock prices. Our findings to some extent crosscheck the liquidity shortage reason which is believed to result in the outbreak of the stock market disaster.

To reduce nonpoint source sediment pollution associated with forest management activities and to maintain the high water quality typically provided from forests, best management practices (BMPs) were developed and implemented. While BMPs have evolved over time, the effectiveness of contemporary BMPs, particularly for harvesting practices, have not been thoroughly investigated, especially in comparison to historical practices. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the effects of contemporary harvesting practices on suspended sediment concentrations and yields and (2) examine the legacy effects from historical harvesting on suspended sediment concentrations. The Alsea Watershed Study was an important early research site that lead to the development of contemporary forest management practices to protect water quality and fish habitat in Oregon and elsewhere. By returning to the same watersheds that were harvested in 1966, this is one of the few times that a watershed-scale study is able to directly compare and contrast the effects of historical practices with contemporary practices. The Alsea Watershed Study Revisited includes the same three watersheds as the original study. Flynn Creek (FCG, 219 ha) is an old-growth dominated reference watershed. Deer Creek (DCG, 315 ha) is an extensively managed watershed that was patch-cut during the original study. Needle Branch (NBLG, 94 ha) was clearcut harvested in the original study and again in the recent study, but with contemporary BMPs, including riparian buffers. The upper portion of Needle Branch was harvested in 2009 (Phase I), while the lower portion of the watershed was harvested in 2015 (Phase II). We monitored suspended sediments and discharge from WY 2006–2016, and analyzed this data using multiple linear regression procedures and ANCOVA. Average suspended sediment yields ranged from 55–313 Mg km−2 yr−1 in FCG, 31–102 Mg km−2 yr−1 in NBLG, and 69–127 Mg km−2 yr−1 in DCG. We found no evidence that contemporary harvesting techniques affected suspended sediment concentrations or yields.

Using two-parameter Weibull distribution, the theoretical tensile strength values are determined for Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) and Carbon Fiber Reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites for different strain rates by a linear curve fitting. The theoretical and experimental values match well. The deviation between the theoretical and experimental values is less than 12% for GFRP laminates and less than 13% for CFRP laminates. Normally the mean values of mechanical properties are sufficient to use theoretical models, whereas all tested specimen data are considered (including the mean values) in Weibull distribution. Therefore, Weibull distribution contains more information and it will be useful for designers and composite manufacturers to ensure the reliability of structures. Studies show that the (0/90/45/-45) laminates have exhibited the highest scale parameter increment of 80.5% for glass/epoxy and 53% for carbon/epoxy composites with the increase of strain rate, when compared to laminates of other orientations.

Spiking and bursting are two main types of firing pattern considered in this work. Numerical results show that, irrespective of the inhibitory firing patterns, the regularity of network is maximized by an optimal intensity of external noise, indicating the occurrence of coherence resonance. Moreover, the firing pattern of inhibitory neuron indeed has a significant influence on coherence resonance, but the efficacy is determined by network property. In the network with strong coupling strength but weak inhibition, bursting neurons largely increase the amplitude of resonance, while they can decrease the noise intensity that induced coherence resonance within the neural system of strong inhibition. Different temporal windows of inhibition induced by different inhibitory neurons may account for the above observations. The network structure also plays a constructive role in the coherence resonance.

Apart from coal conversion rate, the tar yield, quality and radical concentration in char were also measured to explore the difference between lignite briquette and the respective pulverised powder. Additionally, a 1-D model coupled with the chemical percolation devolatilisation (CPD) code was developed to quantitatively understand heat transfer using temperature dependent parameters; product distribution and yields, and the pyrolysis mechanism. It was discovered that heat transfer was the limiting factor for pyrolysis of the lignite briquette, which subsequently lowered the heating rate and led to increased cross-linking and decreased tar production compared to a coal particle. Simultaneously, the primary tar also underwent internal cracking and even deoxygenation to decompose into light aromatics and gases inside the briquette char matrix. Providing a hot gas environment was found to facilitate the cracking of tar species compared to a slow heating rate where tar is released at a lower temperature. The changes in radical concentration in the solid material were linked to the structural changes predicted by the CPD model including bridge-breaking, tar release and cross-linking phenomena. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","1-D modelling coupled with CPD code; Heating rate; Lignite briquette pyrolysis; Radicals","Briquets; Cracks; Heat transfer; Heating; Heating rate; Lignite; Pyrolysis; Solvents; Tar; Thermogravimetric analysis; 1-D modelling coupled with CPD code; Chemical percolation; Experimental investigations; Product distributions; Pyrolysis mechanism; Radical concentration; Radicals; Temperature dependent; Cracking (chemical)",2-s2.0-85032339346

The nodes of the channel can have different “leakage”, i.e., some amount of the substance can leave the channel at a node and the rate of leaving can be different for the different nodes of the channel. The nodes close to the end of the channel for some (design or other) reason may be more “attractive” for the substance in comparison to the nodes around the incoming node of the channel. We discuss channels containing infinite or finite number of nodes. The main outcome of the model is the distribution of the substance along the nodes. Two regimes of functioning of the channels are studied: stationary regime and non-stationary regime. The distribution of the substance along the nodes of the channel for the case of stationary regime is a distribution with a very long tail that contains as particular case the Waring distribution (for channel with infinite number of nodes) or the truncated Waring distribution (for channel with finite number of nodes). In the non-stationary regime of functioning of the channel one observes an exponential increase or exponential decrease of the amount of substance in the nodes. However the asymptotic distribution of the substance among the nodes of the channel in this regime remains stationary. The studied model is applied to the case of migration of humans through a migration channel consisting of chain of countries. In this case the model accounts for the number of migrants entering the channel through the first country of the channel; permeability of the borders between the countries; possible large attractiveness of some countries of the channel; possibility for migrants to obtain permission to reside in a country of the channel. The main outcome of the model is the distribution of migrants along the countries of the channel. We discuss the conditions for concentration of migrants in selected country of the channel. Finally two scenarios of changes of conditions of the functioning of the channel are discussed. It is shown that from the point of view of decreasing of the number of migrants in the countries of the channel it is more effective to concentrate efforts on preventing the entrance of migrants in the first country of the channel when compared to concentration of efforts on decrease of permeability of the borders between the countries of the channel. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Human migration; Network channels; Network flows; Social networks; Waring distribution","Physics; Social networking (online); Asymptotic distributions; Exponential increase; Human migration; Infinite numbers; Network channel; Network flows; Stationary regime; Waring distribution; Chains",2-s2.0-85029606453

Thus, the different sizes of the I-phase from tens of nanoscale precipitates to enhanced icosahedral short-range order in MG matrix can be obtained by controlling cooling history. I-phase particles with tens of nanoscale in BMGs do not contribute to extrinsic ductility due to limited blocking of the propagation of shear band. The shear band passes through the particle, splitting it into two pieces. On the other hand, BMGs with enhanced icosahedral short-range order, which can be evaluated by EXAFS analysis as well as calorimetric signal during isothermal annealing, exhibit enhanced ductility without strength reduction. Indeed, we examine the cut-off size of strain bursts and deformation dynamics of shear-avalanches through the statistical analysis of serration behavior. Icosahedral short-range order (ISRO)-embedded MGs exhibit weakened jammed state of the self-organized deformed zones, which results in the formation of numerous catastrophic deformed zones under relatively chaotic dynamics, and consequently multiple shear bands. These results would help deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanism that determines intrinsic ductility in BMGs via frozen-in ISRO, and ultimately give us a guideline for the design of promising BMGs with improved intrinsic ductility by manipulating local structural instability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Deformation dynamics; Icosahedral phase; Mechanical response; Metallic glass; Structural instability","Deformation; Ductility; Dynamics; Glass; Isothermal annealing; Nanotechnology; Shear bands; Bulk metallic glass; Deformation dynamics; Icosahedral phase; Icosahedral short-range orders; Mechanical response; Multiple shear bands; Structural instability; Structural signatures; Metallic glass",2-s2.0-85032585119

Significant temporal variations were observed in environmental variables as well as the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities, whereas their variational trajectories and directions were entirely different. Variance partitioning analysis showed that extrinsic factors significantly explained only 31% of the variation in the phytoplankton community, thus suggesting that these factors were incomplete predictors of the community structure. Random forest-based models showed that 48% of qualified responsible phytoplankton species were more accurately predicted by phytoplankton-only models, which revealed clear effects of interspecific species-to-species interactions. Furthermore, we used association networks to model the interactions among phytoplankton, zooplankton and the environment. Network comparisons indicated that interspecific interactions were widely present in the phytoplankton community and dominated the network rather than those between phytoplankton and extrinsic factors.

Phormidium cover was highly variable both spatially (among and within sites) and temporally. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) identified site, month of the year, conductivity and nutrient concentrations over the accrual period as significant variables associated with Phormidium cover. Cover was greatest under low to intermediate accrual dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations. Accrual nutrients had a strong, negative effect on cover at concentrations &gt; 0.2 mg L− 1 DIN and 0.014 mg L− 1 DRP. The effect of flow was generally consistent across rivers, with cover accruing with time since the last flushing flow. Total anatoxins were detected at all eight study sites, at concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 662.5 mg kg− 1 dried weight. GAMMs predicted higher total anatoxin concentrations between November and February and during periods of accrual DRP &lt; 0.02 mg L− 1. This study suggests that multiple physicochemical variables may influence Phormidium proliferations and also evidenced large site-to-site variability. This result highlights a challenge from a management perspective, as it suggests that mitigation options are likely to be site-specific. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anatoxin; Benthic cyanobacteria; Cobble-bed rivers; Dissolved inorganic nitrogen; Dissolved reactive phosphorus; Phormidium; Physicochemical variables","Dissolution; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rivers; Anatoxin; Benthic cyanobacteria; Dissolved inorganic nitrogens; Dissolved reactive phosphorus; Phormidium; Physicochemical variables; Nutrients; anatoxin; dissolved inorganic nitrogen; dissolved reactive phosphorus; inorganic compound; nitrogen derivative; phosphorus derivative; river water; unclassified drug; Article; bacterial growth; benthos; concentration (parameters); conductance; controlled study; cyanobacterium; generalized additive mixed model; island (geological); New Zealand; nonhuman; nutrient; Phormidium; physical chemistry; population dynamics; prediction; priority journal; river ecosystem; seasonal variation; statistical model; water flow; Cyanobacteria; Phormidium",2-s2.0-85028312740

Bottom-up, IPCC based methodologies are typically used to estimate the agriculture sector's contribution, but these estimates are rarely verified beyond the farm gate, due to the challenge of separating interspersed sources. We present flux measurements of CH4 using eddy covariance (EC), relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) and wavelet covariance obtained using an aircraft-based measurement platform and compare these top-down estimates with bottom-up footprint adjusted inventory estimates of CH4 emissions for an agricultural region in eastern Ontario, Canada. Top-down CH4 fluxes agree well (mean ± 1 standard error: EC = 17 ± 4 mg CH4 m−2 d−1; REA = 19 ± 3 mg CH4 m−2 d−1, wavelet covariance = 16 ± 3 mg CH4 m−2 d−1), and are not statistically different, but significantly exceed bottom-up inventory estimates of CH4 emissions based on animal husbandry (8 ± 1 mg CH4 m−2 d−1). The discrepancy between top-down and bottom-up estimates was found to be related to both increasing fractional area of wetlands in the flux footprint, and increasing surface temperature. For the case when the wetland area in the flux footprint was less than 10% fractional coverage, the top-down and bottom-up estimates were within the measurement error. This result provides the first independent verification of agricultural methane emissions inventories at the regional scale. Wavelet analysis, which provides spatially resolved fluxes, was used to attempt to separate CH4 emissions from managed and unmanaged CH4 sources. Opportunities to minimize the challenges of verifying agricultural CH4 emissions inventories using aircraft flux measuring systems are discussed. © 2017","CH4 sensor; Eddy covariance; Farm; Relaxed eddy accumulation; Trace gas flux; Wavelet analysis; Wetlands","agricultural emission; bottom-up approach; climate change; eddy covariance; emission inventory; farm; flux measurement; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; methane; sensor; top-down approach; trace gas; wavelet analysis; wetland; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Animalia",2-s2.0-85029693599

Specifically, the microstructure and tribological properties of the coatings are characterized as a function of the particle size distribution of the feedstock powder, of the deposition technique – High Velocity Oxygen-Fuel (HVOF) or High Velocity Air-Fuel (HVAF) spraying – and of specific processing parameters. HVOF-sprayed coatings obtained from fine feedstock powder exhibit numerous oxide inclusions, which provide high hardness (≈ 900 HV0.3) but do not excessively impair fracture toughness, as determined through scratch testing techniques. HVAF-sprayed coatings obtained from the same feedstock powder contain much fewer oxide inclusions, and some of them possess simultaneously high hardness and high toughness. Defects (e.g. speckles) are instead formed in case unsuitable HVAF torch hardware is employed. A coarse feedstock powder always results in unmelted inclusions, which impair the cohesion of the coatings, particularly of the HVAF-sprayed ones. Most coatings anyway exhibit very low sliding wear rates &lt; 3 × 10−6 mm3/(N m); abrasive grooving and surface fatigue-induced pitting are the main wear mechanisms. Oxide inclusions do not affect negatively the response of HVOF coatings, whereas too many unmolten particles increase pitting under severe test conditions.

Debate continues at the behavioral level about which component of reward, learning or incentive salience, is signaled by these dopamine transients and thus altered in addiction. The learning hypothesis proposes that rewarding drugs result in pathological overlearning of drug-predictive cues, while the incentive sensitization hypothesis suggests that rewarding drugs result in sensitized attribution of incentive salience to drug-predictive cues. Therapeutic doses of amphetamine, such as those used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, are hypothesized to enhance the ventral striatal dopamine transients that are critical for reward-related learning and to enhance Pavlovian learning. However, the effects of therapeutic doses of amphetamine on Pavlovian learning are poorly understood, and the effects on dopamine transients are completely unknown. We determined the effects of an acute pre-training therapeutic or rewarding amphetamine injection on the acquisition of Pavlovian autoshaping in the intact rat. We also determined the effects of these doses on electrically evoked transient-like dopamine signals using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in the anesthetized rat. The rewarding dose enhanced the amplitude and duration of DA signals, caused acute task disengagement, impaired learning for several days, and triggered incentive sensitization. The therapeutic dose produced smaller enhancements in DA signals but did not have similar behavioral effects. These results underscore the necessity of more studies using therapeutic doses, and suggest a hybrid learning/incentive sensitization model may be required to explain the development of addiction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Amphetamine; Autoshaping; Dopamine; FSCV; Incentive salience; Learning","amphetamine; dopamine; animal experiment; Article; association; controlled study; cyclic potentiometry; drug determination; drug effect; evoked response; learning; male; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; rat; reward; salience network; signal transduction; ventral striatum",2-s2.0-85028974856

The growth of urban areas and industrial intensification has contributed to a reduction in valuable agricultural lands and to various environmental impacts including climate change. This reduction in agricultural land severely impacts food production and food security. In order to effectively address this issue, spatial analytical and optimization methods based on evaluating multiple criteria decision are needed to evaluate the capability and suitability of available lands for current and future food production. The objective of this study is to implement the GIS and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques as an improved method of multi-criteria decision making for evaluating areas suitable for cultivation priority planning of maize, rape and soybean crops. For this purpose, 12,000 ha land which is located in Ardabil province, west-north of Iran was investigated by excavation of 167 soil profiles and 313 augers. After soil sampling and analysis, soils were classified in Aridisols. 24 soil series and 66 land units were identified and separated in study area. The several criteria had limitation for maize, rape and soybean cultivation in studying lands which the most limiting evaluation criteria including soil depth, slope, climate, pH, electrical conductivity, exchangeable sodium percentage, calcium carbonate and gypsum were selected for usage in prioritization models by principal component analysis and multi-dimensional scaling methods. Selected criteria were very important in growth of maize, rape and soybean. Simple additive weighting (SAW), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Fuzzy TOPSIS methods were used for cultivation priority planning of maize, rape and soybean crops in land units. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy AHP approaches were used to determine weight values of the criteria. Multivariate variance analysis proves significant difference among three methods at 0.05 probability level. With attention to allocated scores by prioritization models, crops cultivation priority was determined as maize, rape and soybean in land units, respectively and maize crop was preferred to other plants. The statistical analysis results with regard to mean comparison derived from least significant difference (LSD) test showed that Fuzzy TOPSIS method set cultivation priority planning of maize, rape and soybean crops for land units more accurately than the others, due to fuzzy TOPSIS method used appropriate values of criteria weights, twin comparing nature of alternative (crop) from positive and negative ideal, data standardization, mathematical equations and matrixes as well as fuzzy logic relations and principles for calculation of process performing. This study emphasizes the successful application of MCDA in dealing with complicated issues in the context of cultivation priority planning management. It is anticipated that, the integration of this developed framework in the planning policies of cultivation priority in developing countries as an effective tool for integrated regional land use planning can help in conducting better control over soil, land and environment losses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cultivation priority; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy TOPSIS; SAW; TOPSIS","Agriculture; Calcium carbonate; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Developing countries; Economics; Environmental impact; Food supply; Fuzzy logic; Hierarchical systems; Land use; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Sawing; Soils; Urban growth; Urban planning; Exchangeable sodium percentages; Fuzzy AHP; FUZZY TOPSIS; Least significant differences; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Multi-dimensional scaling methods; TOPSIS; Cultivation; agricultural land; agricultural technology; calcium carbonate; decision analysis; food production; fuzzy mathematics; GIS; gypsum; land use planning; maize; optimization; prioritization; soybean; Ardabil; Iran; Brassica napus; Glycine max; Zea mays",2-s2.0-85029887162

One strategy to reduce emissions is the implementation of air staging technology in secondary air supply, which became an established technique for modern wood combustion appliances. On that account, emissions from a modern masonry heater fuelled with three types of common logwood (beech, birch and spruce) and a modern pellet boiler fuelled with commercial softwood pellets were investigated, which refer to representative combustion appliances in northern Europe In particular, emphasis was put on the organic constituents of PM2.5, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and phenolic species, by targeted and non-targeted mass spectrometric analysis techniques. Compared to conventional wood stoves and pellet boilers, organic emissions from the modern appliances were reduced by at least one order of magnitude, but to a different extent for single species. Hence, characteristic ratios of emission constituents and emission profiles for wood combustion identification and speciation do not hold for this type of advanced combustion technology. Additionally, an overall substantial reduction of typical wood combustion markers, such as phenolic species and anhydrous sugars, were observed. Finally, it was found that slow ignition of log woods changes the distribution of characteristic resin acids and phytosterols as well as their thermal alteration products, which are used as markers for specific wood types.

The aim of this paper was to assess the mediating role of quantity and quality of social support in adulthood in the association between childhood adversity and psychological distress in adulthood. Methods The study has a three-wave design; the present analysis used longitudinal data collected from 1994 to 2008 within the framework of the Tromsø Study (N = 4530), a representative prospective cohort study of men and women. Quantity and quality of social support were measured at a mean age of 54.7 years, and psychological distress in adulthood was measured at a mean age of 61.7 years. Mediation analysis was used to assess the indirect effect of childhood adversity (via quantity and quality of social support) on psychological distress in adulthood. Results Childhood adversity was associated with deficits in quantity and quality of social support in adulthood (p < 0.05). Childhood adversity and deficits in quantity and quality of social support were associated with psychological distress in adulthood (p < 0.05). Quantity and quality of social support significantly (p < 0.05) mediated the association between childhood adversity and psychological distress in adulthood.

The experiment was designed with four simulated N deposition rates such as 0, 50, 100, and 200 kg N ha− 1, respectively, under grazed and fenced management treatments. Results showed that the investigated steppes were significant sinks for CH4, with an uptake flux of 1.12–3.36 kg ha− 1 over the grass growing season and that the magnitude of CH4 uptake significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased with increasing N deposition rates. The soil CH4 uptake rates were highest in the desert steppe, moderate in the typical steppe, and lowest in the meadow steppe. Compared with grazed plots, fencing increased the CH4 uptake by 4.7–40.2% with a mean value of 20.2% across the three different steppe types. The responses of soil CH4 uptake to N deposition in the continental steppe varied depending on the N deposition rate, steppe type, and grazing management. A significantly positive correlation between CH4 uptake and soil temperature was found in this study, whereas no significant relationship between soil moisture and CH4 uptake occurred.

These basis functions are expressed in terms of “the repeated integrals of the complementary error function” and provide highly efficient tools to solve the free boundary partial differential equation resulting from the related option pricing model. We introduce an integral operator with a function-dependent lower limit which is employed as a basic tool to prove the radial positive definiteness of the proposed basis functions and could be of independent interest in the RBF theory. We then show that using the introduced functions as expansion bases in the context of an RBF-based meshless collocation scheme, we could exactly impose the transparent boundary condition accompanying the heat equation. We prove that the condition numbers of the resulting collocation matrices are orders of magnitude less than those arising from other popular RBF families used in current literature.

RT-qPCR of various selected pro-inflammatory factors revealed similar mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors in BOEC co-cultured with T. pyogenes and in the controls. Higher mRNA expression of IL 1A, -1B, tumor necrosis factor alpha and CXC ligand (CXCL) 1/2, −3, −5 and IL8 and PG synthesis enzymes in BOEC co-cultured with B. pumilus was observed. In the presence of B. pumilus a higher amount of IL8 and PGE2 was released from BOEC than from controls. The viability and pro-inflammatory response of P3 BOEC incubated with bacteria was lower than in P0 BOEC. These findings illustrate the pathogenicity of T. pyogenes towards BOEC in detail and the potential role of B. pumilus in generating inflammation in oviductal cells. Culturing conditions influenced the pro-inflammatory responses of BOEC towards bacteria. Therefore, researchers conducting epithelial-bacterial in vitro co-culture should not underestimate the effects of these parameters. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bovine oviductal epithelial cells; Dairy cattle fertility; Gram-positive bacteria; In vitro cell passaging; Postpartum diseases",,2-s2.0-85032305783

Experimental investigations of adhesives, e.g. structural silicones accounting for cavitation in combination with the numerical treatment of this phenomenon are rare. Accordingly, this paper presents a micro-mechanically motivated constitutive model accounting for isotropic void growth. It was developed based on numerical homogenization schemes of a cube with an incompressible matrix containing a single, vacuous void in the center. To differentiate whether an initial void is growing, a new developed void growth criterion is presented. The void growth criterion was coupled with the new developed volumetric HELMHOLTZ free energy function to extend the classical volumetric-deviatoric split to large volume strains. Experiments were performed with a structural silicone under uniaxial tension as well as so-called pancake tests and compared with the new developed volumetric constitutive model accounting for isotropic cavitation. To observe qualitatively cavitation during experiments, a new testing device was developed, which enables one to characterize this damaging effect of the adhesive bonding. The numerical validation shows a good approximation of the experimental results. In order to improve the simulation results, an optimization study on the constitutive parameters was conducted. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Finite porosity; Nano-cavitation; Numerical homogenization; Poro-hyperelastic materials; Transparent structural silicone adhesive; Void growth criteria","Cavitation; Constitutive models; Silicones; Constitutive model accounting; Constitutive parameters; Experimental investigations; Hyperelastic materials; Numerical homogenization; Numerical validations; Silicone adhesives; Void growth; Free energy",2-s2.0-85032305019

Our study provides a clear understanding of the water quality in the rivers of Lake Taihu Basin based on basin-scale monitoring and a water quality index (WQI) method. From September 2014 to January 2016, four samplings across four seasons were conducted at 96 sites along main rivers. Fifteen parameters, including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, turbidity (tur), permanganate index (CODMn), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonium (NH4-N), nitrite, nitrate (NO3-N), calcium, magnesium, chloride, and sulfate, were measured to calculate the WQI. The average WQI value during our study period was 59.33; consequently, the water quality was considered as generally “moderate”. Significant differences in WQI values were detected among the 6 river systems, with better water quality in the Tiaoxi and Nanhe systems. The water quality presented distinct seasonal variation, with the highest WQI values in autumn, followed by spring and summer, and the lowest values in winter. The minimum WQI (WQImin), which was developed based on a stepwise linear regression analysis, consisted of five parameters: NH4-N, CODMn, NO3-N, DO, and tur. The model exhibited excellent performance in representing the water quality in Lake Taihu Basin, especially when weights were fully considered. Our results are beneficial for water quality management and could be used for rapid and low-cost water quality evaluation in Lake Taihu Basin. Additionally, we suggest that weights of environmental parameters should be fully considered in water quality assessments when using the WQImin method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Lake Taihu Basin; River; Water quality assessment; WQI; WQImin; Yangtze River Delta","Biochemical oxygen demand; Dissolved oxygen; Lakes; Quality control; Quality management; Regression analysis; River pollution; Rivers; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Environmental parameter; Lake taihu; Stepwise linear regression; Water quality assessments; Water quality evaluation; Water quality indexes; WQImin; Yangtze river delta; Water resources; ammonia; calcium; chloride; dissolved oxygen; magnesium; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; phosphorus; river water; sulfate; environmental assessment; lake water; pollution monitoring; qualitative analysis; river pollution; river water; water quality; Article; China; conductance; controlled study; environmental parameters; pH; priority journal; seasonal variation; turbidity; water pollution; water quality; water sampling; water temperature; China; Taihu Basin; Yangtze Delta",2-s2.0-85028702040

The data collected by the second Italian National Forest Inventory, spanning a wide range of temperature and precipitation values (10° latitudinal range), represented a unique opportunity to calculate N content and C/N ratio of the different soil layers to a depth of 30 cm. Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models were applied to investigate the main determinants of soil N distribution and C/N ratio. Forest category was shown to be the main explanatory factor of soil N variability in seven out of eight models, both for forest floor and mineral soil layers. Moreover latitude explained a larger share of variability than single climate variables. BRT models explained, on average, the 49% of the data variability, with the remaining fraction likely due to soil-related variables that were unaccounted for.

Still, data based on active air sampling remain scarce in many regions. The primary objectives of this study were to (i) monitor concentrations of selected POPs in air outside West Africa, and (ii) to evaluate potential atmospheric processes and source regions affecting measured concentrations. For this purpose, an active high-volume air sampler was installed on the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory at Cape Verde outside the coast of West Africa. Sampling commenced in May 2012 and 43 samples (24 h sampling) were collected until June 2013. The samples were analyzed for selected polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and chlordanes. The concentrations of these POPs at Cape Verde were generally low and comparable to remote sites in the Arctic for several compounds. Seasonal trends varied between compounds and concentrations exhibited strong temperature dependence for chlordanes. Our results indicate net volatilization from the Atlantic Ocean north of Cape Verde as sources of these POPs. Air mass back trajectories demonstrated that air masses measured at Cape Verde were generally transported from the Atlantic Ocean or the North African continent. Overall, the low concentrations in air at Cape Verde were likely explained by absence of major emissions in areas from which the air masses originated combined with depletion during long-range atmospheric transport due to enhanced degradation under tropical conditions (high temperatures and concentrations of hydroxyl radicals). © 2017 The Author(s)","Active air sampling; Monitoring; Particle dispersion modelling; Persistent organic pollutants; Tropical regions","Atmospheric movements; Meteorology; Monitoring; Pollution; Pollution detection; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Temperature distribution; Air sampling; Long-range atmospheric transports; Particle dispersion; Persistent organic pollutant (POP); Persistent organic pollutants; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Tropical regions; Organic pollutants",2-s2.0-85028350970

Some antidepressant drugs are considered as PIM, but previous research on the association between antidepressants and subsequent dementia has been inconclusive. Therefore, we investigated whether the intake of antidepressants, particularly of those considered as PIM according to the Priscus list, would predict incident dementia. Methods We used data of a prospective cohort study of non-demented primary care patients (n = 3239, mean age = 79.62) to compute Cox proportional hazards models. The risk for subsequent dementia was estimated over eight follow-ups up to 12 years depending on antidepressant intake and covariates. Results The intake of antidepressants was associated with an increased risk for subsequent dementia (HR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.16–2.02, p =.003; age-, sex-, education-adjusted). PIM antidepressants (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.06–2.10, p =.021), but not other antidepressants (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.66–1.66, p =.863), were associated with an increased risk for subsequent dementia (in age-, sex-, education-, and depressive symptoms adjusted models). Significant associations disappeared after global cognition at baseline was controlled for. Limitations Methodological limitations such as selection biases and self-reported drug assessments might have influenced the results. Conclusions Only antidepressants considered as PIM were associated with an increased subsequent dementia risk. Anticholinergic effects might explain this relationship. The association disappeared after the statistical control for global cognition at baseline. Nonetheless, physicians should avoid the prescription of PIM antidepressants in elderly patients whenever possible. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Antidepressant drugs; Antidepressants; Dementia; Late-life depression; Oldest-old; Potentially inappropriate medication","antidepressant agent; aged; Article; cohort analysis; dementia; depression; education; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; potentially inappropriate medication; primary medical care; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; selection bias; self report",2-s2.0-85029664131

Using our sample of offspring at high and low familial risk for depression, we hypothesized that: a) high-risk offspring (n = 79) and their mothers will report more extensive family dysfunction than low-risk offspring (n = 82) and their mothers, b) family dysfunction will predict the extent of offspring's depressive symptoms, and c) family dysfunction will mediate the impact of mother's depression on offspring's depressive symptoms. Methods The study enrolled 161 offspring of parents who, in a previous study, were ascertained to have either childhood onset mood disorder or no history of a major psychiatric disorder. Parents completed questionnaires and a clinical interview about themselves, their offspring, and the family, while offspring also completed questionnaires about themselves and the family. Results We found support for all three hypotheses. The significant indirect effect between maternal depression and offspring depressive symptoms was driven primarily by offspring's, but not mothers’, reports of family dysfunction. Limitations Although our assessment of mother's early history of depression was done in a previous study, it is important to note that our results do not inform about causality because of the present study's cross-sectional nature.

Furthermore, recorded failure data is often only valid for the specific circumstances and components for which it was collected.

However, to date there were no studies assessing the prevalence of NSSI defined by suggested DSM-5 criteria among Chinese adolescents. We aimed to conduct a nationwide survey to explore the prevalence of and risk factors for NSSI among school-based adolescents in rural China. Methods A total sample of 15,623 adolescents in rural China were enrolled by using a multistage sampling method. Data was collected by self-report questionnaires including demographic characteristics, neglect, maltreatment, loneliness, resilience, social support and emotional management ability. NSSI was defined by suggested DSM-5 criteria, according to which the engagement in self-injury took place more than 5 times a year. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between risk factors and NSSI. Results There were 12.2% of adolescents (n = 1908) met the suggested DSM-5 criteria. Approximately 29% reported a history of NSSI at least once during the last year. Significant differences were found in several demographic factors including gender, ethnicity, grade, and family structure between adolescents with and without experiencing NSSI. The top three NSSI behaviors among adolescents with NSSI experience were hitting self, pinching, and pulling hair, with a prevalence rate of 16.7%, 14.1% and 11.2%, respectively. Female, Han ethnicity, fathers’ education level, neglect, maltreatment, loneliness, social support, suicidal behaviors and emotional management ability were significantly associated with NSSI by multivariate analysis. No significant relationship was found between resilience and risk of NSSI. Limitation The DSM-5 has proposed 6 groups of criteria for NSSI, we only used criteria on frequency given its more accepted feasibility and pragmatic application. Consequently, it may different from other prevalence that estimated by other criteria. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting prevalence of NSSI defined by suggested DSM-5 criteria among adolescent in rural China. In comparison to finding from the similar samples of adolescents, Chinese rural adolescents seem to have a relative higher prevalence. The potential risk factors for NSSI include female, father's education, Han ethnicity, psychosocial factors and suicide behaviors. More evidence for further understanding of context of the occurrence, improving access to health care utilization, and identifying the role of psychosocial factors and family relationship, is needed for the prevention and management of NSSI. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Emotional management; Loneliness; Maltreatment; Neglect; Non-suicidal self-injury; Social support","adolescent; Article; automutilation; child abuse; child neglect; China; controlled study; educational status; emotionality; ethnic difference; family; father; female; Han Chinese; health survey; human; loneliness; major clinical study; male; medical history; prevalence; priority journal; psychological resilience; risk factor; rural population; sex difference; social support; suicidal behavior",2-s2.0-85030685255

A land surface temperature (LST) model-data approach was used to detect daily use of subsurface water (i.e. soil moisture obtained from depths >30 cm and aquifer groundwater) by woody vegetation to a confidence level of 95%. Vegetation subsurface water use was quantified over a 13-year period (2000–2012) coinciding with a series of wet and dry climatic periods. Land surface temperature and subsurface water use time-series data were compared to local meteorological (vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, and soil water availability) and vegetation (leaf area index, stomatal resistance and latent heat loss) data to determine vegetation strategies to declining shallow (<30 cm depth) soil water availability. Different vegetation subsurface water-use strategies and physiological response to changes in water availability were identified at inter- and intra-annual time-scales. At the intra-annual scale, frequency of subsurface water use by vegetation was strongly influenced by availability of shallow soil water. From January–September in this landscape, frequency of subsurface water use by vegetation remained relatively constant, supplementing decreasing shallow soil water availability and/or increasing evaporative demand. From October–December, the vegetation opportunistically utilised more abundant shallow soil water arising from more frequent, intense rainfall events, rather than relying on subsurface water. At the inter-annual scale, vegetation increased frequency of subsurface water use and decreased leaf area to reduce latent heat loss in response to dry conditions. Then, during wet years, subsurface water use by vegetation decreased in frequency as water was increasingly sourced from shallow soil layers. However, despite preceding dry periods of different severity, and exhibiting different average annual rainfall, air temperatures and reduction in the frequency of subsurface water use by vegetation, leaf area increased by approximately the same amount for both ‘recovery’ years. This suggests that investment in canopy leaf growth by this vegetation was more sensitive to the onset of increased water availability after drought rather than the overall volume of water made available by rainfall. © 2017","Drought; Groundwater-dependent vegetation; Land surface temperature; Vegetation response","agrometeorology; drought; evergreen tree; groundwater; land surface; physiological response; shallow soil; subsurface flow; subtropical region; surface temperature; vegetation dynamics; water availability; water use efficiency; woodland; Australia; Queensland",2-s2.0-85031711846

These changes are expected to have important environmental and ecological consequences. However, high spatiotemporal variability has been reported in previous studies, and the underlying mechanisms remain inadequately understood. This study assessed variation in the properties of stream water DOM within watersheds across a gradient of agricultural land use with grazing pasture lands as the dominant agricultural type in the southeastern United States. We collected water samples under baseflow conditions five times over eight months from a regional group of first- to fourth-order streams. Samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, DOM quality based on absorbance and fluorescence properties, as well as DOM biodegradability. We found that air temperature and antecedent hydrological conditions (indicated by antecedent precipitation index and stream water sodium concentrations) positively influenced stream water DOC concentration, DOM fluorescence index, and the proportion of soil-derived, microbial humic fluorescence. This observation suggests that elevated production and release of microbial DOM in soils facilitated by high temperature, in conjunction with strong soil-stream hydrological connectivity, were important drivers for changes in the concentration and composition of stream water DOM. By comparison, watersheds with a high percentage of agricultural land use showed higher DOC concentration, larger proportion of soil-derived, humic-like DOM compounds, and higher DOC biodegradability. These observations reflect preferential mobilization of humic DOM compounds from shallow organic matter-rich soils in agricultural watersheds, likely due to enhanced soil erosion, organic matter oxidation and relatively shallow soil-to-stream flow paths. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","DOM biodegradability; DOM optical property; Excitation emission matrix-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC); Flow path; Microbial DOM; Stream water","Agriculture; Biodegradability; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Dissolution; Ecology; Fluorescence; Land use; Optical properties; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Soils; Stream flow; Water analysis; Watersheds; Dissolved organic matters; Flow path; Hydrological connectivity; Microbial DOM; Organic matter oxidation; Parallel factor analysis; Spatiotemporal variability; Stream water; Rivers; dissolved organic matter; sodium; agricultural land; biodegradation; climate effect; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; flow field; land use; lotic environment; mobilization; streamwater; water quality; watershed; agricultural land; air temperature; Article; biodegradability; climate; concentration (parameters); filtration; fluorescence; grazing; hydrology; land use; oxidation; pastureland; precipitation; priority journal; soil erosion; United States; water sampling; watershed; United States",2-s2.0-85029178238

Adaptations to drainage regimes are one of the most promising options for methane mitigation in rice production. Whereas several studies have focused on mid-season drainage (MD) to mitigate GHG emissions, early-season drainage (ED) varying in timing and duration has not been extensively studied. However, such ED periods could potentially be very effective since initial available C levels (and thereby the potential for methanogenesis) can be very high in paddy systems with rice straw incorporation. This study tested the effectiveness of seven drainage regimes varying in their timing and duration (combinations of ED and MD) to mitigate CH4 and N2O emissions in a 101-day growth chamber experiment. Emissions were considerably reduced by early-season drainage compared to both conventional continuous flooding (CF) and the MD drainage regime. The results suggest that ED + MD drainage may have the potential to reduce CH4 emissions and yield-scaled GWP by 85–90% compared to CF and by 75–77% compared to MD only. A combination of (short or long) ED drainage and one MD drainage episode was found to be the most effective in mitigating CH4 emissions without negatively affecting yield. In particular, compared with CF, the long early-season drainage treatments LE + SM and LE + LM significantly (p &lt; 0.01) decreased yield-scaled GWP by 85% and 87% respectively. This was associated with carbon being stabilised early in the season, thereby reducing available C for methanogenesis. Overall N2O emissions were small and not significantly affected by ED. It is concluded that ED + MD drainage might be an effective low-tech option for small-scale farmers to reduce GHG emissions and save water while maintaining yield. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Drainage timing and duration; Global warming potential; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Redox potential; Rice straw management","Carbon; Gas emissions; Global warming; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Redox reactions; Global warming potential; Increase productions; Mid-season drainage; Nitrous oxide; Redox potentials; Rice production systems; Rice straws; Small scale farmers; Greenhouse gases; carbon; methane; nitrous oxide; crop yield; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; paddy field; redox potential; rice; agricultural land; Article; biomass; controlled study; crop production; flooding; grain yield; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); methanogenesis; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; pollution control; priority journal; rice; seasonal variation; time factor; water management; water supply",2-s2.0-85028960597

In the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP)-Brazil, several studies have been performed to identify sources for PM, revealing vehicular emissions and soil re-suspension as the main identified sources. The organic fraction has been related primarily to biomass burning (BB) and fuel combustion, although there is significant presence of green areas in the city which render biogenic emissions as an additional source of organic carbon (OC). The objectives of this work are to (i) characterise the composition of the PM10 (ii) estimate the relative mass contribution of fungal spores to PM concentrations with sizes smaller than 10 μm (PM10) in MASP and (iii) assess the main sources of PM10. To achieve these objectives, we measured markers of biogenic sources and BB, during the fall-winter transition, which along with other constituents, such as ions, organic/elemental carbon, elemental composition and fungal spore concentrations, help assess the PM10 sources. We used receptor models to identify distinct source-related PM10 fractions and conversion factors to convert biomarker concentrations to fungal mass. Our results show the mean contributions of fungal aerosol to PM10 and OC mass were 2% and 8%, respectively, indicating the importance of fungal spores to the aerosol burden in the urban atmosphere. Using specific rotation factor analysis, we identified the following factors contributing to PM: soil re-suspension, biogenic aerosol, secondary inorganic aerosol, vehicular emissions and BB/isoprene-related secondary organic aerosol (I-SOA). BB/I-SOA was the main source representing 28% of the PM10 mass, while biogenic aerosol explained a significant (11%) fraction of the PM10 mass as well.

The mean concentration of most metals, except As and Mn, exceeded their corresponding background values, with the mean concentration of Cd being 8 times that of its background. Spatially, for most heavy metals, except As and Mn, the high concentration areas were mainly within the 5th ring road, especially the northern area. The geo-accumulation index of Cd and Cu indicated moderate contamination at many sites. The entire study area was prone to potential ecological risks, with higher risks within the 4th ring road. Cd caused high potential ecological risk at most sites. According to the health risk assessment results, the non-carcinogenic risks that human beings suffered from heavy metals were insignificant. However, the carcinogenic risks due to Ni and Cr exceeded the acceptable level. Based on the source apportionment using positive matrix factorization, four factors were defined for the heavy metals. Factor 1, which was traffic-related exhaust, accounted for 34.47% of the concentration of heavy metals. The contributions of Factors 2 and 3 were approximately 25% each. Factor 2 was potentially related to coal combustion, while Factor 3 could be related to the manufacture and use of metal components.

Over recent years, several authors have summarized what is known in critical reviews mainly focused on reciprocating machines in general or on specific signal processing techniques: no attempts to deal with IC engine condition monitoring have been made. This paper first gives a brief summary of the generation of sound and vibration in ICEs in order to place further discussion on fault vibro-acoustic diagnosis in context. An overview of the monitoring and diagnostic techniques described in literature using both vibration and acoustic signals is also provided. Different faulty conditions are described which affect combustion, mechanics and the aerodynamics of ICEs. The importance of measuring acoustic signals, as opposed to vibration signals, is due since the former seem to be more suitable for implementation on on-board monitoring systems in view of their non-intrusive behaviour, capability in simultaneously capturing signatures from several mechanical components and because of the possibility of detecting faults affecting airborne transmission paths. In view of the recent needs of the industry to (−) optimize component structural durability adopting long-life cycles, (−) verify the engine final status at the end of the assembly line and (−) reduce the maintenance costs monitoring the ICE life during vehicle operations, monitoring and diagnosing system requests are continuously growing up. The present review can be considered a useful guideline for test engineers in understanding which types of fault can be diagnosed by using vibro-acoustic signals in sufficient time in both test bench and operating conditions and which transducer and signal processing technique (of which the essential background theory is here reported) could be considered the most reliable and informative to be implemented for the fault in question. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Condition monitoring; Diagnostics; Internal Combustion Engines; Signal processing techniques; Vibro-acoustic signals","Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustic waves; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Engines; Fault detection; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Monitoring; Plasma diagnostics; Signal processing; Vibrations (mechanical); Airborne transmission; Internal combustion engines (ICEs); Mechanical components; Monitoring and diagnostics; On-board monitoring systems; Signal processing technique; Vehicle operating conditions; Vibroacoustics; Condition monitoring",2-s2.0-85026869731

The current meta-analysis investigates if these contradictory findings are a result of differences between studies in methodological approaches towards the assessment of stress and depression. Methods After performing a systematic database search (February to December 2016), first, a meta-analysis was used to investigate the total effect size and publication bias. Second, stratified meta-analyses were used to investigate the potential moderating influence of different methodological approaches on heterogeneity of study findings. Third, a meta-regression was used to investigate the combined influence of the methodological approaches on the overall effect size. Results Results showed a small but significant effect of 5-HTTLPR in interaction with stress in the prediction of depression (OR[95%CI] = 1.18[1.09; 1.28], n = 48 effect sizes from 51 studies, totaling 51,449 participants). There was no evidence of publication bias. Heterogeneity of effect sizes was a result of outliers and not due to different methodological approaches towards the assessment of stress and depression. Yet, there was some evidence that studies adopting a categorical and interview approach to the assessment of stress report higher GxE effects, but further replication of this finding is needed. Limitations A large amount of heterogeneity (i.e., 46%) was not explained by the methodological factors included in the study and there was a low response rate of invited studies.

The present fMRI study characterizes the response profile of TPJ to elucidate its role in action observation. Participants observed naturalistic and pixelized object-directed actions from a 3pp and 1pp. Critically, in the pixelized condition the action goal could only be inferred from the movement kinematics. Both left and right TPJ revealed an interaction: Neural activity in TPJ was enhanced for 3pp vs. 1pp actions in the naturalistic but not pixelized condition. This finding contradicts theories proposing that TPJ is generally involved in transforming the action into the observer's perspective to match perceived body movements with visuomotor representations in the observer's motor system, which would be particularly required when actions can only be inferred from movement kinematics.

We have developed logistic regression models fitted by the historical land use changes to select and score each potential factor, and used the Entropy method to determine weights for the selected factors. The MCE output is then used as the input of CA-Markov model to simulate land use changes from 2001 to 2011. The land use simulation result was compared against observed 2011 land use in order to examine the performance of the updated MCE method. The result shows that the use of MCE factors derived from historical data produces reasonable goodness of fit, based on current literature. The major advantage of the updated MCE method is that the factor selection, scores, and weights are all derived from local data reflecting the actual historical trend.

It is shown that: 1) this rainforest constitutes an economic resource and plays a major socio-cultural role in addition to its global climate regulatory role, 2) an overexploitation of the forest resources for economic purposes exposes the forest to an increased deterioration which can change the ecological and socio-economic balance, or destroy this forest, and by so doing, alter its global climate control power, 3) the climate of the region is experiencing serious variability. Thus, solutions that can satisfy socio-economic needs and give room for sustainable development are proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Central Africa; Economic needs; Equatorial rainforest; Global climate regulator; Sustainable development","Central Africa; deterioration; economic development; global climate; rain forest; sustainable development",2-s2.0-85031825139

In addition, we investigated the putative moderating effects of prescription for lithium, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and/or first- or second-generation antipsychotic agents on the association between BD and risk of road injury. Method As part of an16-year longitudinal cohort study, we compared the risk of road injuries among study subjects aged 16 and above with a diagnosis of BD, with ten age- and sex-matched sample of individuals without BD. Individuals were compared on measures of incidence on road injuries using medical claims data based on the ICD-9-CM codes: E800~807, E810~817, E819~830, E840~848. Time dependent Cox regression models were used to adjust for time-varying covariates such as age, and medication uses. Hazard ratios before and after adjusting for age, sex, other comorbidities, and drug use were calculated. Results 3953 people with BD were matched with 39,530 controls from general population. Adjusted hazard ratios revealed a 1.66-fold (95% CI 1.40–1.97) increase in risk of road injuries among bipolar subjects when compared to controls. Female gender, older age (i.e. over 80), residence in areas of highest levels of urbanization, and use of antidepressants were associated with a lower risk of road injuries. Conclusions In this large, national, population-based cohort, BD was associated with an elevated risk of road injuries. However, prescriptions of antidepressants might help mitigate the foregoing risk. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anticonvulsants; Antidepressant; Antipsychotic; Bipolar; Lithium; Road injuries; Traffic accidents","anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; antihistaminic agent; benzodiazepine; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; corticosteroid; lithium; mood stabilizer; neuroleptic agent; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; bipolar disorder; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; drug use; female; hazard ratio; human; ICD-9-CM; incidence; injury; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prescription; priority journal; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; sex; traffic accident; urbanization; very elderly",2-s2.0-85030466810

However, little research has been conducted on dual pressure from climate and land cover changes on biodiversity in arid and semi-arid environments. Concequntly, it is crutial to understand the potential impacts of future climate and land cover changes on dryland biodiversity. Here, using the Chinese Altai Mountains as a case study area, we predicted the future spatial distributions and local assemblages of nine threatened mammal species under projected climate and land cover change scenarios for the period 2010–2050. The results show that remarkable declines in mammal species richness as well as high rates of species turnover are seen to occur across large areas in the Chinese Altai Mountains, highlighting an urgent need for developing protection strategies for areas outside of current nature reserve network. The selected mammals are predicted to lose more than 50% of their current ranges on average, which is much higher than species' range gains (around 15%) under future climate and land cover changes. Most of the species are predicted to contract their ranges while moving eastwards and to higher altitudes, raising the need for establishing cross-border migration pathways for species. Furthermore, the inclusion of land cover changes had notable effects on projected range shifts of individual species under climate changes, demonstrating that land cover changes should be incorporated into the assessment of future climate impacts to facilitate biodiversity conservation in arid and semi-arid environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Land cover change; Range shifts; Semi-arid region; Species richness; Threatened species","Biodiversity; Conservation; Forestry; Landforms; Mammals; Land-cover change; RANGE shifts; Semi-arid region; Species richness; Threatened species; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; endangered species; land cover; land use change; mammal; range expansion; semiarid region; species richness; vegetation dynamics; altitude; Article; biodiversity; China; climate change; environmental change; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; geographic distribution; land use; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; semiarid climate; species distribution; species identification; Altai Mountains; China; Mammalia",2-s2.0-85028618913

However, this common practice may not always account for the interdependencies among ROIs of the same network or potentially unique information at the ROI-level, respectively. To account for both sources of information, we combined measurement and structural components of structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches to empirically derive networks from ROI activity, and to assess the association of both individual ROIs and their respective whole-brain activation networks with task performance using three large task-fMRI datasets and two separate brain parcellation schemes. The results for working memory and relational tasks revealed that well-known ROI-performance associations are either non-significant or reversed when accounting for the ROI's common association with its corresponding network, and that the network as a whole is instead robustly associated with task performance. The results for the arithmetic task revealed that in certain cases, an ROI can be robustly associated with task performance, even when accounting for its associated network.

To assess the quality of an HSI cube, the structural similarity (SSIM) index has been widely applied in a band-by-band manner, as SSIM was originally designed for 2D images, and then the mean SSIM (MeanSSIM) index over all bands is adopted. MeanSSIM fails to accommodate the spectral structure which is a unique characteristic of HSI. Hence in this paper, we propose a new and simple multivariate SSIM (MvSSIM) index for HSI, by treating the pixel spectrum as a multivariate random vector. MvSSIM maintains SSIM's ability to assess the spatial structural similarity via correlation between two images of the same band; and adds an ability to assess the spectral structural similarity via covariance among different bands. MvSSIM is well founded on multivariate statistics and can be easily implemented through simple sample statistics involving mean vectors, covariance matrices and cross-covariance matrices.

For person re-identification, feature description is a fundamental problem. While many approaches focus on exploiting low-level features to describe person images, most of them are not robust enough to illumination and viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective feature description method for person re-identification. Starting from low-level features, the proposed method uses perceptual hashing to binarize low-level feature maps and combines several feature channels for feature encoding. Then, an image pyramid is built, and three regional statistics are computed for hierarchical feature description. To some extent, the perceptual hash algorithm (PHA) can encode invariant macro structures of person images to make the representation robust to both illumination and viewpoint changes. On the other hand, while a rough hashing may be not discriminative enough, the combination of several different feature channels and regional statistics is able to exploit complementary information and enhance the discriminability. The proposed approach is evaluated on seven major person re-identification datasets. The results of comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method and notable improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2017","Hierarchical feature description; Image pyramid; Person re-identification; Regional statistics; The perceptual hash algorithm (PHA)","Encoding (symbols); Hash functions; Feature description; Hierarchical features; Image pyramids; Low-level features; Perceptual hash; Person re identifications; State-of-the-art approach; Video surveillance systems; Security systems",2-s2.0-85025478825

The current approaches are usually to achieve between-group sparsity using the ℓ1 penalty, such that many groups have small coefficients rather than being accurately zeroed out. The trivial groups may incur the proneness to overfitting of noise and are thereby harmful to interpretability of sparse representation. To this end, we in this paper reformulate the hierarchical sparse model from a Bayesian perspective employing twofold priors: the spike-and-slab prior and the Laplacian prior. The former is utilized to explicitly induce between-group sparsity, while the latter is adopted for both inducing within-group sparsity and obtaining a small reconstruction error. We propose a nest prior by integrating the both priors to result in hierarchical sparsity. The resultant optimization problem can be delivered a convergence solution in a few iterations via the proposed nested algorithm, corresponding to the nested prior. In experiments, we evaluate the performance of our method on signal recovery, image inpainting and sparse representation based classification, with simulated signals and two publicly available image databases.

However, its encoding coefficients do not always reveal a satisfactory cluster structure. To improve its effectiveness, a novel evolutionary strategy is proposed here to drive the iterative updating scheme of NMF and generate encoding coefficients of higher quality that are capable of offering more accurate and sharper cluster structures. The proposed hybridization procedure that relies on multiple initializations reinforces the robustness of the solution. Additionally, three evolving rules are designed to simultaneously boost the cluster quality and the reconstruction error during the iterative updates. Any clustering performance measure, such as either an internal one relying on the data itself or an external based on the availability of ground truth information, can be employed to drive the evolving procedure.

AFPs are supposed to be evolved from different types of protein families to perform the unique function of antifreeze activity and turn out to be the classical example of convergent evolution. The common sequence similarity search methods have failed to predict putative AFPs due to poor sequence and structural similarity that exists among the different sub-types of AFP. The machine learning techniques are the viable alternative approaches to predict putative AFPs. In this paper, we have discussed about the criteria (like apposite feature selection, balanced data sets and complete learning) that are needed to be taken into account for successful application of machine learning methods and implemented these criteria by using a clustering procedure in order to achieve the true performance of the learning algorithms. Diversified and representative training and testing data sets are very crucial for perfect learning as well as true testing of machine learning based prediction methods for two reasons: first is that a training dataset that lacks definable subset of input patterns makes prediction of patterns belonging to this subset either difficult or unfeasible (thus resulting in incomplete learning) and secondly a testing data set that lacks definable subset of input patterns does not tell about whether this subset of patterns can be correctly predicted by the classifier or not (thus resulting in incomplete testing). Moreover, balanced training and testing data sets are equally important for achieving the true (robust) performance of classifiers because a well-balanced training set eliminates bias of the classifier toward particular class/sub-class due to over-representation or under-representation of input patterns belonging to those classes/sub-classes. We have used K-means clustering algorithm for creating the diversified and balanced training as well as testing data sets, to overcome the shortcoming of random splitting, which cannot guarantee representative training and testing sets. The current clustering based optimal splitting criteria proved to be better than random splitting for creating training and testing set in terms of superior generalization and robust evaluation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Antifreeze proteins; Imbalance data set; Incomplete learning; K-means clustering; Physicochemical-n-grams; Representative training set","Artificial intelligence; Biology; Clustering algorithms; Education; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Proteins; Set theory; Speech recognition; Statistical tests; Antifreeze protein; Imbalance datum; Incomplete learning; K-means clustering; N-grams; Training sets; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85023601684

Administration of LWWL is well known for its protective effects on the liver and its capacity to confer long-term stability in patients exhibiting reduced transaminase levels. Clinical studies have reported that LWWL can also be used for the treatment of liver fibrosis with associated treatment regimens resulting in a concomitant reduction in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) levels in the serum of patients with hepatic fibrosis. TGF-β1 plays a prominent role in stimulating liver fibrogenesis and this effect is mediated by myofibroblasts (MFB) derived from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). It is likely that this phenomenon underpins the antifibrotic effects associated with LWWL. Aim The purpose of this study was to investigate the antifibrotic effects and mechanisms pertaining to LWWL. Methods Hepatic fibrosis was induced in rats following bile duct ligation (BDL). Rats that underwent BDL received daily gavage administration of colchicine (0.2 mg/kg per day), LWWL (0.4, 1.6, 6.4 g/kg per day) or PBS (for the control group). Pathological changes in hepatic tissue were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and sirius red staining. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to monitor α-SMA and type I collagen (Collagen I) protein expression. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analyses were used to monitor the expression of genes and proteins in the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, including TGF-β1, bone morphogenic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (Bambi), Smad3, phosphorylated Smad3 (p-Smad3) and Smad7. We also monitored the expression of genes and proteins in the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, including NF-κB p65, IκBα and phosphorylation of IκBα (p-IκBα), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Results LWWL dose-dependently inhibited BDL-induced liver injury and hepatic fibrosis in rats. Furthermore, LWWL reduced liver tissue collagen deposition, hydroxyproline content, liver dysfunction and α-SMA expression in BDL-induced hepatic fibrosis rats. Moreover, LWWL markedly prevented activation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway by inhibiting expression of Smad2/3 and phosphorylation of Smad3, and upregulating the expression of Bambi and Smad7. In addition, LWWL regulated the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB p65 and the phosphorylation of IκBα, and increasing the expression of IκBα. Conclusions LWWL can attenuate BDL-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats, and this effect may be due to modulation of the NF-κB-dependent inflammatory response and activation of HSC and TGF-β/Smad-mediated synthesis and degradation of Collagen I. © 2017","Bambi; Hepatic fibrosis; Liuweiwuling tablets; NF-κB; TGF-β/Smad; Traditional Chinese Medicine","activin; alpha smooth muscle actin; antifibrotic agent; bone morphogenetic protein; bone morphogenic protein and activin membrane bound inhibitor; Chinese drug; colchicine; collagen type 1; collagenase 3; eosin; gelatinase A; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hematoxylin; hydroxyproline; I kappa B kinase alpha; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; liuweiwuling; platelet derived growth factor; Smad protein; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; Smad7 protein; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2; transcription factor RelA; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bile duct ligation; collagen degradation; complex formation; controlled study; dose response; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug megadose; experimental liver fibrosis; experimental liver injury; extracellular matrix; fibrogenesis; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; liver dysfunction; liver tissue; low drug dose; male; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; quantitative assay; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; tablet; upregulation; Western blotting",2-s2.0-85028929199

G. Lee & C. F. Liang (Guangxi ezhu, in Chinese) belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, has been used as a traditionally Chinese medicine nearly 2000 year. Curcumol is one of the guaiane-type sesquiterpenoid hemiketal isolated from medicine plant Curcuma kwangsiensis S. G. Lee & C. F. Liang, which has been reported possesses anti-cancer effects. Our previous study found that the most contribution to inhibit nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell growth was curcumol. Aim of the study To assess the effect of curcumol on cell cycle arrest against human colon cancer cells (CRC) cells (LoVo and SW480) and explore its mechanism in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods Curcumol was dissolved in absolute ethyl alcohol. The concentration of absolute ethyl alcohol in the control group or in experimental samples was always 1/500 (v/v) of the final medium volume. LoVo and SW480 cells were treated with different concentrations of curcumol (0, 53, 106, 212 and 424 μM). And then the cell cycle of each group was examined by flow cytometry. The protein levels of PI3K, p-Akt, cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK2, CDK4 and GSK3β were determined by Western blot. The mRNA expression of PI3K, Akt, cyclin D1, CDK4, P27, p21, and P16 in the treated cells were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, the antitumor activity of curcumol was evaluated in nude mice bearing orthotopic tumor implants. Results Curcumol induced cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase. RT-qPCR and Western blot data showed that curcumol enhanced the expression of GSK3β, P27, p21 and P16, and decreased the levels of PI3K, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E and CDK2. Furthermore, curcumol induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in LoVo cells, and ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly reversed curcumol-induced cell growth inhibition. Besides, curcumol also prevented the growth of human colon cancer cells xenografts in nude mouse, accompanied by the reduction of PI3K, Akt, cyclin D1, CDK4, cycln E and significant increase of GSK3β. Conclusions Curcumol caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase by ROS production and Akt/ GSK3β/cyclin D1 pathways inactivation, indicating the potential of curcumol in the prevention of colon cancer carcinogenesis. © 2017","Akt; Cell cycle; Colon cancer; Curcumol; Cyclin D1; ROS","acetylcysteine; alcohol; antineoplastic agent; curcumol; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase 2; cyclin dependent kinase 4; cyclin E; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; messenger RNA; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; propylene glycol; protein kinase B; protein p16; protein p21; protein p27; reactive oxygen metabolite; sesquiterpenoid; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer graft; cancer inhibition; cell growth; clinical assessment; concentration process; controlled study; Curcuma; Curcuma kwangsiensis; drug effect; drug mechanism; flow cytometry; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; LoVo cell line; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; SW480 cell line; Western blotting",2-s2.0-85029367819

However, there is no scientific evidence demonstrating this activity. Aim of the study To evaluate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and antimycobacterial activities of the essential oil of P. guineense and spathulenol (a major constituent). The study was conducted in part to provide evidence supporting the ethnobotanical use of the leaves of this species. Material and methods The essential oil (EOPG) was extracted from the leaves of P. guineense by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The major compound, spathulenol (PG-1), was isolated in a chromatographic column and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). EOPG and PG-1 were evaluated in vitro for antioxidant activity by DPPH, ABTS and MDA methods; anti-inflammatory potential was assessed using two models, including pleurisy and oedema, in mice. The impact of EOPG and PG-1 on cell proliferation was determined via spectrophotometric quantification of the cellular protein content using a sulforhodamine B assay, and anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis activity was determined using the REMA method. Results A total of 38 components were identified from the EOPG, with the sesquiterpenic alcohol spathulenol (PG-1) (80.7%) being the major constituent. EOPG and PG-1 exhibited the highest antioxidant activities in the DPPH and MDA system compared with reference standard, with IC50 values ranging from 26.13 to 85.60 μg/mL. Oral administration of EOPG and PG-1 showed significant inhibition in the Cg-induced mice paw oedema and pleurisy model. The EOPG (GI50 = 0.89 μg/mL) and PG-1 (GI50 = 49.30 μg/mL) were particularly effective against the ovarian cancer cell line. Both showed moderate antimycobacterial activity.

Previously, the effective components of Ganoderma lucidum extract (GLE) were extracted from two kinds of GL, Ganoderma lucidum (Leyss. Ex Fr.) Karst. and Ganoderma sinense Zhao, Xu et Zhang, which have been used for adjuvant anti-cancer clinical therapy for more than 20 years. However, its concrete active components and its regulation mechanisms on tumor are unclear. Aim of the study In this study, we aimed to identify the main active compounds from GLE and to investigate its anti-cancer mechanisms via drug-target biological network construction and prediction. Materials and methods The main active compounds of GLE were identified by HPLC, EI-MS and NMR, and the compounds related targets were predicted using docking program. To investigate the functions of GL holistically, the whole active components of GL and related targets were predicted based on four public databases. Subsequently, the compound-target network and component-target network were constructed respectively, and they were overlapped to detect the kernel potential targets in both networks. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR was used to validate the expression levels of target genes in GLE treated Hepa1-6-bearing C57 BL/6 mice. Results In our work, 12 active compounds of GLE were identified, including Ganoderic acid A, Ganoderenic acid A, Ganoderic acid B, Ganoderic acid H, Ganoderic acid C2, ganoderenic acid D, Ganoderic acid D, Ganoderenic acid G, Ganoderic acid Y, Kaemferol, Genistein and Ergosterol. Using the docking program, 20 targets were mapped to 12 compounds of GLE. Furthermore, 122 effective active components of GL and 116 targets were holistically predicted using public databases. Compare with the compound-target network and component-target network, 6 kernel targets were screened, including AR, CHRM2, ESR1, NR3C1, NR3C2 and PGR, which was considered as potential markers and might play important roles in the process of GLE treatment. GLE effectively inhibited tumor growth in Hepa1-6-bearing C57 BL/6 mice. Moreover, qRT-PCR data demonstrated the expression levels of NR3C1, NR3C2 and AR are up-regulated and PGR, ESR1 and CHRM2 are down-regulated. Conclusions The results indicated that these 6 kernel target genes might act as potential markers to evaluate the curative effect of GLE treatment in tumor. The combined data provide preliminary study of the pharmacological mechanisms of GLE.

Antibody therapies, an important class of immunotherapies, involve the binding to specific antigens on the surface of the tumour cells of antibodies that activate natural killer (NK) cells to kill the tumour cells. Preclinical assessment of molecules that may cause antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) involves co-culturing cancer cells, NK cells and antibody in vitro for several hours and measuring subsequent levels of tumour cell lysis. Here we develop a mathematical model of such an in vitro ADCC assay, formulated as a system of time-dependent ordinary differential equations and in which NK cells kill cancer cells at a rate which depends on the amount of antibody bound to each cancer cell. Numerical simulations generated using experimentally-based parameter estimates reveal that the system evolves on two timescales: a fast timescale on which antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of the tumour cells, and NK cells form complexes with the cancer cells, and a longer time-scale on which the NK cells kill the cancer cells. We construct approximate model solutions on each timescale, and show that they are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results show how the processes involved in ADCC change as the initial concentration of antibody and NK-cancer cell ratio are varied. We use these results to explain what information about the tumour cell kill rate can be extracted from the cytotoxicity assays. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; Asymptotic analysis; Immunotherapy; Ordinary differential equations","antibody; cancer; cell organelle; computer simulation; cytology; numerical model; time dependent behavior; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; antigen binding; Article; cancer cell; cancer immunotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell killing; complex formation; concentration response; cytotoxicity assay; in vitro study; mathematical model; natural killer cell; priority journal; receptor binding; simulation",2-s2.0-85030679337

Sirtuin (SIRT) proteins have been shown to be differentially expressed in melanoma. We have shown that SIRTs 1 and 2 were overexpressed in melanoma and inhibition of SIRT1 imparts anti-proliferative responses in human melanoma cells. To elucidate the impact of SIRT 1 and/or 2 in melanoma, we created stable knockdowns of SIRTs 1, 2, and their combination using shRNA mediated RNA interference in A375 human melanoma cells. We found that SIRT1 and SIRT1&2 combination knockdown caused a decreased cellular proliferation in melanoma cells. Further, the knockdown of SIRT 1 and/or 2 resulted in a decreased colony formation in melanoma cells. To explore the downstream targets of SIRTs 1 and/or 2, we employed a label-free quantitative nano-LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis using the stable lines. We found aberrant levels of proteins involved in many vital cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, ribosomal activity, oxidative stress response, and angiogenesis. These findings provide clear evidence of cellular systems undergoing alterations in response to sirtuin inhibition, and have unveiled several excellent candidates for future study. Significance Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, due to its aggressive nature, metastatic potential, and a lack of sufficient treatment options for advanced disease. Therefore, detailed investigations into the molecular mechanisms of melanoma growth and progression are needed. In the search for candidate genes to serve as therapeutic targets, the sirtuins show promise as they have been found to be upregulated in melanoma and they regulate a large number of proteins involved in cellular processes known to affect tumor growth, such as DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. In this study, we used a large-scale label-free comparative proteomics system to identify novel protein targets that are affected following knockdown of SIRT1 and/or 2 in A375 metastatic melanoma cell line. Our study offers important insight into the potential downstream targets of SIRTs 1 and/or 2.

The evaluated parameters in the experimental design were volume of AuNPs, concentration of vitamins and sodium chloride concentration. The best condition for nicotinamide was NaCl 2.3 × 10− 3 mol L− 1 and 700 μL of AuNPs colloid and this same condition showed to be adequate to quantify thiamine. The experimental design for riboflavin shows the best condition at NaCl 1.15 × 10− 2 mol L− 1 and 2.8 mL of AuNPs colloid. It was possible to quantify thiamine and nicotinamide in presence of others vitamins and excipients in two solid multivitamin formulations using the standard addition procedure. The standard addition curve presented a R2 higher than 0.96 for both nicotinamide and thiamine, at orders of magnitude 10− 7 and 10− 8 mol L− 1, respectively. The nicotinamide content in a cosmetic gel sample was also quantified by direct analysis presenting R2 0.98. The t-student test presented no significant difference regarding HPLC method.

Normal spectrofluorimetric method of gliquidone was established in methanol at λ excitation 225 nm and λ emission 400 nm in concentration range 0.2–3 μg/ml with LOD equal 0.028. The fluorescence quantum yield of gliquidone was calculated using quinine sulfate as a reference and found to be 0.542. Stability-indicating first and third derivative synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy were successfully utilized to overcome the overlapped spectra in normal fluorescence of gliquidone and its alkaline degradation product. Derivative synchronous methods are based on using the synchronous fluorescence of gliquidone and its degradation product in methanol at Δ λ50 nm. Peak amplitude in the first derivative of synchronous fluorescence spectra was measured at 309 nm where degradation product showed zero-crossing without interference. The peak amplitudes in the third derivative of synchronous fluorescence spectra, peak to trough were measured at 316,329 nm where degradation product showed zero-crossing. The different experimental parameters affecting the normal and synchronous fluorescence intensity of gliquidone were studied and optimized. Moreover, the cited methods have been validated as per ICH guidelines. The peak amplitude-concentration plots of the derivative synchronous fluorescence were linear over the concentration range 0.05–2 μg/ml for gliquidone. Limits of detection were 0.020 and 0.022 in first and third derivative synchronous spectra, respectively. The adopted methods were successfully applied to commercial tablets and the results demonstrated that the derivative synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful stability-indicating method, suitable for routine use with a short analysis time.

PCR was used for microRNA and mRNA quantification, western blotting to evaluate protein expression and echocardiography to assess cardiac structure and function. CORM-3 treatment increased vascular density (P< 0.05 vs. iCORM) and the proportion of cardiomyocytes (P< 0.05 vs. iCORM) in the infarct area. Ejection fraction improved (P< 0.05) and left ventricular volumes decreased (P< 0.05) in CORM-3 treated MI groups compared to iCORM treatment. CORM-3 treatment decreased the amount of proliferating Ki67 positive cardiomyocytes in the infarct/border area at week 2 after MI compared to iCORM treatment, whereas the amount of apoptotic cardiomyocytes did not differ between CORM-3 and iCORM groups. Compared to iCORM treatment, CORM-3 decreased expression on miR-206 in the remote area at week 2 after MI.

The base circle was used to position the deposition circles. The deposition circles, distributed on or around the base circle at a specific proportion, represented the distribution of the electrospun fibers on the collector. The pore characteristics and fiber distribution were compared between the electrospun membrane and simulated membranes with different spinning times; this verified that they had similar distribution trends. A membrane was simulated with a similar magnification ratio to the actual membrane. This further verified the model.

In addition, the relaxing effect of ADTM on rat thoracic aorta and its underlying mechanisms were examined. ADTM relaxed KCl- and phenylephrine-precontracted arotic rings in a concentration-dependent manner. The relaxation by ADTM was greater than that by DSS, TMP and the mixture of DSS and TMP. ADTM induced endothelium-independent relaxation, which couldn't be abolished by removal of endothelium and the preincubation with inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (L-NAME) and guanylate cyclase (ODQ). Potassium channel blockers including tetraethylammonium, BaCl2 and glibenclamide failed to inhibit the relaxation by ADTM. In addition, cyclooxygenase (COX), muscarine receptor and β-adrenoceptor were not involved in ADTM-induced vasorelaxation. ADTM inhibited contraction induced by CaCl2 and phenylephrine in Ca2+-free buffer, suggesting that ADTM inhibited both extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release.

The resulting products were measured by spectrophotometric (Method I) and spectrofluorimetric (Method II) tools. Regarding method I, the absorbance was measured at 315 nm and 403 nm with linearity ranges of 5.0–140.0 and 10.0–100.0 μg/mL for cefixime and cefdinir, respectively. Meanwhile in method II, the produced fluorophore was measured at λem 488 nm or 491 nm after excitation at λex 410 nm with linearity ranges of 0.20–10.0 and 0.20–36.0 μg/mL for cefixime and cefdinir, respectively.

In the clinical practice, such a dynamic flux of information allows the physician to identify and appreciate alterations associated to biochemical pathways of specific organs. In the years, many biochemical assays have been developed to detect, selectively, this vast array of molecules. Methods The Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectrum allows the identification and quantification of more than 30 RBC-associated metabolites with minimum manipulation of the sample. To validate the use of 1H NMR spectroscopy for quality control purposes in transfusion medicine, a series of statistical tools have been employed to analyse and compare accuracy and precision of the 1H NMR results with respect to the ones obtained by standard biochemical assays. Results Among the many metabolites that can be detected and quantified by 1H NMR spectroscopy we selected creatinine and lactate, since they are routinely quantified by standard biochemical assays and because they are characterized by a wide concentration dynamic range. We show that 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy is an accurate a precise method for metabolite quantification. Conclusion These results validate the use of 1H NMR spectroscopy in transfusion medicine as a method to evaluate the quality of RBC packed units and to develop novel and more efficient RBCs storage protocols. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","1H NMR quantification; Biochemical assay; RBC analysis; Statistical validation",,2-s2.0-85021157697

This can be achieved through the development of rapid, efficient and versatile analytical methods able to perform qualification or quantification tasks along the manufacturing and control process. Process monitoring, capable of providing reliable real-time insights into the processes performance during the manufacturing of solid dosage forms, are the key to improve such understanding. In response to these demands, in recent times multivariate chemometrics algorithms have been increasingly associated to different analytical techniques, mainly vibrational spectroscopies [Raman, mid-infrared (MIR), near-infrared (NIR)], but also ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and other methodologies. The resulting associations have been applied to the characterization and evaluation of different aspects of pharmaceutical materials at the solid state. This review examines the different scenarios where these methodological marriages have been successful. The list of analytical problems and regulatory demands solved by chemometrics analysis of solid-state multivariate data covers the whole manufacturing and control processes of both, active pharmaceutical ingredients in bulk and in their drug products. Hence, these combinations have found use in monitoring the crystallization processes of drugs and supramolecular drug associations (co-crystals, co-amorphous and salts), to access the correct crystal morphology, particle size, solubility and dissolution properties. In addition, they have been applied to identify and quantitate specific compounds, mainly active pharmaceutical ingredients in complex solid state mixtures. This included drug stability against different stimuli, solid-state transformations, or detection of adulterated or fraudulent medicines. The use of chemometrics-assisted analytical methods as part of the modern concept of process analytical technology, where every process step of every product batch from raw materials to final product must take place in a controlled manner is discussed. Finally, but no less important, the application of chemometrics methods to chemical imaging, aiming to extract spatial and compositional information is also revised. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Characterization of the solid-state; Chemical imaging; Chemometrics; PAT; Quality control and stability; Vibrational spectroscopies and XRPD",,2-s2.0-85021770441

Although most patients with cancer suffer from anorexia during chemotherapy, resulting in the need to suspend or cease treatment and thereby worsening prognosis, treatment options for anorexia remain limited. Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone that has been proposed to prevent anorexia. To investigate the potential of ghrelin receptor agonists, synthetic small-molecule compounds, as preventive therapies for chemotherapy-induced anorexia, we studied the effects of Z-505 hydrochloride (Z-505), a new oral growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a) agonist, in cisplatin- and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced anorexia animal models. The agonistic activity of Z-505 was examined using calcium flux assays in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells stably expressing rat or mouse GHSR1a. Z-505 showed agonistic activity for rat GHSR1a and mouse GHSR1a, with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 2.08 nM and 5.46 nM, respectively. In a cisplatin-induced anorexia rat model, administration of Z-505 (30, 100 or 300 mg/kg, p.o., once daily) significantly improved the cisplatin-induced reduction in food intake and body weight. In addition, treatment with Z-505 (100 or 300 mg/kg, p.o., once daily) prevented the 5-FU-induced decrease in food intake and body weight in the 5-FU-induced mouse model. Our results demonstrate that Z-505 ameliorates cisplatin- and 5-FU-induced anorexia through the activation of the ghrelin receptor, GHSR1a, suggesting its usefulness in the preventive treatment of anorexia during chemotherapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anorexia; Chemotherapy; Ghrelin; GHSR1a; Z-505",,2-s2.0-85032267310

While numerous efforts have been initiated to reduce their presence, PQMs are still risking the lives of those seeking treatment. This review addresses the importance of characterising results of antimalarial medicine field surveys based upon the agreement of clearly defined definitions. Medicines found to be of poor quality can be falsified or counterfeit, substandard or degraded. The distinction between these categories is important as each category requires a different countermeasure. To observe the current trends in the reporting of field surveys, a systematic literature search of six academic databases resulted in the quantitative analysis of 61 full-text journal articles. Information including sample size, sampling method, geographical regions, analytical techniques, and characterisation conclusions was observed for each. The lack of an accepted uniform reporting system has resulted in varying, incomplete reports, which may not include important information that helps form effective countermeasures. The programmes influencing medicine quality such as prequalification, procurement services, awareness and education can be supported with the information derived from characterised results. The implementation of checklists such as the Medicine Quality Assessment Reporting Guidelines will further strengthen the battle against poor-quality antimalarials. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Antimalarial; Characterisation; Countermeasure; Field survey; Poor-quality; Review",,2-s2.0-85019630202

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK2) modeling is the most potent in silico tool used for extrapolation of pharmacokinetic parameters to animal or human models from results obtained in vitro. Although, many types of in vitro assays are conducted during drug development, use of cell cultures is the most reliable one. Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures have been a part of drug development for many years. Nowadays, their role is decreasing in favor of three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures and co-cultures. 3D cultures exhibit protein expression patterns and intercellular junctions that are closer to in vivo states in comparison to classical monolayer cultures. Co-cultures allow for examinations of the mutual influence of different cell lines. However, the complexity and high costs of co-cultures and 3D equipment exclude such methods from high-throughput screening (HTS).3 In vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion assessment, as well as drug-drug interaction (DDI), are usually performed with the use of various cell culture based assays.

With this in mind, a research study comprised of three experiments was conducted focused on cultivar selection for berry yield, number, sweetness and phytonutrient content. Using a capillary mat system with under bench heating within a double-layer polyethylene greenhouse, strawberries were grown in the Great Plains Region of the US during the winter. During experiment 1, 12 cultivars were grown; berries were weighed, counted and analyzed for sugars and phytonutrients. ‘Albion’ plants produced a high number/mass of berries, had relatively high sugar content but a lower level of phytonutrients when compared to other cultivars. Sugar and phytonutrients concentrations overlapped across cultivars and thus, one cultivar could not be statistically singled out as best. As all cultivars flowered and fruited, two additional 8-month-long experiments were conducted. It took only 7 weeks from potting of dormant crowns for most cultivars to produce fruit. Certain cultivars fruited more successfully during certain months than others, but this was not associated with response time. For example,’ ‘Albion’, ‘Chandler’, ‘Darselect’, ‘Evie-2′ and 'seascape’ plants consistently produced fruit October to early January while ‘AC Wendy’, ‘Cavendish’, ‘Honeoye’ and 'strawberry Festival’ plants mainly produced berries in March/April. Summed over experiment 2, ‘Albion’, ‘ Cavendish’, ‘Chandler’, ‘ Evie-2’, ‘Portola’ and 'seascape’ plants produced the greatest mass of berries. ‘AC Wendy’ and ‘Darselect’ berries contained some of the highest levels of sugars while berries from ‘Chandler’, ‘Darselect’, ‘Evie-2′, 'seascape’ and 'strawberry Festival’ had some of the highest phytonutrient values. In the third experiment, of the 8 selected cultivars, ‘Evie-2′, ‘Evie−2+’ and ‘Portola’ plants had the highest total yield and average berry mass/plant. 'seascape’ and’ Chandler’ plants were second in total production. Glucose, fructose and sucrose levels varied across cultivars with ‘Chandler’ and 'seascape’ berries possessing the lowest level of total sugars. Phytonutrient values varied among cultivars with some having better flavonoids ('seascape’), phenols ('seascape’ and ‘Chandler’) and ant oxidant capacity ('seascape’, ‘Evie-2’ and ‘Cavendish’). Measurement of soluble solids concentration varied by week among the cultivars with 'seascape’, 'seascape+”, and “Albion” berries possessing higher levels than other cultivars such as ’Cavendish’.

Until 2008, Sweden seemed to have managed a shift toward flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), i.e. vehicles that can be driven on a combination of ethanol and gasoline. Every year, sale shares increased, reaching in 2008 almost 25% of the market. But then, the sales dropped to 5% of new sold cars in 2011. In this paper, the development of the flex-fuel market is analyzed by studying the underlying factors such as the market of FFVs and other “green vehicles,” fuel prices, national and local incentives, fueling stations, and the reporting of ethanol as a fuel in media. These factors are then analyzed through econometric analysis of a time series of share of FFVs sales in Sweden between 2002 and 2011 and descriptive statistics of municipal data of share of FFVs sales between 2005 and 2011. Findings show that fuel-efficient diesels entering the market, E85 (ethanol mixed with 15% gasoline) losing its economic advantage, and changes in the rebate structure have been the most significant factors for the decline. The effect of local incentives such as parking subsidies, fueling stations, and exemption from the congestion charging in Stockholm is harder to establish. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Alternative fueled vehicles; ethanol; flex-fuel vehicles; media; parking subsidies; subsidies","Commerce; Ethanol; Fleet operations; Fossil fuels; Fueling; Fuels; Gasoline; Sales; Time series; Time series analysis; Congestion charging; Descriptive statistics; Econometric analysis; Economic advantages; Flex-fuel; media; subsidies; Underlying factors; Vehicles",2-s2.0-85020379008

We use Gaussian Markov random fields to model the spatial effect in Munich rent data and explore some features and characteristics of the data. The potential of using spatial analysis within GAMLSS is discussed.

Atypical/extreme data have a harmful effect on the maximum likelihood estimates of the standard Tobit model parameters. Then, we need to count with diagnostic tools to evaluate the effect of extreme data. If they are detected, we must have available a Tobit model that is robust to this type of data. The family of elliptically contoured distributions has the Laplace, logistic, normal and Student-t cases as some of its members. This family has been largely used for providing generalizations of models based on the normal distribution, with excellent practical results. In particular, because the Student-t distribution has an additional parameter, we can adjust the kurtosis of the data, providing robust estimates against extreme data. We propose a methodology based on a generalization of the standard Tobit model with errors following elliptical distributions. Diagnostics in the Tobit model with elliptical errors are developed. We derive residuals and global/local influence methods considering several perturbation schemes. This is important because different diagnostic methods can detect different atypical data. We implement the proposed methodology in an R package. We illustrate the methodology with real-world econometrical data by using the R package, which shows its potential applications. The Tobit model based on the Student-t distribution with a small quantity of degrees of freedom displays an excellent performance reducing the influence of extreme cases in the maximum likelihood estimates in the application presented. It provides new empirical evidence on the capabilities of the Student-t distribution for accommodation of atypical data. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cook distance; elliptically contoured distributions; labor supply data; local influence method; maximum likelihood method; R software; residuals; Student-t distribution",,2-s2.0-85007340301

This removes potential model mis-specifications and accommodates momentum which is often observed in sports games. (2) further statistical inferences using FDA estimates will not suffer from inconsistency due to the issue of having a continuous model yet discretely sampled data.

Previous synthetic charts are constructed based on the optimization program for a specified shift size, which proves to be difficult to predict in practice. In this paper, the synthetic chart is constructed based on a new design method which takes the mean (ARL) and the standard deviation (SDRL) of the run length into consideration. The other improvement is that the exponential sub-chart is designed to ensure that the CRL sub-chart only needs a lower control limit and that the proposed synthetic chart is ARL-unbiased.

This process, which is quite complex yet fairly elegant, automatically chooses the proper USGS quadrangle, captures the corresponding 1/3 as grid points from the national elevation data set (3D Elevation Program), and adjusts elevation data to better fit water features from the National Hydrography Dataset. After additional processing, such as identifying and tagging depressions, constructing proper contours across double-line streams, and omitting contours from water bodies, contours are automatically produced for the quadrangle. The resulting contours are then compared to the contours on the original (legacy) topographic map sheets, or to the 10-m contours from the original map sheets. Where the elevation surface used to generate the contours has been derived from the previously published contours for a quadrangle, the generated contours match the legacy contours quite well.

Life cycle assessment (LCA), a widely used tool to assess the climate impacts of buildings, is seldom used for bridges. Material-specific phenomena such as concrete carbonation and biogenic carbon storage are usually unaccounted for when assessing the climate impacts from infrastructure. The purpose of this article is to explore the effects these phenomena could have on climate impact assessment of road bridges and comparisons between bridge designs. For this, a case study is used of two functionally equivalent design alternatives for a small road bridge in Sweden. Dynamic LCA is used to calculate the effects of biogenic carbon storage, while the Lagerblad method and literature values are used to estimate concrete carbonation. The results show that the climate impact of the bridge is influenced by both phenomena, and that the gap between the impacts from both designs increases if the phenomena are accounted for. The outcome is influenced by the time occurrence assumed for the forest carbon uptake and the end-of-life scenario for the concrete.

The objective of this study is to scrutinize the impacts of an eco-routing guidance system on emissions through the use of a case study in a commuting corridor. This research aims at assessing the potential environmental benefits in terms of different pollutant emissions. Simultaneously, it addresses the extent of variations in system travel time (STT) that each eco-routing strategy implies. The methodology consists of three distinct phases. The first phase corresponds to the adjustment of a microsimulation platform of traffic and emissions with empirical data previously collected. Second, to volume-emission-functions (VEF), developed based on the integrated modeling structure. Final, to different scenarios of traffic flow optimization performed at the network level based on a simplified assignment procedure. The results show that if the traffic assignment is performed with the objective to minimize overall impacts, then the total system environmental damage costs can be reduced up to 9% with marginal oscillations in total STT. However, if drivers are advised based on their own emissions minimization, total system emissions may be higher than under the standard user equilibrium flow pattern. Specifically, environmentally friendly navigation algorithms focused on individual goals may tend to divert traffic to roads with less capacity affecting the performance of the remaining traffic. This case study brings new insights about the difficulties and potentials of implementing such systems. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Eco-routing; emissions; microscopic modeling; traffic management","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Flow patterns; Global warming; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Routing algorithms; Travel time; Carbon dioxide emissions; ECO routing; Environmental benefits; Environmental damage; Integrated model structures; Microscopic modeling; Navigation algorithms; Traffic management; Traffic control",2-s2.0-85020548082

Data from two UK interview and observation studies are combined: one with heating installers and the other with architects. The data are analysed using concepts from Abbott’s ‘system of professions’ framework that focuses on how the routine working practices of professional groups are born of how they see themselves and the tasks for which they are responsible. This comparison provides insights into how these two groups manage their professional ‘jurisdictions’ during their client interactions and what this means for policy-makers and industry representatives hoping to influence their work in pursuit of less carbon-intensive living.

This study proposes a new economic design of the variable-parameter (Vp) (Formula presented.) -Shewhart control chart for monitoring a continuous production process. In this design, the mean monitoring quality may exhibit an upward or downward shift due to two types of assignable causes. In certain continuous production settings, product quality directly affects production profit; the mean shift in monitoring quality influences lost cost, unit income and product yield. Thus, for modelling continuous production, using a maximum profit objective function for the optimization algorithm of this economic model is more appropriate than using minimum cost. Therefore, the Vp (Formula presented.) -Shewhart control chart uses an economic criterion for optimum parameter design to maximize the anticipated quality-related profit. The assignable cause occurrence is assumed to be an exponentially distributed random variable; Markov chain theory with a 9 × 9 transition probability matrix is used to subdivide the process operation into three actual states and three necessary actions.

The presence of correlation poses difficulties with respect to traditional spatial data analysis. This paper describes a novel spatiotemporal analytical scheme that allows us to yield a characterization of correlation in geophysical data along the spatial and temporal dimensions. We resort to a multivariate statistical model, namely CoKriging, in order to derive accurate spatiotemporal interpolation models. These predict unknown data by utilizing not only their own geosensor values at the same time, but also information from near past data. We use a window-based computation methodology that leverages the power of temporal correlation in a spatial modeling phase. This is done by also fitting the computed interpolation model to data which may change over time. In an assessment, using various geophysical data sets, we show that the presented algorithm is often able to deal with both spatial and temporal correlations. This helps to gain accuracy during the interpolation phase, compared to spatial and spatiotemporal competitors. Specifically, we evaluate the efficacy of the interpolation phase by using established machine-learning metrics (i.e. root mean squared error, Akaike information criterion and computation time). © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CoKriging; interpolation; multivariate analysis; Spatiotemporal data",,2-s2.0-85029903021

Our visual method allowed us to control for background view and compare user preferences on hiking trails with preferences at final destinations.

Due to the high costs to correct the welding distortion, there is great interest from industries to predict, monitor and control these distortions. This paper compares the distortions occurring during welding models of the segmented ring scaled with two types of joints (‘X’ and ‘V’) using the method of monitoring progress of welding distortion with the laser sensors. For continuous monitoring are used laser sensors that are supported on the piece and the beams were projected on a translucent screen placed in front of the same. With the progression of distortion during welding light beams move around the screen in proportion to deformation occurred in the part. The displacements of points of light reflected on the screen are filmed from the opposite side of the bulkhead. The discretization of the film allows to analyze deformations along the welding process and determines the evolution of the distortion in function of time. It was confirmed that the welds performed joints in ‘X’ exhibit distortion values smaller than the joints in ‘V’. The results demonstrate that for the samples used in this experiment at least 60% of the distortion occurred after arc extinction. By experimental testing, it was possible to say that the technique of laser sensors monitoring is viable for use in industry and laboratories of welding, although it is necessary to optimize the data processing obtained by filming, allowing the instantaneous monitoring. The information on the evolution of distortion during welding will be useful to define and monitor more efficiently the best method of control. In addition, it may assist in experimental calibration numerical and computational models, or even to feed back the trajectory of a robot identifying deformations to perform corrections in the welding sequence ensuring also minor distortions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dimensional control; monitoring; Welding distortion","Data handling; Deformation; Electric distortion; Electric welding; Monitoring; Welded steel structures; Computational model; Continuous monitoring; Dimensional control; Experimental calibration; Experimental testing; Monitor and control; Reduced scale models; Welding distortion; Welding",2-s2.0-85031395213

Furthermore, despite many studies, it is not easy to identify the relationship between objective metrics (OM) and subjective assessments (SA), a task further complicated by the fact that SA change between drivers and geographical locations or with time. This paper presents a method which uses two artificial neural networks built on top of each other that helps to close this gap. The first network, based solely on OM, generates a map that groups together similar vehicles, thus allowing a classification of measured vehicles to be visualised. This map objectively demonstrates that there exist brand and vehicle class identities. It also foresees the subjective characteristics of a new vehicle, based on its requirements, simulations and measurements. These characteristics are described by the neighbourhood of the new vehicle in the map, which is made up of known vehicles that are accompanied by word-clouds that enhance this description. This forecast is also extended to perform a sensitivity analysis of the tolerances in the requirements, as well as to validate previously published preferred range of steering feel metrics. The results suggest a few new modifications. Finally, the qualitative information given by this measurement-based classification is complemented with a second superimposed network.

At each iteration, the algorithm builds a short list of candidates by comparing fracture indicators. These indicators quantify at the first order the decrease of a data misfit function; they are cheap to compute. Then, the best candidate is picked up by minimization of the objective function for each candidate. Optimally driven by the fit to the data, the approach has the great advantage of not requiring remeshing, nor shape derivation.

Drawing upon research and theorising of governing by numbers, and applications to the governance of education, and particularly teachers’ learning, the research analyses how a group of Year 3 teachers collaborated to better inform themselves about the nature of their students’ learning. The research reveals that the governance of teachers’ learning under current policy conditions was manifest through both teachers’ compliance with and critique of a strong focus upon school, regional, state and national data–specifically, students’ attainment in ‘leveled’ readers and other school-based standardised measures of reading and mathematics, and school, state and regional results on national literacy and numeracy tests. There is little research that highlights the tensions around these numbers as governing technologies in relation to specific formal, ongoing instances of teacher professional development practices. The research cautions against the influence of such governing processes for how they potentially narrow teachers’ attention to more standardized measures of students’ learning, even as teachers may critique these more reductive effects. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Governing by numbers; standardised testing; teacher learning",,2-s2.0-85019031195

Materials and methods: Tomato plants were subjected to three organic nutrient solutions, which consisted of different mixtures of several OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) certified nitrogen fertilizers of industrially processed residues: Treatment I: solid and soluble liquid fertilizers of animal raw materials, natural potassium sulphate-non-synthetic, and calcium chloride; Treatment II: solid and soluble liquid fertilizers of animal raw materials, by-product of marine raw material (soluble liquid), natural potassium sulphate-non-synthetic, and calcium chloride; and Treatment III: solid fertilizers of animal raw materials, natural potassium sulphate-non-synthetic, and calcium chloride to 100% [0-30 days after transplanting (DAT)], 125% [31-80 DAT], and 150% [&gt;81 DAT]. The Steiner solution (SS) was used as a control (Treatment IV). Results: Yield did not differ between organic and conventional treatments, ranging from 3.04 to 3.35 kg m-2 while fresh weight in organic treatments was 3.14 compared to 3.2 kg m-2 in plants fed with the SS.

The notion of translation in Actor Network Theory (ANT) is used to analyse how a network of PV provision actants decides the system design and integration into homes, and how this in turn conditions household participation in this network. Semi-structured interviews and video tours used in four participative community and two non-participative community case studies reveal the impact of non-human actants in terms of how PV scripts and practices are formed by PV professionals.

Researchers adapted the methodology of urban sociologists Harvey Molotch and Richard Appelbaum to explore twelve different health measures in 148 US counties and their metropolitan statistical areas. The test measure is the percentage of commuters who use some means other than a single-occupant vehicle (SOV). The percentage of such commuters ranges from as low as 11% in Houston County, Alabama to as high as 36% in Honolulu County, Hawaii. Using bivariate and multivariate analyses, we found better health outcomes in counties and metropolitan areas that have fewer workers commuting by SOV.

The viable cells were quantified using qPCR and PMA-qPCR assays targeting tuf gene and also by plate counting. Standard curves were prepared and mean efficiency obtained was 94% and 96% (R2 &gt; 0.98) to L. paracasei in culture medium and probiotic yoghurt stored one day, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) for both samples was 104 genome copies, corresponding to 32.1 pg of DNA.

L. paracasei enumerations obtained by qPCR for probiotic yoghurt stored one day and 30 days were higher than enumerations by PMA-qPCR for the same samples. The plate count values were similar to CFU values obtained by PMA-qPCR.

This research investigates the effects of phone use on pedestrians' street-crossing behaviors at an uncontrolled intersection where head-turning performances are important to identify a gap among the oncoming traffic. A field study using video cameras was conducted for evaluating pedestrians' head-turning behaviors (e.g., head-turning frequency, not looking at traffic before crossing, looking at the wrong traffic side), crossing time, and sudden movement while they were engaging in various smartphone activities (e.g., calling, texting, gaming, and listening to music). Data such as phone features, distraction types, and personal attributes of the pedestrians were obtained in the interviews conducted after pedestrians had completed crossing the street. The results indicate that the unsafe crossing behaviors (e.g., sudden movement, fewer head-turning frequencies, not looking at traffic before crossing, not looking at left side of traffic first) were more prevalent among those gaming with “Pokemon Go.” Web surfing appears to be the 2nd risky distraction event following gaming with “Pokemon Go.” Logistic regression models reveal several important correlates of unsafe crossing behaviors: being a student, large phone screen (5 in. or larger), and having un-restricted 4G Internet data allowance.

Biomass for bioenergy feedstocks comes from five sources, which are agricultural crop residues, forest residues and industrial wood waste, energy crops and woody crops, animal manure, and municipal solid waste. The potential biomass production is predicted based on the resource availability. In the process of identifying biomass resources production, assumptions are made regarding arable land, marginal land, crops yields, forest growth rate, and meat consumption and waste production. Four scenarios were designed to describe the potential biomass energy production to elaborate the role of biomass energy in the Chinese energy system in 2030. The assessment shows that under certain restrictions on land availability, the maximum potential biomass energy productions are estimated to be 18,833 and 24,901 PJ in 2030 and 2050. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biomass energy production; Biomass resource; China","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Crops; Fertilizers; Forestry; Municipal solid waste; Agricultural crop residues; Bio-mass energy; Biomass productions; Biomass resources; China; Land availability; Resource availability; Waste production; Biomass; bioenergy; biomass power; energy resource; resource assessment; resource availability; China; Animalia",2-s2.0-84990224110

The mathematical formulation of the detector was exploited and re-expressed as a quadratic form of the Toeplitz matrix. The detector has a highly structured internal architecture with abundant spatial isotropic symmetricity. The proposed operator can greatly reduce problems frequently encountered in edge detection including fragmentation, position dislocation, and thinness loss. The detector is robust to noise and can efficiently extract crucial edge features. We named this new operator as the WL operator (Wang and Lin). The performance of the WL operator was compared to that of other edge detectors by using Pratt's figure of merits. In addition, the performance was confirmed with experts by using visual analog scale scores. The results obtained using the WL operator for different medical imaging modalities including X-ray, CT, and MRI are promising.

It is a bit difficult to stop security threats and breaches entirely using present security technologies. Detecting the presence of intruder is very crucial for maintaining the network security. It is found that intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that are signature-based are restricted in their areas of detecting intrusions, because of the fact that the signature-based intrusion detection system is based on matching a signature with the network details. The system using signatures or patterns can detect only known attacks and threats, but they mostly fail when it comes to novel attacks.﻿ Thus preventing/detecting the new or special types of attracts whose signature is not specified. Although signature-based IDS does not give false alarms at genuine cases, but still is inept for unknown attacks or masked attacks.

Dust devils exhibit pressure perturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several surveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil structures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with the widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be distorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series cannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical and geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of the duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a distribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the underlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a scheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five low-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track. © 2017","Atmosphere; Earth; Mars; Mars; Surface",,2-s2.0-85026736880

Odor repellents have the potential to lower the overall number of WVC and allow animals to cross roads at the same time. We tested the effectiveness of odor repellent preparation in prevention of WVC. 18 places were selected on the Czech road network where WVC were concentrated on the basis of traffic crash data. Control sections on the same road segments were also delimited in order to keep the traffic intensities constant. We applied a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study design to control not only the effect of the measures but also the expected natural variations in wildlife populations over time. Data were compared before and after odor repellent installations. Wildlife carcass gathering was carried out during the spring and autumn.

In many practical situations, only incomplete and inaccurate statistical knowledge on uncertain input parameters are available. Fortunately, to construct a finite-order expansion, only some partial information on the probability measure is required that can be simply represented by a finite number of statistical moments. Such situations, however, trigger the question to what degree higher-order statistical moments of input data are increasingly uncertain. On the one hand, increasing uncertainty in higher moments will lead to increasing inaccuracy in the corresponding chaos expansion and its result. On the other hand, the degree of expansion should adequately reflect the non-linearity of the analyzed model to minimize the approximation error of the expansion. Observation of the PCE convergence when statistical input information is incomplete demonstrates that higher-order PCE expansions without adequate data support are useless. Moreover, it makes apparent that PCE of a certain order is adequate just for a corresponding amount of available input data. The key idea of the current work is to align the order of expansion with a compromise between the degree of non-linearity of the model and the reliability of statistical information on the input parameters. To assure an optimal choice of the expansion order, we offer a simple relation that helps to align available input statistical data with an adequate expansion order. As fundamental steps into this direction, we propose overall error estimates for the statistical type of error that results from inaccurate statistical information plus the error that results from truncating the expansion of a non-linear model. Our key message is that any order of expansion is only justified if accompanied by reliable statistical information on input moments of a certain higher order. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adequate expansion order; Incomplete statistics; Orthonormal basis; Polynomial chaos expansion; Uncertainty quantification","Errors; Input output programs; Polynomials; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Adequate expansion order; Degree of non-linearity; Orthonormal basis; Polynomial chaos expansion; Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE); Statistical information; Stochastic model reduction; Uncertainty quantifications; Statistics",2-s2.0-85027895795

Current practices rely on the conventional Weibull statistics and more recently on the weakest-link statistical model conforming to the uniform spatial distribution of microcracks. Based on the understanding that the weakest-link postulate is built on the mutual independence of microcracks and is not necessarily bounded to the uniform spatial distribution of microcracks, this work develops a generic weakest-link statistical formulation pertaining to a power-law spatial distribution of mutually non-interactive microcracks to synchronize the random variation and size effect of brittle fracture strength. The formulation encompasses both Weibull statistics and the uniform spatial distribution law-based weakest-link model as its subordinate members. A resultant master curve behavior between a compound parameter and the nominal fracture strength is identified for size scaling of strength and is validated by the strength data of a wide spectrum of quasi-brittle materials including wood, concrete, coal, gamma titanium aluminum alloy, nuclear-grade graphite and aluminum foam on geometrically self-similar specimens under same loading conditions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Brittleness; Fracture; Fracture toughness; Size determination; Spatial distribution; Statistics; Strength of materials; Titanium alloys; Weibull distribution; Mutual independence; Quasibrittle material; Spatial distribution laws; Statistical approach; Statistical formulation; Statistical modeling; Titanium aluminum alloy; Weakest-link models; Brittle fracture",2-s2.0-85029604116

Suspensions with 3 different Gaussian distributions of particle radii are considered (i.e. 3 different standard deviations). The distributions are centered on the reference particle radius of the monodisperse suspension. In the most extreme case, the radius of the largest particles is 4 times that of the smaller particles. We consider two different solid volume fractions, 2% and 10%. We find that for all polydisperse cases, both fluid and particles statistics are not substantially altered with respect to those of the monodisperse case. Mean streamwise fluid and particle velocity profiles are almost perfectly overlapping. Slightly larger differences are found for particle velocity fluctuations. These increase close to the wall and decrease towards the centerline as the standard deviation of the distribution is increased. Hence, the behavior of the suspension is mostly governed by excluded volume effects regardless of particle size distribution (at least for the radii here studied). Due to turbulent mixing, particles are uniformly distributed across the channel. However, smaller particles can penetrate more into the viscous and buffer layer and velocity fluctuations are therein altered.

As such, we characterized the dynamics and multiscale relationships of hourly electricity consumption data for 13 occupied Florida houses from calendar year 2013. Statistical approaches included: (1) exploratory data analyses with distribution-based descriptive statistics; (2) normality testing; (3) spectral and monofractal analyses; (4) multifractal detrended fluctuation analyses (MFDFA) with surrogate testing; and (5) Ward's minimum variance method for hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Results suggested the energy-use patterns were non-normal, nonlinear, and exhibited predominantly anti-persistent fractal complexities. Thus, classical descriptive statistics presuming Gaussian probability density function (PDF) distributions neither well fit, nor well described, the data and their interdependent characteristics. Notably, clusters of comparable houses were categorically and statistically different when using descriptors based on normality (e.g., mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) versus those based on fractality (e.g., Hurst exponent, multifractal spectrum width). We believe MFDFA statistical outputs may serve as novel indicators of residential building dynamics as they better characterize the complex, nonlinear asset and occupancy interactions and they require no assumptions regarding the PDF distribution shape. We offer guidance on the data management, transformation, parameterization, and interpretation processes necessary to apply MFDFA to whole-house, short-interval, electricity consumption time series data.

An independent life for people with disabilities has gradually become the goal of social promotion. Under the circumstances, the support strategies and facilities for the independency of physically and mentally disabled citizens should be focusing on the design and the goal of exploring the areas needing resources of social welfare by introducing spatial analysis. According to the demographic analysis on the population sizes of physically and mentally disabled citizens in Taiwan between 2008 and 2015, the highest percentage of pathogenesis in different counties/cities was 71.95% caused by illness (organ defects), and the proportion and average life expectancy of people with disabilities in the individual county/city were significantly correlated. That is, the longer average life expectancy, the higher proportion of physically and mentally disabled citizens. Because the demands on healthcare and service are gradually increasing, the establishment of support measures and facilities has become an important topic at present to achieve of the goal of well life independency. The study used a database of disabled persons published by the Taipei City Government in 2015, which was based on the statistics analyzed by the Department of Social Welfare, Taipei City Government. The description of the distribution of physically and mentally disabled citizens and resources was presented by using geographic informatics, and the coverage areas of supportive institutions were calculated based on the information network of route map combining with the statistics of physically and mentally disabled citizens made by Taipei City Government. Hop spots that cannot be covered were explored by applying the Kriging Method. Furthermore, the adequate candidate locations for setting social welfare institutions to support physically and mentally disabled citizens were calculated based on hot spots, minimal statistical areas as well as weighted population center points.

A study of the statistics of photon distribution during heterodyning of two laser beams shifted in frequency made it possible to experimentally estimate the length of photon. It is shown that photon represents the wave packet of needle-shaped form with spatial length determined by the coherence length of the light radiation and substantially exceeds the wavelength λ. The pulse duration on the output of photomultiplier (PM), originated from single photon, is determined only by processes in the PM and does not refer to the length of photon.

The objective of this study was to assess the association between residential radon levels and mortality due to different types of cancer, using misaligned data analysis techniques. Mortality data (observed cases) for each of the 313 Galician municipalities were drawn from the records of the National Statistics Institute for the study period (1999–2008). Expected cases were computed using Galician mortality rates for 14 types of malignant tumors as reference, with a total of 56,385 deaths due to the tumors analyzed. The effect estimates of indoor radon (3371 sampling points) were adjusted for sociodemographic variables, altitude, and arsenic topsoil levels (1069 sampling points), using spatial/geostatistical models fitted with stochastic partial differential equations and integrated nested Laplace approximations. These models are capable of processing misaligned data. The results showed a statistical association between indoor radon and lung, stomach and brain cancer in women in Galicia. Apart from lung cancer (relative risk (RR) = 1.09), in which a twofold increase in radon exposure led to a 9% rise in mortality, the association was particularly relevant in stomach (RR = 1.17) and brain cancer (RR = 1.28). Further analytical epidemiologic studies are needed to confirm these results, and an assessment should be made of the advisability of implementing interventions targeting such exposure in higher-risk areas. © 2017 The Authors","Cancer mortality; Geochemistry; Indoor radon; Medical geology; Misaligned data; Residential radon; Soil composition; Spatial data analysis","Biological organs; Data handling; Diseases; Geochemistry; Housing; Information analysis; Radon; Risk assessment; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Tumors; Cancer mortality; Indoor radon; Medical geologies; Misaligned data; Soil composition; Spatial data analysis; Population statistics",2-s2.0-85027849101

This case study demonstrates the scientific relevance of the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) as a robust drought metric that incorporates influence of supply-demand balance. Using long-term data, the SPEI was calculated at multiple timescales to identify historical water deficit periods in selected drought-prone case study regions in southeast Queensland, Australia. The drought duration (D; number of months with continuously negative SPEI representing below average water resources), severity (S; accumulated negative SPEI in a drought-identified period), intensity (I; minimum SPEI), and return periods were enumerated for iconic dry events over multiple (1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 24-month) timescales. The SPEI was evaluated with corresponding drought indicators (precipitation and soil moisture) and climatological Rainfall Anomaly Index to yield drought severity information from a meteorological perspective. The results showed disparities in duration, severity, and intensity (D-S-I) of different droughts among the case study regions; reaffirming the significance of SPEI for regional drought impact assessment. Accordingly, this case study advocates SPEI as a convenient metric for detecting drought onsets and terminations, including drought ranking and recurrence evaluations that are vital statistics in hydrologic engineering. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Drought duration; Intensity; Multiscalar drought index; Return period; Run-sum method; Severity; Standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index","Evapotranspiration; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil moisture; Statistics; Water resources; Drought duration; Drought indices; Intensity; Return periods; Run-sum method; Severity; Standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index; Drought",2-s2.0-85032746606

It is based on the idea of population interference, and yields the probability that a given algorithm produces a smaller (global?) minimum than an alternative algorithm, in a single run. Three benchmark example problems and four optimization algorithms are employed to demonstrate that the proposed metric is better than usual statistics such as mean, standard deviation, best and worst values obtained over several runs. The proposed metric actually quantifies how much better a given algorithm is, in comparison to an alternative algorithm.

Our DA method is validated through numerical experiments called “twin experiments” to verify that the DA method can estimate a priori assumed-true phase-field mobility from synthetic observational data. The results of the twin experiments using various initial phase-field mobilities show that our DA methodology can successfully estimate the true phase-field mobility, even when the initial value largely deviates from the true value.

All NHS employees are recruited on the basis of a prescribed set of values. This is extended to the recruitment of student healthcare professionals, yet there is little research of how to implement this. Involving Service Users in healthcare educational practice is gaining momentum internationally, yet involvement of service users in VBR of ‘would be’ healthcare professionals remains at an embryonic phase. Adult nurses represent the largest healthcare workforce in the UK, yet involvement of service users in their recruitment has received scant attention. This paper is an evaluation of the inclusion of service users in a VBR of 640 adult student nurses. Background Design This study used a participatory mixed methods approach, with service users as co-researchers in the study. Methods The study consisted of mixed methods design. Quantitative data via an online questionnaire to ascertain candidates' perspectives (n = 269 response rate of 42%), and academic/clinical nurses (n = 35 response rate 34.65%). Qualitative data were gathered using focus groups and one to one interviews with service users (n = 9). Data analysis included descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Findings 4 overarching themes were identified; increasing sense of humanness, substantiating care values; impact of involvement; working together and making it work, a work in progress. Conclusion The findings from the study highlight that involving service users in VBR of student healthcare professionals has benefits to candidates, service users and local health services. Appreciating the perceptions of healthcare professionals is fundamental in the UK and internationally to implementing service users' engagement in service enhancement and delivery. Findings from this study identify there may be a dissonance between the policy, the nurses' thoughts and their practice. © 2017","Nurse recruitment; Nursing; Service users; Student nurse; Values; Values based recruitment","adult; attention; data analysis; education; embryo; female; human; interview; major clinical study; male; nursing student; perception; questionnaire; scientist; statistics; thematic analysis; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85032170940

This means that a strong societal problem is emerging that desperately needs resolution. Objectives To acquire a solid understanding of the causes for the low popularity of community care by exploring first-year baccalaureate nursing students' perceptions of community care, their placement preferences, and the assumptions underlying these preferences. Design A quantitative cross-sectional design. Settings Six universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands. Participants Nursing students in the first semester of their 4-year programme (n = 1058). Methods Data were collected in September–December 2014. The students completed the ‘Scale on Community Care Perceptions’ (SCOPE), consisting of demographic data and three subscales measuring the affective component of community care perception, perceptions of a placement and a profession in community care, and students' current placement preferences. Descriptive statistics were used. Results For a practice placement, 71.2% of first-year students prefer the general hospital and 5.4% community care, whereas 23.4% opt for another healthcare area. Students consider opportunities for advancement and enjoyable relationships with patients as most important for choosing a placement. Community care is perceived as a ‘low-status-field’ with many elderly patients, where students expect to find little variety in caregiving and few opportunities for advancement. Students' perceptions of the field are at odds with things they believe to be important for their placement. Conclusion Due to misconceptions, students perceive community care as offering them few challenges. Strategies to positively influence students' perceptions of community nursing are urgently required to halt the dissonance between students' preference for the hospital and society's need for highly educated community nurses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bachelor of Nursing; Career preferences; Community care; Nursing education; Nursing students; Perceptions; Placements","aged; career; community health nursing; cross-sectional study; demography; female; general hospital; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; Netherlands; nursing education; nursing student; perception; statistics",2-s2.0-85031812113

The participants were examined with tests of fine and gross motor function (Trail Making Test-5: TMT-5, Grooved Pegboard, Triangle from Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2: MABC-2 and High-level Mobility Assessment Tool: HiMAT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Probabilistic tractography of motor pathways of the corticospinal tract (CST) and corpus callosum (CC) was performed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated in non-crossing (capsula interna in CST, body of CC) and crossing (centrum semiovale) fibre regions along the tracts and examined for group differences. Associations between motor test scores and FA in the CST and CC were investigated with linear regression. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to examine group differences in DTI metrics in all major white matter tracts. The VLBW group had lower scores on all motor tests compared with controls, however, only statistically significant for TMT-5. Based on tractography, FA in the VLBW group was lower in non-crossing fibre regions and higher in crossing fibre regions of the CST compared with controls. Within the VLBW group, poorer fine motor function was associated with higher FA in crossing fibre regions of the CST, and poorer bimanual coordination was additionally associated with lower FA in crossing fibre regions of the CC. Poorer gross motor function was associated with lower FA in crossing fibre regions of the CST and CC. There were no associations between motor function and FA in non-crossing fibre regions of the CST and CC within the VLBW group. In the TBSS analysis, the VLBW group had lower FA and higher mean diffusivity compared with controls in all major white matter tracts. The findings in this study may indicate that the associations between motor function and FA are caused by other tracts crossing the CST and CC, and/or by alterations in the periventricular white matter in the centrum semiovale. Some of the associations were in the opposite direction than hypothesized, thus higher FA does not always indicate better function.

Cultural beliefs and biases are incorporated into the thought process where they reveal themselves in patterns of thought. Once the thought patterns are established they may be observed in the digital trail that results from online interactions. Once captured online, the behaviors can be reviewed and examined in multiple ways so that researchers can gain new insights. Historically, observations have taken place in the physical environment; this talk discusses findings of cultural markers in the cyber realm. The results of evidence-based research exploring the relationship between national culture and cyber behaviors will be discussed. These quantitative, observational studies were the result of researchers mining the raw website defacements found in the Zone-H archives containing over 10 million records. Mining the dataset and evaluating the findings within Hofstede’s cultural framework allowed for research into behaviors, preferences, reasons, imaging, sentiment analysis, and various other aspects of attacker and victim cybersecurity actors. The use of Hofstede’s six dimensional cultural framework to define culture, along with some basic inferential statistics, resulted in specific digital identifiers that were associated with specific cultural dimensions. Over time findings can be trended, allowing for more accurate modeling of cyber actors based on cultural values. The results supported Nisbett’s observation that people “think the way they do because of the nature of the societies they line in”. This discussion centers on the six dimensions of culture, the values associated with each dimension, and examples of those values in cyber space for victims, attackers and defenders. The six cultural dimensions measure views on self-determination, collectivism, aggression, nurturing, uncertain outcomes, holism, instant gratification, and levels of societal openness. The behavioral traits that associate with the cultural values are behavioural traits that are consistent with cyber behaviors. Cultural values provide context for individual behaviors by determining the norm for a group. Thus, behavior that may seem perfectly normal in one environment may stand out as odd in a different environment. Cultural difference have been historically used to model adversaries in the kinetic world. Moving this analysis into the cyber realm offers the potential to gain greater insights into all cyber actors. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Attackers; Cultural dimensions; Culture; Cyber; Vectors; Victims","Cell culture; Human engineering; Vectors; Attackers; Cultural dimensions; Cyber; Evidence based researches; Inferential statistics; Instant gratification; Physical environments; Victims; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85021681605

Most seismic design codes lead to reduced loads. Nevertheless, an extensive review of related literature indicates that the effect of viscous dampers on the response modification factor is no longer considered. In this study, the effect of implementing viscous damper devices in reinforced concrete structures on the response modification factor was investigated. Reinforced concrete structures with different stories were considered to evaluate the values of the response modification factors. A nonlinear statistic analysis was performed with finite element software. The values of the response modification factors were evaluated and formulated on the basis of three factors: strength, ductility, and redundancy. Results revealed that the response modification factors for reinforced concrete structures equipped with viscous damper devices are higher than those for structures without viscous damper devices. The number of damper devices and the height of buildings have significant effects on response modification factors. In view of the analytical results across different cases, we proposed an equation according to the values of damping coefficients to determine the response modification factors for reinforced concrete structures furnished with viscous damper devices. © 2017, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

It is one of the most common cancer among women both in developed and developing countries. To raise the survival of BC patients, genetic factors are used for early diagnosis because they are non-changed factors and give ability of cells to proliferate and metastasize. MiR-196a2 targets many genes which are vital for development, apoptosis, differentiation, motility and angiogenesis. The SNP rs11614913 (C/T) affects the processing of the pre-miRNA to its mature form and the ability to regulate target genes. This SNP has been demonstrated to relate to breast cancer in Asian, especially in Chinese [OR (95% CI) = 0.73 (0.57–0.93), p = 0.011]. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the SNP rs11614913 and BC in Vietnamese population. 113 cases and 127 controls were genotyped using optimized high resolution melting method (HRM) then statistical analysis was applied to examine the association of the SNP. The results show that the frequencies of TT, CT, and CC were 26.54, 30.97 and 42.49% in cases group and 25.19, 50.39, and 24.42% in controls group, respectively.

Classical outlier detection schemes typically rely on the assumption that normal/background data of interest are distributed according to an assumed statistical model and search for data that deviate from that assumption. However, it is frequently the case that performance is reduced because the underlying distribution does not follow the assumed model. Manifold learning techniques offer improved performance by learning better models of the background but can be too computationally expensive due to the need to calculate a distance measure between all data points. Here, we study a general framework that allows manifold learning techniques to be used for unsupervised anomaly detection by reducing computational expense via a uniform random sampling of a small fraction of the data. A background manifold is learned from the sample and then an out-of-sample extension is used to project unsampled data into the learned manifold space and construct an anomaly detection statistic based on the prediction error of the learned manifold. The method works well for unsupervised anomaly detection because, by definition, the ratio of anomalous to non-anomalous data points is small and the sampling will be dominated by background points. However, a variety of parameters that affect detection performance are introduced so we use here a low-dimensional toy problem to investigate their effect on the performance of four learning algorithms (kernel PCA, two versions of diffusion map, and the Parzen density estimator). We then apply the methods to the detection of watercraft in an ensemble of 22 infrared maritime scenes where we find kernel PCA to be superior and show that it outperforms a commonly employed baseline algorithm. The framework is not limited to the tested image processing example and can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection task. © 2017","Anomaly detection; Image processing; Manifold learning; Manifolds; Target detection","Automobile engine manifolds; Decision making; Image processing; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Statistics; Target tracking; Anomaly detection; Computational expense; Decision making process; Manifold learning; Out-of-sample extension; Parzen density estimator; Underlying distribution; Unsupervised anomaly detection; Learning algorithms",2-s2.0-85029517499

Here, we study the simplest concave particles, granular ""u-particles,"" of varied barb length to particle width ratio l/w. Piles of u-particles cohere through the interlocking of particle barbs in concave regions, a phenomenon we call mechanical entanglement. We study the packing and relaxation dynamics of vertical, free-standing columns formed from u-particles of fixed l/w subject to sinusoidal vibration (frequency f, peak acceleration Γ). We vary l/w to discover how particle concavity influences packing, column collapse, and entanglement properties. Increasing l/w results in columns that pack to a lower volume fraction, φ{symbol}, with a functional form described through the use of a mean-field random contact model. Collapse dynamics are measured by monitoring column height, h(t), and we find that the timescale for column collapse, τ, follows the relation τ = f -1 exp (Δ/Γ). Δ is analogous to an activation energy in a thermal system and is maximal at intermediate l/w = 0.394 ± 0.045. We perform simulation of u-particle ensembles to determine the number of mechanical entanglements as a function of l/w. We find that the density of entangled particles is maximum at l/w = 0.340 ± 0.015, near our observed maximum in relaxation time. The optimal l/w is described using the random contact model and results from a competition between packing and entanglement. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In this study, a systematic investigation on the difference of the determinants driving the two types of variations of air pollution is addressed. We employed panel data models with both constant and varying coefficients to examine the impacts of socioeconomic factors (namely, population density, per capita GDP, and secondary industry share) and meteorological indicators (temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) on the spatial and temporal variation of ambient SO2 concentrations in China, using a sample of 30 major cities during the period 1995–2016. The results show that average SO2 concentrations for the 30 cities persistently declined over the 22 years studied, decreasing from 92 μg/m3 to 23 μg/m3, and that the most polluted cities shifted from being in the southwest to being in North China during this period. In addition, the gaseous pollutant concentrations and six factors were cointegrated. The results of the constant coefficient model (R2 = 0.734) indicate that secondary industry proportion presented a significant (p&lt;1%) positive correlation with contamination; as such, a 1% increase in the secondary industry ratio was found to be able to cause a 0.81% increase in SO2 levels. The varying coefficient models (R2 = 0.922 and 0.839, respectively) illustrated that the temporal (yearly) variation of SO2 concentration was more influenced by human-related factors, especially by secondary industry share; as SO2 is mainly produced and discharged in the process of industrial production. While the spatial variation of such concentration was more affected by meteorological indicators, especially by wind speed. This may be caused by the large difference in climate conditions among the studied 30 cities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Panel data models; SO2 concentrations; Spatial variation factors; Temporal variation factors","Fog; Pollution; Wind; Atmospheric contamination; China; Panel data models; Positive correlations; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatial variations; Temporal variation; Varying coefficient model; Population statistics",2-s2.0-85029672250

Despite the physiological reasons, emotion contagion between peoples is pivotal to understand people's emotional changes. However, most existing works at the individual level focus on small groups in the short term. Because negative emotions are natural to appear and can largely affect the dynamics of emotion spreading, therefore this paper aims to investigate the negative emotion spreading mechanism at the individual level of large user groups in the long term, and finally infer individuals’ ability of the negative emotion spreading by observing people's behaviors on mobile social networking. Specifically, we first propose a novel metric for measuring individuals’ degree of negative emotion spreading. We then put forward a Graph-Coupled Hidden Markov Sentiment Model for modeling the propagation of infectious negative sentiment locally within a social network using data collected by mobile phones. In this model, we assume that one can infect others even if he/she is not infected, which is an extension of the traditional assumption in epidemic spreading. Because the proposed model involves parameters, to infer those parameters, Gibbs sampling method is employed.

For the relatively large nested catchments (&gt; 40,000 km2), characteristic regional values emerge for nutrient input per unit area of around 30 T/yr/km2 for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and 2 T/yr/km2 for total phosphorus (TP).

Despite the popularity of EM algorithms, it is challenging to efficiently implement these algorithms in a distributed environment for handling massive data sets. In particular, many EM algorithms that frequently update the parameters have been shown to be much more efficient than their concurrent counterparts. Accordingly, we propose two approaches to parallelize such EM algorithms in a distributed environment so as to scale to massive data sets. We prove that both approaches maintain the convergence properties of the EM algorithms. Based on the approaches, we design and implement a distributed framework, FreEM, to support the implementation of frequent updates for the EM algorithms. We show its efficiency through two categories of EM applications, clustering and topic modeling. These applications include k-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering, parameter estimation for the Gaussian Mixture Model, and variational inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We extensively evaluate our framework on both a cluster of local machines and the Amazon EC2 cloud.

A range of methods have been proposed in the literature, including probabilistic topic models and techniques based on matrix factorization. However, in both cases, standard implementations rely on stochastic elements in their initialization phase, which can potentially lead to different results being generated on the same corpus when using the same parameter values. This corresponds to the concept of “instability” which has previously been studied in the context of k-means clustering. In many applications of topic modeling, this problem of instability is not considered and topic models are treated as being definitive, even though the results may change considerably if the initialization process is altered. In this paper we demonstrate the inherent instability of popular topic modeling approaches, using a number of new measures to assess stability. To address this issue in the context of matrix factorization for topic modeling, we propose the use of ensemble learning strategies. Based on experiments performed on annotated text corpora, we show that a K-Fold ensemble strategy, combining both ensembles and structured initialization, can significantly reduce instability, while simultaneously yielding more accurate topic models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","LDA; NMF; Topic modeling; Topic stability","Factorization; Stability; Statistics; Stochastic systems; Ensemble strategies; Inherent instability; K-means clustering; Latent structures; Matrix factorizations; Probabilistic topic models; Stochastic elements; Topic Modeling; Matrix algebra",2-s2.0-85028880663

This type of models can possibly exhibit complex dynamical behaviors such as traveling wave, self-organized spatial pattern, or chaos. Numerical methods play an essential role in the study of these dynamical behaviors. This paper concerns the finite element approximation for reaction–diffusion models with time delay. Two fully discrete schemes and corresponding a priori error estimates are derived. Generally, the research on evolution of population and epidemic needs to survey long-time dynamical behaviors of these models, so that it is important to improve the speed of numerical simulation. To this end, interpolation technique is used in our schemes to avoid numerical integration of reaction term. An outstanding advantage of using interpolation of reaction term is that it improves the operation speed greatly, meanwhile does not reduce convergence order. Applications are given to some model problems arising from population biology and epidemiology. From these simulations some interesting phenomena can be found and we try to explain them in biological significance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Epidemic model; Finite element; Population model; Reaction–diffusion equation; Time delay","Bioinformatics; Biology; Diffusion; Dynamics; Ecology; Epidemiology; Interpolation; Numerical methods; Population statistics; Time delay; Timing circuits; Biological significance; Diffusion equations; Efficient numerical method; Epidemic modeling; Finite element approximations; Interpolation techniques; Population model; Self-organized spatial pattern; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85028562837

We simultaneously process pseudorange and/or phase data from GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Beidou, QZSS, NAVIC (formerly IRNSS) and SBAS/GAGAN in different combinations, depending on availability and receiver tracking capability. We estimate at each epoch by least squares three coordinates, one Tropospheric Zenith Delay and nGNSS sums of the receiver time offset and the offset of the time scale of each GNSS relative to a common, interGNSS time scale, where nGNSS is the number of tracked GNSS constellations. Differentiation of such offsets relative to the GPS data yields epochwise for each receiver estimates of the time offset GNSS to GPS. Comparing across different receivers we find that such offsets can be biased relative to each other by as much as several tens of nanoseconds. We arbitrarily select the average of six Septentrio receivers as reference, and estimate the receiver biases relative to the average Septentrio. We find that for a given receiver brand, the bias relative to Septentrio for the various GNSS is very repeatable, with a few exceptions. We show that updating the firmware version does affect the GNSS dependent receiver bias. We finalize our work with a table of ‘mean’ calibrations, for each GNSS, of comparable receivers, whenever their bias to Septentrio is within one standard deviation, and a subtable of ‘individual’ calibrations for those receivers which fall out of the mean by more than one standard deviation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Inter system bias; Mean and type receiver calibration; MultiGNSS interoperablity; Position Velocity Timing (PVT) estimates; Receiver dependent bias","Calibration; Environmental engineering; Firmware; Geophysics; MATLAB; Radio navigation; Statistics; Timing circuits; Broadcast ephemerides; Inter system; MultiGNSS interoperablity; Position Velocity Timing (PVT) estimates; Precise point positioning; Single-point positioning; Standard deviation; Tracking capability; Global positioning system",2-s2.0-85028673078

Survey methods vary, often to achieve different goals. Thus when different survey methods are used in different locations and/or years, it is difficult to compare abundance data between regions or for assessing population trends through time. In many jurisdictions, forest legislation or policy may require managers to carry out surveys to assess presence or confirm absence of rare species. This then can inform forest management decisions that may impact these species, particularly when the rare species is listed for protection, for example under species-at-risk legislation. Because species surveys can be time consuming as managers want to be confident in their ability to detect species (or confirm that observed absences are likely true), survey protocols should be as efficient and effective as possible. Floristic habitat sampling (FHS) is often applied for botanical surveys and focuses on generating a list of species present in a region (sometimes referred to as the relevé method) by inventorying an area as thoroughly as possible, including potential microhabitats. The Adaptive Cluster Sampling (ACS) method assumes that rare species are clustered in space and delineates sample plots non-randomly to increase accuracy of abundance estimates. Here, we compare FHS and ACS methods to detect rare lichens in two landscapes on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland, as well as to generate species lists of arboreal lichens in a region. We also carry out a novel field simulation using artificial lichens to test how well ACS estimates known abundance.

The aims of this research, beside interpolation, were the determination of extrapolation performance of ANN model, which was developed for the prediction of DO content in the Danube River, and the assessment of relationship between the significance of inputs and prediction error in the presence of values which were of out of the range of training. The applied ANN is a polynomial neural network (PNN) which performs embedded selection of most important inputs during learning, and provides a model in the form of linear and non-linear polynomial functions, which can then be used for a detailed analysis of the significance of inputs. Available dataset that contained 1912 monitoring records for 17 water quality parameters was split into a “regular” subset that contains normally distributed and low variability data, and an “extreme” subset that contains monitoring records with outlier values. The results revealed that the non-linear PNN model has good interpolation performance (R2 = 0.82), but it was not robust in extrapolation (R2 = 0.63). The analysis of extrapolation results has shown that the prediction errors are correlated with the significance of inputs. Namely, the out-of-training range values of the inputs with low importance do not affect significantly the PNN model performance, but their influence can be biased by the presence of multi-outlier monitoring records. Subsequently, linear PNN models were successfully applied to study the effect of water quality parameters on DO content. It was observed that DO level is mostly affected by temperature, pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and phosphorus concentration, while in extreme conditions the importance of alkalinity and bicarbonates rises over pH and BOD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Danube River; Dissolved oxygen; Extrapolation; GMDH; PNN","Alkalinity; Biochemical oxygen demand; Dissolution; Extrapolation; Forecasting; Interpolation; Neural networks; Normal distribution; Oxygen; Polynomials; Statistics; Surface waters; Water management; Water quality; Water resources; Biological oxygen demand; Danube rivers; Dissolved oxygen contents; GMDH; Phosphorus concentration; Polynomial neural networks; Significance analysis; Water quality parameters; Dissolved oxygen",2-s2.0-85027850174

To assess the impact of water quality conditions on estuarine fish health during successive severe drought years with Microcystis blooms, we performed fish embryo toxicity testing with Delta Smelt and Medaka. Fish embryos were exposed to filtered ambient water collected from the San Francisco Estuary during the Microcystis bloom season in 2014 and 2015, the third and fourth most severe recorded drought years in California. Medaka embryos incubated in filtered ambient waters exhibited high mortality rates (> 77%), which was mainly due to bacterial growth. Medaka mortality data was negatively correlated with chloride, and positively correlated with water temperature, total and dissolved organic carbon, and ambient and net chlorophyll a concentration. Delta Smelt embryo mortality rates were lower (< 42%) and no prominent seasonal or geographic trend was observed. There was no significant correlation between the Delta Smelt mortality data and water quality parameters. Aeromonas was the dominant bacteria that adversely affected Medaka. The growth of Aeromonas was suppressed when salinity was greater than or equal to 1 psu and resulted in a significant reduction in mortality rate. Bacterial growth test demonstrated that the lysate of Microcystis cells enhanced the growth of Aeromonas. Toxin production by Microcystis is a major environmental concern, however, we conclude that dissolved substances released from Microcystis blooms could result in water quality deterioration by promoting growth of bacteria. Furthermore, a distinctive developmental deformity was observed in Medaka during the toxicity tests; somite formation was inhibited at the same time that cardiogenesis occurred and the functional heart was observed to be beating. The exact cause of the embryonic developmental deformity is still unknown. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial growth; Delta Smelt; Developmental deformity; Fish embryo toxicity testing; Medaka; Mortality","Bacteria; Carbon; Climate change; Deformation; Drought; Estuaries; Fish; Organic carbon; Toxicity; Water quality; Bacterial growth; Developmental deformity; Medaka; Mortality; Toxicity testing; Population statistics; Aeromonas; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria; Hypomesus transpacificus; Microcystis; Oryziinae",2-s2.0-85027890962

This paper considers two fuzzy approaches for forecasting future mortality rates. First, the fuzzy autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method allows the making of fuzzy forecasts based on crisp estimates of mortality model parameters. Second, the fuzzy Lee-Carter method models past mortality rates as fuzzy numbers, and then allows the prediction of future fuzzy mortality rates.

High energy supply is required especially in the developing countries to sustain the lifestyle due to the growth in the world's population and techno-economic city. In fact, the sources of fossil fuel-based energy are limited and the use of fossil fuels can lead to the environmental pollution problem. Accordingly, the combustion of fossil fuels sources will give rise to the global warming issue, i.e., the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide resulting in erratic weather patterns, such as floods, draughts, etc. In the last two decades, solar photovoltaic cells have been used as the alternatives to generate renewable, sustainable and green energy. High dye absorption rates, efficient charge separation of exciton, and free charge carrier formation as well as large area production at low costs contribute to the emerging photovoltaic technologies. Generally, the materials involved in photoanode section (acting as the platform for the electron collection) are the main key to produce high-efficiency photovoltaic cells. Currently, multijunction based solar panels showed the highest performance of 40% efficiency as compared to that of the conventional Si based solar panels with 22–27% efficiency. Apart of that, DSSCs sensitized by the silyl-anchor and carboxy-anchor dyes have attained the highest efficiency of 14%. In recent years, the metal doping or binary oxide photo-catalyst systems, particularly graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites, have attracted much attention due to their extraordinary characteristics, i.e., (i) photocatalyst activity enhancement, and (ii) accelerated electron mobility to reduce the charge recombination. The high efficiency of the graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites in DSSCs’ reaction basically requires a suitable architecture that minimizes electron loss during excitation state and maximizes photon absorption. In order to further improve the immigration of photo-induced charge carriers during excitation state, considerable efforts have to be exerted to further improve the charge mobility and maximize the dye loading. It has also been reported that the properties of graphene-TiO2 nanocomposites primarily depend on the nature of the preparation method, and the role of optimum dopants content incorporated into the graphene photoanode to improve the dye molecules loading and minimize the charge recombination. Therefore, we review recent achievements for different nanoarchitecture of TiO2, as well as graphene-TiO2 composite nanostructured based photoanode in DSSCs performance with future prospects and challenges. Indeed, graphene-TiO2 composite photoanode has proven to be of great interest for use in DSSCs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dye-sensitized solar cells; Graphene; Nanomaterials; Photoanode; Titanium dioxide","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Charge carriers; Developing countries; Dye-sensitized solar cells; Excited states; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Nanocomposites; Nanostructured materials; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photovoltaic cells; Photovoltaic effects; Population statistics; Solar cell arrays; Solar cells; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Titanium dioxide; Accelerated electrons; Charge recombinations; Electron collections; Environmental pollution problem; Photo-anodes; Photocatalyst activity; Photovoltaic technology; Secondary energy sources; Graphene",2-s2.0-85029375350

We analysed data on 1292 landslide and 771 flood fatalities that occurred in Italy in the 50-year period 1965–2014, to determine the dependence of the fatalities on gender and age and the circumstances of death by type of hazard. The multinomial probability mass function of the expected fatalities by gender and age, as reported by national census data, were estimated and compared with the observed landslide and flood fatalities. We identified the age categories over or under represented when the observed fatalities were respectively higher or lower than the modelled expected deaths. We found that in Italy males are more vulnerable to floods and landslides for most of the age categories. Apart from children, males are over-represented up to the age of 89 for floods and up to 79 for landslides, whereas females are under-represented up to the age of 59 for floods and landslides, and over-represented above 70 for floods and between 60 and 79 for landslides. To consider the demographic and socio-cultural changes over time, we performed a temporal analysis splitting the record into two non-overlapping subsets of 25 year each. The analysis demonstrated that the over-representation of males compared to the females, both for landslide and flood is statistically significant and does not vary in time, indicating a different propensity towards the risk taking and a different degree of exposure between males and females. Analysis of the data allowed to identify the common circumstances of death. Landslides fatalities occurred frequently indoor, whereas the majority of the flood fatalities occurred outdoor, outlining the different dynamics of the hazards. Floods killed numerous people along roads and drivers or passengers travelling in vehicles. We expect that the results of this work will be helpful to design recommendations for self-protecting actions, and proactive policies that can contribute to reduce the human toll of floods and landslides in Italy, and elsewhere. © 2017 The Authors","Deaths; Flood and landslide fatalities; Flood and landslide mortality; Gender and age analysis; Geo-hydrological disasters; Loss of life; Statistical approach","Hazards; Landslides; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk management; Social sciences; Deaths; Gender and age analysis; Landslide mortality; Loss of life; Statistical approach; Floods",2-s2.0-85027550638

However, the effect of urban spatial planning on spatial pattern of carbon dioxide emissions in cities is rarely discussed. The relationships between the changes in urban zoning plans and carbon dioxide emissions of major economic sectors has yet to be investigated on a scale smaller than an entire city. Using the Taipei metropolitan area as a case study, this study hypothesizes that: (1) carbon dioxide emissions have a spatial dimension within the city due mainly to the heterogeneous nature of land use activities and urbanization, and (2) changes in spatial planning can influence the urban form, and consequentially affect carbon dioxide emissions through changes in traffic demand and energy consumption. A downscaling analysis approach was used to estimate carbon dioxide emissions of different sectors for each administrative district in the Taipei metropolitan area. The analytical results reveal that the total carbon dioxide emissions of the four sectors in the Taipei metropolitan area increased with the increases in the growth of urban planned zones during the period 1981–2011.The carbon dioxide emission increases were correlated with the distribution of land uses in each administrative district. A negative correlation was found between the population density and the per-capita carbon dioxide emissions in the transportation sector. The compact development and planning of urban transit systems are believed to be the source of decreasing per-capita carbon dioxide emissions. While many studies have emphasized that spatial planning is important addressing climate change, this work demonstrates understanding the historic links between spatial planning and carbon dioxide is equally valuable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Downscaling analysis; Urban spatial planning","Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Global warming; Land use; Mass transportation; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Transit time devices; Urban growth; Urban planning; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Down-scaling; Negative correlation; Population densities; Spatial planning; Transportation sector; Urban transit system; Carbon dioxide",2-s2.0-85027727878

Several researchers have obtained positive preliminary results using OC-SVMs. Nevertheless, existing algorithms are either too complicated or oversimplified and their performance needs to be further improved. In this study, a modified neighborhood one-class support vector machine (MNOC-SVM) algorithm is proposed to detect brain functional activation on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This method is based on two basic assumptions: (a) For task-related fMRI data, time series of only a few voxels are related to a particular functional activity or functional area, and these voxels should be identified as activated voxels, i.e., the outliers. In contrast, for resting-state fMRI data, only a small number of voxels are unrelated to any resting-state functional networks. These voxels should instead be taken as non-activated voxels, i.e., the outliers. (b) Close voxels have similarly activated or non-activated states. To improve detection accuracy, we apply the following features to each voxel: the RV coefficient between each voxel and its 26 neighborhood voxels (or fewer than 26 for voxels on the edge of the brain), a flag for isolated voxels and a flag for isolated areas. For both task-related and resting-state fMRI data, our MNOC-SVM method effectively detects activated functional areas in the whole brain. © 2017","Brain activation detection; fMRI data; OC-SVM; Regional homogeneity","Chemical activation; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Statistics; Support vector machines; Brain activation; fMRI data; Functional activation; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Machine learning methods; OC-SVM; One-class support vector machine; Regional homogeneity; Functional neuroimaging; algorithm; Article; clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; comparative study; controlled study; electroencephalogram; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; neighborhood; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; resting state network; support vector machine; time series analysis; visual stimulation",2-s2.0-85028690849

We collected data in the central Great Basin (Lander, Nye, and Eureka Counties, Nevada) and western Great Basin (Mono County, California and Mineral, Douglas, and Lyon Counties, Nevada), United States. We used Bayesian model selection to identify sets of five species that best explained observed variation in species richness of the same or the other taxonomic group in either subregion. We then built random forest models that included only the five identified indicator species and externally tested these models with new data from the other subregion (central or western Great Basin) or a later time in the same subregion. We compared the predictive accuracy of indicator-species only models to that of models based on environmental variables or on both indicator species and environmental variables. In external evaluations, models based on same-taxon indicator species predicted 34–52% of the variation in species richness of birds and 40–70% of the variation in species richness of butterflies. Comparable models based on environmental variables predicted 11–46% of the variation in species richness of birds and 12–67% of the variation in species richness of butterflies. Models based on same-taxon indicator species predicted more variation in species richness than those based on environmental variables in seven of eight cases. Our results suggested that the predictive accuracy and spatial and temporal transferability of models based on indicator species can exceed that of models based on environmental variables.

Under greenhouse conditions, a previous recurrent selection for high-oil castor seeds from a base population resulted in a new population with an increased mean oil content from 50.33 to 54.47% dry weight, average single seed weight from 0.44 to 0.54 g, and correlation between oil content and weight from moderate (r = 0.43, p < 0.0001) to strong (r = 0.77, p < 0.0001). Here, we describe field trials to evaluate the oil content and seed weight of the new (Test), and base (Control) populations. Duplicated Tests and Controls were planted and the trials were repeated for two consecutive years. From planting to seed harvesting, no difference in growth pattern was observed in either of the populations. Test seeds had a mean oil contents of 54.01% dry weight, an average single seed weight of 0.54 g, and strong correlations between oil content and weight (r = 0.71 to 0.72, p < 0.0001), similar to the new population obtained from the greenhouse study. Correspondingly, Control seeds had a mean oil content of 50.5% dry weight, an average single seed weight of 0.44 g, and moderate correlation between oil content and weight (r = 0.43 to 0.44, p < 0.0001), comparable to previous data on the base population. The frequency distribution of oil content and seed weight in field- and greenhouse-grown castor seeds were similar.

However, the latter approximation introduces a systematic error in fat percentage quantification in patients where the differences in lipid chemical composition are significant (such as for neuromuscular disorders) because of the spatial dependence of the peak amplitudes. The present work aims to overcome this limitation by taking advantage of an unsupervised clusterization-based approach offering a reliable criterion to carry out a data-driven segmentation of the input MRI dataset into multiple regions.

At the individual level, their toxicity and underlying mechanisms of action have been studied through experimental exposure. However, the number of experimental studies approaching marine environmental situations is scarce, i.e., in most cases, individuals are exposed to either single congeners, or single types of molecules, or high concentrations, so that results can hardly be transposed to natural populations. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of chronic dietary exposure to an environmentally realistic marine mixture of PCB and PBDE congeners on zebrafish life-history traits from larval to adult stage. Exposure was conducted through diet from the first meal and throughout the life cycle of the fish. The mixture was composed so as to approach environmentally relevant marine conditions in terms of both congener composition and concentrations. Life-history traits of exposed fish were compared to those of control individuals using several replicate populations in each treatment. We found evidence of slower body growth, but to a larger asymptotic length, and delayed spawning probability in exposed fish. In addition, offspring issued from early spawning events of exposed fish exhibited a lower larval survival under starvation condition. Given their strong dependency on life-history traits, marine fish population dynamics and associated fisheries productivity for commercial species could be affected by such individual-level effects of PCBs and PBDEs on somatic growth, spawning probability and larval survival. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Body length; Condition; Contaminants; Energy allocation; Fertilization rate; Trade-off","Economic and social effects; Fish; Fisheries; Impurities; Mixtures; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Population statistics; Body length; Condition; Energy allocations; Fertilization rates; Trade off; Organic pollutants; Danio rerio",2-s2.0-85027583687

However, it is a stochastic technique that is vulnerable to premature convergence to sub-optimal clustering solutions. PSO-based clustering algorithms also require tuning of the learning coefficient values to find better solutions. The latter drawbacks can be evaded by setting a proper balance between the exploitation and exploration behaviors of particles while searching the feature space. Moreover, particles must take into account the magnitude of movement in each dimension and search for the optimal solution in the most populated regions in the feature space. This study presents a novel approach for data clustering based on particle swarms. In this proposal, the balance between exploitation and exploration processes is considered using a combination of (i) kernel density estimation technique associated with new bandwidth estimation method to address the premature convergence and (ii) estimated multidimensional gravitational learning coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using 11 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in terms of classification accuracy, repeatability represented by the standard deviation of the classification accuracy over different runs, and cluster compactness represented by the average Dunn index values over different runs. The results of Friedman Aligned-Ranks test with Holm's test over the average classification accuracy and Dunn index values indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy and compactness when compared with other algorithms. The significance of the proposed algorithm is represented in addressing the limitations of the PSO-based clustering algorithms to push forward clustering as an important technique in the field of expert systems and machine learning. Such application, in turn, enhances the classification accuracy and cluster compactness. In this context, the proposed algorithm achieves better results compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms when applied to high-dimensional datasets (e.g., Landsat and Dermatology). This finding confirms the importance of estimating multidimensional learning coefficients that consider particle movements in all the dimensions of the feature space. The proposed algorithm can likewise be applied in repeatability matters for better decision making, as in medical diagnosis, as proved by the low standard deviation obtained using the proposed algorithm in conducted experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data clustering; Exploitation and exploration balance; Kernel density estimation; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm intelligence; Universal gravity rule","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Decision making; Diagnosis; Estimation; Evolutionary algorithms; Expert systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Statistics; Stochastic systems; Swarm intelligence; Data clustering; Exploitation and explorations; High dimensional datasets; Kernel Density Estimation; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; State-of-the-art algorithms; UCI machine learning repository; Universal gravity rule; Clustering algorithms",2-s2.0-85028849459

The present study evaluated the effects of PD (features) on treatment continuation and effectiveness in Cognitive Therapy (CT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for MDD. Methods Depressed outpatients were randomized to CT (n=72) and IPT (n=74). Primary outcome was depression severity measured repeatedly with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline, three months, at the start of each therapy session, at post-treatment and monthly during five months follow-up. Results Comorbid PD and PD features did not affect dropout. Multilevel and Cox regression models indicated no negative effect of PD on BDI-II change and remission rates during treatment and follow-up, irrespective of the treatment received. For both therapies, higher dependent PD features predicted overall lower BDI-II scores during treatment, however this effect did not sustain through follow-up. Cluster A PD features moderated treatment outcome during treatment and follow-up: individuals with high cluster A PD features had greater BDI-II reductions over time in CT as compared to IPT. Limitations Not all therapists and participants were blind to the assessment of PD (features), and assessments were performed by one rater. Further research must investigate the state and trait dependent changes of PD and MDD over time. Conclusions We found no negative impact of PD on the effectiveness and treatment retention of CT and IPT for MDD during treatment and follow-up.

We addressed an environmental surveillance of both HPyVs (JCPyV and BKPyV) and HPVs in three wastewater treatment plants in Egypt. A high level of dissemination was found for both viruses. HPyVs (JCPyV and BKPyV) were found in ~ 73% of examined samples, while HPVs were detected in 30.5%. Sequence analysis of HPV positive samples revealed a wide variety of circulating genotypes representing both anogenital (HPV-6, HPV-16, HPV-53, HPV-44, HPV-31, HPV-43) and cutaneous (HPV-37, HPV-21, HPV-120, HPV-111, HPV-5) types. In addition, two unclassified sequences were identified, suggesting putative types. The median concentrations of HPyVs in inflow samples were 3.03 × 1005, 3.9 × 1005, and 1.44 × 1005 GC/l in the three WWTPs, respectively. Whereas, the viral concentration in outflow reduced by one order of magnitude in WWTP-A and WWTP-C and two orders of magnitude in WWTP-B. On the other hand, the mean concentration of the quantified HPVs positive samples was 1.68 × 1003 GC/l for inflow and a quite similar pattern in the outflow as well. These data provide an evidence about the actual circulation pattern of both viruses in the population. Also, the high abundance of HPyVs supports its potential as a possible fecal indicator.

The model is applied on a metropolitan region level, encompassing 101 cities and towns surrounding Boston in the northeastern United States. The ‘marginal’ land use category includes vacant and abandoned lands, portions of public and private lots, and degraded lands, with poor soil quality. Four different energy crops—miscanthus, switchgrass, poplar, and willow—were considered as biomass feedstocks for bioenergy production. A total marginal land area of 71,200 ha (712 km2) was identified that can be suitably used for bioenergy production, representing 20% of the total land area of the region. Spatial analysis revealed greatest marginal land densities close to the urban core. Statistical analysis found a weak positive correlation between population density and marginal land availability. Short-rotation hybrid poplar was identified as the highest yielding bioenergy crop for this region. Bioenergy potential calculations revealed that poplar can potentially yield up to 22 PJ (HHV) of yearly primary energy for this region that can be used for heat, conversion to transportation fuels, and/or electricity production. This is equivalent to &gt;50% of current biomass primary energy use in Massachusetts and could potentially fulfill all of the core city of Boston's heating demand. Hauling of biomass from the periphery to the urban core would add an estimated maximum of $7.20 per ton delivered.

Over the past decade, several regions with low population density have successfully transited towards renewable energy (for example Siena, Italy). In the Netherlands and other countries, more densely populated regions have drawn up ambitious targets for energy transition. Most of these transition targets lack empirical evidence with regard to spatio-technological feasibility. This lack of evidence may compromise energy transition if constraints are discovered posteriori and short-term milestones missed. To address this shortcoming, we propose an integrated approach. Spatial Transition Analysis (STA) can assist in defining spatially explicit and evidence-based targets for energy transition. STA combines quantitative modelling of energy potentials, qualitative spatial considerations for the siting of renewable energy technologies and comparative scenario development. The application of STA in a case-study (Parkstad Limburg, the Netherlands) revealed that the region has the potential to become energy neutral between 2035 and 2045. Examining and illustrating the different types of constraints as well as the possible choices between renewable energy technologies enabled stakeholders to start planning for energy transition and implementing first interventions. This shows that STA provides a solid framework to foster sustainable energy transition initiated by regional stakeholders and informed by local preferences. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Energy landscape; Energy potential maps; Energy-conscious; Landscape architecture; Landscape planning; Stakeholder preferences","Climate change; Energy conservation; Fossil fuels; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Energy landscape; Energy-conscious; Landscape architecture; Landscape planning; Stakeholder preferences; Spatial variables measurement",2-s2.0-85027687909

The building was developed in Birmingham, UK and the contract value was circa £36 million (UK Sterling, 2015). Members of the project management team (PMT) produced designs that were subsequently integrated by the main contractor into a federated building information modelling (BIM) model; at this stage 404 error clashes were evident between the positions of the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) designer's and structural designer's building compartments. The contractor deemed that these particular clashes were ‘mission critical’ as previous experience suggested that project costs could spiral uncontrollably if left unabated. Participatory action research was employed to acquire a deeper understanding and knowledge of the clash incidents. Clash data accrued (in mm) was subsequently quantitatively modelled using the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Two models produced were the Log Logistic Three Parameter (3P) (using all data including outliers) and Generalized Gamma distribution (excluding outliers). Both models satisfied Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit tests at α 0.01 and 0.02 levels of significance. Model parameters could be used to forecast similar clashes occurring on future projects and will prove invaluable to PMT members when accurately estimating the time and resource needed to integrate BIM designs. The predictive modelling revealed that 92.98% of clashes reside within the 30–299 mm range while the most probable occurrence of a clash overlap resides in a discrete category of 100–199 mm. Further qualitative investigation is also conducted to understand why these clashes occurred and propagate ideas about how such may be mitigated. The research concludes on two important points, namely: i) BIM is not a panacea to design related construction project rework and that innovative 21st century digital technologies are hampered by 20th century management practices; and ii) improvements in clash and error mitigation reside in a better understanding of tolerances specified to alleviate the erroneous task of resolving unnecessary clashes. Future research is proposed that seeks to: automate the clash detection management, analysis and resolution process; conduct further investigative analysis of the organizational and human resource management influences impacting upon design clash propagation; and devise and validate new procedural methods to mitigate clash occurrence using a real-life project. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building information modelling; Clash detection; Cumulative distribution function; Generalized Gamma distribution; Log Logistic (3P) distribution; Probability density function","Buildings; Contractors; Contracts; Distribution functions; Human resource management; Information theory; Management science; Probability; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Project management; Statistics; Structural design; Building Information Modelling; Clash detection; Cumulative distribution function; Generalized gamma distribution; Log-logistic; Architectural design",2-s2.0-85032384727

Previous studies have mainly extracted features from the signal manually, but proper features need to be selected carefully. To avoid performance degradation caused by manual feature selection, we applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the automatic feature extractor and classifier for fNIRS-based BCI. In this study, the hemodynamic responses evoked by performing rest, right-, and left-hand motor execution tasks were measured on eight healthy subjects to compare performances.

This is associated with a strong precari-ousness and labor turnover, plus the widespread practice of subcontracting. The pertinence of the study carried out is framed in the necessity of evaluating and valuing the management indicators, through accident rates that are statistically valid. In order to obtain the indices as a function of sectoral and market management variables, several statistical models were developed with the capacity to predict the behavior of these indices. Exogenous variables, such as the unemployment rate and the GDP growth rate of Portugal, were included for this purpose. These statistical models function as predictive models, provided that the coefficients of the independent variables are significant. Linear regressions were used because, due to the temporal shortage of data, the other types of regression would hardly prove to be robust. Also, were tested dozens of models, and the overwhelming majority did not show any statistical significance. Nevertheless, we obtained 3 (three) partially significant multiple linear regression models. Thus, as a final result of this work, it was verified that only (2) two models, demonstrated to have good predictability and reliability for future use. Being that these appear as relevant variables, the unemployment rate and the training costs per worker. These models can be used by companies in the industry, such as tools for the prevention of accidents at work. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Construction; Models; Prevention; Safety","Accident prevention; Accidents; Construction; Construction industry; Employment; Human engineering; Job satisfaction; Linear regression; Models; Regression analysis; Construction sectors; Exogenous variables; Independent variables; Multiple linear regression models; Organizational management; Prevention; Prevention of accidents; Statistical significance; Population statistics",2-s2.0-85022175795

We want to determine the time period for which their function will be guaranteed in the course of operation in different operational conditions. These conditions are represented by distinct temperature levels and various discharge currents. Capability monitoring is performed experimentally and mathematically. Within the experiments a decrease in battery voltage is monitored at different ambient temperature levels and discharge currents. Then, discharge courses are modelled and simulated using Wiener processes to obtain a set of time points when the battery voltage drops below a critical value. The first hitting time, i.e., a guaranteed period of an up-state with respect both to given operating conditions and critical threshold, is assessed by non-parametric methods, namely by the kernel density estimation. The results of testing, modelling and simulation provide an interesting picture about Li-ion battery operational behaviour.

However, PSO has premature convergence, is easily trapped in the local optimum solution and is ineffective in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in complex multi-peak search functions. To overcome the shortcomings of PSO, a hybrid particle swarm optimizer with sine cosine acceleration coefficients (H-PSO-SCAC) is proposed to solve these problems. It is verified by the application of twelve numerical optimization problems. In H-PSO-SCAC, we make the following improvements: First, we introduce sine cosine acceleration coefficients (SCAC) to efficiently control the local search and convergence to the global optimum solution. Second, opposition-based learning (OBL) is adopted to initialize the population. Additionally, we utilize a sine map to adjust the inertia weight ω. Finally, we propose a modified position update formula. Experimental results show that, in the majority of cases, the H-PSO-SCAC approach is capable of efficiently solving numerical optimization tasks and outperforms the existing similar population-based algorithms and PSO variants proposed in recent years. Therefore, the H-PSO-SCAC algorithm is successfully employed as a novel optimization strategy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Opposition-based learning; Particle swarm optimizer; Sine cosine acceleration coefficients; Sine map","Global optimization; Optimization; Pattern matching; Population statistics; Acceleration coefficients; Balancing exploration and exploitations; Computational overheads; Global optimum solutions; Numerical optimizations; Opposition-based learning; Particle swarm optimizers; Population-based algorithm; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",2-s2.0-85028957463

It remains poorly understood how patterns of mating and gene flow influence key components for their long-term persistence such as effective population size or genetic diversity. Yet such information is critical for designing effective protection measures and informing programs for the conservation of forest genetic resources. Here we investigate the mating system and pollen dispersal of a long-term refugial population of beech (Fagus sylvatica), a major European forest tree. This population stretches over ca. 7 km along the ravines of a small lowland river in SW France. We exhaustively mapped the adult population (n = 932 trees) and collected seed families (n = 450 seeds) from 30 mother trees spread across the stand. All individuals were genotyped at 113 SNP markers and submitted to paternity analyses. We estimated various mating parameters and tested whether among-individual variation was related with the ecological neighbourhood of the mother tree. A unique father could be identified for all seeds analysed. We detected neither pollen immigration nor selfing events. Instead, we observed extensive mating between neighbouring trees that resulted in a very steep decline of the pollen dispersal kernel and a low effective number of fathers (median Nep = 7.9). In turn, male fecundity was tightly related with the distance between mates. The adult population showed an exceptionally strong and far-reaching spatial genetic structure indicating that neighbouring trees are most often sibs. The predominant mating between these neighbours suggests that patterns of reproduction and pollen flow are not constrained by cross-compatibility issues. Instead, dense conspecific neighbourhoods even tend to bar long-distance pollen flow by saturating the stigmas of mother trees through pollen swamping. The observed patterns are a direct consequence of the refugial habitat that imposes the population's linear distribution and whose dense vegetation represents a further obstacle to pollen dispersal. The elevated capacity of sib-mating might be a microevolutionary consequence of the population's long-term persistence in isolation. The resulting spatial genetic structure and the critical role of tree density in assuring an effective reproduction have important consequences for the design of forest genetic resources programs as well as for the conservation management of refugial and other riparian tree populations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Forest genetic resources; Long-term population persistence; Mating system; Pollen cloud; Riparian forest; Spatial genetic structure","Natural resources management; Population statistics; Genetic resources; Mating system; Population persistences; Riparian forests; Spatial genetic structure; Forestry; deciduous forest; dispersal; genetic resource; genetic structure; genetic variation; pollen; refugee; reproductive strategy; riparian forest; spatial variation; France; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica",2-s2.0-85031905139

The selection of bandwidth in KDE is suggested. Then, two least-square fitting procedures are performed to reconstruct the EVD, where a two-section form parametric model for the EVD is proposed. The shifted generalized lognormal distribution (SGLD), which has a rich flexibility in shape, is fitted based on the preliminary estimation to obtain the main body of EVD.

The body couples stemming from a misalignment between the electric field and the electric-dipole density vector are studied and the conservation laws for polymer networks are derived. Using variational principles, expressions for the polarization and the stress are determined. Interestingly, it is found that the stress tensor resulting from coupled loadings in which the electric field is misaligned with the principal stretch directions is not symmetric and the asymmetry arises from the body couples. Next, the electro-mechanical response of a chain is analyzed. The deformations of the individual polymer chains are related to the macroscopic deformation via two highly non-linear constraints - the first pertaining to the compatibility of the local deformations with the imposed macroscopic one and the second stems from the symmetric part of the stress at equilibrium. In accord with the proposed framework, an amended three-chains model is introduced. The predictions of this model are found to be in excellent agreement with experimental findings. Lastly, the behavior of a polymer subjected to a simple shear and an electric field is studied. The offset between the electric field and the principal directions gives rise to body couples, a polarization that is not aligned with the electric field, and an asymmetric stress tensor. © 2017","Dielectrics; Electro-active polymers; Electromechanical coupling; Multi-scale analysis","Deformation; Dielectric materials; Electric fields; Electromechanical coupling; Polarization; Statistics; Tensors; Dielectric polymers; Electro-active polymers; Electromechanical response; Macroscopic deformations; Multi scale analysis; Non-linear constraints; Principal directions; Variational principles; Polymers",2-s2.0-85030872909

To this end agricultural intensification is considered desirable, yet, there remain uncertainties regarding the impact of climate change on opportunities for agricultural intensification and the adequacy of intensification options given the rapid population growth. We quantify trade-offs between levels of yield gap closure, food availability and forest and woodland conservation under different scenarios. Each scenario is made up of a combination of variants of four parameters i.e. (1) climate change based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs); (2) population growth based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs); (3) cropland expansion with varying degrees of deforestation; and (4) different degrees of yield gap closure. We carry out these analyses for three major food crops, i.e. maize, cassava and yam, in Benin. Our analyses show that in most of the scenarios, the required levels of yield gap closures required to maintain the current levels of food availability can be achieved by 2050 by maintaining the average rate of yield increases recorded over the past two and half decades in addition to the current cropping intensity. However, yields will have to increase at a faster rate than has been recorded over the past two and half decades in order to achieve the required levels of yield gap closures by 2100. Our analyses also show that without the stated levels of yield gap closure, the areas under maize, cassava and yam cultivation will have to increase by 95%, 102% and 250% respectively in order to maintain the current levels of per capita food availability. Our study shows that food security outcomes and forest and woodland conservation goals in Benin and likely the larger SSA region are inextricably linked together and require holistic management strategies that considers trade-offs and co-benefits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Food availability; Food security; Forest and woodland; Population growth; Yield gap closures","Agriculture; Aircraft propulsion; Commerce; Cultivation; Deforestation; Food supply; Forestry; Plants (botany); Population statistics; Agricultural intensification; Ecosystem protection; Food availability; Food security; Forest and woodland; Management strategies; Population growth; Rapid population growth; Climate change; climate change; crop yield; food availability; food security; forest; nature conservation; population growth; trade-off; woodland; agricultural procedures; Article; Benin; cassava; climate change; cropland; cropping system; deforestation; environmental impact; environmental protection; food availability; food security; forest management; harvest; maize; population growth; priority journal; quantitative analysis; yam; Benin [West Africa]; Dioscorea alata; Manihot esculenta; Zea mays",2-s2.0-85021158082

Although there is an increasing literature on food N and its environmental impacts in China, the relative magnitude of these driving forces are not well understood. Here we first quantify the differences in per capita AN and PN consumption in urban and rural areas and their impacts on N input to the food system during 1990–2012, and then quantify the relative contributions of DC, PG and M in the overall N change during this period. Our results show that a resident registered as living in city required 0.5 kg more AN yr− 1 and 0.5 kg less PN yr− 1 than one living in a rural area, in 2012. DC, PG and M accounted for 52%, 31% and 17% of the total AN increase, respectively. These three factors caused 46% of the increased N use for food production over the past two decades. Another 54% was mainly caused by the declining in N use efficiencies of the food system. Food-sourced N loss intensity in urban and rural areas were 502 and 162 kg N hm− 2 in 2012, a three-fold difference due to the increasing amount and a linear rural-urban flow of N input, and inadequate N recovery via solid waste and wastewater treatment in cities. Our study highlights China is facing higher risks of environmental N pollution with urbanization, because of the high demand for AN and higher food-sourced N loss intensity in urban than in rural areas. © 2017","Dietary changes; Driving force; Food N consumption; Population growth; Rural-urban migration","Environmental impact; Nitrogen; Population statistics; Rural areas; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Dietary changes; Driving forces; Food production; N use efficiency; Nitrogen flow; Population growth; Relative contribution; Urban and rural areas; Urban growth; nitrogen; diet; environmental impact; environmental risk; food consumption; income; nitrogen; population growth; rural-urban migration; twentieth century; twenty first century; Article; China; environmental impact; environmental management; food; food composition; food industry; food intake; human; income; meat; migration; plant; population growth; priority journal; rural area; solid waste; trend study; urban area; urban rural difference; China; Animalia",2-s2.0-85028721893

In consideration of FIT, we propose an integration plan for incinerator plants (IPs) with highly efficient power generation for the whole area of a prefecture. The plan includes disposal of forest biomass using the reserve capacity of IPs. The model prefecture's population is set to 1,200,000 and the proportion of the forested area is set to 70% of the model area based on data for northeastern Japan. The present 16 IPs are integrated into three new IPs. A relay transportation (RT) facility for waste is located at a decommissioned IP, and the waste from the area is transported to the new IP. In order to calculate the RT costs, an approximation formula for the RT distance is estimated via the IPs integration study. The plan will realize about 37% cost reduction and 1.8-fold CO2 reduction including RT as compared to the plan to update the current IP situation. Forest biomass of 56,500 tons per year, which is about 43% of available forest biomass volume in the model prefecture, can be disposed of at new IPs. On the other hand, enough profit is not expected from the dedicated biomass power generation plant as a result of wood chip processing fees.

The aggregation of individuals in the population is closely related to distribution and abundance, but they are not totally equivalent patterns. Despite the great efforts made in recent decades to harmonise the sampling protocols used to collect distribution and abundance data, studies regarding the development and testing of aggregation indices are scarce, even when individuals’ aggregation is quite relevant and necessary for the design of effective wildlife management policies. One of the most popular aggregation indices is the overcrowding index (m*), which quantifies the number of individuals per group, and does not, therefore, take into account how the individuals and groups are distributed in a given territorial unit. In this study, we describe and assess a new spatially explicit aggregation index (SAI) in which the distribution of individuals within the group and the groups in the territorial units are included in the formulation. A comparative evaluation of the proposed index was carried out in relation to m*, including a specific assessment of the biological meaning of these indices by relating aggregation indices with pathogen prevalence in a multi-host epidemiological scenario. Our results showed that SAI – but not m* – responded to changes in the aggregation level of individuals in the population in both theoretical scenarios and with real data obtained from a case study. Spatial information is, therefore, required to quantify individuals’ aggregation and the processes that are associated with it. This is particularly relevant when our understanding of processes needs to be addressed on a fine local scale, as is the case when working in epidemiology. Our results reinforce this idea, since the capacity of SAI to explain the prevalence of animal tuberculosis at a community level was significantly higher than that observed for m*, the latter being to a great extent based in the abundance of individuals in the area. We concluded that SAI has a great potential for wildlife monitoring in general and for epidemiological studies in particular and may, together with abundance data, provide practical information to evaluate wildlife management actions and define effective policies for diseases control. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Disease ecology; Livestock-wildlife interface; Population monitoring; Unmanned aircraft systems; Wildlife abundance; Wildlife distribution","Agriculture; Animals; Disease control; Ecology; Epidemiology; Population statistics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Disease ecology; Population monitoring; Unmanned aircraft system; Wildlife abundance; Wildlife distribution; Population distribution; abundance; airborne survey; epidemiology; host; index method; livestock; monitoring; overcrowding; spatial distribution; tuberculosis; unmanned vehicle; wildlife management; Animalia",2-s2.0-85030174964

Though the existing urban development evaluation system is advanced, there is no commonly recognized underground space development evaluation index system. The correlations between urban indicators and underground space development, as well as between each underground indicator and the other, have not been comprehensively studied. Based on summarizing underground space evaluation indicators and the city indicators that affect underground space development, 12 indicators from categories of economy, society and underground are chosen to assess urban underground space (UUS) development. The 7 urban indicators that may affect the development of UUS include population density, per capita GDP, proportion of tertiary industry, industrial density, urbanization rate, investment in real estate development and car ownership. The 5 underground space indicators are underground space per capita, underground space per built-up area, underground parking proportion, proportion of service space in underground space, and underground space social dominant proportion. The data of 56 representative cities at different levels in 2015 is collected, normalized, shown in radar chart, and the correlation analysis are summarized. Based on sample analysis and other detailed works, four main conclusions of UUS developments in Chinese cities are put forward, including (1) the distribution can be broadly divided into three levels, and the structure is described as three cores, two axes, and one belt; (2) China is at the forefront of UUS development on aspects of UUS amount, Metro construction, underground complex construction, equipment and technologies and related industries; (3) the development is stimulated and promoted by urban development problems such as traffic problems, resource shortages and city resilience needs; (4) the development has a close relationship to city character and industrial structure. Three trends are concluded as new promoting roles in urban development in depth, new characterized development features, and increasing influence on urban forms.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied to assess the environmental performance landing 1 t of seafood with wooden demersal trawlers in the Gulf of Gabes. Impact categories included in the study were abiotic depletion potential (ADP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), global warming potential (GWP), ozone depletion potential (ODP), photochemical oxidant formation potential (POFP), human toxicity potential (HTP), marine eco-toxicity potential (METP), terrestrial eco-toxicity potential (TETP), land occupation potential (LOP), and total cumulative energy demand (TCED). Demersal trawlers were classified based on their impact intensity. Results showed that 70% of the vessels had relatively low impacts. Impact intensity was proportional to the amount of fuel consumed to land 1 t of seafood. Ships that fished less had the highest impacts per ton, due to lower fishing effort and catch per unit effort. This is likely to typify vessels that target highly valuable species such as shrimp. Onboard vessel activities contributed most to different environmental impacts (AP, EP, GWP and POFP), related to the high energy use of this fishery. Several impacts (ADP, ODP, METP, LOP and TCED) were associated mainly with fuel and lubricating oil production. Therefore, improvements must focus on minimizing fuel consumption.

Similarly, the Waterloo WWTP treatment operation is also expected to improve once the upgrades have been fully implemented and is expected to effectively treat estrogens even under extreme scenarios of population growth and river flows. The developed model may be employed to support decision making on wastewater management strategies designed for environmental protection, especially on reducing the endocrine effects in fish exposed to WWTP effluents. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Effluent; Endocrine disruption; Estrogenicity; Model; Wastewater; Water treatment","Decision making; Effluent treatment; Models; Population statistics; Rivers; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Direct measurement; Endocrine disruption; Estrogenic effluents; Estrogenicity; Municipal wastewaters; Treatment efficiency; Wastewater management; Wastewater treatment plants; Effluents",2-s2.0-85027839540

H2S generated by anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in WWTPs is a cause for concern because it is an air pollutant, which can cause eye and respiratory irritation, headaches, and nausea. Considering the requirement for WWTPs in all communities, it is necessary to assess the concentrations and effects of gases such as H2S on populations living and/or working near WWTPs. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the indoor and outdoor concentration of H2S in the neighbourhood of two WWTPs located in Curitiba, as well as its human health impacts. Between August 2013 and March 2014 eight sampling campaigns were performed using passive samplers and the analyses were carried out by spectrophotometry, presenting mean concentrations ranging from 0.14 to 32 μg m− 3. Eleven points at WWTP-A reported H2S average concentrations above the WHO recommendation of 10 μg m− 3, and 15 points above the US EPA guideline of 2 μg m− 3. At WWTP-B the H2S concentration was above US EPA guideline at all the sampling points. The I/O ratio on the different sampling sites showed accumulation of indoor H2S in some instances and result in exacerbating the exposure of the residents. The highest H2S concentrations were recorded during the summer in houses located closest to the sewage treatment stations, and towards the main wind direction, showing the importance of these factors when planning a WWTP. Lifetime risk assessments of hydrogen sulphide exposure showed a significant non-carcinogenic adverse health risk for local residents and workers, especially those close to anaerobic WWTPs. The data indicated that WWTPs operated under these conditions should be recognized as a significant air pollution source, putting local populations at risk. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Anaerobic wastewater treatment; Health risk; Hydrogen sulphide; Odour","Air pollution; Health; Health risks; Hydrogen; Hydrogen sulfide; Odors; Pollution; Population statistics; Reclamation; Risk assessment; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Air pollution sources; Anaerobic decomposition; Anaerobic waste water treatment; Average concentration; Human health impacts; Outdoor concentrations; Sulphide concentration; Wastewater treatment plants; Hydrogen sulfide removal (water treatment); hydrogen sulfide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health risk; hydrogen sulfide; odor; pollution exposure; risk assessment; wastewater treatment plant; air pollution; Article; Brazil; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; geographic distribution; hazard assessment; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; no-observed-adverse-effect level; practice guideline; priority journal; spectrophotometry; waste water treatment plant; Brazil; Curitiba; Parana [Brazil]",2-s2.0-85027419956

Independent of mean signal estimates, recent findings have shown that neural variability diminishes with age and is positively associated with cognitive performance, underscoring its adaptive nature. The present investigation sought to employ functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to derive two operationalizations of cerebral oxygenation, representing mean and variability [using standard deviation (SD)] in neural activity, and to specifically contrast these mean- and SD-oxyhemoglobin (HbO) estimates as predictors of cognitive function. Method: a total of 25 older adults (71 to 81 years of age) completed a test of cognitive interference (Multisource Interference Task) while undergoing fNIRS recording using a multichannel continuouswave optical imaging system (TechEn CW6) over bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Time-varying covariation models were employed to simultaneously estimate the within- and between-person effects of cerebral oxygenation on behavioral performance fluctuations. Results: mean effects were predominantly observed at the between-person level and suggest that greater concentrations of HbO are associated with slower and less accurate performance. Greater HbO variability at the between-person level was associated with slower performance, but was associated with faster performance at the within-person level. Conclusions: these findings are in keeping with assertions that mean and variability confer complementary (as opposed to redundant) sources of information regarding the effective functioning of a neural system and suggest that fNIRS is a viable methodology for capturing meaningful variance in the hemodynamic response that is characteristic of adaptive CNS function. © The Authors.","Executive functioning; Neural variability; Older adults; Standard deviation","Adaptive optics; Brain; Infrared devices; Near infrared spectroscopy; Neurons; Neurophysiology; Oxygenation; Statistics; Continuous-wave optical imaging; Executive functioning; Functional near infrared spectroscopy; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs); Neural variability; Older adults; Sources of informations; Standard deviation; Functional neuroimaging; aged; assertiveness; central nervous system function; executive function; female; fluorescence imaging; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; male; prefrontal cortex; tissue oxygenation; very elderly",2-s2.0-85032618734

For time-varying satellite channels, we assume that all the source-satellite links are ON/OFF channels, and then model the satellite transmission between ON and OFF states by using the two-state Markov chain. Following this, we discuss the procedure of SD-SRLNC, and provide a theoretical analysis on its effectiveness of resisting the fading in satellite channel.

A significant challenge in using these analysers as part of process monitoring and control loops is the large amount of personnel time required for calibration and maintenance of models which involve decision inputs such as whether an observation is an outlier, the number of latent variables in a model, type of pre-processing and when a calibration model has to be updated. Since no one measure works well for all applications, supervision by the process data analyst is required which invariably involves some level of subjectivity. In this paper, we focus on the detection of multivariate outliers in a calibration set. We propose a method which combines multiple outlier detection techniques to identify a set of outlying observations without operator input. Apart from the overall methodology, this work introduces several novelties. The system uses partial least squares (PLS) instead of principal component analysis (PCA) which is normally used for detecting multivariate outliers. A simple modification to the Mahalanobis distance was also proposed which appears to be more sensitive to outliers than the conventional Mahalanobis distance. The methodology also introduces the concept of a desirability function to enable automatic decision making based on multiple statistical measures for outlier detection. The methodology is demonstrated using Raman spectroscopy data collected from an industrial distillation process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Desirability function; Mahalanobis distance; Multivariate outliers; Multivariate Trimming; Outlier detection","Data handling; Decision making; Distillation; Least squares approximations; Principal component analysis; Process monitoring; Statistics; Desirability function; Mahalanobis distances; Multivariate Outliers; Outlier Detection; Partial least square (PLS); Petrochemical industry; Process monitoring and control; Simple modifications; Process control",2-s2.0-85031740635

The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence and factors associated with lead, cadmium and arsenic contamination in breast milk collected from lactating mothers in Lebanon. Methods A total of 74 breast milk samples were collected from primaparas according to guidelines set by the World Health Organization. A survey was administered to determine the demographic and anthropometric characteristics of participating lactating mothers. Dietary habits were assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The milk samples were analyzed for the presence of arsenic, cadmium and lead using microwave-assisted digestion and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results Arsenic contamination was found in 63.51% of breast milk samples (mean 2.36 ± 1.95 μg/L) whereas cadmium and lead were detected in 40.54% and 67.61% of samples respectively (means 0.87 ± 1.18 μg/L and 18.18 ± 13.31 μg/L). Regression analysis indicated that arsenic contamination was associated with cereal and fish intake (p = 0.013 and p = 0.042 respectively). Residence near cultivation activities (p = 0.008), smoking status before pregnancy (p = 0.046), potato consumption (p = 0.046) and education level (p = 0.041) were associated with lead contamination. Cadmium contamination was significantly associated with random smoke exposure (p = 0.002). Conclusion Our study is the first in Lebanon to report toxic metal contamination in breast milk. Although estimated weekly infant intake of these metals from breast milk was found to be lower than the limit set by international guidelines, our results highlight the need for developing strategies to protect infants from exposure to these hazardous substances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Arsenic; Breast milk; Cadmium; Determinants; Lead; Lebanon","Cadmium; Contamination; Lead; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Surveys; Arsenic contamination; Atomic absorption spectrophotometry; Breast milk; Cadmium contamination; Determinants; Lebanon; Microwave assisted digestion; World Health Organization; Arsenic; arsenic; cadmium; lead; arsenic; cadmium; child health; demography; food consumption; guideline; health impact; lead; lifestyle; milk; pollution exposure; pollution incidence; pregnancy; questionnaire survey; smoking; socioeconomic conditions; World Health Organization; adult; anthropometry; Article; atomic absorption spectrometry; breast milk; cereal; dangerous goods; demography; dietary intake; education; environmental exposure; female; fish; food contamination; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; human; human experiment; Lebanon; lifestyle; normal human; potato; smoke; smoking; Lebanon; Solanum tuberosum",2-s2.0-85032267679

This study assessed the non-target effects of chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam seed treatments on the life history and walking behavior of Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas), as well as the efficacy of these insecticides for controlling Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith). Thiamethoxam caused mortality of P. nigrispinus, increased the pre-oviposition period, and reduced the oviposition period and the fecundity and survival of females compared to chlorantraniliprole. In contrast, the life expectancy of P. nigrispinus females was prolonged by chlorantraniliprole, which also increased the intrinsic rate of growth (rm) and the finite growth rate (λ), and reduced the population doubling time (DT) compared to thiamethoxam. The net reproductive rate (R0) and mean generation time (T) were not affected by either insecticide treatment, and neither were the walking velocity of P. nigrispinus females, nor the distance they covered. Both chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam reduced soybean leaf consumption by S. frugiperda larvae.

Recently, ensemble methods receive an increasing attention in designing high-quality DE algorithms. However, previous efforts are mainly devoted to the low-level ensemble of mutation strategies of DE. This study investigates the high-level ensemble of multiple existing efficient DE variants. A multi-population based framework (MPF) is proposed to realize the ensemble of multiple DE variants to derive a new algorithm named EDEV for short. EDEV consists of three highly popular and efficient DE variants, namely JADE (adaptive differential evolution with optional external archive), CoDE (differential evolution with composite trial vector generation strategies and control parameters) and EPSDE (differential evolution algorithm with ensemble of parameters and mutation strategies). The whole population of EDEV is partitioned into four subpopulations, including three indicator subpopulations with smaller size and one reward subpopulation with much larger size. Each constituent DE variant in EDEV owns an indicator subpopulation. After every predefined generations, the most efficient constituent DE variant is determined and the reward subpopulation is assigned to that best performed DE variant as an extra reward. Through this manner, the most efficient DE variant is expected to obtain the most computational resources during the optimization process. In addition, the population partition operator is triggered at every generation, which results in timely information sharing and tight cooperation among the component DE variants. Extensive experiments and comparisons have been done based on the CEC2005 and CEC2014 benchmark suit, which shows that the overall performance of EDEV is superior to several state-of-the-art peer DE variants. The success of EDEV reveals that, through an appropriate ensemble framework, different DE variants of different merits can support one another to cooperatively solve optimization problems. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Differential evolution; Ensemble of differential evolution variants; Evolutionary algorithm; Multi-population; Numerical optimization","Benchmarking; Optimization; Population statistics; Silicate minerals; Adaptive differential evolutions; Computational resources; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Information sharing; Multi population; Numerical optimizations; Optimization problems; Evolutionary algorithms",2-s2.0-85030692966

Thus, the function of material stabilization to improve the quality and enable the use of available low-quality granular materials is becoming increasingly important. Traditionally, cement-based additives have been used for such stabilization. However, alternate additives such as polymers have recently been shown to also enhance strength and stiffness characteristics. Furthermore, as an added benefit, the use of polymer-based additives results in a far lower carbon footprint than cement-based additives. In the study reported herein, an extensive laboratory investigation was carried out to evaluate the use of polymeric stabilization to improve engineering properties of pavement materials. The engineering properties of three types of soils were evaluated after being treated with a polyacrylamide (PAM). Strength and stiffness properties were determined by conducting unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests. The experimental program showed that the addition of PAM consistently enhanced the strength properties of all tested soils. The PAM-treated samples also showed improvements in the resilient moduli when compared to samples treated with traditional additives of lime and cement. Furthermore, multiple regression models were developed and the resulting three-parameter model revealed an excellent fit to actual resilient moduli.

Therefore, Melbourne tram drivers are responsible for controlling one of the heaviest vehicles on road ranging from shared tram lanes to exclusive tram lanes. In addition to different tram lane configurations, tram drivers need to follow different traffic signal phases at intersections including tram priority signals as well as need to serve passengers at various types of closely spaced tram stops. Despite all these challenges, no research has explored tram driver perceptions of the risk factors on different tram route road design configurations. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate how tram drivers’ safety perceptions alter along various tram route sections, signal settings and stop configurations. A tram driver focus group approach was adopted for this research involving thirty tram drivers (4 female and 26 male drivers). The tram drivers’ age ranged from 29 to 63 years, with an average age of 47.6 years (standard deviation of 10.1 years), and their experience of tram driving ranged from 1.17 to 31 years, with an average experience of 12.5 years (standard deviation of 10.2 years). The participating tram drivers perceived that the raised tram tracks and tramways with raised yellow curbing beside tracks are safer lane priority features on the Melbourne tram network compared to full-time, part-time and mixed traffic tram lanes. They regarded ‘hook turns’ as a safe form of tram signal priority treatment at intersections and platform tram stops as the safest tram stop design for all passengers among all other tram stop designs in Melbourne. Findings of this research could enhance the understanding of crash risk factors for different tram route features and thus can offer effective planning strategies for transit agencies to improve tram road safety. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Focus groups; Road safety; Tram; Tram driver; Tram priority","Accident prevention; Highway planning; Motor transportation; Risk perception; Roads and streets; Safety engineering; Statistics; Traffic control; Traffic signals; Transportation; Focus groups; Road safety; Tram; Tram driver; Tram priority; Railroad rolling stock",2-s2.0-85032661897

The uncertainty quantification of dynamic response is conducted by the combination of the first-order Taylor expansion and interval mathematics.

One proposal for how learners surmount the problem of ambiguity is that learners use cross-situational statistics to constrain the ambiguity: When a word and its referent co-occur across multiple situations, learners will associate the word with the correct referent. Yu and Smith (2007) propose that these co-occurrence statistics are sufficient for word-to-referent mapping. Alternative accounts hold that co-occurrence statistics alone are insufficient to support learning, and that learners are further guided by knowledge that words are referential (e.g., Waxman & Gelman, 2009). However, no behavioral word learning studies we are aware of explicitly manipulate subjects’ prior assumptions about the role of the words in the experiments in order to test the influence of these assumptions. In this study, we directly test whether, when faced with referential ambiguity, co-occurrence statistics are sufficient for word-to-referent mappings in adult word-learners. Across a series of cross-situational learning experiments, we varied the degree to which there was support for the notion that the words were referential. At the same time, the statistical information about the words’ meanings was held constant. When we overrode support for the notion that words were referential, subjects failed to learn the word-to-referent mappings, but otherwise they succeeded. Thus, cross-situational statistics were useful only when learners had the goal of discovering mappings between words and referents. We discuss the implications of these results for theories of word learning in children's language acquisition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Hypothesis testing; Language acquisition; Statistical learning; Word learning","ambiguity; Article; attention; classification; controlled study; cross situational word learning; dependent variable; follow up; human; hypothesis; information; language; learning; learning environment; logistic regression analysis; memory; priority journal; Stroop test; uncertainty",2-s2.0-85029706722

Objective To develop specific measures of MS-associated walking capacity through statistically sophisticated HPA analysis, thereby more precisely defining the real-world impact of disease. Methods Eighty-eight MS and 38 control subjects completed timed walks and patient-reported outcomes in clinic, then wore an accelerometer for 7 days. HPA was analyzed with several new statistics, including the maximum step rate (MSR) and habitual walking step rate (HWSR), along with conventional methods, including average daily steps. HPA statistics were validated using clinical walking outcomes. Results The six-minute walk (6MW) step rate correlated most strongly with MSR (r = 0.863, p &lt; 10−25) and HWSR (r = 0.815, p &lt; 10−11) rather than average daily steps (r = 0.676, p &lt; 10−11). The combination of MSR and HWSR correlated more strongly with the 6 MW step rate than either measure alone (r = 0.884, p &lt; 10−14). The MSR overestimated the 6 MW step rate (μ = 10.4, p &lt; 10−7), whereas the HWSR underestimated it (μ = −18.2, p &lt; 10−19). Conclusions Conventional HPA statistics are poor measures of capacity due to variability in activity behaviors. The MSR and HWSR are valid, specific measures of real-world capacity which capture subjects’ highest step rate and preferred step rate, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Accelerometry; Gait disorders/ataxia; Habitual physical activity; Habitual walking performance; Multiple sclerosis; Outcomes research; Six-Minute walk","adult; Article; clinical article; clinical outcome; employment status; Expanded Disability Status Scale; female; human; male; multiple sclerosis; patient-reported outcome; physical activity; priority journal; running; six minute walk test; walking",2-s2.0-85032006810

Due to the presence of non-isotropic turbulence in rod bundles, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are used. This approach is first justified by mesh convergence studies of a single rod in cross flow, simulated by two popular linear eddy viscosity turbulence models. Then the LES approach is validated by comparing the calculations of 90° cross flow to results known from the literature: the well-known experiment of Simonin et al. (1986) for a triangular rod arrangement and the very fine calculations of Iacovides et al. (2014) for inline rod arrangements.

A randomly generated sequence has both of these properties, almost surely. There seems to be a vague sense that having Poissonian pair correlations is a “finer” property than being equidistributed. In this note we prove that this really is the case, in a precise mathematical sense: a sequence whose asymptotic distribution of pair correlations is Poissonian must necessarily be equidistributed.

Invasive detection techniques cause rupture of the tumor, accelerating the spread of cancer to adjoining areas. Hence, there arises the need for a more robust, fast, accurate, and efficient noninvasive cancer detection system. In this work, an automated system is proposed for achieving error-free detection of breast cancer using mammogram. In this system, the deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network, sparse autoencoder, and stacked sparse autoencoder are used.

We therefore wished to demonstrate how procedure-based hierarchical models can be constructed and to describe their results. Methods NSQIP data from 2015 were used to construct statistical models predicting 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity, using two-level logistic regression with preoperative patient-level variables as fixed effects and procedure-specific codes as a random intercept. Model performance was validated using NSQIP data from 2014. Results NSQIP for 2015 contained records for 885,502 patients, of whom 8986 died (1.0%) and 104,836 suffered a complication (11.8%). Complete model specifications and results are presented, including odds ratios for patient-level variable effects and random procedure effects. Most comorbidities were associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but overweight and obesity were associated with lower risk. Odds ratios for individual procedures ranged from 0.117 to 10.85 for mortality and from 0.615 to 8.09 for morbidity. Validation C-statistics were 0.940 for the mortality model and 0.833 for the morbidity model; Brier Scores were 0.0086 and 0.085, respectively.

Our current healthcare system falls short on both counts. Most doctors and patients do not understand the available medical evidence. To illustrate the extent of the problem in the setting of cancer screening: In a representative sample of some 5000 women in nine European countries, 92% overestimated the reduction of breast cancer mortality by mammography by a factor of 10–200, or did not know. For a similar sample of about 5000 men with respect to PSA screening, this number was 89%. Of more than 300 US citizens who regularly attended one or more cancer screening test, more than 90% had never been informed about the biggest harms of screening—overdiagnosis and overtreatment—by their physicians. Among 160 German gynecologists, some 80% did not understand the positive predictive value of a positive mammogram, with estimates varying between 1 and 90%. In a national sample of 412 US primary care physicians, 47% mistakenly believed that if more cancers are detected by a screening test, this proves that the test saves lives, and 76% wrongly thought that if screen-detected cancers have better 5-year survival rates than cancers detected by symptoms, this would prove that the screening test saves lives. And of 20 German gynecologists, not a single one provided a woman with all information on the benefits and harms of cancer screening required in order to make an informed choice. Why is risk literacy so scarce in health care? One frequently discussed explanation assumes that people suffer from cognitive deficits that make them predictably irrational and basically hopeless at dealing with risks, so that they need to be “nudged” into healthy behavior. Yet research has demonstrated that the problem lies less in stable cognitive deficits than in how information is presented to physicians and patients. This includes biased reporting in medical journals, brochures, and the media that uses relative risks and other misleading statistics, motivated by conflicts of interest and defensive medicine that do not promote informed physicians and patients. What can be done? Every medical school should teach its students how to understand evidence in general and health statistics in particular. To cultivate informed patients, elementary and high schools should start teaching the mathematics of uncertainty—statistical thinking. Guidelines about complete and transparent reporting in journals, brochures, and the media need to be better enforced, and laws need to be changed in order to protect patients and doctors alike against the practice of defensive medicine instead of encouraging it. A critical mass of informed citizens will not resolve all healthcare problems, but it can constitute a major triggering factor for better care. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","5-year survival; Absolute risk; Cancer screening; Informed decision-making; Medical risk communication; Medical risk illiteracy; Relative risk",,2-s2.0-85030108564

Classical approaches to modeling this noise and neutron count distribution in the detection system rely on the stochastic transport equation for the probability generating function and on transfer function response to random perturbations. In recent years, a third modeling approach has been proposed, relying on Ito stochastic differential equations, which enjoys the tractability that the first aforementioned approach has, and at the same time accounts for fluctuations, by modeling noise in terms of Brownian motion. This paper develops the latter approach to incorporate the stochasticity in the detection process to the model equations. The resulting neutron count distributions are explicitly computable. As an application of our approach we present a straightforward derivation of the well-known Feynman-Y formula. We then propose an alternative to the traditional sampling scheme of this formula, based on mean absolute deviation, known from the statistics literature to be more robust than the mean square deviation estimator. The study focuses on a single energy point model and neglects the effect of the delayed neutrons. Extensions of the approach to multiple energy levels and the incorporation of delayed neutrons are discussed, as well as further applications of the approach and its advantages over existing diffusion scale approximations. © 2017","Diffusion approximations; Point reactor kinetics; Stochastic differential equations","Brownian movement; Differential equations; Neutrons; Probability distributions; Sampling; Diffusion approximations; Ito stochastic differential equations; Mean absolute deviations; Multiple energy level; Point reactor kinetics; Probability generating functions; Science and engineering; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic systems",2-s2.0-85030480989

The Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) and the Fourier-transform-based direct solution methods used in the semi-implicit fractional-step method take advantage of multiple tridiagonal matrices whose inversion is known as the major bottleneck for acceleration on a typical multi-core machine. A novel implementation of the semi-implicit fractional-step method designed for GPU acceleration of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is presented. Aspects of the programing model of Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which are critical to the bandwidth-bound nature of the present method are discussed in detail. A data layout for efficient use of CUDA libraries is proposed for acceleration of tridiagonal matrix inversion and fast Fourier transform. OpenMP is employed for concurrent collection of turbulence statistics on a CPU while the Navier–Stokes equations are computed on a GPU. Performance of the present method using CUDA is assessed by comparing the speed of solving three tridiagonal matrices using ADI with the speed of solving one heptadiagonal matrix using a conjugate gradient method. An overall speedup of 20 times is achieved using a Tesla K40 GPU in comparison with a single-core Xeon E5-2660 v3 CPU in simulations of turbulent boundary-layer flow over a flat plate conducted on over 134 million grids.

Methods Based on key publications and legislative documents, a narrative review was undertaken about alcohol-related harm reduction policies in Russia for the period between 2005 and 2017, as well as the impact of these policies on the recorded and unrecorded alcohol consumption and alcohol market. Results Various policy measures mainly targeting availability and price of recorded and unrecorded alcohol have been introduced since 2005, which generally coincided with the decreases in alcohol-related mortality observed at that time.

The bias correction adjustments have been applied on precipitation and temperature from the European Centre for Middle-range Weather Forecasting System 4 (S4). We have used three bias correction strategies: two linear (mean bias correction, BC, and linear regression, LR) and one non-linear (Model Output Statistics analogs, MOS-analog). The results have been compared with climatology and persistence. The volume-anomaly model is a previously computed Multiple Linear Regression that ingests precipitation, temperature and in-flow anomaly data to simulate monthly volume anomalies. The potential utility for end-users has been assessed using economic value curve areas. We have studied the S4 hindcast period 1981–2010 for each month of the year and up to seven months ahead considering an ensemble of 15 members. We have shown that the MOS-analog and LR bias corrections can improve the original S4. The application to volume anomalies points towards the possibility to introduce bias correction methods as a tool to improve water resource seasonal forecasts in an end-user context of climate services. Particularly, the MOS-analog approach gives generally better results than the other approaches in late autumn and early winter. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","bias correction; climate services; ECMWF System 4; reservoir; seasonal forecast; water management","Article; autumn; calculation; case study; climate; forecasting; linear regression analysis; mathematical analysis; multiple linear regression analysis; nonlinear system; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; probability; season; simulation; temperature; winter",2-s2.0-85026894863

The application performance was evaluated with the help of a passive motion capture system, which was used as a reference. The presented analysis indicates how precise the mobile registration method is in relation to the reference system. Distance and speed are the parameters that were taken into the consideration. Motion was registered by a mobile device attached to the participant’s arm. Retroreflective markers, required by the reference system were attached to the phone and mounting bands.

In line with this view, it has been shown that automatic imitation is modulated by contextual variables that constrain the positive outcomes of imitation. However, this work has largely neglected that many gestures have an inherent pro- or antisocial meaning. As a result of their meaning, antisocial gestures are considered taboo and should not be used in public. In three experiments, we show that automatic imitation of symbolic gestures is modulated by the social intent of these gestures. Experiment 1 (N = 37) revealed reduced automatic imitation of antisocial compared with prosocial gestures. Experiment 2 (N = 118) and Experiment 3 (N = 118) used a social priming procedure to show that this effect was stronger in a prosocial context than in an antisocial context. These findings were supported in a within-study meta-analysis using both frequentist and Bayesian statistics. Together, our results indicate that automatic imitation is regulated by internalized social norms that act as a stop signal when inappropriate actions are triggered. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic imitation; Context; Mimicry; Social norm; Social priming; Taboo",,2-s2.0-85030871016

Data-mining models are receiving considerable attention for identifying low birth weight risk factors. However, prediction of actual birth weight values based on the identified risk factors, which can play a significant role in the identification of mothers at the risk of delivering low birth weight infants, remains unsolved. This paper presents a study of data-mining models that predict the actual birth weight, with particular emphasis on achieving a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC). The prediction is based on birth data from the North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics of 2006. The steps followed to extract meaningful patterns from the data were data selection, handling missing values, handling imbalanced data, model building, feature selection, and model evaluation. Decision trees were used for classifying birth weight and tested on the actual imbalanced dataset and the balanced dataset using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The results highlighted that models built with balanced datasets using the SMOTE algorithm produce a relatively higher AUC compared to models built with imbalanced datasets. The J48 model built with balanced data outperformed REPTree and Random tree with an AUC of 90.3%, and thus it was selected as the best model. In conclusion, the feasibility of using J48 in birth weight prediction would offer the possibility to reduce obstetric-related complications and thus improving the overall obstetric health care. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Birth weight; Data-mining; Imbalanced dataset; Low birth weight; SMOTE","Classification (of information); Data handling; Decision trees; Forecasting; Trees (mathematics); Birth weight; Birth weight prediction; Handling missing values; Imbalanced dataset; Low birth weights; Receiver operating characteristics; SMOTE; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Data mining",2-s2.0-85020403611

They were asked to give a metaphor with explanations to describe the power dynamics in the educator-student relationship, within 200 words in English or Chinese. After some thought, the participants each gave their own metaphor individually, because the aim of this study was to collect their subjective experiences. The results were presented as follows: a) The overall description of the metaphors; b) The three groups of metaphors; c) The fives natures of metaphors; d) The most significant metaphors; and e) The four thematic meanings – (i) nurturing role; (ii) guiding role; (iii) insufficient connection; and (iv) promoting development.

The aim of this study is to examine whether differences in length of stay and frequency of inpatient episodes, according to ICD-10 bipolar disorder (BD)-subgroups, exist between men and women. Methods All episodes of a manic (F31.0-2), depressive (F31.3-5) or mixed (F31.6) subtype of BD during an inpatient stay in an Austrian hospital in the period of 2001–2014 were included in this study. Data on episodes was provided by the national statistics agency. Weekly admission rates per 100,000 people were calculated by directly age-standardized rates. Results The database comprised 60,607 admissions (35.8% men). The number of inpatient episodes was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in women in all BD subgroups. Average length of stay in manic (p < 0.001) and depressive (p < 0.001) episodes was shorter in women compared to men. No difference could be found for mixed episodes. Limitations Only aggregated patient data and no single case histories were available for this study. Conclusions The current study reveals relevant gender differences regarding inpatient treatment patterns, as women were overrepresented in all BD-subgroups. Despite equal life time prevalence, severe mood episodes lead more often to hospitalisations in women. There is a high necessity to further research the underlying causes of these findings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bipolar disorder; Gender differences; Hospitalisation; Length of stay; Patient discharge","adult; Article; Austria; bipolar disorder; depression; female; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; ICD-10; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mania; middle aged; patient care; priority journal; sex difference",2-s2.0-85029167973

The present study evaluated a theoretical model in which management approaches to procedure compliance were linked to compliance outcomes through user perceptions of positive and negative procedure attributes. New scales were developed to assess these variables; hypotheses derived from the model were tested in survey data collected from maintainers in the mining industry (N = 176). A structural equation model showed acceptable fit statistics; findings were broadly consistent with the initial hypotheses. As predicted, positive and negative dimensions of procedure attributes and compliance/non-compliance were perceived as distinct constructs, and were implicated in different pathways of the model. Also supporting the initial hypotheses, user involvement and managers’ learning-oriented responses to non-compliance were linked to favourable compliance outcomes through perceived procedure attributes. Learning-oriented responses were also directly associated with greater compliance. In addition, and contrary to prediction, punitive management responses positively predicted compliance. As discussed in the paper, these findings contribute new insights, relevant in both research and industry contexts, to understanding procedure compliance among maintainers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Compliance; Maintenance; Mining; Procedure; Safety; User perceptions; Violations","Accident prevention; Industrial research; Mining; Compliance; Maintenance personnel; Procedure; Procedure managements; Structural equation modeling; Theoretical modeling; User perceptions; Violations; Maintenance",2-s2.0-85028016402

Repeated elastic contact causes localized fatigue, whereas abrasive part is an anticipatory outcome of plastic contacts by hard metal asperities on to soft polymer surface. Further, presuming adhesive interactions in elastic-plastic contacts, asperity contact theories with necessary modifications were analyzed to assess load and separation for their subsequent use in elementary wear correlations. Both Gaussian and Weibull distributions of asperity heights were considered to include statistics of surface microgeometry. Finally, volumetric wear was written in terms of roughness parameters, material properties, and sliding distance. Validation was conducted extensively, and reliability of the formulation was achieved to a large extent. Experimental part of this work included several pin-on-disk tests using polyether ether ketone (PEEK) pins and 316L stainless steel disks. Disks with different roughness characteristics generated by polishing, turning, and milling were tested. Experimental results agreed well with predictions for the polished surface and with some deviations for other two surfaces. Further, fatigue to abrasive wear ratio was identified as an analytical tool to predict prevailing wear mechanism for polymer-metal tribo-systems. After examining the considered cases, it was both interesting and physically intuitive to observe a complete changeover in wear mechanisms following simply an alteration of roughness characteristics.

This work will use the inversion test, which is a variant of the test based on correlation Kendall rank. In the case of a moderate sample, it is more convenient to consider the amount of inversion.

This annealed disorder approach, which formally consists of solving the approximate Levermore–Pomraning equations for linear particle transport, enables a considerable speed-up with respect to transport in quenched disorder, where ensemble-averaging of the Boltzmann equation with respect to all possible realizations is needed. However, CLS intrinsically neglects the correlations induced by the spatial disorder, so that the accuracy of the solutions obtained by using this algorithm must be carefully verified with respect to reference solutions based on quenched disorder realizations. When the disorder is described by Markov mixing statistics, such comparisons have been attempted so far only for one-dimensional geometries, of the rod or slab type. In this work we extend these results to Markov media in two-dimensional (extruded) and three-dimensional geometries, by revisiting the classical set of benchmark configurations originally proposed by Adams, Larsen and Pomraning [1] and extended by Brantley [2].

In general the main goal in this task is to ensure a connection between given pairs of nodes (source-target) with possible high efficiency. When each pair (demand) brings different revenue, the problem of blocking less attractive demands appears. Usually this situation is caused by not including any fairness criterion into optimization and thus optimizing only the total (revenue) efficiency of the system. Another complication is the fact of inverse proportionality of these criteria. In this paper an optimization model has been examined which takes into account a fairness criterion and minimizes the loss of system efficiency. It may also be understood as optimizing the ratio of fairness degree to the mean of the traffic flow in the network. For implementation of the model the CPLEX package was used. As input data the example of backbone Polish network structure was chosen. To evaluate the approach, basic statistics which help in describing the equity of distribution such as standard deviation, kurtosis and Gini coefficient are used. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,"Decision making; Decision support systems; Fuzzy sets; Optimization; Fairness criteria; Gini coefficients; Network dimensioning; Network structures; Optimization modeling; Optimization problems; Standard deviation; System efficiency; Efficiency",2-s2.0-85031424538

The method commonly applied by environmental science researchers and professionals is to substitute half the limit of reporting for derivation of summary statistics. This approach has been criticised by some researchers, raising questions around the interpretation of historical scientific data. This study evaluated four complete soil datasets, at three levels of simulated censorship, to test the accuracy of a range of censored data management methods for calculation of the geometric mean. The methods assessed included removal of censored results, substitution of a fixed value (near zero, half the limit of reporting and the limit of reporting), substitution by nearest neighbour imputation, maximum likelihood estimation, regression on order substitution and Kaplan-Meier/survival analysis. This is the first time such a comprehensive range of censored data management methods have been applied to assess the accuracy of calculation of the geometric mean. The results of this study show that, for describing the geometric mean, the simple method of substitution of half the limit of reporting is comparable or more accurate than alternative censored data management methods, including nearest neighbour imputation methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Censored data; Environmental analysis; Geometric mean; Limit of reporting; Nearest neighbour imputation; Soil","Geometry; Information management; Maximum likelihood; Soils; Censored data; Environmental analysis; Geometric mean; Limit of reporting; Nearest neighbour; Maximum likelihood estimation; accuracy assessment; data management; data set; geometry; management practice; regression analysis; research work; soil management; calculation; censorship; human; information processing; maximum likelihood method; simulation; soil; survival analysis",2-s2.0-85031733948

There are few references regarding the need to integrate tourism demand in the planning of public transport of cities or the development of methods and techniques to facilitate this task. A method for evaluating potential public bus transportation demand including both residents and tourists is presented. The method uses geographic information systems and statistics, namely, the Gini coefficient, to diagnose imbalances between supply and demand and the degree of equity in transport services. The city of Palma (Spain) is selected as a case study. The results show a significant imbalance in the public transport of the city.

How to accurate evaluate and predict the energy consumption has attracted more and more attention of researchers, operating enterprise, and policy-makers. Therefore, this paper is devoted to establishing a traction energy consumption model to accurate evaluate and predict the traction energy consumption which is the main energy consumption in urban rail transit systems. On the basis of dynamics analysis of urban rail transit, four categories variables are adopted into the model, including train running state, line attribute, operation indexes and environment variable factors. Then, two multiple regression models of the traction energy consumption factor for underground line and overground line are proposed. Based on the urban rail transit statistics database of Beijing, the models are calibrated by the least square method. The results show a good-fit between the proposed model estimates and the field measurements, and the proposed model has satisfied prediction accuracy. Furthermore, to further improve the prediction accuracy, two extend models involving the season factor for underground line and overground line are proposed in this paper. The calibrated results show that the extended model is more effective to evaluate the traction energy consumption factor than the previous model, and the MAPEs of the extended model for underground line and overground is 4.7 and 5.1%. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.","Dynamics analysis; Operation characteristics; Traction energy consumption; Urban rail transit","Calibration; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Least squares approximations; Mass transportation; Rapid transit; Regression analysis; Transportation; Urban growth; Dynamics analysis; Least square methods; Multiple regression model; Operation characteristic; Prediction accuracy; Traction energy consumption; Urban rail transit; Urban rail transit systems; Light rail transit",2-s2.0-85026738317

In this paper, we firstly start with a derived expression for two forms of information entropy of an undirected graph. They are approximated von Neumann entropy and Shannon entropy, and depend on vertex degree statistics. Secondly, we show the basic solution of a generalized differential operator. This solution is a specific reproducing kernel called the H1-reproducing kernel in H1-space, and then it is proven to satisfy the condition of Mercer kernel. Thirdly, based on the two aforementioned forms of information entropy and H1-reproducing kernel, we define two reproducing graph kernels: one is approximated von Neumann entropy reproducing graph kernel (AVNERGK), the other is Shannon entropy reproducing graph kernel (SERGK). And then we prove that they satisfy the condition of Mercer kernel. Finally, to obtain better classification results, we further propose a hybrid reproducing graph kernel (HRGK) based on the two reproducing graph kernels. We use the HRGK as a means to establish the similarity between a pair of graphs.

The first task in designing a hydronic pavement heating system is determining heating capacity. A simulation method for the heat-mass coupled snow melting process is described. This numerical algorithm can predict system heat consumption, surface condition, and pavement temperature at a specific depth when inlet fluid temperature and meteorological data are provided. The model is validated experimentally and included in the discussion of design alternatives to hydronic pavement heating systems. Simulation test results show the importance of preheating time, heating capacity, weather condition, and snow melting target in snow melting performance. It is reasonable to design hydronic pavement heating systems under consideration of specific climate conditions and snow melting target. Finally, the design alternatives for 12 representative cities in China with various snow melting targets have been proposed based on the collected statistics of limit snowfall conditions from the last 30 years.

Additionally, an Implicit LES (ILES), which relies on the intrinsic numerical dissipation to act as a subgrid model, is investigated to assess the consistency and the accuracy of the method. Direct comparison with data from high resolution DNS calculations (Pirozzoli and Bernardini, 2011) provides validation of the different modeling approaches. Turbulent statistics up to the fourth-order are reported, which help emphasizing some salient features related to near-wall asymptotic behavior, mesh resolution and models prediction. Detailed analysis of the near-wall asymptotic behavior of all relevant quantities shows that the models are able to correctly reproduce the near-wall tendencies. The thermodynamic fluctuations, Trms and ρrms, show a lack of independence from SGS modeling and grid refinement in contrast to the velocity fluctuations. The pressure fluctuations, which are associated with the acoustic mode, are not significantly affected by the modeling and the mesh resolution. Furthermore, the comparison of different contributions to the viscous dissipation reveals that the solenoidal dissipation plays the most dominant role regardless of the model. Finally, it is found that the ILES is more likely to produce consistent near-wall behavior even with a numerical scheme that has a small amount of numerical dissipation to emulate the effects of unresolved scales. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Coherent Structures model (CSM); Dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM); Implicit LES (ILES); Subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling; Supersonic Turbulent Boundary Layer (STBL); Wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity (WALE)","Asymptotic analysis; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Mesh generation; Numerical methods; Turbulence; Turbulent flow; Walls (structural partitions); Coherent structure; Dynamic Smagorinsky models; Eddy viscosity; Implicit LES (ILES); Subgrid scale models; Supersonic turbulent boundary layers; Large eddy simulation",2-s2.0-85030128695

Organizational Readiness for Change (ORC) is the questionnaire used in the present study to assess the influence of organizational factors on implementation success. The respondents were employed in one of 203 Swedish municipalities within social work and psychiatric substance/abuse treatment services. They took part in a nationwide implementation project organized by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR), commissioned by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Aim The aims were: (a) to identify classes (clusters) of employees with different ORC profiles on the basis of data collected in 2011 and (b) to investigate ORC profiles which predicted the use of assessment instruments, therapy methods and collaborative activities in 2011 and 2013. Design and recruitment The evaluation study applied a naturalistic design with registration of outcome at consecutive assessments. The participants were contacted via official e-mail addresses in their respective healthcare units and were encouraged by their officials to participate on a voluntary basis. Statistics Descriptive statistics were obtained using SPSS version 23. A latent profile analysis (LPA) using Mplus 7.3 was performed with a robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) to identify subgroups (clusters) based on the 18 ORC indexes. Results A total of 2402 employees responded to the survey, of whom 1794 (74.7%) completed the ORC scores. Descriptive analysis indicated that the respondents were a homogenous group of employees, where women (72.0%) formed the majority. Cronbach's alpha for the 18 ORC indexes ranged from α = 0.67 to α = 0.78. A principal component analysis yielded a four-factor solution explaining 62% of the variance in total ORC scores. The factors were: motivational readiness (α = 0.64), institutional resources (α = 0.52), staff attributes (α = 0.76), and organizational climate (α = 0.74). An LPA analysis of the four factors with their three distinct profiles provided the best data fit: Profile 3 (n = 614), Profile 2 (n = 934), and Profile 1 (n = 246). Respondents with the most favorable ORC scores (Profile 3) used significantly more instruments and more treatment methods and had a better collaborating network in 2011 as well as in 2013 compared to members in Profile 1, the least successful profile. Conclusion In a large sample of social work and healthcare professionals, ORC scores reflecting higher institutional resources, staff attributes and organizational climate and lower motivational readiness for change were associated with a successful implementation of good practice guidelines for the care and treatment of substance users in Sweden. Low motivational readiness as a construct may indicate satisfaction with the present situation. As ORC proved to be an indicator of successful dissemination of evidence-based guidelines into routine and specialist healthcare, it can be used to tailor interventions to individual employees or services and to improve the dissemination of and compliance with guidelines for the treatment of substance users. © 2017",,"adult; Article; controlled study; employee; evaluation study; female; human; institutional resource; latent profile analysis; male; motivational readiness; organizational climate; Organizational Readiness for Change test; principal component analysis; priority journal; questionnaire; social aspect; staff attribute; statistical analysis",2-s2.0-85031804455

Taiwan has a high proportion of immigrant spouses who take care of the aging parents-in-law at home mainly based on filial piety. Difficulties in communication in many aspects of daily life occur between the elderly and immigrant spouses, and result in the elderly becoming vulnerable and thus, influencing their psychological well-being. Although past studies demonstrated that due to cultural differences, employed foreign care providers negatively influenced elder care quality (e.g., care receipts’ health or mortality rates), no studies have explored whether immigrant spouses, as family caregivers, have any influence on elderly suicides due to cross cultural communication differences. Objective To address the above gap, this study was to examine the static relationship between immigrant spouses and elderly suicides. Method National-level authority data, comprising a 10-year longitudinal nationwide sample, were used. The number of immigrant spouses was treated as a proxy of cultural differences. Twelve models of outcomes with and without city- and time-fixed effects were conducted using panel data analysis. Results Descriptive statistics of the study variables are provided. The results revealed that overall the number of immigrant spouses had a positive correlation with suicides in older adults. Further, the gender of immigrant spouses had different impacts on elderly suicides. Conclusions This is the first study to examine relation between immigrant spouses and the elderly suicides.

Methods Pixels were allocated to one of four tissues (fibrous tissue (FT), fibro-fatty tissue (FFT), necrotic core (NC), and dense calcium (DC)) through processes of border segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. Grayscale IVUS images and their corresponding virtual histology images were acquired from 11 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease using 20 MHz catheter. A total of 102 hybrid textural features including first order statistics (FOS), gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), extended gray level run-length matrix (GLRLM), Laws, local binary pattern (LBP), intensity, and discrete wavelet features (DWF) were extracted from IVUS images. To select optimal feature sets, genetic algorithm was implemented. A hybrid ensemble classifier based on histogram and texture information was then used for plaque characterization in this study. The optimal feature set was used as input of this ensemble classifier. After tissue characterization, parameters including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated to validate the proposed approach. A ten-fold cross validation approach was used to determine the statistical significance of the proposed method. Results Our experimental results showed that the proposed method had reliable performance for tissue characterization in IVUS images. The hybrid ensemble classification method outperformed other existing methods by achieving characterization accuracy of 81% for FFT and 75% for NC. In addition, this study showed that Laws features (SSV and SAV) were key indicators for coronary tissue characterization.

Uncontrolled hemorrhage (57 patients, 0.14%), devastating ICPTE (54 patients, 0.13%) and primary graft failure (49 patients, 0.12%) contributed the most and equally to the 24-hour mortality. For the ICPTE, recipients' prior history of pulmonary embolism, portal vein thrombosis, functional status (Karnofsky score) < 20, preoperative ventilator support, diabetes mellitus and Asian ethnicity emerged as significant independent hazard factors on multivariable regression analysis. These risk factors were expressed as an index to calculate the overall hazard of a devastating ICPTE; c-statistics 0.70 (p < 0.001). Conclusions Devastating ICPTE contributes significantly to the 24-hour mortality after adult cadaveric liver transplantation. Its most significant risk factors could be expressed as an index with a good predictive accuracy. Further studies of perioperative factors with potential impact on ICPTE and related mortality and morbidity are needed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Futile; Liver transplant; Mortality; Pulmonary embolism; Risk; Transesophageal echocardiography",,2-s2.0-85032435897

Temperature and mixture fraction profiles from Raman/Rayleigh/CO-LIF line measurements are used to determine one-dimensional scalar dissipation rates at six axial locations. A major focus of the current work is to assess the effects of experimental artifacts, including spatial resolution, noise, and dimensionality, on the accuracy of the derived scalar dissipation rate. Two-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) of the mixture fraction gradients are used to determine possible clipping effects due to insufficient spatial resolution. This resolution limit is compared to values determined from one-dimensional dissipation spectra and scaling laws. Spatial resolution also is investigated using laminar flame calculations in conjunction with optical-blur filters representing the experimental setup. The impact of noise is treated by error propagation methods. Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data from laminar flames are used to verify and validate the models used to predict noise propagation for the measurements of the absolute gradients, squared gradients, and scalar dissipation rates. Gradient and scalar dissipation rate detection limits and contribution from apparent dissipation (due to noise effects) are presented as functions of measurement signal-to-noise ratios. A noised lognormal function is introduced to investigate the impact of noise on derived PDFs and corresponding statistical moments of the measured scalar gradients and the scalar dissipation rate within the turbulent flame. Results from the turbulent flame measurements are presented in the form of scatter plots and conditional statistics to examine turbulence-chemistry interaction and develop a database for model assessment. Specifically, the results are compared to laminar flame calculations over a broad range of strain rates with multi-component and unity Lewis number transport assumptions. This comparison is used to assess the relevance of differential diffusion effects on scalar dissipation rates in the turbulent flame. © 2017 The Combustion Institute","Apparent dissipation; Gradient measurement; Scalar dissipation rate; Spatial averaging; Turbulent combustion model validation; Uncertainty propagation","Combustion; Ethers; Fuels; Image resolution; Intelligent systems; Mixtures; Monte Carlo methods; Probability density function; Reynolds number; Signal to noise ratio; Uncertainty analysis; Gradient measurement; Scalar dissipation rate; Spatial averaging; Turbulent combustion modeling; Uncertainty propagation; Strain rate; dimethyl ether; air; Article; combustion; controlled study; flame; limit of detection; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; signal noise ratio; uncertainty",2-s2.0-85030771454

Materials and methods The APW dataset analysed was composed by signals acquired in a clinical environment from a total of 213 subjects, including healthy volunteers and non-healthy patients. The signals were parameterised by means of 39 pulse features: morphologic, time domain statistics, cross-correlation features, wavelet features. Multiclass Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM RFE) method was used to select the most relevant features. A comparative study was performed in order to evaluate the performance of the two classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Results and discussion SVM achieved a statistically significant better performance for this problem with an average accuracy of 0.9917 ± 0.0024 and a F-Measure of 0.9925 ± 0.0019, in comparison with ANN, which reached the values of 0.9847 ± 0.0032 and 0.9852 ± 0.0031 for Accuracy and F-Measure, respectively. A significant difference was observed between the performances obtained with SVM classifier using a different number of features from the original set available. Conclusion The comparison between SVM and NN allowed reassert the higher performance of SVM. The results obtained in this study showed the potential of the proposed method to differentiate those three important signal outcomes (healthy, pathologic and noise) and to reduce bias associated with clinical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease using APW. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Arterial pulse waveform; Morphologic features; Neural network; Support vector machine recursive feature elimination; Support vector machines","Biomedical signal processing; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Neural networks; Optical systems; Pathology; Supervised learning; Time domain analysis; Vectors; Arterial pulse waveforms; Cardio-vascular disease; Clinical environments; Clinical examination; Morphologic features; Multi-class support vector machines; Supervised learning methods; Support vector machine recursive feature eliminations; Support vector machines",2-s2.0-85032723746

Lung cancer is highly related to particulate matter (PM)—especially fine particulates with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5). Recent studies have indicated a strong correlation between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and lung function diseases. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and explore the phenomenon of lung cancer and its spatial correlation to mortality and PM2.5 in Eastern Thailand from 2008 to 2012 using multidisciplinary techniques. The cancer registry was utilized as data inventory and geographical information system (GIS), Global Moran's I, Getis-Ord G statistics, Average Nearest Neighbor (ANN) tool, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA), and ordinary least square (OLS) methods to generate the PM2.5 maps to create hot spots in Eastern Thailand. The results visualize and analyze lung cancer hot spots and are adjusted for known factors such as sex and age of lung cancer patients. Choropleth maps of lung cancer incidence and mortality rates, generated for the first time, revealed that the number of male cancer patients is higher than that of females in Eastern Thailand. Global autocorrelation demonstrated considerable spatial clustering of lung cancer incidence and mortality. 91.56% of the lung cancer patients belonged to the age group of above 50 in both sexes. Significant relationships were found between the PM2.5 variable and the spatial patterns of lung cancer incidence and mortality. The Chonburi and Chanthaburi provinces were found to be the major hot spots for lung cancer incidence, which are close to industrial areas. These findings are useful in identifying the cancer registry information globally as well as locally. This study also provides a useful set of tools to identify and create hot spots in the developing countries where data and resources are major limitations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Geographic information systems (GIS); Global Moran's I; Hot spot analysis; Industrial pollution; Lung cancer","Autocorrelation; Biological organs; Developing countries; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Inverse problems; Least squares approximations; Particles (particulate matter); Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Hot spot; Industrial pollution; Inverse distance weighting; Lung Cancer; Ordinary least square methods; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial correlations; Diseases",2-s2.0-85032002417

This article pursues the emerging interest of approaching the young driver problem from a systems thinking perspective in order to design and deliver robust countermeasures. Specifically, the focus of this paper is the cars driven by young drivers. The study of vehicles’ characteristics and their interaction with driving behaviour is, more often than not, considered a minor concern when developing countermeasures in young drivers’ safety not only in developed nations, but especially in developing nations. Participants completed an online survey containing the 44-item Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale Spanish version (BYNDS-Sp), in addition to providing information regarding their vehicle, any crash involvement, and driving offences. Based on the vehicle model information, the assessment of vehicle safety was conducted for three safety programs (ANCAP, Latin NCAP, U.S. NCAP). Young drivers in Colombia reported a breadth of risky driving behaviours worth targeting in broader interventions. For example, interventions can target speeding, particularly as three quarters of the participants drove small-medium cars associated with poorer road safety outcomes. Moreover, risky driving exposure was highly prevalent amongst the young driver participants, demonstrating the need for them to be driving the safest vehicles possible. It is noteworthy that few cars were able to be assessed by the Latin NCAP (with half of the cars rated having only 0–2 star ratings), and that there was considerable discrepancy between ANCAP, U.S. NCAP, and Latin NCAP ratings. The need for system-wide strategies to increase young driver road safety—such as improved vehicle safety—is vital to improve road safety outcomes in jurisdictions such as Colombia. Such improvements may also require systemic changes such as enhanced vehicle safety rating scales and investigation of the nature of vehicles sold in developing nations, particularly as these vehicles typically contain fewer safety features than their counterparts sold in developed nations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescent; BYNDS; Human-systems integration; Risky driving; Vehicle; Vehicle safety rating","Accident prevention; Behavioral research; Motor transportation; Rating; Roads and streets; Safety engineering; Surveys; Transportation; Vehicles; Adolescent; BYNDS; Human systems integration; Risky driving; Vehicle safety; Accidents",2-s2.0-85032196607

Out of 230 lactating crossbred cows with either clinical or subclinical mastitis examined for the involvement of Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated at a rate of 47.2% (N = 92) and 42.9% (N = 15) of the sub- clinical and clinical cases, respectively. The overall prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus scored in this study was 46.5% (N = 107). Descriptive statistics and chi-square were used in order to assess the magnitude of the difference of comparable variables, as a result, among risk factors considered, Age, parity, and lactation stage were found significantly associated with the occurrence of S. aureus in mastitis milk (p < 0.05). The current study revealed that S. aureus has 0% susceptibility to penicillinG, followed by tetracycline (14.2%). However, these randomly selected isolates were found to be totally (100%) susceptible to the Kanamycin. The possible justification for, low antimicrobial susceptibility to these commonly used antimicrobials might be repeated and uncontrolled use of these drugs without veterinarian's prescription. Proper provention and regular antimicrobial sensitivity testing helps to select effective antibiotics and ultimately reduce the development of resistance towards commonly used antibiotics. To conclude, the study was able to show that, mastitis caused by S. aureus is one of the major problems of dairy cows in milk production and imposing public health hazard in study area.

Current methods for estimating %TBSA, such as Lund and Browder (L&B) tables, rely on historic body statistics. An increasingly obese population has been blamed for increasing errors in %TBSA estimates. However, this assumption has not been experimentally validated. We hypothesized that errors in %TBSA estimates using L&B were due to differences in the physical proportions of today's children compared with children in the early 1940s when the chart was developed and that these differences would appear as body mass index (BMI)-associated systematic errors in the L&B values versus actual body surface areas. Materials and methods We measured the TBSA of human pediatric cadavers using computed tomography scans. Subjects ranged from 9 mo to 15 y in age. We chose outliers of the BMI distribution (from the 31st percentile at the low through the 99th percentile at the high). We examined surface area proportions corresponding to L&B regions. Results Measured regional proportions based on computed tomography scans were in reasonable agreement with L&B, even with subjects in the tails of the BMI range. The largest deviation was 3.4%, significantly less than the error seen in real-world %TBSA estimates. Conclusions While today's population is more obese than those studied by L&B, their body region proportions scale surprisingly well. The primary error in %TBSA estimation is not due to changing physical proportions of today's children and may instead lie in the application of the L&B table. © 2017 The Authors","Burn estimation; Lund and Browder; Pediatric; Total body surface area","adolescent; Article; assessment of humans; body height; body mass; body regions; body surface; body weight; burn; cadaver; child; cohort analysis; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; human; infant; Lund and Browder table; medical history; priority journal; surface area; three dimensional imaging",2-s2.0-85030474784

Here, we developed a machine-learning model to predict p53 status in lower-grade gliomas based on radiomic features extracted from conventional magnetic resonance (MR) images. Methods Preoperative MR images were retrospectively obtained from 272 patients with primary grade II/III gliomas. The patients were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to a training (n = 180) or validation (n = 92) set. A total of 431 radiomic features were extracted from each patient. The lest absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for feature selection and radiomic signature construction. Subsequently, a machine-learning model to predict p53 status was established using the selected features and a Support Vector Machine classifier. The predictive performance of all individual features and the model was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves in both the training and validation sets. Results The p53-related radiomic signature was built using the LASSO algorithm; this procedure consisted of four first-order statistics or related wavelet features (including Maximum, Median, Minimum, and Uniformity), a shape and size-based feature (Spherical Disproportion), and ten textural features or related wavelet features (including Correlation, Run Percentage, and Sum Entropy). The prediction accuracies based on the area under the curve were 89.6% in the training set and 76.3% in the validation set, which were better than individual features. Conclusions These results demonstrate that MR image texture features are predictive of p53 mutation status in lower-grade gliomas.

Early readmission is most common after vascular surgery; these patients are often discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), making postacute care an essential partner in reducing readmissions. We characterize 30-day readmissions among vascular surgery patients discharged to SNF to provide evidence for this understudied segment of readmission after specialty surgery. Methods We utilize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Warehouse, a longitudinal 5% national random sample of Medicare beneficiaries to study 30-day readmission or death after discharge to SNF following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or lower extremity revascularization from 2005-2009. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression with Least Adaptive Shrinkage and Selection Operator were used for analysis. Results Two thousand one hundred ninety-seven patients underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm procedure or lower extremity revascularization at 686 hospitals and discharged to 1714 SNFs. Eight hundred (36%) were readmitted or had died at 30 d. In adjusted analysis, predictors of readmission or death at 30 d included SNF for-profit status (OR [odds ratio] = 1.2; P = 0.032), number of hospitalizations in the previous year (OR = 1.06; P = 0.011), number of comorbidities (OR = 1.06; P = 0.004), emergent procedure (OR = 1.69; P < 0.001), renal complication (OR = 1.38; P = 0.003), respiratory complication (OR = 1.45; P < 0.001), thromboembolic complication (OR = 1.57; P = 0.019), and wound complication (OR = 0.70; P = 0.017).

Although the measures of population-land conflicts are many, there lacks a model that appropriately considers both the social and physical contexts of population-land conflicts. In this study we introduce the concept of population stress, which identifies areas with populations growing faster than the lands available for sustainable development. Specifically, population stress areas are identified by comparing population growth and land development as measured by land developability in the contiguous United States from 2001 to 2011. Our approach is based on a combination of spatial multicriteria analysis, zonal statistics, and spatiotemporal modelling. We found that the population growth of a county is associated with the decrease of land developability, along with the spatial influences of surrounding counties. The Midwest and the traditional “Deep South” counties would have less population stress with future land development, whereas the Southeast Coast, Washington State, Northern Texas, and the Southwest would face more stress due to population growth that is faster than the loss of suitable lands for development. The factors contributing to population stress may differ from place to place. Our “population stress” concept is useful and innovative for understanding population stress due to land development and can be applied to other regions as well as global research. It can act as a basis towards developing coherent sustainable land use policies. Coordination among local governments and across different levels of governments in the twenty-first century is a must for effective land use planning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Land developability; Population growth; Population stress; Population-land conflicts; Vulnerability","land use conflict; land use planning; population growth; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; vulnerability; United States",2-s2.0-85031775857

However, few papers discussed its applications in the field of safety science research. Additionally, there exist many problems that cannot be ignored when big data is applied to safety science, most outstanding of which is lack of universal supporting theory that guides how to apply big data to safety science research like methods, principles and approaches, etc. In other terms, it is not enough for big data to be viewed as a strong enabler for safety science applications mainly due to lack of universal and basic theory from the perspective of safety science. Considering the above analyzes, the two key objectives of this paper are: (1) to propose the connotation of safety big data (SBD) and its applying rules, methods and principles, and (2) to put forward some application prospects and challenges of big data to safety science research seen from theoretical research. First, by comparing SBD and traditional safety small data (SSD) from four aspects including theoretical research, typical research method, specific analysis method and processing mode, this paper puts forward the definition and connotation of SBD.

It is unclear how the brain recovers from traumatic stress in these trauma-exposed non-PTSD people (TENP). Methods Twenty-two TENP individuals were recruited from the most affected area of Wenchuan quake, and scanned twenty-five days after the quake and at a two-year follow-up. Tract-based spatial statistics was used to examine brain microstructure changes over the two years. Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between brain microstructure changes and both stress recovery and demographic factors. To assess DTI stability, fifteen healthy subjects were scanned twice in a year and analysed similarly. Results Significantly increased fractional anisotropy (FA) was found in the left posterior limb of internal capsule, left superior and posterior corona radiata (SCR and PCR), and left external capsule. The FA increase of these regions was primarily a result of radial diffusivity reduction. Recovery in symptoms was positively correlated with FA increase of SCR. Changes were related to participant age and sex. No DTI measures were changed for the healthy subjects. Limitations Generalizability of the findings was constrained by the relatively small sample size. Conclusions The TENP individuals showed a recovery from the trauma over the follow-up, and that was accompanied with increased brain microstructure integrity in fiber tracts primarily involving corticostriatal networks. These changes may contribute to the psychological resilience to a severe life stress that led to PTSD in quake victims. In particular，this study adds to Psychoradiology, which is a promising subspecialty for clinical radiology focusing on psychiatric disorders. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme life stress; Longitudinal DTI; Psychoradiology; Stress recovery; Trauma-exposed non-PTSD","adult; Article; brain function; brain region; capsula interna; clinical article; controlled study; corpus callosum; emotional stress; external capsule; female; follow up; fractional anisotropy; human; left superior corona radiata; longitudinal study; male; neurobiology; posterior corona radiata; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; pyramidal tract; Self-rating Anxiety Scale; Self-rating Depression Scale; sex ratio; superior longitudinal fasciculus; tractography",2-s2.0-85028716032

BPD may be linked to an abnormal brain anatomy, but little is known about possible impairments of the white matter microstructure in BPD or their relationship with impulsivity or risky behaviors. The aims of the present study were to explore the relationship between BPD and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and psychological tests. Methods We evaluated 35 un-medicated BPD patients in a medication-free state and 50 healthy controls (HCs). We performed DTI tractography in BPD patients and HCs. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Profile of Mood State (POMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), and Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS) were administered to BPD patients and HCs. Results A tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) revealed that the BPD group had three clusters with a significantly lower axial diffusivity (AD) than the HC group: one located mainly in the cingulum and the other mainly in the inferior front-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Regarding the AD values, one cluster correlated negatively and significantly with POMS (Depression) and it was located in the cingulum, while another cluster correlated positively and significantly with DACS (Future Denial) and it was located in the inferior front-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). Limitations The small sample size of this study prevents us from forming any definitive conclusions, meaning that more studies are needed to confirm our findings. We are unable to generalize our findings to include other ethnic groups.

In order to prove the simple naphthalene sublimation method for measuring convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) is feasible in extreme climate conditions and obtain CHTC recommended value in island-reef areas, the study adopted the research methods to combine field measurement and data statistics. According to taking the measured data from naphthalene sublimation experiment as strong support, predictive formula of CHTC on vertical external surface of island-reef building under low wind velocities was raised to provide convenience for engineering design and validated feasible by comparing with ASHRAE recommend formula based on error analysis. Subsequently, the CHTC predictive formula and the specific wind characteristics in Xisha Islands of China were analyzed together. The results showed that CHTCs had a wide range from 6.22 W/m2·Kto 54.66 W/m2·K, and the average CHTC of all measured points was 17.30 W/m2·K. Additionally, CHTCs on windward were greater than those on leeward. Furthermore, the CHTC predictive formula under low wind velocities raised by this study was precise and reliable, and could guarantee to be applicable for island-reef building more than 55% time no matter which season it was. Consequently, CHTC on vertical external surface of island-reef building under low wind velocities was recommended as 21.51 W/m2·K in terms of average level of the whole year. This study can provide convenience for popularizing the simplified method in extreme climate conditions and lay a solid foundation for the design of low energy consumption building in island-reef areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CHTC predictive formula; Island-reef building; Low wind velocity; Naphthalene sublimation method; Recommended value","Architectural design; Buildings; Energy utilization; Heat transfer; Heat transfer coefficients; Naphthalene; Reefs; Rotational flow; Sublimation; Velocity; Convective heat transfer Coefficient; Convective heat transfer coefficients; Low winds; Low-energy-consumption buildings; Naphthalene sublimation; Predictive formulas; Recommended values; Wind characteristics; Heat convection",2-s2.0-85031088391

We previously reported our experience in instituting a standardized appendicitis ultrasound template, which decreased CT rates by 67.3%. In this analysis, we demonstrate the ongoing cost savings associated with using this template. Methods Retrospective chart review for the time period preceding template implementation (June 2012-September 2012) was combined with prospective review through December 2015 for all patients in the emergency department receiving diagnostic imaging for appendicitis. The type of imaging was recorded, and imaging rates and ultrasound test statistics were calculated. Estimated annual imaging costs based on pretemplate ultrasound and CT utilization rates were compared with post-template annual costs to calculate annual and cumulative savings. Results In the pretemplate period, ultrasound and CT rates were 80.2% and 44.3%, respectively, resulting in a combined annual cost of $300,527.70. Similar calculations were performed for each succeeding year, accounting for changes in patient volume. Using pretemplate rates, our projected 2015 imaging cost was $371,402.86; however, our ultrasound rate had increased to 98.3%, whereas the CT rate declined to 9.6%, yielding an annual estimated cost of $224,853.00 and a savings of $146,549.86. Since implementation, annual savings have steadily increased for a cumulative cost savings of $336,683.83. Conclusions Standardizing ultrasound reports for appendicitis not only reduces the use of CT scans and the associated radiation exposure but also decreases annual imaging costs despite increased numbers of imaging studies.

Because these studies were mainly conducted in children and adolescents, these WM abnormalities have been assumed, but not proven to progress into adulthood. To provide further insight in the natural history of WM maturation delay in ADHD, we here investigated the modulating effect of age on WM in children and adults. 120 stimulant-treatment naive male ADHD children (10–12 years of age) and adults (23–40 years of age) with ADHD (according to DSM-IV; all subtypes) were included, along with 23 age and gender matched controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were compared throughout the WM by means of tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and in specific regions of interest (ROIs). On both TBSS and ROI analyses, we found that stimulant-treatment naive ADHD children did not differ in FA values from control children, whereas adult ADHD subjects had reduced FA values when compared to adult controls in several regions. Significant age × group interactions for whole brain FA (p = 0.015), as well as the anterior thalamic radiation (p = 0.015) suggest that ADHD affects the brain WM age-dependently. In contrast to prior studies conducted in medicated ADHD children, we did not find WM alterations in stimulant treatment naïve children, only treatment-naïve adults. Thus, our findings suggest that the reported developmental delay in WM might appear after childhood, and that previously reported differences between ADHD children and normal developing peers could have been attributed to prior ADHD medications, and/or other factors that affect WM development, such as age and gender. © 2017","ADHD; Age; Brain development: ADHD medications; Diffusion tensor imaging","cannabis; midomafetamine; recreational drug; adult; age; Article; attention deficit disorder; brain maturation; cannabis use; child; clinical article; comorbidity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; developmental delay; diffusion tensor imaging; fractional anisotropy; group dynamics; human; intelligence quotient; male; medical history; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; white matter",2-s2.0-85030863992

However, provided a metal-complex with sufficient stability, soft ionization techniques such as electrospray offer a means to quantify and probe the characteristics of such systems using mass spectrometry. Unfortunately, the gas-phase species observed in ESI-MS systems do not always reflect the solution phase distributions due to the inherent electrochemical mechanism of the electrospray process, ion transfer from ambient to low pressures conditions, and other factors that are related to droplet evaporation. Even for simple systems (e.g. hydrated cations), it is not always clear whether the distribution observed reflects the solution phase populations or whether it is simply a result of the ionization process. This complexity is further compounded in mixed solvent systems and when multiply charged species are present. Despite these challenges, the benefits of mass spectrometry with respect to speed, sensitivity, and the ability to resolve isotopes continue to drive efforts to develop techniques for the speciation of metal complexes. Using an electrospray ionization atmospheric pressure ion mobility mass spectrometer (ESI-apIMS-MS), we demonstrate an approach to stabilize simple uranyl complexes during the ionization process and mobility separation to aid speciation and isotope profile analysis. Specifically, we outline and demonstrate the capacity of ESI-apIMS-MS methods to measure mobilities of different uranyl species, in simple mixtures, by promoting stable gas phase conformations with the addition of sulfoxides (i.e. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dibutyl sulfoxide (DBSO), and methyl phenyl sulfoxide (MPSO)). Addition of these sulfoxides, as observed in the mass spectrum and mobility domain, produce stable gas-phase conformations that enable the observation of the counter anion pair while minimizing the range of ligand exchange events as the ionized complex enters the gas-phase. Other enhancements include improved data acquisition times by applying multiplexing approaches to the IMS Bradbury-Nielsen (BN) gate to realize increased ion transmission and improve ion statistics measured at the m/z detector. Analyte identification using this approach is based on a multitude of combined measured gas-phase ion metrics, which include mass measurements, isotope profiling, and experimentally determined reduced mobilities measured at the low-field limit (<2 E/N). Though geared initially towards uranyl complexes, this approach may find application in fields where both chemical speciation and isotopic profiles provide diagnostic information for a given metal. © 2017","Chemical-speciation; Electrospray ionization; Ion mobility-mass spectrometry; Uranium speciation","Atmospheric ionization; Atmospheric pressure; Chemical speciation; Conformations; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Dimethyl sulfoxide; Electrospray ionization; Gas dynamics; Gases; Ionization; Ionization of gases; Ions; Isotopes; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Metal complexes; Organic solvents; Population distribution; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Uranium; Uranium compounds; Analyte identifications; Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Electrochemical mechanisms; Gas phase conformations; Ion mobility-mass spectrometry; Mixed-solvent systems; Spectroscopic technique; Traditional approaches; Ion mobility spectrometers",2-s2.0-85029381106

The Bohai Rim Region in China hosts dozens of large ports, two of which ranked among the top ten ports in the world. To determine the impact of ship emissions on the PM2.5 concentrations over this region, two parts of works have been conducted in this study. First, a detailed ship emission inventory with high spatiotemporal resolution was developed based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Then the WRF/Chem model was applied to modeling the impact of ship emissions by comparing two scenarios: with and without ship emissions. The results indicate that the total estimated ship emissions of SO2, NOX, PM10, PM2.5, CO, HC, and CO2 from Bohai Rim Region in 2014 are 1.9 × 105, 2.9 × 105, 2.6 × 104, 2.4 × 104, 2.5 × 104, 1.2 × 104, and 1.3 × 107 tonnes, respectively. The modeling results indicate that the annual PM2.5 concentrations increased by 5.9% on land areas of Bohai Rim Region (the continent within 115.2°E–124.3°E and 36.1°N–41.6°N) due to ship emissions. The contributions show distinctive seasonal variations of contributions, presenting highest in summer (12.5%) followed by spring (6.9%) and autumn (3.3%), and lowest in winter (0.9%). The contribution reaches up to 10.7% along the shoreline and down to 1.0% 200 km inland. After examining the statistics of the modeling results during heavy and non-heavy haze days in July, it was found that 6 out of 9 cities around the Bohai Rim Region were observed with higher contributions from ship emissions during heavy haze days compared with non-heavy haze days.

Findings from the small numbers of studies with comparable data, there was no evidence of any significant differences between tested wash products and water or tested baby wipes and water. There was some evidence to suggest that daily use of full-body emollient therapy may help to reduce the risk of atopic eczema in high risk babies with a genetic predisposition to eczema; however, the use of olive oil or sunflower oil for baby dry skin may adversely affect skin barrier function. There was no evidence about hair/scalp care or baby massage. Qualitative research indicates that parents and health professionals believe that water alone is best.

Although equally considered in the computation of the SPPB score, each of the components may present a specific and different weight in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between SPPB and its component of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood). Method Data are from a longitudinal cohort study (ie, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents [INCUR]) of 730 older persons (74.29% women) living in 13 French nursing homes. The FI was computed as the ratio between 30 actual and potential deficits the participant might have presented at the baseline visit (range between 0 [no deficit] and 1 [30 deficits]). Physical status was assessed using the SPPB score at baseline. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between the SPPB and FI and estimate which components of the SPPB were most strongly associated with the FI. Results Mean age of participants was 86.5 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.37 (SD 0.11) and SPPB of 2.5 (range between 0 and 12). The SPPB and its components were all significantly associated with the FI, but the magnitude of the associations varied. Linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, showed that the balance test [beta = −0.045 (95%CI −0.042; −0.028), p < 0.0001] and chair stand test [beta = −0.040 (95%CI −0.054; −0.027), p < 0.0001] was more strongly associated with the FI than the gait speed [beta = −0.015 (95%CI −0.021; −0.008), p < 0.0001].

Although malaria still presents health problems, significant successes have been recorded in reducing deaths resulting from the disease. As malaria transmission continues to decline, control interventions will increasingly depend on the ability to define high-risk areas known as malaria hotspots. Therefore, there is urgent need to use geospatial tools such as geographic information system to detect spatial patterns of malaria and delineate disease hot spots for better planning and management. Thus, accurate mapping and prediction of seasonality of malaria hotspots is an important step towards developing strategies for effective malaria control. In this study, we modelled seasonal malaria hotspots as a function of habitat suitability of Anopheles arabiensis (A. Arabiensis) as a first step towards predicting likely seasonal malaria hotspots that could provide guidance in targeted malaria control. We used Geographical information system (GIS) and spatial statistic methods to identify seasonal hotspots of malaria cases at the country level. In order to achieve this, we first determined the spatial distribution of seasonal malaria hotspots using the Getis Ord Gi* statistic based on confirmed positive malaria cases recorded at health facilities in Zimbabwe over four years (1996–1999). We then used MAXENT technique to model habitat suitability of A. arabiensis from presence data collected from 1990 to 2002 based on bioclimatic variables and altitude.

This work compares two types of satellite-based maps for evaluating fire damage in a large wildfire (around 8000 ha) located in Sierra de Gata (central-western Spain) on 6–11 August 2015. 1) burn severity maps based exclusively on Landsat data; specifically, on differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and on its relative versions (Relative dNBR, RdNBR, and Relativized Burn Ratio, RBR) and 2) burn severity maps based on the same indexes but combining pre-fire data from Landsat 8 OLI with post-fire data from Sentinel-2A MSI data. Combination of both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data might reduce the time elapsed since forest fire to the availability of an initial fire damage map.

In medical imaging field images are very frequently using for analyzing different type of disease symptoms. HR medical images are required for proper diagnosing but due to the hardware limitation it is very difficult. In this paper we propose a HR image generation technique based on image statistic research for single low resolution (LR) input image-using joint dictionary learning. The view of LR image is like down sampled version of HR image and its patches are considered to have a sparse representation with respect to an over complete dictionary. Sparse representation can be recovered under mild condition with compressed sensing perspective. This study explores the use of super resolution (SR), due to learning there is no need to aligned subpixels of different LR images. For validity of our research, we use this technique on OCT and Lungs images and train three dictionaries (i) using OCT images (ii) using Lungs images and (iii) using multiple different natural (MDN)-HR images. Images are produced with using MDN-HR and for both medical images and also used OCT images dictionary for OCT images and lungs images dictionary for lungs images.

Accidents at European LXs account for about one-third of the entire railway accidents and result in more than 300 deaths every year in Europe. Due to the non-deterministic causes, the complex operation background and the lack of thorough statistical analysis based on accident/incident data, the risk assessment of LXs remains a challenging task. In the present paper, some LX accident prediction models are developed. Such models allow for highlighting the influence of the main impacting parameters, i.e., the average daily road traffic, the average daily railway traffic, the annual road accidents, the vertical road profile, the horizontal road alignment, the road width, the crossing length, the railway speed limit and the geographic region. The Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) and Nonlinear Least-Squares (NLS) methods are employed to estimate the respective coefficients of variables in the prediction models, based on the LX accident/incident data. The validation and comparison process is performed through statistical means to examine how well the estimation of the models fits the reality. The outcomes of validation and comparison attest that the improved accident prediction model has statistic-based approbatory quality.

This rapidly changing scenario together with availability of high precision and large-scale experimental data has enabled development of high fidelity simulation tools capable of simulating multi-physics multi-scale phenomena. At the same time, there has been an increased emphasis on developing strategies for verification and validation of such high fidelity simulation tools. The problem is more pronounced in cases where it is not possible to collect experimental data or field measurements on a large-scale or full scale system performance. This is particularly true in case of systems such as nuclear power plants subjected to external hazards such as earthquakes or flooding. In such cases, engineers rely solely on simulation tools but struggle to establish the credibility of the system level simulations. In practice, validation approaches rely heavily on expert elicitation. There is an increasing need of a quantitative approach for validation of high fidelity simulations that is comprehensive, consistent, and effective. A validation approach should be able to consider uncertainties due to incomplete knowledge and randomness in the system's performance as well as in the characterization of external hazard. A new approach to validation is presented in this paper that uses a probabilistic index as a degree of validation and propagates it through the system using the performance-based probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) framework. Unlike traditional PRA approaches, it utilizes the power of Bayesian statistic to account for non-Boolean relationships and correlations among events at various levels of a network representation of the system. Bayesian updating facilitates evaluation of updated validation information as additional data from experimental observations or improved simulations is incorporated. PRA based framework assists in identifying risk-consistent events and critical path for appropriate allocation of resources to improve the validation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Bayesian networks; Hazards; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; High-fidelity simulations; Incomplete knowledge; Network representation; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Quantitative approach; System level simulation; System's performance; Verification-and-validation; Risk assessment",2-s2.0-85030567554

The WDPM approach is especially useful for real applications that have heterogeneous error distributions or come from a mixture of distributions. In the mean function, the unknown functions are estimated using natural cubic smoothing splines. For the error terms, several different WDPMs are proposed using different weights that depend on the distances between the covariates. Their marginal likelihoods are derived, and the computation of marginal likelihood for WDPM is provided. Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are also provided. The Bayesian approaches based on different WDPMs are compared with the parametric error model and the Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) error model in terms of the Bayes factor using a simulation study, suggesting better performance of the Bayesian approach based on WDPM.

Globally useful markers could, however, have ranges of values that are “diagnostically non-informative”. This paper demonstrates that the presence of marker values from diagnostically non-informative ranges could lead to a loss in statistical efficiency during nonparametric evaluation and shows that grouping non-informative values provides a natural resolution to this problem. These points are theoretically proven and an extensive simulation study is conducted to illustrate the possible benefits of using grouped marker values in a number of practically reasonable scenarios. The results contradict the common conjecture regarding the detrimental effect of grouped marker values during performance assessments. Specifically, contrary to the common assumption that grouped marker values lead to bias, grouping non-informative values does not introduce bias and could substantially reduce sampling variability. The proven concept that grouped marker values could be statistically beneficial without detrimental consequences implies that in practice, tied values do not always require resolution whereas the use of continuous diagnostic results without addressing diagnostically non-informative ranges could be statistically detrimental. Based on these findings, more efficient methods for evaluating diagnostic markers could be developed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarker evaluation; Diagnostically non-informative values; Grouped marker values; Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis; Statistical efficiency","Decision making; Efficiency; Diagnostic markers; Diagnostically non-informative values; Extensive simulations; Grouped marker values; Natural resolution; Performance assessment; Receiver operating characteristic analysis; Statistical efficiency; Diagnosis",2-s2.0-85028508539

One well-known nonparametric estimator, the linear empirical Bayes estimator, can be interpreted as an estimator based on empirical likelihood under some framework and it is shown that the proposed procedure can improve the linear empirical Bayes estimator. Numerical studies are presented to compare the proposed estimator with some existing estimators.

There are some classes of biased estimators for solving the problem in statistical literature. In these biased classes, estimation of the shrinkage parameter plays an important role in data analyzing. Using eigenvalue analysis, efforts have been made to develop skills and methods for computing risk function of the estimators in regression models. A modified estimator based on the QR decomposition to combat the multicollinearity problem of design matrix is proposed in partially linear regression model which makes the data to be less distorted than the other methods. The necessary and sufficient condition for the superiority of the partially generalized QR-based estimator over partially generalized least-squares estimator for selecting the shrinkage parameter is obtained.

Its elements can be characterized via the support function, which agrees with the usual Minkowski addition, and naturally embeds Kc(Rp) into a cone of a separable Hilbert space. The support function embedding holds interesting properties, but it lacks of an intuitive interpretation for imprecise data. As a consequence, it is not easy to identify the elements of the image space that correspond to sets in Kc(Rp). Moreover, although the Minkowski addition is very natural when p=1, if p&gt;1 the shapes which are obtained when two sets are aggregated are apparently unrelated to the original sets, because it tends to convexify. An alternative and more intuitive functional representation will be introduced in order to circumvent these difficulties. The imprecise data will be modeled by using star-shaped sets on Rp.

These limitations are illustrated using simulated data generated by general VECH models of different dimensions in which volatilities and correlations are interrelated. We show that the restrictions imposed by the BEKK model are very unrealistic, generating potentially misleading forecasts of conditional correlations. On the other hand, models based on the DCC specification provide appropriate forecasts. Alternative estimators of the parameters are important in order to simplify the computations, and do not have implications for the estimates of conditional correlations.

Unfortunately, c-optimal designs have several practical problems, commonly including an inability to also estimate the underlying dose–response parameters in the same trial. It is demonstrated how optimal designs for combination indices can be generated as well as how these designs can be adapted to guarantee that at least a satisfactory degree of precision can be maintained for all parameter estimates. This is achieved by introducing secondary constraints on efficiency regarding the D-criterion, and optimizing within these constraints only.

The results are used to schedule pipeline inspections and maintenance actions. Corrosion growth is often determined from noisy in-line inspection results where the sizing errors can have a significant impact on the measured size and growth of the corrosion features. If the inspection results are on average unbiased, the top percentiles of measured features have a statistical trend of being oversized as shown in the paper. This trend has been confirmed in pipeline practice. The statistical bias effect leads to suboptimal inspection and maintenance requirements if it is not removed in the corrosion growth analysis. Three deterministic and probabilistic models, which account for the sizing bias inherent in in-line inspection data, are introduced for the corrosion growth analysis. The models are tailored toward pipelines subject to internal corrosion with high feature densities.

Multivariate outliers can severely distort the estimation of population parameters. Detecting multivariate outliers is mainly disregarded or done by using the basic Mahalanobis distance. However, that indicator uses the multivariate sample mean and covariance matrix that are particularly sensitive to outliers. Hence, this method is problematic. We highlight the disadvantages of the basic Mahalanobis distance and argue instead in favor of a robust Mahalanobis distance. In particular, we present a variant based on the Minimum Covariance Determinant, a more robust procedure that is easy to implement. Using Monte Carlo simulations of bivariate sample distributions varying in size (ns = 20, 100, 500) and population correlation coefficient (ρ =.10,.30,.50), we demonstrate the detrimental impact of outliers on parameter estimation and show the superiority of the MCD over the Mahalanobis distance. We also make recommendations for deciding whether to include vs. exclude outliers.

This study has been designed in order to identify individual and workplace factors that increase the risk of an accident, and to provide evidence for the achievement of precautionary actions in workplace environment. Registered fatal occupational injuries between the years 2004 and 2014 were investigated. The case reports of shipyard occupational accidents of Ministry of Labour and Social Security of Turkey have been analyzed. Then, a workplace survey was conducted among workers and foremen at Turkish shipyards located in Istanbul region. Classification of fatal occupational accidents revealed five major reasons for the shipyard workers; falling from higher elevation to a lower level, exposed to electric shock, fire and/or explosion, being struck by or struck against objects and caught in between, and drowning. The ratio of the places of fatal occupational accidents at Turkish shipyards can be classified as occurring inside the ship (43.7%) and the shipyard (56.3%). The questionnaire contains four groups: personal data, workplace environment, personal factors and commuting factors. The total number of questions is 56. The results reveal that substandard low education level of shipyard workers, housekeeping at workshops, lunch effect, bad weather conditions, improper use of PPE, being tired and sleepy, overcapacity ship production, hectic work, overtime, being a subcontractor worker and strenuous work are main risk factors for workplace accidents. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fatality; Occupational accidents; Prevention; Safety; Shipyard","Accident prevention; Electric accidents; Ships; Shipyards; Surveys; Fatality; Occupational accident; Occupational injury; Prevention; Ship production; Social Security; Workplace accidents; Workplace environments; Occupational risks; adult; Article; drowning; educational status; electric accident; explosion; falling; housekeeping; human; male; mortality rate; occupational accident; occupational exposure; personal experience; priority journal; protective equipment; questionnaire; risk factor; shipyard worker; stress; Turkey (republic); weather; work capacity; work experience; workplace",2-s2.0-85029594178

The 3SLS estimator is obtained sequentially, once the underlying model is modified, by adding or deleting rows of data. A new theoretical pseudo SEM is developed which has a non positive definite dispersion matrix and is proved to yield the 3SLS estimator that would be derived if the modified SEM was estimated afresh. In addition, the computation of the iterative 3SLS estimator of the updated observations SEM is considered. The new recursive method utilizes efficiently previous computations, exploits sparsity in the pseudo SEM and uses as main computational tool orthogonal and hyperbolic matrix factorizations. This allows the estimation of large-scale SEMs which previously could have been considered computationally infeasible to tackle. Numerical trials have confirmed the effectiveness of the new estimation procedures.

Self-administered questionnaires that included a demographic and the factors focused in this research were used to collect data from 111 schools in Kelantan, which is one of the states in Malaysia. The number of returned valid questionnaires was 408. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with Amos 19 was used to analyze the data. The measurement model shows that the four factors of situational dimensions lead to the safety culture among teachers in school. The results of the analysis indicated that safety policy, safety training and the safety committee would do well to increase the safety culture in education sector. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Education sector; Measurement model; Safety culture; Situational dimension","Education; Factor analysis; Human engineering; Surveys; Teaching; Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA); Contributing factor; Education sectors; Focus of researches; Measurement model; Safety culture; Self-administered questionnaire; Situational dimension; Safety factor",2-s2.0-85022196560

Such a framework is useful for deriving all existing results with ease. In addition, it also provides insights into two forecast combination puzzles. Specifically, it investigates why a simple average of forecasts often outperforms forecasts from single models in terms of MSFEs, and why a more complicated weighting scheme does not always perform better than a simple average. In addition, this paper presents two new findings that are particularly relevant in practice. First, the MSFE of a forecast combination decreases as the number of models increases. Second, the conventional approach to the selection of optimal models, based on a simple comparison of MSFEs without further statistical testing, leads to a biased selection. © 2017 International Institute of Forecasters","Averaging; Forecast combination; Mean squared error; Optimal weights",,2-s2.0-85030119857

A two-stage estimation approach is proposed. First, the marginal distributions are modeled. Second, the dependence structure modeled by a vine copula is estimated via likelihood maximization. Due to the right-censoring single and double integrals show up in the copula likelihood expression such that numerical integration is needed for its evaluation. For the dependence modeling a sequential estimation approach that facilitates the computational challenges of the likelihood optimization is provided.

In this paper we tackle the theoretical analysis of the recently proposed nonlinear population Monte Carlo (NPMC). This is an iterative importance sampling scheme whose key features, compared to conventional importance samplers, are (i) the approximate computation of the importance weights (IWs) assigned to the Monte Carlo samples and (ii) the nonlinear transformation of these IWs in order to prevent the degeneracy problem that flaws the performance of conventional importance samplers. The contribution of the present paper is a rigorous proof of convergence of the nonlinear IS (NIS) scheme as the number of Monte Carlo samples, M, increases. Our analysis reveals that the NIS approximation errors converge to 0 almost surely and with the optimal Monte Carlo rate of M−1/2. Moreover, we prove that this is achieved even when the mean estimation error of the IWs remains constant, a property that has been termed exact approximation in the Markov chain Monte Carlo literature.

The use of alternative fuels in the EU-28 is regulated by Directives, and in many countries, liquid biofuels are blended with mineral fuels. In Lithuania, the share of liquid biofuels reached 5.75% of the total volume of transport fuel in 2010, and this share should increase to 10% until 2020. In the Baltic States, as well as in other East European countries (Finland and others), biodiesel is produced mainly from the rapeseed oil and bioethanol – from the starch containing cereals (wheat, triticale, etc.), sugar beet or potatoes. Lithuania promotes production of liquid biofuel via economic and legal measures. Revised legislation provides favourable conditions for the development of biofuel production. Established biofuel production framework exceeds the capacities, which are required by Lithuania's obligations, related to liquid biofuel consumption in transport sector.

In this work, a new method for mean life evaluation of power system equipment, based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution, is presented for complete and right-censored failure data. Classical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is employed for determination of distribution parameters. However, an estimator based on asymptotic expansions is proposed, overpassing the disadvantages of MLE-based methods that employ numerical or graphical techniques. High accuracy of the proposed method with respect to other estimators is also shown by analyzing two right-censored lifetime data sets with different sample sizes for three types of power equipment.

A log transformation is applied for the three pollutants to achieve normality. The sum-metric function is utilized for modelling the spatiotemporal variogram as it gave the smallest Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to other forms namely separable, metric, and product sum models. Therefore, employing the gstat package in R together with the trans-Gaussian spatiotemporal kriging, the maps are generated for the interpolated surfaces for the monthly averages of 2015 and the corresponding standard error values. These maps will help the decision maker to understand and visualize the spatial and temporal variability of the measured pollutants and hence undertake the necessary policies and decisions.

Many publications addressing the issue thus far, propose changes of consumer behaviour as the solution to fighting food waste. This article explores the possible contribution of technology, in particular, improvements in storage conditions in household refrigerators towards combating food waste. An optimized refrigerator design better serving its purpose of food preservation can theoretically reduce food waste due to quality loss and spoilage. In the current market, the functionality of refrigeration appliances is only indirectly determined by the quality of food preservation. Actual demand is driven by habits, available physical space, perception of size needed, price and –identified as a main driver in several market surveys– the EU's energy label rating. As a result, 85% of consumers choose an appliance that, apart from the freezer compartment, only has one compartment for perishable fresh food (typically at 4 °C). This article argues that the 4 °C is a compromise: The real optimal preservation temperature, depending on the type and condition of the fresh food products, lies between −1 °C and +17 °C. At those optimal temperatures the ‘shelf life’ can be increased by a factor of two to three and thus the chance of food spoilage can be significantly reduced. Subsequently, the article tries to quantify the EU-wide potential impact of optimised household refrigeration, as much as current data availability allows. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Food preservation; Food storage; Food waste; Refrigeration; Resource efficiency; Sustainability","Commerce; Digital storage; Food microbiology; Food preservation; Food products; Food storage; Labels; Refrigeration; Refrigerators; Sustainable development; Food spoilage; Food waste; Household refrigerators; Market surveys; Optimal temperature; Potential impacts; Resource efficiencies; Storage condition; Spoilage; European Union; food waste; household survey; optimization; storage; sustainability; waste technology; Article; feeding behavior; food intake; food preservation; food quality; food spoilage; food storage; food waste; household; human; market; refrigeration; shelf life; temperature; Europe",2-s2.0-85030467935

In addition to making the strategies, it is important to follow, how they work in practice. The aim of the study is to examine, how climate change mitigation policies and other events affected the consumption-based household carbon footprints in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA) from 2006 until 2012. The cities of the HMA launched an ambitious climate change mitigation strategy in 2007. Furthermore, the study analyses the changes in the carbon footprints of six different types of urban zone within the HMA: the central pedestrian zone, the fringe of the central pedestrian zone, intensive public transport zone, public transport zone, car zone and the pedestrian zones of subcentres. The results of the study reveal that the average carbon footprint decreased 7% from 2006 to 2012, despite 1% increase in expenditure, which is encouraging. Emissions caused by housing energy consumption and motor fuel consumption decreased the most. Among the urban zones, public transport zone and car zone, which are the two outermost zones of the HMA, had the strongest emission reductions. Cleaner electricity and the improved energy efficiency of buildings had a strong effect. The regression analysis of the study suggests that the central pedestrian zone and the car zone, the two most affluent zones of the HMA, have higher carbon footprints than all the other zones have between them. However, this is only true when income is controlled, not when expenditure is controlled. The economic crisis in 2008, and changes in consumption behaviour because of it, seem to explain the result. The reduction of the average carbon footprint in the HMA was not only due to steered mitigation actions. Increased housing costs seem to have contributed to the decline of consumption-based emissions. The results of the study suggest that to achieve the ambitious international, national and local climate change mitigation targets, stronger measures are needed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Cities; Climate change; Economic crisis; Travel behaviour; Urban zone","Automotive fuels; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Housing; Regression analysis; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Cities; Climate change mitigation; Combining strength; Economic crisis; Emission reduction; Mitigation policies; Travel behaviour; Urban zones; Climate change",2-s2.0-85031906022

Protein expression in colorectal carcinoma tissues and their paired normal tissues was examined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) to identify differentially expressed protein spots. Ten pairs of colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues were randomly collected from surgical pathology department, Cho Ray Hospital during the period of March 2014 to December 2014. The protein samples were extracted via sonication by using urea buffer in liquid nitrogen. 2D-PAGE analysis was performed at pH range 4–7 and differentially expressed protein spots were determined by using DECOCON Delta 2D software (version 4.6). We have found significant change in the protein expression between carcinoma and normal tissues. In brief, 68 protein spots on 2D gel images substantially increased or decreased in tumors and normal specimens. Of these, a total of 37 up-regulated spots in carcinoma tissues were detected and a total of 31 down-regulated spots in the normal tissues. Although there have been plenty of methods or techniques to analyze protein from a mixture recently, 2D-PAGE is still powerful in its ability to separate different proteins simultaneously on a single gel. However, via establishing and performing 2D-PAGE in this study, we recognized that this technique is quite powerful but costly and particularly has low reproducibility which produces lots of difficulty in analyzing and extracting valuable data. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Colorectal cancer; Proteome; Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","Biomedical engineering; Diagnosis; Diseases; Electrophoresis; Histology; Medicine; Proteins; Surgery; Urea; Carcinoma tissues; Colorectal cancer; Colorectal carcinoma; Protein expressions; Reproducibilities; Surgical pathology; Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE); Tissue",2-s2.0-85030859535

The majority of these algorithms suffer from the setting of regularization parameter or its estimation. To overcome this weakness, the extension of multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has been studied for sparse optimization. The major advantages of MOEA/D lie in two aspects: (1) free setting of regularization parameter and (2) detection of true sparsity. Due to the generational mode of MOEA/D, its efficiency for searching the knee region of the Pareto front is not very satisfactory. In this paper, we proposed a new steady-state MOEA/D with the preference to search the region of Pareto front near the true sparse solution. Within each iteration of our proposed algorithm, a local search step is performed to examine a number of solutions with similar sparsity levels in a neighborhood. Our experimental results have shown that the new MOEA/D clearly performs better than its previous version on reconstructing artificial sparse signals. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Evolutionary algorithm; MOEA/D; Multiobjective optimization; Sparse optimization","Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms; Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Parameterization; Its efficiencies; MOEA/D; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Regularization parameters; Single objective optimization; Sparse optimizations; Sparse signals; Sparse solutions; Optimization",2-s2.0-85029585936

Several studies have focused on energy consumption, air pollution, CO2 emissions and regional blue water footprint (WF) following release of the Jing-Jin-Ji Integration Strategy by the China government in 2013. However, a comprehensive assessment distinguishing blue, green and grey WF amongst different industrial sectors, ascertaining how WF transfers internally and beyond the region and final demand consumption is not available. We consider this to be crucial in understanding and addressing the deteriorating water situation in the Jing-Jin-Ji. In this study, we quantified the WF and virtual water flow on a sectoral basis for the year 2010 through coupling the multi-regional input-output model (MRIO) with WF assessment. The results showed that Beijing and Tianjin are net importers of green, blue and grey water from Hebei and other China provinces to support their needs. Conversely, Hebei exports all WF colors to Beijing, Tianjin and other provinces in China, and more than 60% of WF is transferred as virtual water. For the overall Jing-Jin-Ji region a small amount of blue water (2086 million m3) is exported, but huge amounts of green water (15,573 million m3) and grey water (30,620 million m3) are outsourced. A “Virtual Water Strategy” is one measure which could alleviate water stress at the regional scale, with consideration of financial compensation from water receiving regions made to water supplying regions in the context of achieving water management targets. We also found that physical water transfer to Jing-Jin-Ji could not balance virtual blue water exports, not to mention compensating for internal water consumption. Our research suggests that a continuation of an export-based economic development model will worsen Hebei's water stress. Reducing the dependency of Hebei's sectoral economy on export of water intensive and low value added agricultural products may be one strategy to reduce the pressure on regional water resources. In addition, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Integration Strategy drives industrial transfer from Beijing to Hebei resulting in the transfer of enterprises with low water utilization efficiency and producing heavy pollution. As a result, the government should consider incentivizing corporations to adopt technologies that reduce water consumption and pollution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Industrial sectors; MRIO model; Urban agglomeration; Virtual water; Water footprint","Agglomeration; Agricultural products; Agriculture; Economics; Energy utilization; Industrial economics; Pollution; Water management; Water resources; Comprehensive assessment; Financial compensation; Industrial production; Industrial sector; Regional water resources; Urban agglomerations; Virtual water; Water footprint; Water pollution",2-s2.0-85024093195

However, VMD may not be efficient for analyzing missing data since it is based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This paper proposes a new VMD procedure that can effectively handle problems caused by missing values. The proposed method is based on an estimation of spectral density that reflects frequency information of a signal properly with removing the effects of missing samples; hence, it is able to produce stable decomposition results.

The Distortion Minimizing Geodesic Submanifold (DMGS) approach allows to select the most accurate submanifolds in term of distortion under a dimensionality constraint for shape spaces. We show that the computation of DMGS is widely compatible with the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework and the varifold distortion for application to computational anatomy. It allows the estimation of finite dimensional geodesic submanifolds in the difficult situation where we do not assume any one to one correspondance between shapes (parametrisation invariance). Unlike regular Tangent PCA, the computation of DMGS does not need to deal with the classical balance between the deformation cost from the template to target and the resulting distortion. On the contrary, the greedy minimization of the distortion under dimensionality constraints, hiding the deformation metric in the exponential map, suggests a new way to select between alternative metrics and shape spaces under the unifying point of view of the dimension/distortion curves in the spirit of the rate/distortion curves in information theory.

Due to climate change, heatwaves are likely to become more intense, more frequent and last longer in the future. A number of factors may influence risks associated with heat exposure, such as population age, housing type, and location within the Urban Heat Island, and such factors may not be evenly distributed spatially across a region. We simulated and analysed two major heatwaves in the UK, in August 2003 and July 2006, to assess spatial vulnerability to heat exposure across the West Midlands, an area containing ~ 5 million people, and how ambient temperature varies in relation to factors that influence heat-related health effects, through weighting of ambient temperatures according to distributions of these factors across an urban area. Additionally we present quantification of how particular centres such as hospitals are exposed to the UHI, by comparing temperatures at these locations with average temperatures across the region, and presenting these results for both day and night times. We find that UHI intensity was substantial during both heatwaves, reaching a maximum of + 9.6 °C in Birmingham in July 2006. Previous work has shown some housing types, such as flats and terraced houses, are associated with increased risk of overheating, and our results show that these housing types are generally located within the warmest parts of the city. Older age groups are more susceptible to the effects of heat. Our analysis of distribution of population based on age group showed there is only small spatial variation in ambient temperature that different age groups are exposed to. Analysis of relative deprivation across the region indicates more deprived populations are located in the warmest parts of the city. © 2017","Health effects; Heat waves; Spatial vulnerability; Urban Heat Island","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Health; Health risks; Housing; Risk assessment; Temperature; Environmental risks; Health effects; Health protection; Heat waves; Number of factors; Spatial variations; Spatial vulnerability; Urban heat island; Heating",2-s2.0-85027502140

Methods We used 2005–2015 Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters data to measure trends in opioid average days' supply among commercially insured individuals and 2005–2014 MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid data to measure trends in opioid average days' supply among Medicaid beneficiaries. Results For Medicaid, we found an increase in days' supply for all drugs except morphine. The largest percentage increase was for oxycodone, which increased 4.5 days (37%). Opioid days' supply for individuals with commercial insurance exhibited similar but steeper trends. The largest increase was also for oxycodone, which increased 6 days (56%).

Identification of this model is based on likelihood maximization which makes it sensitive to the dimension of the distribution, namely the number of considered modes in our context. To this respect, a mode selection preprocessing step is proposed. It allows the selection of the relevant random modes for a given transfer function. The second point, addressed in this study, concerns the choice of the D-Vine model. Indeed, D-Vine model is not uniquely defined. Two strategies are proposed and compared. The first one is based on the context of the study whereas the second one is purely based on statistical considerations.

The research examines the influence of installer businesses on rates of uptake and standards of installation, and the interplay between business practices and the policy environment. The research developed new detailed datasets through a nationwide survey, to which 388 installers responded, and follow-up interviews with 22 installers. Focusing on solar photovoltaics and air source heat pumps installed in households, the results show the fundamental dependence of installer businesses on government financial incentives and on the quality assurance scheme in operation. Market confidence was compromised by the sharp reduction in the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) for residential solar PV in 2012 and long delays to the equivalent Renewable Heat Incentive for residential installations. Nevertheless, more modest FIT levels have reduced the risk of sub-optimal installations and inappropriate specification of microgeneration systems. The findings underline the need for consistent policy to allow installer businesses and their supply chains to develop and mature, and thus facilitate commercial deployment of microgeneration of high quality, raise its competiveness with incumbent forms of energy supply and contribute to decarbonisation goals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air source heat pumps; Energy policy; Feed-In Tariff; Microgeneration; Solar PV; Subsidies","Energy policy; Heat pump systems; Heating; Housing; Quality assurance; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Supply chains; Commercial deployment; Exploratory analysis; Feed-in tariff; Microgeneration; Microgeneration systems; Residential solar pv; Solar PVs; Subsidies; Air source heat pumps; energy policy; installation; photovoltaic system; power generation; pump; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; solar power; subsidy system; tariff structure; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85030668180

Using the LCA approach, this paper performs an in-depth analysis on the environmental benefits and costs of this industry for the period of 2011–2016. Differing from existing literature, this paper broadens system boundaries to cover 11 stages of the solar PV industry life cycle, taking module sources and market directions of PV system into consideration, and quantifies the costs of environmental emissions of the industry by shadow pricing. The key finding of this study is that during 2011–2016 the total environment benefit was smaller than the total cost of China's solar PV industry.

An understanding of such variations is critical for urban infrastructure design and operation. Urban climatology and sparse spatial data lead to uncertainties in the estimates of spatial precipitation. In this study, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to obtain the spatial distribution of return levels of precipitation extremes in urban areas and quantify the associated uncertainty. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is used for modeling precipitation extremes. A spatial component is introduced in the parameters of the GEV through a latent spatial process by considering geographic and climatologic covariates. A Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used for sampling the parameters of the GEV distribution and latent-process model. Applicability of the methodology is demonstrated with data from 19 telemetric rain-gauge stations in Bangalore city, India. For this case study, it is inferred that the elevation and mean monsoon precipitation are the predominant covariates for annual maximum precipitation. Variation of seasonal extremes are also examined in the study. For the monsoon maximum precipitation, it is observed that the geographic covariates dominate, whereas for the summer maximum precipitation, elevation and mean summer precipitation are the predominant covariates.

One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index (η2, ω2 and ε2) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of η2 in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies. Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue. We urge researchers to consider alternative approaches to determining the sample size of their studies, and discuss several options. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Effect size; Epsilon-squared; Eta-squared; Follow-up bias; Omega-squared; Power analysis","effect size; follow up; human; pilot study; power analysis; publishing; sample size; scientist; simulation",2-s2.0-85031300248

This paper examines the socioeconomic aspects of such biomass-derived resin production, which are composed of environmental impacts quantified by life cycle analysis (LCA) and the structure of generated value flows specified by structural path analysis (SPA) based on a Japanese input–output table. Missing inventory data were estimated by process simulation using Aspen Plus™ and Aspen HYSYS™ with design information extracted from the literature, patents, and design heuristics. LCA based on actual and demonstration plants with process simulation shows the environmental advantage of biomass-derived resins on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. PE production has the largest effect on GHG emissions reduction, followed by bioethanol from a gasoline mixture, and PP. The uncertainties in agricultural processes also influence the potential application of international and domestic bioethanol production and synthesis gas obtained from the gasification of waste woods. According to SPA results for gasoline, PE, PP, and plastic products, the cyclicality of resins and plastic products, which was quantitatively analyzed as the total cyclic cash flows from target products to final demands, is much larger than that of gasoline.

This paper presents a limited comparative study about the application of the two previously cited quantifier guided choice degrees. By using statistical tools, it is concluded that both choice degrees can offer significantly different rankings of alternatives.

Validation assessment for multiple responses involves comparison with multiple experimental measurements, which makes it much more complicated than that for single response. With considering both the uncertainty and correlation of multiple responses, this paper presents a new method for validation assessment of models with multivariate output. The new method is based on principal component analysis and the concept of area metric. The method is innovative in that it can eliminate the redundant part of multiple responses while reserving their main variability information in the assessment process. This avoids directly comparing the joint distributions of computational and experimental responses. It not only can be used for validating multiple responses at a single validation site, but also is capable of dealing with the case where observations of multiple responses are collected at multiple validation sites.

Increasing penetration of renewable generation and integration of new consumer technologies (e.g. electric vehicles) challenge the traditional way of balancing electricity in the grid, whereby supply matches demand. Demand-side management (DSM) has been shown to offer a promising solution to the above problem. However, models proposed in literature typically consider an isolated system whereby a single aggregator coordinates homogeneous consumers. As a result potential externalities of DSM are overlooked. This work explores the value of DSM in the context of an interacting electricity system, where utilities compete for cheap electricity in the wholesale market. A stylized model of the UK electricity system is proposed, whereby a traditional supplier competes with a ‘green’ supplier in the wholesale market. The modelling was able to show that with enough dispatchable capacity the traditional supplier was able to benefit from instructing his consumers to increase demand peaks, which had an adverse effect on the system. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Competing utilities; Demand side management; UK electricity system","Commerce; Electric utilities; Adverse effect; Competing utilities; Demand peaks; Electricity system; Isolated systems; Renewable generation; Wholesale markets; Demand side management",2-s2.0-85025117769

In general, such an analysis is intractable because of the size of the search space and the fact that the transitions between the states within this space can be very intricate. That is why AI algorithms are, for the most part, evaluated empirically and experimentally, i.e., by simulations. However, whenever such an analysis is undertaken, it usually involves an analysis of the underlying stochastic process. In this connection, the most common tools used involve Random Walks (RWs), which is a field that has been extensively studied for more than a century [6]. These walks have traditionally been on a line, and the generalizations for two and three dimensions, have been by extending the random steps to the corresponding neighboring positions in one or many of the dimensions. The analysis of RWs on a tree have received little attention, even though it is an important topic since a tree is a counter-part space representation of a line whenever there is some ordering on the nodes on the line. Nevertheless, RWs on a tree entail moving to non-neighbor states in the space, which makes the analysis involved, and in many cases, impossible. This is precisely what we achieve in this rather pioneering paper. The applications of this paper are numerous. Indeed, the RW on the tree that this paper models, is a type of generalization of dichotomous search with faulty feedback about the direction of the search, rendering the real-life application of the model to be pertinent. To resolve this, we advocate the concept of “backtracking” transitions in order to efficiently explore the search space. Interestingly, it is precisely these “backtracking” transitions that naturally render the chain to be “time reversible”. By doing this, we are able to bridge the gap between deterministic dichotomous search and its faulty version, explained, in detail, in [21]. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Controlled random walk; Dichotomous search; Learning systems; Random walk with jumps; Time reversibility","Chains; Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Controlled random walks; Dichotomous searches; Mathematical analysis; Random Walk; Real-life applications; Three dimensions; Time reversibilities; Time reversible; Random processes",2-s2.0-85019241243

In this article we complement this result by showing that the Fourier dimension of the graph of Wt is almost surely 1. In the proof we introduce a method based on Itô calculus to estimate Fourier transforms by reformulating the question in the language of Itô drift-diffusion processes and combine it with the classical work of Kahane on Brownian images. © 2018 Mathematical Sciences Publishers.","Brownian motion; Fourier dimension; Fourier transform; Graph; Itô calculus; Itô drift-diffusion process; Salem set; Wiener process",,2-s2.0-85032263781

Many simulation models produce dynamic functional output, such as a set of time-series data generated during a process. These computer models require verification and validation (V&V) to assess the correctness of these simulations. In particular, the model validation effort evaluates if the model is an appropriate representation of the real-world system that it is meant to simulate. However, when assessing a model capable of generating functional output, it is useful to learn more than simply whether the model is valid or invalid. Specifically, if the model is deemed invalid, then what aspects of the model are incorrect? Is it possible to identify over what range the model data are a poor representation of the system data? Current V&V methods cannot identify these ranges. This paper proposes a wavelet analysis of variance (WANOVA) bisection method that first assesses model validity and can also identify the interval(s) over which the model is biased. The technique is illustrated using several simulation studies. Ultimately, this new method supports and expands the efficacy of model validation efforts. © 2017","Bisection; Model validation; WANOVA; Wavelets","Hardware; Software engineering; Bisection; Functional outputs; Model validation; Simulation studies; Systems and process; Verification-and-validation; WANOVA; Wavelets; Verification",2-s2.0-85031819519

The contribution provides an integrated framework for probabilistic reliability and risk assessment of existing energy production units considering availability and human safety criteria. An extensive case study focused on risks of an energy production unit in a fossil power station is provided to support practical applications.

The adaptivity is optimized by defining a statistical model, including both the option models and the adaptivity parameters. It turns out the corresponding (log-)likelihood function can be optimized through the EM algorithm, which ensures that the optimization is robust. We evaluate the method on simulated data and S&P 500 index options, seeing that we can track variations in the model parameters well.

Unlike previous studies, this study examined the moderating effect of income. Since Facebook has become a phenomenon, there is a necessity to explore whether the level of f-commerce browsing and usage intensity can trigger urge to purchase and impulse purchase. Following the Stimulus-Organism-Response framework, data was collected using mall-intercept technique and analyzed with SmartPLS 3. Majority of the suggested hypotheses have been empirically validated and the research framework can explain 33.0% of variance in urge to purchase and 61.7% variance in impulse purchase.

Historically, the developed mathematical framework has been largely confined to the aggregation of real numbers, while the aggregation of other types of structures, such as rankings, has been independently considered in different fields of application. However, one could lately perceive an increasing interest in the study and formalization of aggregation processes on new types of data. Mostly, this aggregation outside the framework of real numbers is based on the use of a penalty function measuring the disagreement with a consensus element. Unfortunately, there does not exist a comprehensive theoretical framework yet. In this paper, we propose a natural extension of the definition of a penalty function to a more general setting based on the compatibility with a given betweenness relation. In particular, we revisit one of the most common methods for the aggregation of rankings – the method of Kemeny – which will be positioned in the penalty-based aggregation framework. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Aggregation of rankings; Kemeny; Monometric; Penalty function","Fuzzy sets; Network function virtualization; Pattern matching; Aggregation process; Aggregation theory; Current confinement; Kemeny; Mathematical frameworks; Monometric; Penalty function; Theoretical framework; Fuzzy logic",2-s2.0-85029435540

The system is composed of K units, one online and the rest in cold standby. The online unit is submitted to different types of failures and when a non-repairable failure occurs the corresponding unit is removed. Several internal degradation states are considered which are observed when a random inspection occurs. This unit is subject to internal repairable failure, external shocks and preventive maintenance. If one internal repairable failure occurs, the unit goes to the repair facility for corrective repair, if a major degradation level is observed by inspection, the unit goes to preventive maintenance and when one external shock happens, this one may produce an aggravation of the internal degradation level, cumulative external damage or external extreme failure (non-repairable failure). Preventive maintenance and corrective repair times follow different distributions. The system is modelled in transient regime and relevant performance measures are obtained.

To gain insights into the problem we used the Kohonen self-organizing neural network to visualize the relationship between the class labels and the independent variables. The information gained from the learned internal clusters gave a deeper insight into the mapping process. The ability to accurately predict ATC codes was unbalanced due to over and under representation of some ATC classes.

The elastic domain is defined by a level-set function, and the evolution of the domain is obtained by moving the level-set along a velocity field using a transport equation. The velocity field is the largest decreasing direction of the shape derivative that satisfies a certain regularity requirement and the computation of the shape derivative is based on a volume formulation. Using the cut finite element method no re-meshing is required when updating the domain and we may also use higher order finite element approximations. To obtain a stable method, stabilization terms are added in the vicinity of the cut elements at the boundary, which provides control of the variation of the solution in the vicinity of the boundary.

However, existed methods and results are limited if the fuzzy linear programming problem with generalized fuzzy numbers in its objective functions and constraints. In this paper, we discuss fully fuzzy linear programming (FFLP) problems of which all parameters are LR at fuzzy numbers and a simple but practical method is developed to solve it. In this method, the approximate representation of fully fuzzy constraints is investigated by means of the arithmetic operations on LR at fuzzy numbers space firstly. Meanwhile, we constructed a auxiliary multi-objective programming to solve the FFLP problems. After that, three approaches are proposed to solve the constructed auxiliary multi-objective programming, including optimistic approach, pessimistic approach and linear sum approach based on membership function. Finally, the obtained results are compared with the existing works and numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 by Eudoxus Press, LLC.

However, an outstanding question answering system requires an outstanding Question Classification (QC) system. Question classifier is a system that assigns a label to each question. There exist different ways of solving this problem such as rule-based, machine learning, and hybrid approaches. This paper provides a better solution for QC using machine-learning approaches. Three methods of feature extraction are proposed in this paper. The First method uses clustering algorithms to partition vocabulary into clusters and acquires feature vector corresponding to each question using clustering information. The second one suggests a method of extracting features from questions to dispose of using recurrent neural networks and to use feedforward neural networks, which have the advantage of learning faster and less need for data, instead. Each question is converted to a feature vector, which is obtained by the Word2vec method and weighted by tf-idf coefficients. The results of question classification using Support Vector Machine and Neural Network classifiers indicate the effectiveness of this type of feature vector and based on that, high performance of the proposed QC system. Finally, the third approach keeps the innovation behind first approach, but it also keeps the fact that we are dealing with a sequence based type of data into consideration.

We propose a watermarking scheme based on machine learning which also has cropping tolerance. First, the luminance space of the image is decomposed by one level through wavelet transform. Then, a bit of the watermark and the marker for synchronization are embedded or extracted by adjusting or comparing the relation between the embedded coefficients value of the LL space and the output coefficients value of the trained machine learning model. This model can well memorize the relationship between its selected coefficients and the neighboring coefficients. The marker for synchronization is embedded in a latticed format in the LL space.

The protection for the workers is essential. However, due to the colorless and odorless nature of natural gas, it is difficult for humans to identify leaks. This paper proposes a quadrotor based gas tracking robot to be used in hazardous gas localization areas, and specifically, to detect methane leak from gas extraction sites. For the quadrotor to fulfill this purpose, it requires the ability to detect wind direction and speed, an endowment that commercial quadrotors lack. The need to detect wind direction and speed stems from the fact that gas plumes travel downwind, but the quadrotor needs to find the source of the leak, and hence, must determine the upwind direction to locate the source. In order to equip the quadrotor with the above skills, a wind direction and speed estimation algorithm based on Euler angles-velocity vectors has been proposed. For comparison purposes, we compared the proposed method with a generic ultrasonic wind sensor. We concluded that the proposed method achieves an error percentage as low as 10.73% for wind speed, and 9.09% for wind direction estimation. Thus, the algorithm is a significant addition to the quadrotors’ capabilities, enabling the quadrotor to trace upwards, against the traversal of the gas plume, and carry out accurate calculations. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2018.",,"Extraction; Speed; Ultrasonic applications; Wireless telecommunication systems; Accurate calculations; Error percentage; Gas extractions; Hazardous gas; Speed estimation; Tracking robots; Velocity vectors; Wind directions; Gases",2-s2.0-85022209496

Support Vector Regression (SVR) was used as the modeling tool. Additionally, we introduced a novel method of assessing regression model in terms of accuracies over Mean Square Error (MSE) which does not capture the behavior of data pattern spatially. This novel method resulted in 71% accuracy of prediction for Kamphaeng Phet province. The proposed model of prediction facilitates administrative bodies to make informed decisions in the context of public health of Thailand. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Dengue prediction; Prediction accuracy of regression; Regression analysis of dengue","Health; Health risks; Mean square error; Public health; Regression analysis; Viruses; Communicable disease; Efficient predictions; Geographical variations; Infection patterns; Informed decision; Prediction accuracy; Regression model; Support vector regression (SVR); Forecasting",2-s2.0-85022179012

In this paper the visual controlling concept is presented in the iSpace framework. The positions of the end-effector of the robot manipulator are presented by the 3D spatial coordinates extracted from image pairs. The exact image Jacobian matrix of the mapping from Cartesian space to image space is given, the task space controllers can be directly extended to image-space controllers. The Jacobian matrix poses uncertainty if modeling and calibration errors are present. Despite the fact that much progress has been presented in the literature of visual servoing, there are only a few results obtained for the stability analysis in presence of the uncertain camera parameters. This research aims developing a new method for the control of the manipulator in Cartesian space, using the vision information of the environment obtained by cameras using the OptiTrack framework. The robotic manipulator is mounted on a mobile tank. The control scheme allows the end effector to transit smoothly from Cartesian-space feedback to vision-space feedback when the target is inside the vicinity of the camera. Key points on the manipulator are marked which are detected by the camera system. The framework calculates the coordinates of the markers, and thus estimate the state of each joint of the manipulator within a margin of error. In order to achieve the most precise estimation each camera image is weighted during the evaluation. The weights are determined using data set of images. After, a likelihood function is assigned for each joint that is used for defining the position and designing the motion. During the experiments the proposed control concept has proven to be reliable. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Intelligent systems; iSpace; Likelihood function; Mechatronics; Robot control; Visual-based control","Cameras; Controllers; End effectors; Feedback; Flexible manipulators; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Jacobian matrices; Manipulators; Mechatronics; Robot applications; Robots; Space applications; Uncertainty analysis; Image jacobian matrix; iSpace; Likelihood functions; Robot controls; Robotic manipulators; Spatial coordinates; Stability analysis; Task space controllers; Visual servoing",2-s2.0-85029785214

The “death” Markov process provides a basis for reliability analysis of the non-repairable multi-state system. It does not consider, however, the impact of start–up failures of components on system reliability. In this chapter, two models of modified “death” Markov processes considering component start–up failures are proposed. They are referred to as “survival-death” Markov processes and they differ in that the first model considers not only completely successful and failed start up but also partially successful start-up, whereas the second model only considers completely successful or failed start up. In such processes, the analytic expressions of the time-dependent transition probabilities can be obtained by using the Laplace-Stieltjes transform and the inverse Laplace-Stieltjes transform.

Few studies have however provided insights into specific influences of cause of death, gender of the deceased and bereaved, age at bereavement and suicide, and time since bereavement. The present nested case-control study was based on data from three longitudinal registers. Subjects comprised 19 015 persons who died from suicide at an age of 11–64 years during 1969–2012 (cases), and 332 046 live comparison individuals matched for gender and date of birth. Information about deceased parents’ cause and date of death, and sociodemographic data was retrieved and merged. Data were analysed with conditional logistic regression. Losing a parent to suicide, transport accidents and other external causes of death was associated with an increased suicide risk in offspring. Parental suicide was associated with a substantially higher suicide risk than transport accidents and other external causes. These effects were equally strong for daughters and sons, and for the loss of a mother, father or both parents. Suicide risk was highest in younger bereaved offspring, and bereavement had both short and long-term impacts on suicide risk. In conclusion, all offspring exposed to parental death by external causes have an increased suicide risk, independent of factors related to the exposure. The consequences are long lasting, and offspring should be offered follow-up in primary healthcare. Younger offspring bereaved by parental suicide have the highest risk and may be targeted for prevention and intervention programs in specialist healthcare. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bereavement; Norway; Population registers; Suicide","adolescent; adult; Article; bereavement; case control study; cause of death; child; controlled study; female; follow up; health care; human; ICD-8; ICD-9; logistic regression analysis; longitudinal study; male; medical specialist; parental death; patient information; primary health care; priority journal; progeny; risk factor; suicide",2-s2.0-85030093645

Moreover, monitoring can be tailored to capture particular facets of this complex thermal landscape that may be important indicators for species and life stages of management concern. We applied spatial stream network models (SSNMs) to an empirical dataset of water temperature from the Snoqualmie River watershed, WA, and use results to provide guidance with respect to necessary sample size, location of new sites, and selection of a modeling approach. As expected, increasing the number of monitoring stations improved both predictive precision and the ability to estimate covariates of stream temperature; however, even relatively small numbers of monitoring stations, n = 20, did an adequate job when well-distributed and when used to build models with only a few covariates. In general, winter data were easier to model and, across seasons, mean temperatures were easier to model than summer maximums, winter minimums, or variance. Adding new sites was advantageous but we did not observe major differences in model performance for particular new site locations. Adding sites from parts of the river network with thermal regimes which differed from the rest of the network, and which were therefore highly influential, improved nearby predictions but reduced model-estimated precision of predictions in the rest of the network. Lastly, using models which accounted for the network-based spatial correlation between observations made it much more likely that estimated prediction confidence intervals covered the true parameter; the exact form of the spatial correlation made little difference. By incorporating spatial structure between observations, SSNMs are particularly valuable for accurate estimation of prediction uncertainty at unmeasured locations. Based on our results, we make the following suggestions for designing water temperature monitoring arrays: (1) make use of pilot data when possible; (2) maintain a distribution of monitors across the stream network (i.e., over space and across the full range of covariates); (3) maintain multiple spatial clusters for more accurately estimating correlation of nearby sites; (4) if sites are to be added, prioritize capturing a range of covariates over adding new tributaries; (5) maintain a sensor array in winter; and (6) expect reduced accuracy and precision when predicting metrics other than means. © 2017","Monitoring; Rivers; Spatial autocorrelation; SSNM; Streams; Water temperature",,2-s2.0-85027986397

This conventional method neglects the opportunity to see the interaction between different zones as it relates to whole building performance. This paper presents fifteen individual cases of dynamic simulations of a six-storey office building with 160 zones. The energy performance analysis was conducted for three climate zones including Helsinki in Finland, London in the United Kingdom and Bucharest in Romania. For each location, the following three cases were simulated: (i) building as usual simulated according to valid national building codes; (ii) Energy-efficient (EE) case with selected necessary parameters enhanced to reduce total delivered energy demand; and (iii) nZEB case representing partial enhancement of the EE case based on the parametric analysis. The results of nZEB indicate that for Helsinki, it is possible to reduce the space-heating load by 86%, electricity consumed by lighting, appliance, and HVAC by 32%. For London, the heating load is reduced by 95%, cooling load is slightly increased, and electricity demand is decreased by 33%. For Bucharest, 92% of energy in heating can be saved, cooling energy demand was reduced by 60% and electricity consumption by 34%. Based on the nZEB cases for each location, alternative heating and cooling choices of a radiant floor panel system and radiant ceiling panel system were explored. There are small differences in absolute consumption demand for heating, cooling, and electricity for three cases in each location. The specific energy/m2 for heating remained nearly the same in all systems for all three cases in each location. Alternative choices for heating and cooling by using Radiant Ceiling Panel (RCP) and Radiant Floor Panel (RFP) were investigated for all final nZEB cases. Marginal difference in heating energy required for space heating can be seen for London nZEB IHC and London nZEB RCP of 0.8 kWh/m2/year and for Bucharest nZEB IHC and Bucharest nZEB RCP case of 1.3 kWh/m2/year. RFP has the availability of large surface area for heat exchange and can provide heating at a low temperature and cooling at high temperature, but requires supporting air based cooling during the humid season. For RCP, the limited temperature exchange surface may increase the airflow rate, but supplies it at a lower temperature for the same load. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bucharest; Dynamic simulations; Energy efficiency; Energy performance; Helsinki; IDA ICE; London; Multi zone; nZEB; Office buildings; Radiant ceiling panels; Radiant floor panels","Air conditioning; Building codes; Buildings; Ceilings; Computer simulation; Electric power utilization; Energy management; Floors; Heating; Location; Office buildings; Space heating; Temperature; Bucharest; Energy performance; Helsinki; London; nZEB; Radiant ceiling panels; Radiant floors; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-85032388303

This paper presents a numerical approach capable of simulating the ice accretion transient phenomenon and its effects on wind turbine performance. This approach is applied to the NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine to predict (i) its performance during and after an icing event lasting for 8 h and (ii) the potential improvement in energy harnessing due to different operational strategies. The results show that by decreasing the turbine rotational speed and accepting a slight energy conversion decrease during the icing event, the performance can improve up to 6% when full operation is restored compared to the baseline operational strategy. Whereas, sustaining the rotational speed during the icing event can generate a 3% of performance loss afterwards compared to the same baseline. The developed workflow can be used for optimising performance of wind turbines by accounting for environmental conditions, the duration of the icing event, and performance after the icing event itself, thus constituting a valuable tool to maximise profitability of wind turbines in cold climates. © 2017","Icing simulation; NREL wind turbine; Numerical simulation; Operational strategies; Transient ice accretion","Computer simulation; Energy conversion; Ice; Wind power; Environmental conditions; Ice accretion; Icing simulation; Mitigation measures; Numerical approaches; Operational strategies; Transient phenomenon; Turbine performance; Wind turbines; climate change; environmental conditions; numerical method; operations technology; performance assessment; simulation; wind power; wind turbine",2-s2.0-85028968192

Currently many Australian children are consuming a diet that is characterised by large quantities of discretionary items. We undertook a qualitative study to gain a descriptive account of preadolescent children's attitudes and perceptions towards health and nutrition. A series of 6 focus groups and 14 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirty-eight children aged 11–12 years, across three state government schools in a socially disadvantaged region of metropolitan South Australia. The naturalistic manner of qualitative inquiry led to several unintended yet highly pertinent emergent themes, including children's perceptions and practices surrounding discretionary food consumption. Our results indicate that while Australian guidelines recommend that discretionary foods are consumed ‘only sometimes and in small amounts’, children generally held a different belief with respect to what constituted ‘sometimes’. Many children identified that discretionary foods should be consumed in moderation to maintain a balanced diet, yet reported consuming these foods frequently. Self-reported discretionary food consumption was grounded in socially constructed experiences valued by the children, who made situational attributions to foods and legitimised discretionary food consumption in certain contexts, for example during the weekend. Overall, there is variability between children's opinions about the acceptable frequency of consumption of discretionary foods compared with national guidelines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Children; Discretionary foods; Nutrition; Treats","Australian; child; clinical article; female; food intake; government; human; information processing; male; nutrition; perception; practice guideline; qualitative research; school child; semi structured interview; South Australia",2-s2.0-85028336780

This investigation compares three groups of fibroblasts: control group and with two kinds of genetic modifications. Those are: fibroblasts isolated from human skin (control group), after transduction with lentivirus bearing EGFP fluorescent marker and transduction with lentivirus bearing DsRed2 fluorescent markers. The experimental sequences of images of a monitored cells’ culture have been analysed using image processing methods, such as image segmentation and morphological feature quantification of cells. The following features: area, perimeter, eccentricity, roundness, elongation ratio, length of the major axis, roundness and Hu and Zernike moments have been analyzed in two types of cells models: lamina model and wire model. It appears that the differences in eccentricity, roundness, elongation ratio between modified human skin fibroblasts and their reference culture are not statistically significant. However, the differences in the area, the length of the major axis and the length of perimeter between the control group of fibroblasts and both groups of transduced fibroblasts are statistically significant. The next feature – roundness of fibroblasts – presents statistically significant difference for both transdused groups and fibroblast control group. There is no statistically significant difference between fibroblasts transduced with EGFP marker and those transdused with DsRed2 marker. Genetically modified fibroblasts after extra gene transduction occupy bigger area and assume more elongated shapes.

However, the environmental efficiency analysis and evaluation based on the traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) cross model is subjective and inaccurate, because all elements in a column or a row of the cross evaluation matrix (CEM) in the traditional DEA cross model are given the same weight. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved environmental DEA cross model based on the information entropy to analyze and evaluate the carbon emission of industrial departments in China. The information entropy is applied to build the entropy distance based on the turbulence of the whole system, and calculate the weights in the CEM of the environmental DEA cross model in a dynamic way. The theoretical results show that the new weight constructed based on the information entropy is unique and optimal globally by using the Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, compared with the traditional environmental DEA and DEA cross model, the improved environmental DEA cross model has a better efficiency discrimination ability based on the data of industrial departments in China. Moreover, the proposed model can obtain the potential of carbon emission reduction of industrial departments to improve the energy efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission reduction; Dynamic weights; Environmental DEA cross model; Industrial departments; Information entropy; Monte Carlo simulation","carbon dioxide; coal; coke; fuel oil; gasoline; petroleum; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental modeling; industrial emission; information; Monte Carlo analysis; sustainable development; air analysis; Article; carbon footprint; China; data envelopment analysis; entropy; greenhouse effect; industry; Monte Carlo method; China",2-s2.0-85030851526

The stress manipulation successfully increased cortisol scores (AUCg and AUCi) in presenters. No significant relationships emerged between cortisol and either total EI or EI subscales, although the emotional control subscale predicted mood. Results may indicate that EI influences stress processes in some students but not others, they may reflect the study methods and EI measure used, or they may reflect the complexity of group assessments.

We aimed to apply superlearning, an ensemble machine learning method, to the prediction of 30-day neonatal postoperative mortality. Materials and methods We included neonates in the 2012-2014 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric. Patients treated in 2012-13 were used in model development (n = 6499), and patients treated in 2014 formed the validation sample (n = 3552). Our superlearner algorithm included 14 regression and machine learning algorithms and included all preoperative patient demographic and clinical characteristics, including indicator variables for surgical procedures. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error and measures of discrimination and calibration. Results The superlearner out-performed all individual algorithms with regard to cross-validated mean squared error. It showed excellent discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in development and 0.87 in validation. The superlearner showed good calibration in development but not in validation (Cox calibration test P = 0.06 and P < 0.001, respectively). Performance was improved when the superlearner was fit using only variables strongly associated with mortality in bivariate analysis (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.89, calibration test P = 0.63 in validation). Conclusions Superlearning provided improved or equivalent performance compared with individual regression and machine learning algorithms for predicting neonatal surgical mortality. This method should be considered for prediction in large data sets whenever complex mechanisms make parametric modeling assumptions unrealistic. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Neonates; Postoperative mortality; Prediction; Superlearning",,2-s2.0-85031011093

Methods We randomly assigned 34 schools to one of the two interventions: students in 17 schools received a daily lunch-box and parents in the other 17 schools received a food voucher of equal value once a month. All students were offered the opportunity to participate. We conducted 30 focus groups in all participating schools (17 in the meal distribution and 13 in the food voucher schools). Eligible participants included parents (n = 106), educators (n = 66) and school principals (n = 34). We qualitatively evaluated their perceptions and attitudes towards the program. Results Important differences were observed between the two approaches, with more favourable perceptions being reported for the meal distribution approach. More specifically, social stigmatization was minimized in the meal distribution approach, through the participation of all students, compared with the food-voucher participants who reported feelings of embarrassment and fear of stigmatization. Secondly, the meal distribution approach alleviated child food insecurity through the provision of the daily meal, while the food-voucher intervention helped manage household food insecurity, as vouchers were mainly used for purchasing food for family meals. Furthermore, the educational and experiential nature of the meal distribution approach intensified healthy eating promotion, while the food-voucher intervention was efficient mainly for conscious parents regarding healthy eating. Conclusions The meal distribution intervention was considered more effective than the food-voucher one. Hence, for interventions aiming at tackling food insecurity of children and adolescents, public health focus could be oriented towards school-based in kind food assistance. © 2017","Children; Food aid; Food insecurity; Food-vouchers; Perceptions; School meal","child; controlled study; eating; fear; female; food assistance; food insecurity; household; human; information processing; major clinical study; male; perception; public health; purchasing; student",2-s2.0-85032264392

Analyzing the spillover effects on agricultural commodities and biofuel helps commodity suppliers hedge their portfolios, and manage the risk and co-risk of their biofuel and agricultural commodities. There have been many papers concerned with analyzing crude oil and agricultural commodities separately. The purpose of this paper is to examine the volatility spillovers for spot and futures returns on bio-ethanol and related agricultural commodities, specifically corn and sugarcane. The diagonal BEKK model is used as it is the only multivariate conditional volatility model with well-established regularity conditions and known asymptotic properties. The daily data used are from 31 October 2005 to 14 January 2015. The empirical results show that, in 2 of 6 cases for the spot market, there were significant negative co-volatility spillover effects: specifically, corn on subsequent sugarcane co-volatility with corn, and sugarcane on subsequent corn co-volatility with sugarcane. In the other 4 cases, there are no significant co-volatility spillover effects. There are significant positive co-volatility spillover effects in all 6 cases, namely between corn and sugarcane, corn and ethanol, and sugarcane and ethanol, and vice-versa, for each of the three pairs of commodities. It is clear that the futures prices of bio-ethanol and the two agricultural commodities, corn and sugarcane, have stronger co-volatility spillovers than their spot price counterparts. These empirical results suggest that the bio-ethanol and agricultural commodities should be considered as viable futures products in financial portfolios for risk management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-ethanol; Biofuel; Co-risk; Co-volatility spillover effects; Corn; Diagonal BEKK model; Futures prices; Hedging; Returns; Risk; Risk management; Spot prices; Sugarcane; Volatility",,2-s2.0-85028431837

These emissions stem from both the construction and operation of buildings. In recent years the carbon efficiency of energy sources and energy efficiency of new buildings has been improved in Sweden. Therefore, embodied emissions accounts for an increasing share of the life cycle emissions of new buildings. This study aims to asses the cost effectiveness in abatement of embodied emissions. This was done by assessing the embodied emissions of a case building and several conventional design measures along with the implication on production cost. It was found that many of the measures enabled cost effective carbon abatement. Embodied emissions could be reduced by 15% using cost neutral or nearly cost neutral measures. Abatements up to 18% were found cost effective in relation to abatement of carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors. Abatements up to 24% were possible with minor increases in total production cost (0.22%) even though some of the individual measures were found expensive in relation to abatement of carbon dioxide emissions in other sectors. Some measures entailed increased floor area that could potentially lead to economic gain where exterior area is a limiting factor.

Today, cluster analysis is a widely known technique applied and universally practised in many research areas. Among ‘n’ different clustering techniques we briefly deal with centroid model, i.e., K-means, which is an iterative clustering technique. The recital of this algorithm is dependent on certain factors, which include the selection of initial centroid and the approach used in performing reckoning from each data point to different cluster centers. Initial pattern considered randomly by K-means algorithm often make the clustering results reach the local optima, i.e., choice of initial seed (pattern) greatly affects the ultimate clusters that results, in terms of inter and intra cluster distances and firmness. In this research paper author experimented the behaviors of different patterns with different distance metrics on k-means. Finally estimated validity check, i.e., cluster division ratios for every distance measure used and patterns considered. The experimental grades showed the maximum cluster parting and observed better cluster quality when chosen the initial seed as per the assumptions made, compared to patterns randomly picked. The pragmatic results were met when tried with different sample set and different k values.

Therefore, we conducted a clinical trial to compare two different extended endocrine therapy durations.Methods: In the randomized phase III IDEAL trial, postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly allocated to either 2.5 or five years of letrozole after the initial five years of any endocrine therapy. The primary end point was disease free survival (DFS), and secondary end points were overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free interval (DMFi), new primary breast cancer, and safety. Hazard ratios (HRs) were determined using Cox regression analysis. All analyses were by intention-to-treat principle.Results: A total of 1824 patients were assigned to either 2.5 years (n = 909) or five years (n = 915) of letrozole, with a median follow-up of 6.6 years. A DFS event occurred in 152 patients in the five-year group, compared with 163 patients in the 2.5-year group (HR = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74 to 1.16).

The provinces with the large CFs and per capita CF were mainly those locate in eastern, developed regions along the coast and several highly populated ones. CO2 emissions due to capital formation contributes the most to the CFs and the increment in this period, and this was followed by urban consumption. Significant embodied CO2 transfer were observed to drift from the developing and energy-abundant provinces like Hebei and Inner Mongolia, to the developed coastal provinces. Total embodied CO2 transfer account for 43.9% of the national CF in 2007, and decreased to 41.0% in 2010. In order to control CO2 emissions and make reduction allocations for provinces, interprovincial embodied CO2 transfer and practical capacities need to be taken into account. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Embodied CO2 transfer; Multi-regional input–output; Provincial level; Regional variation","Carbon footprint; Annual growth rate; Consumption patterns; Economic development; Embodied CO2 transfer; Provincial level; Reduction targets; Regional variation; Resource endowments; Carbon dioxide",2-s2.0-85030664663

However, the quantitative relationship between how strict gun laws are and the incidence of firearm violence with their associated mortality is largely unknown. We therefore, sought to explore the impact of firearm law patterns among states on the incidence and outcomes of firearm-related suicide attempts, utilizing established objective criteria. Methods The National Inpatient Sample for the years 1998-2011 was queried for all firearm-related suicides. Discharge facilities were stratified into five categories (A, B, C, D, and F, with A representing states with the most strict and F representing states with the least strict laws) based on the Brady Campaign to prevent Gun Violence that assigns scorecards for every state. The primary outcomes were suicide attempts and in-hospital mortality per 100,000 populations by Brady state grade. Results During the 14-year study period, 34,994 subjects met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 42.0 years and 80.1% were male. A handgun was utilized by 51.8% of patients. The overall mortality was 33.3%. Overall, 22.0% had reported psychoses and 19.3% reported depression. After adjusting for confounding factors and using group A as reference, there were higher adjusted odds for suicide attempts for patients admitted in group C, D, and F category states (1.73, 2.09, and 1.65, respectively, all P < 0.001). Conclusions Firearm-related suicide attempt injuries are more common in states with less strict gun laws, and these injuries tend to be associated with a higher mortality. Efforts aimed at nationwide standardization of firearm state laws are warranted, particularly for young adults and suicide-prone populations. Level of evidence III.

Patterns of map production and distribution reflect changes in society and the structural evolution of a ‘world city.’ Histiocartographic analysis illustrates the: 1.transition from a make-shift village to a world centre,2.evolution from a penal colony (1788–1840) via a ‘nodal city’ controlling exports, to an international city, important in its own right,3.and the switch from a small, ‘walking city’ with colonial outposts to an urban/suburban complex absorbing its rural hinterland (the Cumberland Plain). Printed maps and their publication and distribution characteristics both illustrate change, and add to the dynamic with their focus on colonial printing history. Maps in the First Fleet Journals (1789–1792) show early hope, then disappointment while those of French visitors (Baudin, 1802) depict a composite and busy village. The impact of Macquarie is seen in a map by Thomas Mitchell (Surveyor General), published with the “NSW Calendar & Directory” (1831), a list of residents connected with ‘the General Post Office.’ It was the first local, commercially lithographed map, and represented a watershed moment when Australian printing could replace cheaper printing in Europe. Traditional European sources (e.g. printed atlases, Hansard, published journals) contained few large-scale maps of Sydney—from this time nearly all important maps were published by local printers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,"Printing; Publishing; Rural areas; Distribution characteristics; Structural evolution; Watershed moment; Maps",2-s2.0-85031296831

We examined the effectiveness of an evidence-based confrontation in which participants received concrete evidence of their discriminatory gender-biased evaluations. Participants were confronted with evidence that they evaluated a female applicant for a lab manager position negatively, which would have resulted in her not being hired, and that their evaluations were more negative than an otherwise identical applicant who was male. Experiment 1 found that this confrontation activated greater guilt and, in turn, concern about expressing and regulating gender bias in the future (hereafter “future concern”), relative to participants who were confronted about gender bias but without concrete evidence of bias. Experiment 2 showed that confrontation with concrete evidence of gender bias activated guilt and future concern whether the bias was framed as viewing women as not belonging in science or as unintelligent. Experiment 3 showed that the positive effects of confronting gender bias with evidence were just as strong as a parallel confrontation of racial bias. Experiment 4 showed that the positive effects also held in a non-STEM domain, and that these effects were not dependent on the situational salience of norms opposing gender bias. Thus, a robust strategy for effective confrontation of gender bias was established.

The recognizer also uses two statistical classifiers. The frame feature vectors are utilized by the frame classifier. The results of the classifier, then become part of the sequence feature vector, which in turn are utilized by the sequence classifier. The results show that the accuracy of the recognizer increases more than twice, when using both classifiers.

As background, the paper presents the regional needs the programme is intended to address and describes how the programme was designed. The aim was to understand how, from students’ perspective, the nurse master's programme structured knowledge for their future position as APNs. The research question focuses on how the master's programme prepares students by meeting their diverse needs for knowledge. Empirical material was collected at two times during the students’ first and second years of study through semi-structured qualitative interviews. The findings highlight the process in which these master's students gained a more advanced identity of becoming APNs. This process demonstrates how students perceive their current position as nurses based on a discourse of knowledge in relation to the practical and theoretical knowledge they encounter in the master's programme. This article concludes by recommending that attention should be paid to developing APN role models in the current Swedish healthcare system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced practice nurse; Blended learning; Knowledge structures; Master's programme; Qualitative","advanced practice nurse; attention; health care system; human; identity; interview; learning; student; Sweden; theoretical study",2-s2.0-85032820894

SSL methods aim to project samples into a low-dimensional subspace which can well maintain sparse correlations of dataset. However, most SSL methods utilize sparse representation (SR) which constructs sparse correlations without label information. Therefore, labels can’t be fully utilized to improve discriminative abilities of SSL methods. In order to overcome this drawback, this paper proposed a novel method called semi-supervised sparsity preserving projection (SSPP). SSPP first combines label information with SR to construct sparse correlations between samples. Some wrong correlations are avoided due to the employment of labels. Then, in order to further improve discriminative abilities of SSPP, large-margin criterion is adopted.

The analysis takes a functional approach to assess the state of the energy governance system and to determine its relationship to renewable energy (RE) penetration. Using a suite of governance, market and financial progress indicators, a range of RE preparedness levels was identified in PSIDS. Analysis demonstrated that strengthening of RE enabling indicators led to only a limited increase of RE penetration; consequently, the region has fallen behind global rates of RE uptake. Inward investment by development partners for RE demonstration projects failed to be upscaled by government-facilitated private sector.

This study investigated current workplace risk management practices in two industry sectors with high risk of both MSDs and MHDs and evaluated the extent to which risk from psychosocial hazards is being effectively managed. Method Nineteen, mostly large, Australian organisations were each asked to provide documentation of their relevant policies and procedures, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 67 staff who had OHS or management roles within these organisations. Information about current workplace practices was derived from analyses of both the documentation and interview transcripts. Results Risk management practices addressing musculoskeletal and mental health risks in these workplaces focused predominately on changing individual behaviours through workplace training, provision of information, individual counselling, and sometimes healthy lifestyle programs. There were formal procedures to control sources of risk for workplace biomechanical hazards affecting musculoskeletal risk, but no corresponding procedures to control risk from work-related psychosocial hazards. Very few risk control actions addressed risk from psychosocial hazards at their workplace sources. Practical applications To reduce the risk of both musculoskeletal and mental health disorders, existing practices need considerable expansion to address risk from all potential psychosocial hazards. Risk controls for both biomechanical and psychosocial hazards need to focus more on eliminating or reducing risk at source, in accord with the general risk management hierarchy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Musculoskeletal; Occupational health and safety; Psychosocial; Workplace risk management","Biohazards; Biomechanics; Hazards; Health; Health hazards; Health risks; Human resource management; Industrial hygiene; Musculoskeletal system; Risk management; Individual behaviour; Musculoskeletal; Occupational health; Occupational health and safety; Psychosocial; Psychosocial hazards; Risk management practices; Semi structured interviews; Occupational risks; adult; Article; controlled study; counseling; female; human; lifestyle; male; mental disease; musculoskeletal disease; occupational hazard; priority journal; risk management; risk reduction; semi structured interview; workplace",2-s2.0-85029814100

This is a secondary analysis of intake data from NOURISH and SAIDI cohorts. Scores for dietary diversity, fruit variety, vegetable variety and meat/alternative variety were combined using structural equation modelling to form the latent variable ‘Dietary quality’ (DQ) at age 24 months. A longitudinal model examined influence of formula (grams), cow's milk (grams) and dietary diversity at 14 months and covariates, on DQ. At age 24 months (n = 337) 27% of children obtained a maximum dietary diversity score (5/5). Variety scores were relatively low – with mean variety scores (and possible range) being four for fruit (0–30); five for vegetables (0–36); and three for meat/alternatives (0–8).

Formula intake was negatively associated with diversity at 14 months, but not DQ at 24. Diversity and variety were limited despite sociodemographic advantage of the sample. Diversity at 14 months, degree of neophobia and sociodemographic factors predicted DQ at 24 months. There is an ongoing need to emphasise the importance of repeated early exposure to healthy foods, such that children have the opportunity to learn to like a range of tastes and texture, thereby maximising dietary diversity and quality in infancy and early toddlerhood. © 2017","Breastfeeding; Dietary quality; Diversity; Formula; Structural equation modelling; Toddlers; Variety","Article; artificial milk; Australia; child; Child Food Neophobia Scale score; clinical article; controlled study; dietary intake; education; female; fruit; human; longitudinal study; male; maternal age; meat; mental disease assessment; observational study; preschool child; randomized controlled trial; secondary analysis; vegetable",2-s2.0-85029296150

Therefore, the objectives of this paper are threefold: (i) to develop a modeling technique that can be used to predict the normal behavior of air quality variables and help provide accurate reference for monitoring purposes; (ii) to develop fault detection method that can effectively and quickly detect any anomalies in measured air quality data. For this purpose, a new fault detection method that is based on the combination of generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) will be developed. GLRT is a well-known statistical fault detection method that relies on maximizing the detection probability for a given false alarm rate. In this paper, we propose to develop GLRT-based EWMA fault detection method that will be able to detect the changes in the values of certain air quality variables; (iii) to develop fault isolation and identification method that allows defining the fault source(s) in order to properly apply appropriate corrective actions.

In this chapter, we propose support functions to assess the learning conditions of a programming practicum.

To deal with these incomplete data, a new kernel function with asymmetric intrinsic mappings is proposed in this study. Such a new kernel uses three-side similarities for kernel matrix formation. The similarity between a testing instance and a training sample relies not only on their distance but also on the relation between the testing sample and the centroid of the class, where the training sample belongs. This reduces biased estimation compared with typical methods when only one training sample is used for kernel matrix formation. Furthermore, centroid generation does not involve any clustering algorithms. The proposed kernel is capable of performing data imputation by using class-dependent averages. This enhances Fisher Discriminant Ratios and data discriminability. Experiments on two open databases were carried out for evaluating the proposed method. The result indicated that the accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of the baseline. These findings thereby demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed idea. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Data analytics; Data imputation; Incomplete data analysis; Kernel method; Kernel ridge Regression (KRR); Missing values; Multiside similarity; Partial similarity; Privacy preservation","Cloud computing; Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Data privacy; Information analysis; Matrix algebra; Regression analysis; Sampling; Data analytics; Data imputation; Incomplete data; Kernel methods; Kernel ridge regression (KRR); Missing values; Multiside similarity; Partial similarities; Privacy preservation; Big data",2-s2.0-85006981923

It extends the results of Knüppel (2014) in order to relax the condition on the data structure that is required for the SUR estimator to be independent of unknown quantities. It turns out that the SUR estimator of the forecast uncertainty, which estimates the forecast uncertainty for all horizons jointly, tends to deliver large efficiency gains relative to the OLS estimator (i.e., the sample mean of the squared forecast errors for each individual horizon) in the case of increased forecast horizons.

However, the calculation of the Cramér-Rao bound requires a known probability density function that describes the occurring stochastic process. For this reason, the Cramér-Rao bound is applied for determining the lower limit of the measurement uncertainty due to random errors. According to the international guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM), unknown systematic errors shall be treated as random errors. This approach is adopted here to enhance the applicability of the Cramér-Rao bound for unknown systematic errors. As a key result, the concept of Fisher information and the Cramér-Rao bound is shown to be applicable also to unknown systematic errors, which is demonstrated for several examples. An unknown offset, an unknown linear drift and successive unknown linear drifts are investigated in detail as systematic errors. Each derived corresponding Fisher information shows a characteristic behavior with respect to the measurement time. In contrast to random errors with a constant variance, the Fisher information can decrease for unknown systematic errors and, thus, the Cramér-Rao bound can increase with an increasing measurement time. For the typically existing case of simultaneously occurring random and unknown systematic errors, an optimal measurement time exists for which the achievable measurement uncertainty becomes minimal. In summary, the examples demonstrate how to determine the Fisher information and the Cramér-Rao bound for unknown systematic errors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cramér-Rao inequality; Fisher information; Measurement time; Measurement uncertainty limit; Systematic error","Errors; Fisher information matrix; Probability density function; Random errors; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Fisher information; Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements; Lower bounds; Lower limits; Measurement time; Measurement uncertainty; Optimal measurements; Systematic errors",2-s2.0-85028805740

Spammers have utilized social networks as a new way to spread spam information using fake accounts. Many detection methods have been proposed to solve this problem, and have been proved to be successful to some extent. However, as the spammers' strategies for evading detection evolve, many existing methods lose their efficacy. A major limitation of previous approaches is that they are using the features from a static time point to detect spammers, without considering temporal factors. In this study, we approach the challenge of spammer detection by leveraging the temporal evolution patterns of users. We propose a dynamic metric to measure the change in users' activities and design new features to quantify users' evolution patterns. Then we develop a framework by combining unsupervised and supervised learning to distinguish between spammers and legitimate users. We test our method on a real world dataset with a large number of users. The evaluation results show that our approach can efficiently distinguish the difference between spammers and legitimate users regarding temporal evolution patterns. It also demonstrates the high level of similarity in the spammers' temporal evolution patterns. Compared with other detection methods, our method can achieve better performance. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to provide a generic and efficient framework to depict the evolutional pattern of users. It can handle the problem of spammers updating their strategies to evade detection and is a valuable reference for this research field. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Machine learning; Online social networks; Spammer detection; Temporal evolution","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Statistical tests; Detection methods; Evaluation results; Evolution patterns; Information sharing; On-line social networks; Social activities; Spammer detections; Temporal evolution; Social networking (online)",2-s2.0-85029423592

However, automatic object detection, especially for small objects detection in such images is still difficult because of the inherent speckle noise as well as the various shapes of small objects. In this paper, by using both the Percentage Occupancy Hit-or-Miss Transform (POHMT) and the Tsallis entropy, a novel method for detecting small objects in SSS images is proposed. On one hand, the proposed method adopts the morphological POHMT to enhance faint small objects. On the other hand, the Tsallis entropy which considers the long-range interactions among particles in a system is employed to determine the optimal threshold of the POHMT. The proposed method has been evaluated on two groups of SSS images. For the first group, the average detection rate and false alarm rate of the proposed method are about 86.42% and 10.58%, respectively. For the second group, the average detection rate is 100% while the average false alarm rate is 6.25%.

However, little is known about the dimensions that govern sound quality and character of electric vehicles. Electric vehicle sound signatures are characterized by significant high frequency content caused by the tonal harmonics that are emitted from the electric drive systems. Currently, the quiet sound emissions of electric vehicles at low speeds pose a safety risk to pedestrians and cyclists. Legislation in several countries stipulate that a warning sound should be added to the inherent signature sound of these vehicles to enhance the audio-detectability of these vehicles. Furthermore, consumer perceptions of the interior sound quality point to an unsatisfactory and bland sound character. Could the electric motor sound be modified in such a way that it not only satisfies legislation, but also improves consumer satisfaction? The effects of various sound modifiers are investigated, by means of jury testing, in order to asses the influence on juror satisfaction. The results revealed that enhanced sounds were preferred above standard production electric vehicle sounds. It was concluded that electric vehicle sound quality is complex and the multi-dimensional sound space should be considered as a whole, rather than mere individual subjective semantics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive; Electric vehicles; Psychoacoustics; Sound","Acoustic variables measurement; Acoustic waves; Acoustics; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Pedestrian safety; Semantics; Sound reproduction; Vehicles; Automotive; Consumer perception; Consumer satisfactions; Electric drive system; High frequency HF; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Psychoacoustics; Vehicle sound quality; Audio acoustics",2-s2.0-85028444479

The model is formulated as a stochastic variational inequality derived from the formulation of the deterministic version of the problem, also stated as a variational inequality problem, for which only a single solution method is known uptodate. Closely related with the stochastic model, and as a special case of it, a consistent smoothing approximation to the deterministic model is developed and it is shown that this approximation provides an alternative way of solving the deterministic model. It is also shown that both, the stochastic model and the smoothed approximation, can be solved by means of an adaptation of a path based method for the asymmetric traffic assignment problem.

In the future, the optimal planning and design of a DH system should consider not only the techno-economic feasibility but also the capability to improve energy efficiency and environment protection. This means that single objective optimization model for the planning of DH system is limited in this regard. Therefore, a multicriteria decision making (MCDM) model for decision support on the planning and designing of DH system is developed in this paper. This is a typical problem with uncertainty and imprecision both in the criteria measurements and the weights. In view of this, we adopted the fuzzy set theory and grey relational analysis to develop a fuzzy grey multicriteria decision making (FG-MCDM) model for DH systems.

However, even though ridesharing is based on a win-win collaboration and modern mobile communication technologies have significantly eased discovering and managing ride matches, the adoption of ridesharing has paradoxically decreased during the last years. In this respect, recent studies have highlighted how privacy concerns and the lack of trust among peers are crucial issues that hamper the success of ridesharing. In this chapter, we tackle both of these issues by means of (i) a fully decentralized P2P ridesharing management network that avoids centralized ride-matching agencies (and hence private data compilation by such agencies); and (ii) an also decentralized reputation management protocol that brings trust among peers, even when they have not previously interacted. Our proposal rests on co-utility, which ensures that rational (even purely selfish) peers will find no incentives to deviate from the prescribed protocols. We have tested our system by using data gathered from real mobility traces of cabs in the San Francisco Bay area, and according to several metrics that quantify the degree of adoption of ridesharing and the ensuing individual and societal benefits. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,2-s2.0-85028987509

To penalize disk overlap, we added priori distribution of configuration based on pairwise interaction. The best disk configuration maximizes the probability of configuration given image data and pairwise interactions between disks.

Active fall protection system (AFPS) is frequently a must in situations where working conditions are difficult and other controls are not feasible or inadequate. However, the design and selection of AFPS are still problematic in the construction industry. This paper aims to develop an online knowledge-based system, FPSWizard, to support the design and selection of AFPS. The hybrid system adopts a combination of case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) to improve retrieval performance. FPSWizard is meant to recommend suitable AFPS based on similar past design cases. Potential end users, such as professional engineers and safety professionals, can use the system as a decision support system when they are selecting and designing a solution to the work-at-height problem at hand. A total of fifty stored cases were created based on actual work scenarios and AFPS designs in the construction industry. A case structure was also created using the AFPS-Ontology. The system was assessed using a leave-one-out cross validation approach, where fifty cases in the case base were used to test the retrieval performance of the system. The hybrid CBR-RBR approach had an average positive predictive value (PPV) (or precision) of 90%. In comparison, a pure CBR approach had an average PPV of 76%.

The results showed that: (1) Most of heating energy exhibit a distinct north-south difference, such as central heating supply, stalks and domestic coal. Whereas spatial distribution of domestic natural gas and electricity exhibited west-east differences. (2) Consumption of central heating, stalks and domestic coal show obvious spatial dependence. Whereas firewood, natural gas and electricity did not show significant spatial autocorrelation. It exhibited an extinct south-north difference of heat supply, stalks and domestic coal which were identified to show significant positive spatial autocorrelation. (3) Central heating, residential boilers and natural gas did not show any significant correlations with LEB. While, the utilization of domestic coal and biomass showed significant negative correlations with LEB, and household electricity shows positive correlations. The utilization of domestic coal in China showed a negative effect on LEB, rather than central heating.

As government incentives are reduced or withdrawn the incorporation of battery storage, to lower building electricity grid imports through increased on-site PV self-consumption, is an option to sustain rooftop PV uptake. This study combines a life cycle assessment approach and discounted cash flow analysis to assess the CO2 and financial impact of adding battery storage to a PV assemblage in the context of future incentive withdrawal, electricity system decarbonisation and changing technology costs. An example non-domestic building in the UK with a 20 kW mono-crystalline silicon PV and lithium-ion battery storage is modelled. With electricity grid decarbonisation in line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the PV and battery system here reduces the building's CO2 emissions by 17% (19tCO2) compared with the grid-only reference over a 30year lifetime. The analysis also highlights that adding battery storage does not necessarily increase C02 savings achieved by PV alone for the building, if grid decarbonisation is considered. PV systems without batteries in the UK are however found to be viable in 2020 without government incentives. For system considered here the battery costs of &lt;£334/kWh available capacity are needed in 2020 for batteries to positively affect the financial performance of PV. The study therefore concludes that UK battery costs have to continue to reduce rapidly, or additional revenue from providing electricity system services is needed to make batteries financially attractive in lower insolation areas like the UK. Policy to reduce electricity system CO2 through building integrated battery uptake requires better understanding of the net system CO2 impact in line with other changes in electricity generation and demand. © 2017 The Authors","Battery storage; Financial analysis; Life cycle assessment; Organisational barriers; PV","Buildings; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Finance; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Monocrystalline silicon; Battery storage; Climate Change Agreements; Electricity generation; Financial analysis; Financial performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Non-domestic buildings; Organisational; Lithium-ion batteries",2-s2.0-85029684769

In addition, with the challenges and competitions existing in Indian manufacturing system, domestic tyre manufacturers are struggling for their competitive sustenance. This situation is particularly severe in the radial tyre manufacturing unit, which involves very complex manufacturing process, thereby increasing the volume of wasteful activities. Therefore, tyre manufacturing units are struggling for both their economic and environmental sustainability. Using the well accepted lean manufacturing principles, this paper investigates the processes and the associated wastes of radial tyre manufacturing. The paper presents a novel approach for assessing the wastes using a system dynamics model and validates the model in a radial tyre manufacturing case organisation in India. Scenario analysis by varying the level of employee skills, manpower availability, and machine availability is conducted. The model in addition to showing the overall performance of the radial tyre manufacturing unit assessed, throws light on the amount of greenness attainable by the organisation through the implementation of lean thinking.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12/15-LOX inhibitor, LOXBlock-1(LB1), in mice using a FeCl3-induced permanent distal MCAO model and FeCl3-induced ischemia/thrombolysis with tPA. In order to induce permanent distal MCAO, 30% FeCl3 was used in C57BL6 mice. LB1 or DMSO treatments were applied intraperitoneally 2 h following MCAO. For FeCl3-induced ischemia/thrombolysis experiments, 10% FeCl3 was preferred so as to obtain reperfusion with tPA in CD1 mice. 4 h following ischemia either LB1 or DMSO and iv tPA was administered. Outcomes were NSS, weight loss, infarct volume, hemorrhage area and reperfusion rate. FeCl3-induced distal MCAO caused an increase in 12/15-LOX signal in the ischemic cortex with an increase in MDA2 and AIF immunoreactivity. LB1 treatment, applied 2 h after ischemia, significantly decreased the infarct volume at 24 h of permanent distal MCAO. Weight loss was also significantly reduced in LB1 treated group. Distal MCAO and tPA application with LB1 or DMSO showed that treatment significantly decreased the infarct volume and the hemorrhage area. The reperfusion rate in the LB1-treated group was surprisingly higher than in the DMSO group and NSS results were significantly improved. These data suggest that LB1 can be used as an adjuvant agent to tPA.

Descriptive empirical data examining alcohol behaviors among trans adults is limited. The present study investigates alcohol behaviors – quantity, frequency, alcohol-related problems, and drinking to cope motives – across sex assigned at birth, gender expression, and gender identity subgroups within a sample of trans adults. Method A total of 317 trans participants were recruited to complete a cross-sectional battery of online measures assessing alcohol use behaviors, alcohol-related problems, and drinking to cope. Gender identity was assessed through two methods: (1) an open-ended question in which participants wrote-in their primary gender identity; and (2) participants rated the extent to which they identified with 14 gender identity categories. Results This sample had high rates of alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, and drinking to cope motives relative to the general population. Significant and meaningful differences in drinking frequency, alcohol-related problems and drinking motives were found according to gender expression, but not sex assigned at birth or gender identity.

Those needs far exceeded the damaged state of local health care facilities. The nationwide disaster medical system established after GHAE worked fully for the first time, but further improvements of the response system, such as implementation of a disaster medical and public health coordinator, more efficient emergency medical information systems, and the establishment of specialized health care assistance teams including psychiatry, rehabilitation, reproductive health, public health, and oral care, were found to be necessary after GEJE.

It reduces the negative influence of used tires on the environment as well as natural resources exploitation. According to the latest data, 4.7 million units of used truck tires were retreaded in 2014 in Europe. This paper proposes an interval-parameter chance-constrained programming model for uncertainty-based decision making in tire retreading industry. A case study is conducted in order to demonstrate its potentials and applicability. When constraints violation level increases (0.01, 0.05 and 0.10), the system profit obtained in the analyzed nine-year planning horizon correspondingly raises (€[35.08, 82.03] × 106, €[38.94, 90.78] × 106 and €[40.87, 95.16] × 106 respectively). The uncertainty degree of the objective function under three considered system violation levels is around 80%, which demonstrates that used tires retreading management systems are highly uncertain. Profit per tonne of processed used tires is in €[1594.64, 3730.84] interval. The developed model can efficiently handle uncertainties expressed as interval values and probability distributions. It can address multiple interrelationships among numerous components of used tires retreading management systems. The proposed model can examine various admissible risk levels of violating retreading capacities. It can provide a trade-off between economic efficiency of tires retreading management systems and capacity constraints violations. Compared with the conventional chance-constrained programming approach, the formulated model can incorporate much more uncertain information. The presented model can provide valuable support for tire retreading managers in avoiding inferior or simply wrong decisions. In fact, it can help tire retreading managers optimize long-term purchasing, retreading and inventory planning schemes, and allocation patterns of retreaded, reusable and end-of-life tires under multiple uncertainties. The proposed model can be extended to other environmental problems related to part worn or worn-out products. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Chance-constrained programming; Interval-parameter programming; Management; Retreading; Uncertainty; Used tires","Computer programming; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Management; Managers; Probability distributions; Profitability; Tires; Trucks; Capacity constraints; Chance-constrained programming; Chance-constrained programming model; Environmental problems; Interval parameter; Uncertain informations; Uncertainty; Used tires; Retreading",2-s2.0-85005917613

Apart from the economic valuation of the direct and indirect benefits of biodiversity, people place existence values on biodiversity, i.e. they consider the existence of particular species, regardless of the services they provide. There is also a general recognition that species diversity indicates the status of the ecosystem or community, and thus the quality of the living environment; hence, both at academic and institutional level, there is a lively discussion about how to properly measure and monitor biodiversity. Although many candidates have been proposed, nowadays, no scientific consensus measure exists, and this is mainly due to three motivations: the large number of properties that an indicator of biodiversity should meet, the definition of biodiversity, and the specific interests of policymakers or stakeholders that indicators should satisfy. Because most existing indices neglect the multivariate nature of biodiversity, we address this drawback by proposing a functional approach to Hill's numbers for assessing changes in species variety of ecological communities over time. New functional tools are developed, both analytical and graphical: we present “the biodiversity surface”, “the volume under the biodiversity surface”, and some indicators which have been derived from them. This functional multivariate approach provides additional tools to the existing biodiversity monitoring techniques, and allows us to address biodiversity by considering both richness and evenness, and all of their possible shades. The goal of this research is to provide policymakers, stakeholders, and scholars with additional tools for improving the understanding of biodiversity dynamics within ecological communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity indicators; Biodiversity monitoring; Biodiversity surface; Biodiversity trend; Functional data analysis; Variety","Ecology; Ecosystems; Biodiversity indicators; Biodiversity monitoring; Ecosystem functions; Functional approach; Functional data analysis; Living environment; Multivariate approach; Variety; Biodiversity; Animalia; Fungi",2-s2.0-85028360462

Legislation in the US and the EU prohibits firms from engaging in corrupt practices in foreign countries and this suggests that foreign-owned firms might be less likely to pay bribes. However, such legislation may be ineffective because foreign firms have to adapt to local market conditions or risk being uncompetitive. Using firm-level data for 41 emerging countries, a probit model estimates the probability that a firm pays bribes. To allow for possible endogeneity this probit analysis is repeated with an instrument to proxy for endogenous foreign ownership. Then, a propensity score matching technique tests for differences in the propensity to pay bribes by domestic and foreign firms. The paper finds no difference in the behavior of foreign-owned and domestic firms with respect to corrupt practices. Results are robust to different levels of foreign ownership and support the view that foreign-owned firms adapt to local practices and are neither more nor less likely to pay bribes than comparable domestic firms. The paper finds that other variables including bureaucracy, government contracts, and perceived difficulties with civil society (legal and political) do have statistically significant effects on increasing bribery and that some others, such as per capita GDP, tend to reduce bribery. The study concludes that there is no evidence that foreign ownership, after investment has occurred, tends to reduce bribery but it does support the view that foreign-owned firms adopt local behavioral norms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","corruption; emerging markets; inward FDI; propensity score matching",,2-s2.0-85032266581

ESOMs cover the full life-cycle of fuels from extraction to end-use, including the associated direct emissions. Nevertheless, the life-cycle emissions of energy equipment and infrastructure are not modelled explicitly. This prevents analysis of questions relating to the relative importance of emissions associated with the build-up of infrastructure and other equipment required for decarbonization. We have soft-linked an environmentally-extended input-output (EEIO) model to a European TIMES Model (ETM-UCL) with the aim of addressing the following questions: - In what ways does the inclusion of indirect emissions change the optimal technology pathway for decarbonizing the European energy system?- How much does the present value of key low-carbon technologies change when indirect emissions are accounted for in a decarbonization scenario for Europe?We show that, although indirect emissions are a relatively small portion of overall power sector emissions (<10% in 2050), including them in the model leads to changes in the optimal power sector portfolio. Renewable energy technologies become relatively less attractive once indirect emissions are included within the optimization framework, and we quantify this effect, showing that it is not large. Changes to the relative attractiveness of specific renewable energy technologies are more pronounced than the reduction in attractiveness of renewable energy as a whole: in our main scenarios wind energy saw increased relative deployment in 2050 when indirect emissions are accounted for, since it displaced other technologies with higher life-cycle emissions (notably solar PV). Optimal cumulative installed capacity of PV in the EU 2050 is at least 7% lower when indirect emissions are included. We conclude that policy advice derived from ESOMs that focuses on the roles of specific technologies should ensure that it is robust to the possible effects of indirect emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consequential LCA; Energy policy; Energy system modelling; Life cycle assessment; TIMES model","Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Energy policy; Global warming; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Carbon dioxide emissions; Consequential LCA; Energy system modelling; Energy system optimizations; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-carbon technologies; Renewable energy technologies; TIMES modeling; Life cycle",2-s2.0-85031923658

Considering the connections between the indefinite and total least squares problems, we derive the (structured) partial condition numbers for the latter, which generalize the ones in the literature.

Our main aim is to study inferential processes, like the Bayesian one, when the information is expressed in natural language and the uncertainty measure is either partially or imprecisely assessed. We deal with partial assessments consistent with a conditional plausibility, and adopt the interpretation of the membership of a fuzzy set in terms of coherent conditional plausibility, regarded as a function of the conditioning events. This kind of interpretation, inspired to that given in terms of coherent conditional probability, is particularly useful for computing the measure of the uncertainty of fuzzy events, when the knowledge on the variable is imprecise and can be managed with a non-additive measure of uncertainty. A simple situation related to a Zadeh’s example can be the following: a ball will be drawn from an urn containing balls of different colours and different diameters, but one knows only the distribution of the different colours.

The optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithms for POBDS state estimation, namely, the Boolean Kalman filter (BKF) and Boolean Kalman smoother (BKS), are intractable in the case of large systems, due to computational and memory requirements. To address this, we introduce approximate MMSE filtering and smoothing algorithms based on the auxiliary particle filter (APF) method, which are called APF–BKF and APF–BKS, respectively. For joint state and parameter estimation, the APF–BKF is used jointly with maximum-likelihood (ML) methods for simultaneous state and parameter estimation in POBDS models. In the case the unknown parameters are discrete, the proposed ML adaptive filter consists of multiple APF–BKFs running in parallel, in a manner reminiscent of the Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) method in classical linear filtering theory. In the presence of continuous parameters, the proposed ML adaptive filter is based on an efficient particle-based expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the POBDS model, which is based on a modified Forward Filter Backward Simulation (FFBSi) in combination with the APF–BKS. The performance of the proposed particle-based adaptive filters is assessed through numerical experiments using a POBDS model of the well-known cell cycle gene regulatory network observed through noisy RNA-Seq time series data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive filtering; Auxiliary particle-filter; Boolean Kalman Filter; Expectation maximization; Fixed-interval smoother; Gene regulatory networks; Maximum-likelihood estimation; Partially-observed Boolean dynamical systems; RNA-seq data","Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Adaptive systems; Bandpass filters; Computation theory; Distributed computer systems; Dynamical systems; Genes; Kalman filters; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Maximum principle; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; RNA; Silicon compounds; Auxiliary particle filter; Boolean dynamical systems; Expectation - maximizations; Fixed interval smoother; Gene regulatory networks; RNA-Seq datum; Parameter estimation",2-s2.0-85032226792

The potentiometric profiles recorded showed that intra- and inter-day signal drifts could be neglected (i.e., relative standard deviations lower than 25%), being not statistically significant the effect of the analysis day on the overall recorded E-tongue sensor fingerprints (P-value = 0.5715, for multivariate analysis of variance using Pillai's trace test), which significantly differ according to the olive oils’ sensory defect (P-value = 0.0084, for multivariate analysis of variance using Pillai's trace test). Thus, a linear discriminant model based on 19 potentiometric signal sensors, selected by the simulated annealing algorithm, could be established to correctly predict the olive oil main sensory defect (fusty, rancid, wet-wood or winey-vinegary) with average sensitivity of 75±3% and specificity of 73±4% (repeated K-fold cross-validation variant: 4 folds×10 repeats). Similarly, a linear discriminant model, based on 24 selected sensors, correctly classified 92±3% of the olive oils as virgin or lampante, being an average specificity of 93±3% achieved. The overall satisfactory predictive performances strengthen the feasibility of the developed taste sensor device as a complementary methodology for olive oils’ defects analysis and subsequent quality grade classification. Furthermore, the capability of identifying the type of sensory defect of an olive oil may allow establishing helpful insights regarding bad practices of olives or olive oils production, harvesting, transport and storage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Chemometrics; Olive oil; Potentiometric electronic tongue; Sensory analysis; Sensory defects","Defects; Electronic tongues; Multivariant analysis; Olive oil; Potentiometers (electric measuring instruments); Quality control; Sensory perception; Simulated annealing; Chemometrics; K fold cross validations; Linear discriminant model; Multivariate analysis of variances; Potentiometric electronic tongue; Predictive performance; Relative standard deviations; Simulated annealing algorithms; Sensory analysis",2-s2.0-85028578332

Understanding the psychological processes underlying unhealthy eating behaviour is crucial for the development of effective obesity prevention programmes. Dual-process models implicate the interplay between impaired cognitive control and enhanced automatic responsivity to rewarding food cues as key risk factors. The current study assessed the influence of four different components of trait impulsivity (reflecting impaired cognitive control) and automatic approach bias for food (reflecting automatic responsivity to food) on uncontrolled eating in a large sample (N = 504) of young adolescents. Of the four impulsivity factors, negative urgency was found to be the strongest predictor of uncontrolled eating. Interestingly, we found that lack of premeditation was a key risk factor for uncontrolled eating, but only when approach bias for food was high, supporting a dual-process model. Lack of perseverance showed a similar interactive pattern to a lesser degree and sensation-seeking did not predict uncontrolled eating. Together, our results show that distinct components of trait impulsivity are differentially associated with uncontrolled eating behaviour in adolescents, and that automatic processing of food cues may be an important factor in modulating this relationship. © 2017 The Authors","Adolescents; Dual-process; Food-bias; Impulsivity; Obesity; Uncontrolled-eating","adolescent; Article; association; eating; executive function; feeding behavior; female; food intake; human; human experiment; impulsiveness; male; meditation; obesity; reward; risk factor",2-s2.0-85032290113

Recognizing the financial and environmental burden of diesel generation and risk of energy security, the government of Cape Verde has launched an ambitious goal of 50% electricity from renewables by 2020, since the country is endowed with high potential of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar. Although the annual average penetration rate of wind power has reached 24% of total electricity production generated in Cape Verde, raising the wind energy penetration level in future will pose numerous challenges for the operation and control of the power system because of wind's inherent intermittency and unpredictability. In this study, a statistical analysis of the wind characteristics in Santiago island, is presented by using historical wind speed and power data of the Santiago wind farm in 2014. A two-parameter Weibull distribution is first applied to model the wind speeds on various timescales and to determine wind energy potential in Santiago island, Cape Verde. The annual average wind speed was 8.57 m/s with a standard deviation close to 3.29 m/s. The monthly Weibull scale parameters varied from 5.64 m/s to 13.7 m/s, while the monthly Weibull shape parameters varied from 1.97 to 9.13. Although the monthly mean power density of the rainy season from August to September was low, the annual mean power density shows that Santiago has good wind potential. Then, an approach to modeling the equivalent power curve based on available wind speed and power output data from the wind farm is proposed. By utilizing the estimated power curve, the uncertainty set of wind power generation, resulted from the uncertainty of wind speed forecast, can be obtained to quantify the power system reserve requirements. A statistical analysis of wind power ramp is also given for estimating the power capacity requirement of the energy storage system that can be considered as a reasonable way to mitigate the wind intermittency and minimize curtailment of wind. Results of this study contribute to assess the wind energy potential of Cape Verde for investors, and can be used to quantify the uncertainties of wind power generation for the power system operator. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Statistical analysis; Uncertainty set; Wind characteristics; Wind energy potential assessment; Wind power curve; Wind ramp","Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy security; Renewable energy resources; Speed; Statistical methods; Uncertainty analysis; Weibull distribution; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Annual average wind speed; Energy characteristics; Energy storage systems; Power curves; Power system operators; Uncertainty set; Weibull scale parameters; Wind characteristics; Electric power system control; assessment method; electricity supply; power generation; statistical analysis; uncertainty analysis; Weibull theory; wind farm; wind power; wind velocity; Cape Verde [Macaronesia]; Sao Tiago",2-s2.0-85028577857

The scope for sustainable intensification in crop sciences can be assessed through yield gap analysis, using crop growth models based on concepts of production ecology. Recently, an analogous cattle production model named LiGAPS-Beef (Livestock simulator for Generic analysis of Animal Production Systems – Beef cattle) was developed, which allows yield gap analysis in beef production systems. This paper is the first to assess yield gaps of integrated feed-crop livestock systems, to analyse underlying causes of yield gaps, and to identify feasible improvement options. We used grass-based beef production in the Charolais area of France as a case study. To this end, we combined LiGAPS-Beef with crop growth models that simulate grass production (fresh grass under grazing, grass silage, hay) and wheat production (concentrate). Feed crop and cattle production were integrated to simulate potential and resource-limited live weight (LW) production per hectare. Potential production is defined as the theoretical maximum LW production per ha, in the absence of resource or management limitations. Resource-limited production is determined by availability of one or several resources: water and nutrients for crops, and feed quality and quantity for animals. Potential production of a cattle herd with an ad libitum diet of grass silage was 2380 kg LW ha− 1 year− 1 and resource-limited production was 664 kg LW ha− 1 year− 1. Actual LW production (354 kg LW ha− 1 year− 1) was 15% of the potential production, implying a relative yield gap of 85%, and 53% of the resource-limited production, implying a relative yield gap of 47%. Applying yield gap analysis disentangled the major biophysical causes of these yield gaps: feeding diets other than the ad libitum grass silage diet, water-limitation in feed crops, and sub-optimal management. These yield gaps suggest scope to intensify beef production. We demonstrate, however, that yield gap mitigation decreased the operational profit per kg LW under the European regulations for bovine and grassland premiums operational in 2014. Hence, as expected, the premiums aiming to support farmers' income and to promote sustainable agriculture and rural development were not conducive to narrow yield gaps at the same time. The current common agricultural policy (CAP, 2015–2020) provides more scope for intensification, such as increasing stocking density via better grassland management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Grass growth model; Production ecology; Yield gap mitigation","agricultural development; alternative agriculture; cattle; Common Agricultural Policy; crop production; grass; grassland; livestock farming; management practice; mixed farming; resource availability; rural development; silage; stocking density; yield response; Bourgogne; Charolais; France; France; Saone et Loire; Animalia; Bos; Bovinae; Triticum aestivum",2-s2.0-85031129484

Moreover, a triangulation of the surface into regular shaped elements is not required. The background mesh is an octree grid with cubic cells. As an example of an application, we consider the modeling of contaminant transport in fractured porous media. One standard model leads to a coupled system of advection–diffusion equations in a bulk (matrix) and along a surface (fracture). A series of numerical experiments with both steady and unsteady problems and different embedded geometries illustrate the numerical properties of the hybrid approach.

We collected daily concentrations of NOx; particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 μm (PM10), 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and 1 μm (PM1); particle number concentration (N); black carbon (BC) and CO from research and official monitoring stations. We fitted linear regression models for each pollutant with the strike indicator as an independent variable, and models were adjusted for day of the week, month, year, and holiday periods. During the study period, there were 208 days affected by a strike of the metro (28), train (106) or bus (91) systems. Half of the strikes were partial, most of them were single-day strikes, there was little overlap between strikes of the different transport systems, and all strikes had to comply with mandatory minimal services. When pooling all types of strikes, NOx and BC showed higher levels during strike days in comparison with non-strike days (increase between 4.1% and 7.7%, with higher increases for NO). The increases in these concentrations were more evident during full day and multiday metro strikes. In conclusion, alterations in public transport have consequences on air quality.

The average social protection program increases the value of food consumed/expenditure by 13% and caloric acquisition by 8%. Food expenditure rises faster than caloric acquisition because households use transfers to improve the quality of their diet, most notably increasing their consumption of calories from animal source foods. Since the consumption of animal source foods in these populations is low, and because there are significant nutritional benefits to increasing the consumption of these, this is a positive outcome.

This paper reports the findings from an education intervention designed to increase midwifery students' confidence in working with pregnant women who disclose domestic violence. An authentic practice video and associated interactive workshop was developed to bring the ‘woman’ into the classroom and to provide role-modelling of exemplary midwifery practice in screening for and responding to disclosure of domestic violence. The findings demonstrated that students' confidence increased in a number of target areas, such as responding appropriately to disclosure and assisting women with access to support. Students' confidence increased in areas where responses needed to be individualised as opposed to being able to be scripted. Students appreciated visual demonstration (video of authentic practice) and having the opportunity to practise responding to disclosures through experiential learning. Given the general lack of confidence reported by both midwives and students of midwifery in this area of practice, this strategy may be useful in supporting midwives, students and other health professionals in increasing confidence in working with women who are experiencing domestic violence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Domestic violence; Education; Educational activities; Interactive tutorial; Midwifery; Nursing",,2-s2.0-85029473107

This study aimed to examine the prevalence and correlates of recent medical and non-medical cannabis use among this important US sub-population. Method Data came from the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted that were weighted to account for the complex survey design. Results Approximately 9% of Veterans in the US reported past year cannabis use. Older, and female, Veterans had lower odds of past year cannabis use. Veterans who were unmarried, out of the work force, had greater functioning disability, nicotine dependence, heavy episodic alcohol use, alcohol use disorder, and drug use had greater odds of past year cannabis use. In states where medical cannabis was legal in 2014, approximately 41% of Veterans who used cannabis in the past year used medically. Those who used medically were older and less likely to engage in recent heavy episodic drinking or to meet criteria for alcohol abuse/dependence, compared to Veterans using non-medically. Conclusion Compared to non-Veterans in the US general population, recent cannabis use was similar or slightly lower among Veterans. However, among those with past year use, the proportion of those using medically was more than double that of the general population. Because only non-medical cannabis use was associated with higher rates of heavy episodic alcohol use and alcohol use disorder, it may be important to address problematic alcohol consumption among this high-risk group. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cannabis; Marijuana; Medical; Non-medical; Veterans",,2-s2.0-85028434675

We analyse basic mathematical properties of the considered model such as existence and uniqueness of the solutions. Next, we discuss the existence of the stationary solutions and analytically investigate their stability depending on the forms of considered probability densities that is: Erlang, triangular and uniform probability densities separated or not from zero. Particular instability results are obtained for a general type of probability densities. Our results are compared with those for the model with discrete delays know from the literature. In addition, for each considered type of probability density, the model is fitted to the experimental data for the mice B-cell lymphoma showing mean square errors at the same comparable level. For estimated sets of parameters we discuss possibility of stabilisation of the tumour dormant steady state. Instability of this steady state results in uncontrolled tumour growth. In order to perform numerical simulation, following the idea of linear chain trick, we derive numerical procedures that allow us to solve systems with considered probability densities using standard algorithm for ordinary differential equations or differential equations with discrete delays. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed delays; Estimation of parameters; Hopf bifurcation; Tumour-immune system interactions","Cells; Cytology; Differential equations; Estimation; Hopf bifurcation; Immune system; Mean square error; Parameter estimation; Probability; Probability density function; Time delay; Tumors; Distributed delays; Distributed time delays; Estimation of parameters; Existence and uniqueness; Mathematical properties; Numerical procedures; Probability densities; System interactions; Ordinary differential equations",2-s2.0-85020709369

It is an iterative algorithm on quadratic optimization to generate a better characteristic matrix. During the process, the iMIC can quickly find out the local optimal value while using a lower number of iterations. It produces results that are close to the true MIC values by searching just n times, rather than n2 computations required for the previous method. In the compared experiments of 169 indexes about 202 countries from World Health Organization (WHO) data set, the proposed algorithm offers a better solution coupled with a reasonable run-time for MIC, and good performance search for the extreme values in fewer iterations.

Prior techniques to automate fraud detection rely on a priori rules or specialized learned models associated with the customer. Mostly, these techniques do not consider fraud sequences or changing behavior, which can lead to false alarms. This study demonstrates how a transaction model can be dynamically created and updated, and fraud can be automatically detected for prepaid cards. A card processing company creates models of the store terminals rather than the customers, in part, because of the anonymous nature of prepaid cards. The technique automatically creates, updates, and compares hidden Markov models (HMM) of merchant terminals. We present fraud detection and experiments on real transactional data, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the approach. In the fraud test cases, derived from known fraud cases, the technique has a good F-score.

Various tripping techniques were tested, including wires of different diameters and changes in roughness. Experimental measurements were taken on a flat plate in a wind tunnel at a number of locations along the flat plate and at a variety of flow speeds using hot-wire anemometry to measure the boundary layer resulting from each tripping method. The results have demonstrated that to produce a natural turbulent boundary layer using a 2D protuberance, the height of the trip must be less than the undisturbed boundary layer thickness. Using such a trip was shown to reduce the development length of the turbulent boundary layer by approximately 50%. This was shown to hold true for all Reynolds numbers investigated 105 1:5 106.

Every year, the construction of new industrial areas requires thousands of tons of steel pipes, resulting in a high consumption of natural resource of iron and high emission of carbon dioxide. Additionally, the long pipeline will increase the energy consumption for material transportation. Meanwhile, accidents in industrial areas can usually result in serious damage to the local environment. So the optimization of industrial area layout holds great significance for natural resource, energy saving, and environment protection. But up to now, very few papers have been reported to consider the use of pipes and safety simultaneously to optimize the layout in industrial area level. Most works only focus on safety aspects, and the impact of connection is ignored. Accordingly, this paper proposes a methodology to optimize the relative position of each plant, whose objective function consists of piping cost and safety cost. In this paper, despite conventional consideration of material piping, steam piping, which features multiple-branches connected pipeline network, is also considered. For safety issues, it is firstly analyzed by qualitative principles to limit position for some specified plants. Then quantitative analysis, including explosion and toxic release, are optimized simultaneously with connection cost. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the proposed model. Kruskal algorithm and Arrangement & Combination are used to calculate the length of steam piping. Finally, a case study illustrates the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Area layout; Explosion; Mathematical programing; Piping; Toxic gas dispersion","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Dispersions; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Explosions; Genetic algorithms; Industrial emissions; Materials handling; Natural resources; Optimization; Pipelines; Area layout; Environment protection; Material transportation; Mathematical programing; Objective functions; Piping; Surrounding environment; Toxic gas; Accident prevention",2-s2.0-85029685059

Dynamic analysis tools such as tracers have been developed to assist programmers in debugging and optimizing the performance of such systems. However, complex systems can generate huge traces, with billions of events, which are hard to analyze manually. Trace visualization and analysis programs aim to solve this problem. Such software needs fast access to data, which a linear search through the trace cannot provide. Several programs have resorted to stateful analysis to rearrange data into more query friendly structures. In previous work, we suggested modifications to the State History Tree (SHT) data structure to correct its disk and memory usage. While the improved structure, eSHT, made near optimal disk usage and had reduced memory usage, we found that query performance, while twice as fast, exhibited scaling limitations. In this paper, we proposed a new structure using R-Tree techniques to improve query performance. We explain the hybrid scheme and algorithms used to optimize the structure to model the expected behaviour. Finally, we benchmark the data structure on highly parallel traces and on a demanding trace visualization use case. Our results show that the hybrid R-SHT structure retains the eSHT's optimal disk usage properties while providing several orders of magnitude speed up to queries on highly parallel traces. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Data structure; External memory; Stateful analysis; Tracing; Tree","Data structures; Data visualization; Decision trees; Distributed computer systems; Forestry; Program debugging; Visualization; Dynamic analysis tools; External memory; Improved structures; Orders of magnitude; Stateful analysis; Trace visualization; Tracing; Tree; Trees (mathematics)",2-s2.0-85031507778

Traditionally sustainability in supply chains has focused on environmental dimensions, while a few have attempted to focus on social and economic dimensions without really integrating them. There has been only a small effort to define sustainability by integrating all relevant dimensions (a holistic approach). This paper proposes to fill this gap. We identify sustainability of a supply chain with the equilibrium of the system over a long (but finite) period of time after integrating the various dimensions. Thus it necessitates looking at factors that can cause a shift in the equilibrium. Towards this, we propose to build a strong theoretical framework to integrate, explain, and predict sustainability for supply chains using cross-disciplinary effort. In our theoretical framework, evolutionary game theory serves as the pure conceptual theory-building tool, the metrics are qualitative in nature and the indicators are quantitative statistical measures. The use of evolutionary game theory concepts allows us to understand how sometimes trivial actions by members of the supply chain can trigger cascading effects that can move the system away from equilibrium. One of the salient aspects of our model is its complete scalability in terms of changes to the dimensions and metrics. As an example, we explain and predict social and economic sustainability (in tandem) for a public health insurance supply chain using evolutionary game theory. © 2017","Evolutionary game theory; Public health insurance; Supply chain management; Sustainability; Theoretical framework","Health insurance; Public health; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Cascading effects; Cross-disciplinary; Economic sustainability; Evolutionary game theory; Holistic approach; Integrated approach; Statistical measures; Theoretical framework; Game theory",2-s2.0-85010952468

Consequently, major failures in wind turbines are expensive to repair and cause losses of revenue due to long down times. Asset management using optimal maintenance strategies can aid in improving the reliability and the availability of wind turbines, thereby making them more competitive. Various mathematical optimization models for maintenance scheduling have been developed for application with wind turbines. Typically, these models provide either an age based or a condition based preventive maintenance schedule. This paper proposes a wind turbine maintenance management framework which utilizes operation and maintenance data from different sources to combine the benefits of age based and condition based maintenance scheduling. A mathematical model called Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem with Interval Costs (PMSPIC) is presented with modification for the maintenance optimization considering both age based and condition based failure rate models. The application of the maintenance management framework is demonstrated with case studies which illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network (ANN); Condition monitoring system (CMS); Maintenance scheduling; mathematical optimization model; Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA); Wind turbine","Condition monitoring; Data acquisition; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Maintenance; Neural networks; Optimization; Scheduling; Wind turbines; Condition monitoring systems; Condition-based maintenance scheduling; Environmental conditions; Maintenance scheduling; Maintenance scheduling problem; Mathematical optimization model; Operation and maintenance; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Preventive maintenance; artificial neural network; data acquisition; environmental conditions; maintenance; management practice; monitoring system; numerical model; optimization; wind turbine",2-s2.0-85028722391

Denoising is an important issue that has been frequently discussed in recent years. In this paper, an interesting phenomenon is found that the directional information is abundant in MR images. Therefore, high-quality reconstructed MR images could be obtained if the related directional information is considered. To address the issue, the directional extension for the undecimated wavelet transform (DEUWT), an effective tool that is able to handle the directional information and provides the translation-invariant (TI) property as well, is employed to process MR images. Based on the DEUWT, we present a novel and fast wavelet domain complex data denoising algorithm for MR images. In the presented algorithm, we combine the DEUWT with the stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE) thresholding, and treat the real and imaginary components of the MR image as a single complex entity. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both simulated complex images and complex phantoms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Complex denoising; DEUWT; Magnetic resonance imaging; Translation-invariant; Wavelet transform","Image denoising; Image processing; Magnetic resonance imaging; De-noising; DEUWT; Directional information; Real and imaginary; State-of-the-art methods; Stein's unbiased risk estimators (SURE); Translation invariants; Undecimated wavelet transform; Wavelet transforms",2-s2.0-85027889260

If a Bayes classifier is to be used, then reduction to a dimensionality of K−1 is necessary and sufficient to preserve the classification information in the original feature space for the K-class problem. However, most of the existing algorithms provide no optimal dimensionality to which to reduce the data, thus classification information can be lost in the reduced space if K−1 dimensions are used. In this paper, we present a novel LDR technique to reduce the dimensionality of the original data to K−1, such that it is well-primed for Bayesian classification. This is done by sequentially constructing linear classifiers that minimise the Bayes error via a gradient descent procedure, under an assumption of normality. We experimentally validate the proposed algorithm on 10 UCI datasets. Our algorithm is shown to be superior in terms of the classification accuracy when compared to existing algorithms including LDR based on Fisher's criterion and the Chernoff criterion. The applicability of our algorithm is then demonstrated by employing it in diagnosing the health states of 2 ultrasonic flow meters. As with the UCI datasets, the proposed algorithm is found to have superior performance to the existing algorithms, achieving classification accuracies of 99.4% and 97.5% on the two flow meters. Such high classification accuracies on the flow meters promise significant cost benefits in oil and gas operations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bayes error; Flow meter diagnostics; Heteroscedasticity; LDA; Linear dimensionality reduction","Data reduction; Errors; Flow measurement; Flow visualization; Flowmeters; Regression analysis; Ultrasonic applications; Accuracy of classifications; Bayes error; Bayesian classification; Classification accuracy; Classification informations; Heteroscedasticity; Linear dimensionality reduction; Supervised linear dimensionality reduction; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85029290265

Our proposal is the CADMIACA model based on the theories of the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM), other motivational and interpersonal ones (MI) and the Action Competence Approach (ACA). Additionally, this model contains a broad range of control conditions to be considered in the general definition of the determinants of green behavior such as global warming, energy savings, recycling, green purchasing, and pollution. The data were collected in the A Coruna metropolitan area (Spain) in order to analyze empirically the causal relationship among those variables included in the model by using structural equation methodology (SEM). Findings confirm that environmental education reveals as a powerful tool in order to generate green behavior among citizens. Moreover, the comprehensive CADMIACA model proposed appears to be a good fit with the data since all the factors included in this model (intrapersonal, motivational, interpersonal, and educational) are determining green behavior.

Speech recordings contain acoustic noise from the MRI scanner. The required noise reduction is based on adaptive comb filtering designed for accurate formant extraction. Two kinds of speech materials were used to validate the post-processing algorithm. The primary material consists of samples of prolonged vowel productions during MRI. The comparison data was obtained from the same test subject, and it was recorded in anechoic chamber in a similar configuration as used during the MRI. Spectral envelopes and vowel formants were computed from the post-processed speech and from the comparison data. Vowel samples (with a known formant structure) were artificially contaminated using MRI scanner noise to determine performance of the post-processing algorithm. Resonances computed from a numerical acoustic model and spectra measured from 3D printed vocal tract physical models were used as comparison data. The properties of the recording instrumentation or the post-processing algorithm do not explain the observed frequency dependent discrepancy between the vowel formant data from two kinds of experiments: recordings during MRI and comparison data. It is shown that the discrepancy is statistically significant, in particular, where it is largest at ca. 1 kHz and 2 kHz. Numerical and experimental evidence suggests that the surfaces of the MRI head coil change the acoustics of speech which results in “exterior formants” at these frequencies. The discrepancy is too large to be neglected if the recordings during MRI are to be used for parameter estimation or validation of a numerical speech model, based on the MR images. However, the role of test subject adaptation to noise and constrained space acoustics during an MRI examination cannot be ruled out. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","DSP; Helmholtz; MRI; Noise reduction; Speech","3D printers; Acoustic noise; Audio recordings; Linguistics; Magnetic resonance imaging; Noise abatement; Scanning; Speech enhancement; Speech processing; Constrained space; Experimental evidence; Frequency dependent; Helmholtz; Numerical acoustics; Postprocessing algorithms; Primary materials; Spectral envelopes; Speech; acoustics; adaptation; adult; algorithm; Article; case report; frequency analysis; human; male; noise reduction; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; physical model; post processing algorithm; priority journal; signal processing; speech analysis; vowel",2-s2.0-85026776641

The weighted average EROI for a New Zealand wind energy farm over a 20 year life span is 34.3, with the highest achieving 57.7, while the lowest is 6.5. These values are higher than wind energy farms in Europe and America, which average about 20, and higher than many other electricity generation methods reported in the literature with hydropower being the main exception. The above-average capacity factor of New Zealand wind energy farms is the primary reason for the higher EROI values. The average EROC value for New Zealand's existing wind energy farms is 477 GJ/t CO2-e, which is 56 times the EROC of a combined cycle natural gas power station. The substantial range of EROI values are chiefly driven by two factors: (1) wind speed profile for a given site and (2) the blade diameter of the turbine, where greater values are better.

In the last years, several efforts have been done in order to provide an effective denoising methodology. Although good results have been achieved in terms of noise reduction effectiveness, most of the proposed approaches are not characterized by low computational burden and require the supervision of an external operator for tuning the input parameters. Methods Within this manuscript, a novel approach is investigated, based on Wiener filter. Working in the frequency domain, it is characterized by high computational efficiency. With respect to classical Wiener filter, the proposed Enhanced Wiener filter is able to locally adapt itself by tuning its kernel in order to combine edges and details preservation with effective noise reduction. This characteristic is achieved by implementing a Local Gaussian Markov Random Field for modeling the image. Due to its intrinsic characteristics, the computational burden of the algorithm is sensibly low compared to other widely adopted filters and the parameter tuning effort is minimal, being well suited for quasi real time applications. Results The approach has been tested on both simulated and real datasets, showing interesting performances compared to other state of art methods.

Our main findings are that the overall variation in German excess stock returns mainly reflects revisions in expectations about dividends and that the stock market response to monetary policy shocks is dependent on the prevailing interest rate regime. In periods of negative real interest rates, a surprise monetary tightening leads to a decrease in excess stock returns. The channels behind this response are news about higher expected excess returns and lower future dividends. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Monetary policy shocks; Stock market; Unconventional monetary policy; VAR model; Variance decomposition",,2-s2.0-85030177465

The problem can be rigorously addressed through the optimization of one or more objective functions that represent the managerial goals associated to the network. However, the use of objective functions is based on assumptions that in practical cases can be inaccurate. To overcome this problem, we have developed a retrospective analysis procedure that validates the degree of acceptability of the optimal reduced configuration at a local and global level. The procedure has been applied to a case study in Apulia, Italy, finding that the optimal reduced network was unable to recover the measured values of the monitored parameter of two discarded locations, making it unable to accomplish its monitoring goals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Groundwater monitoring; Kriging; Monitoring network optimization; Retrospective analysis","Groundwater; Effective management; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental resources; Groundwater monitoring; Kriging; Logistics constraints; Monitoring network; Retrospective analysis; Monitoring",2-s2.0-85027398567

The lack of flexibility in terms of shipment quantity and delivery frequency may cause unnecessary inventories and lost sales, which may outweigh the savings in transportation costs. To guide the strategic volume allocation, we examine a modal split transport (MST) policy of two modes that integrates inventory controls.We develop a single-product–single-corridor stochastic MST model with two transport modes considering a hybrid push–pull inventory control policy. The objective is to minimize the long-run expected total costs of transport, inventory holding, and backlogging. The MST model is a generalization of the classical tailored base-surge (TBS) policy known from the dual sourcing literature with non-identical delivery frequencies of the two transport modes. We analytically solve approximate problems and provide closed-form solutions of the modal split. The solution provides an easy-to-implement solution tool for practitioners. The results provide structural insights regarding the tradeoff between transport cost savings and holding cost spending and reveal a high utilization of the slow mode. A numerical performance study shows that our approximation is reasonably accurate, with an error of less than 3% compared to the optimal results. The results also indicate that as much as 85% of the expected volume should be split into the slow mode. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Inventory control; Modal split transport; Stochastic model applications; Tailored base-surge policy","Costs; Inventory control; Railroad transportation; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Transportation; Truck transportation; Closed form solutions; Delivery frequency; Inventory control policies; Modal split; Numerical performance; Stochastic model applications; Structural insights; Transportation cost; Stochastic models",2-s2.0-85019877907

We first consider a single-server multi-stage serial supply chain and find a closed form expression for the fulfilment time distribution. For the multi-server multi-stage problem, the closed form evaluation of the fulfilment time distribution becomes intractable due to the dependency of the lead-times in different stages. We circumvent this difficulty by proposing a novel FCFS discipline which enables a closed-form analysis.

The results suggest that the LUCC was large, with a 76% comprehensive land use dynamic degree. The ecosystem services were clearly varied, and there was a fluctuation in water retention that was mainly caused by LUCC. There were trade-offs between food production and extreme net primary productivity(NPP), wind prevention and sand fixation, and water retention and extreme food production. There were synergistic relationships between NPP, wind prevention and sand fixation, and water retention under three ecosystem services.

The difficulties in learning deep generative or discriminative models can be overcome by an initial unsupervised learning step that maps the inputs to useful intermediate representations.

Auto encoder techniques include Deep Auto encoder (DAE), Stack Auto encoder (SAE), Contractive Auto encoder (CAE), and Denoising Auto encoder (DA). DAE aims to make good representations of data which can be utilized for reconstruction and classification.

These concepts are used to model linguistic and propositional uncertainty – which is inherent to medical knowledge – in a variety of clinical situations. Using these fuzzy methods, we can create medical fuzzy control systems (MFCSs), in which linguistic control rules are used and evaluated in parallel. Their results are aggregated so that gradual transitions between otherwise discrete control states are enabled. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of MFCSs in Fuzzy Arden Syntax.

Despite progress identifying risk factors, limited research has examined how to combine variables into an optimized post-earthquake PTSD prediction tool that could be used to triage survivors to mental health services. The current study developed a post-earthquake PTSD risk score using machine learning methods designed to optimize prediction. The data were from a two-wave survey of Chileans exposed to the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in February 2010. Respondents (n = 23,907) were interviewed roughly three months prior to and again three months after the earthquake. Probable post-earthquake PTSD was assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale. We applied super learning, an ensembling machine learning method, to develop the PTSD risk score from 67 risk factors that could be assessed within one week of earthquake occurrence. The super learner algorithm had better cross-validated performance than the 39 individual algorithms from which it was developed, including conventional logistic regression. The super learner also had a better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.79) than existing post-disaster PTSD risk tools. Individuals in the top 5%, 10%, and 20% of the predicted risk distribution accounted for 17.5%, 32.2%, and 51.4% of all probable cases of PTSD, respectively.

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) demonstrated one factor for this measurement model with poor indices (Chi-square (df) = 55.02(9), p < 0.001). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the single factor and showed a well-adjusted model except for question 5 (Chi-square (df) = 11.443(4), p = 0.022; RMSEA = 0.084; CFI=0.99; GFI = 0.98; AGFI = 0.94), the convergent validity (AVE = 0.55) and reliability values (α = 0.85 /CR = 0.86) were good. In conclusion, the Sleep Health Scale (SHS) is valid and reliable for the assessment of the several sleep health indicators of Portuguese adults. An investigation on the relationship between sleep health and well-being in promoting quality of life with this scale is recommended for future research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adults; Portugal; Sleep Health; Sleep Health Scale; Validation","adult; age; aged; Article; community sample; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; convergent validity; educational status; exploratory factor analysis; female; gender; human; male; measurement; population research; Portuguese (citizen); priority journal; rating scale; reliability; scoring system; Sleep Health Scale; sleep medicine; validation study",2-s2.0-85030845982

In this paper, we present a novel depth based method for gesture recognition to improve the interaction of a service robot autonomous shopping cart, mostly used by reduced mobility people. In the proposed solution, the identification of the user is already implemented by the software present on the robot where a bounding box focusing on the user is extracted. Based on the analysis of the depth histogram, the distance from the user to the robot is calculated and the user is segmented using from the background. Then, a region growing algorithm is applied to delete all other objects in the image. We apply again a threshold technique to the original image, to obtain all the objects in front of the user. Intercepting the threshold based segmentation result with the region growing resulting image, we obtain candidate objects to be arms of the user. By applying a labelling algorithm to obtain each object individually, a Principal Component Analysis is computed to each one to obtain its center and orientation. Using that information, we intercept the silhouette of the arm with a line obtaining the upper point of the interception which indicates the hand position. A Kalman filter is then applied to track the hand and based on state machines to describe gestures (Start, Stop, Pause) we perform gesture recognition.

On the other hand, an overlooked property of d-separation implies that d-separation need only consider the relevant part of a BN. We propose a new method for testing independencies in BNs, called relevant path separation (rp-separation), which explores the intersection between the active and relevant parts of a BN.

Using a straightforward Markov method for reliability assessment is leading to explosion of number of states that should be analyzed. The chapter proposes a method for the estimation of important power system indices such as the availability for specified demand level, the loss of load probability, the expected energy not supplied to consumers etc. This method is based on Lz-transform of discrete-state continuous-time Markov process. The proposed approach is useful for a short-term reliability analysis of power system and operative decisions making. A numerical example is presented as an illustration of the proposed approach. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Available generating capacity; Combine cycle power generating unit; Lz-transform; Multi-state Markov model; Reliability; Universal generating function",,2-s2.0-85027406519

The investment decision making process has two main stages. In the first stage, filters are applied regarding four critical issues: target geography, impact theme, asset class and target return category. In this phase, the set of possible investment alternatives are determined based on their appropriateness for impact investment in terms of those four essential aspects. In a second stage, efficient portfolios are obtained taking into account financial criteria (maximizing expected return, minimizing risk) and trying to maximize the social impact of the portfolio of investments. In this chapter, we will focus on the establishment of the target geography for the impact investment proposing a fuzzy indicator of the appropriateness of a geographic area in terms of impact investment.

During the operation of the system successive exponential failure-free times are followed by generally distributed repair periods. After the processing a job may rejoin the queue (feedback) with probability q or leave the system with probability 1 − q. Applying the analytical approach based on the idea of Markov chain and the formula of total probability, a system of integral equations for the transient queueing delay distribution is built, conditioned by the initial buffer state. Algebraic method based on the idea of Korolyuk’s potential is used to obtain the solution of the corresponding system written for Laplace transforms in a closed form.

A bi-objective optimization model is formulated, in which the first objective is to minimum the total operation cost, and the second objective is to maximum the passenger volume. The proposed model is a nonlinear integer programming, thus a genetic algorithm with self-crossover operation is designed to solve it.
