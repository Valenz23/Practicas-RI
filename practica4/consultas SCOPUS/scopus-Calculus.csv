The nonlocal parameter interpolates between volume and perimeter functionals, and so it can be seen as a fractional counterpart of classical free boundary problems, in which the bulk energy presents nonlocal aspects. The nonlinear term in the energy superposition takes into account the possibility of modeling different regimes in terms of different energy levels and provides a lack of scale invariance, which in turn may cause a structural instability of minimizers that may vary from one scale to another.","Bernoulli’s law; Fractional perimeter; Free boundary problems; Gagliardo norm; Nonlocal minimal surfaces",,2-s2.0-85032455470

Composite materials have complex internal structure and properties, which make them to be more effectual in the solution of special problems required for civil and environmental engineering. As a consequence of this internal heterogeneity, they exhibit complex mechanical properties. In this work, the analysis of some features of the behavior of composite materials under different loading conditions is carried out. The dependence of nonlinear elastic response of composite materials on loading conditions is studied. Several approaches to model elastic nonlinearity such as different stiffness for particular type of loadings and nonlinear shear stressstrain relations are considered. Instead of a set of constant anisotropy coefficients, the anisotropy functions are introduced. Eventually, the combined constitutive relations are proposed to describe simultaneously two types of physical nonlinearities. The first characterizes the nonlinearity of shear stressstrain dependency and the latter determines the stress state susceptibility of material properties. Quite satisfactory correlation between the theoretical dependencies and the results of experimental studies is demonstrated, as described in [2, 3] as well as in the references therein.","Composite materials; Entire solutions; Existence theorems; Fractional elliptic operators; Nonlocal elasticity models",,2-s2.0-85032451011

We should mention that, one of the main methods used to solve these problems in classical calculus is the so-called matched asymptotic expansion method. However we shall note that, this was not achievable via the existing classical definitions of fractional derivative, because they do not obey the chain rule which one of the key elements of the matched asymptotic expansion method. In order to accommodate this method to fractional derivative, we employ a relatively new derivative so-called the local fractional derivative. Using the properties of local fractional derivative, we extend the matched asymptotic expansion method to the scope of fractional calculus and introduce a reliable new algorithm to develop approximate solutions of the singularly perturbed boundary value problems of fractional order. In the new method, the original problem is partitioned into inner and outer solution equations. The reduced equation is solved with suitable boundary conditions which provide the terminal boundary conditions for the boundary layer correction. The inner solution problem is next solved as a solvable boundary value problem. The width of the boundary layer is approximated using appropriate resemblance function. Some theoretical results are established and proved. Some illustrating examples are solved and the results are compared with those of matched asymptotic expansion method and homotopy analysis method to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method. It can be observed that, the proposed method approximates the exact solution very well not only in the boundary layer, but also away from the layer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Boundary layer; Boundary value problem; Local fractional derivative; Matched asymptotic expansion method; Singular perturbation","Asymptotic analysis; Boundary conditions; Boundary layers; Boundary value problems; Calculations; Problem solving; Boundary layer corrections; Fractional derivatives; Homotopy analysis methods; Local fractional derivatives; Matched asymptotic expansion method; Singular perturbations; Singularly perturbed boundary value problems; Terminal boundary conditions; Perturbation techniques",2-s2.0-85029806427

These oscillations display complex dynamics that might be produced by using neuronal models and varying many model parameters. Recent studies have shown that models with fractional order can produce several types of history-dependent neuronal activities without the adjustment of several parameters. We studied the fractional-order Izhikevich model and analyzed different kinds of oscillations that emerge from the fractional dynamics. The model produces a wide range of neuronal spike responses, including regular spiking, fast spiking, intrinsic bursting, mixed mode oscillations, regular bursting and chattering, by adjusting only the fractional order. Both the active and silent phase of the burst increase when the fractional-order model further deviates from the classical model. For smaller fractional order, the model produces memory dependent spiking activity after the pulse signal turned off. This special spiking activity and other properties of the fractional-order model are caused by the memory trace that emerges from the fractional-order dynamics and integrates all the past activities of the neuron. On the network level, the response of the neuronal network shifts from random to scale-free spiking. Our results suggest that the complex dynamics of spiking and bursting can be the result of the long-term dependence and interaction of intracellular and extracellular ionic currents. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fractional-order; Memory; Model; Plasticity","Brain; Complex networks; Data storage equipment; Dynamics; Enzyme activity; Models; Neural networks; Oscillators (mechanical); Plasticity; Cortical neurons; Fractional dynamics; Fractional order; Fractional order models; Long-term dependence; Mixed mode oscillations; Neuronal activities; Neuronal networks; Neurons",2-s2.0-85031315241

Its mean squared displacement (MSD) is not a power law function of time, but instead a logarithmic function, and in some cases grows even more slowly than the logarithmic rate. The distributed-order fractional diffusion equation model simply does not work for the general ultraslow diffusion. Recent study has used the local structural derivative to describe ultraslow diffusion dynamics by using the inverse Mittag–Leffler function as the structural function, in which the MSD is a function of inverse Mittag–Leffler function. In this study, a new stretched logarithmic diffusion law and its underlying non-local structural derivative diffusion model are proposed to characterize the ultraslow diffusion in aging dense colloidal glass at both the short and long waiting times. It is observed that the aging dynamics of dense colloids is a class of the stretched logarithmic ultraslow diffusion processes. Compared with the power, the logarithmic, and the inverse Mittag–Leffler diffusion laws, the stretched logarithmic diffusion law has better precision in fitting the MSD of the colloidal particles at high densities.

While relying exclusively on natural landmarks for that task is the preferred option, their use is somewhat limited because the proposed methods are complex, require high computational power, and are not reliable in all environments. On the other hand, artificial landmarks can be placed in order to alleviate these problems. In particular, square fiducial markers are one of the most popular tools for camera pose estimation due to their high performance and precision. However, the state-of-the-art methods still perform poorly under difficult image conditions, such as camera defocus, motion blur, small scale or non-uniform lighting. This paper proposes a method to robustly detect this type of landmarks under challenging image conditions present in realistic scenarios. To do so, we re-define the marker identification problem as a classification one based on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Second, we propose a procedure to create a training dataset of synthetically generated images affected by several challenging transformations. Third, we show that, in this problem, a classifier can be trained using exclusively synthetic data, performing well in real and challenging conditions.

Finally, the obtained classifiers have been compared to the ArUco and AprilTags fiducial marker systems in challenging video sequences.

The two-phase hydrodynamic focusing has already been shown to be a flexible method of micromixing. In this method, the sample stream composed of solute and solvent is squeezed between two sheath flows of a highly viscous fluid so as to reduce the diffusion path. The main challenge in modeling the associated transport phenomena is the difference between the viscosities and diffusivities of the sample and sheath flows. In this paper, 3D analytical solutions are presented for solute transport in two-phase focusing micromixers, regarding the sample and sheath flows as a single domain of variable physical properties. The model is shown to be able to capture the change of the concentration gradient at the sample/sheath interfaces. The results demonstrate that the mixing length can be reduced significantly by employing more viscous sheath flows while even having more values of efficiency, defined as the ratio of the solutes remaining in the sample flow to the total solutes. Although smaller mixing lengths may also be obtained by increasing the sheath flow rate in single-phase focusing, it is accompanied by sever reductions in efficiency, revealing that the single-phase focusing is not an efficient mixing tool. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hydrodynamic focusing; Mathematical modeling; Microfluidic; Micromixer; Multiphase flow; Transport processes","Boundary layers; Efficiency; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Mathematical models; Microfluidics; Mixers (machinery); Mixing; Multiphase flow; Solute transport; Viscosity; Concentration gradients; Highly viscous fluids; Hydrodynamic focusing; Micro mixers; Micro-fluidic devices; Transport phenomena; Transport process; Variable physical properties; Focusing",2-s2.0-85032471814

Dynamic modeling of PV solar modules is useful when used in switching circuits and grid-connected situations. The dynamic elements of the proposed model are a fractional-order inductor and capacitor of two independent orders which allow for two extra degrees of freedom over the conventional dynamic model. The step response and transfer function of the load current are investigated for different orders under resistive and supercapacitor loading conditions. Closed-form expressions for the time response of the load current at equal orders of capacitor and inductor are derived. Stability analysis of the load current transfer function is carried out for different orders and loading conditions. The regions for pure real and pure imaginary input admittance scenarios are calculated numerically for both resistive and supercapacitor load cases. It is found that the order of the inductor has a dominant effect on the responses. As a proof of concept, the model is fitted to experimental data to show its flexibility in regenerating the actual response.

The viscoelastic models are derived by expanding thermodynamic balance equations for both fractal and non-fractal media. The order of the fractional time derivative is shown to strongly affect the accuracy of the viscoelastic constitutive predictions. Model validation uses experimental data describing viscoelasticity of the dielectric elastomer Very High Bond (VHB) 4910. Since these materials are known for their broad applications in smart structures, it is important to characterize and accurately predict their behavior across a large range of time scales. Whereas integer order viscoelastic models can yield reasonable agreement with data, the model parameters often lack robustness in prediction at different deformation rates. Alternatively, fractional order models of viscoelasticity provide an alternative framework to more accurately quantify complex rate-dependent behavior. Prior research that has considered fractional order viscoelasticity lacks experimental validation and contains limited links between viscoelastic theory and fractional order derivatives. To address these issues, we use fractional order operators to experimentally validate fractional and non-fractional viscoelastic models in elastomeric solids using Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The fractional order model is found to be advantageous as predictions are significantly more accurate than integer order viscoelastic models for deformation rates spanning four orders of magnitude. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fractal media; Fractional order; Parameter estimation; Viscoelasticity","Behavioral research; Deformation; Elastomers; Forecasting; Fractals; Parameter estimation; Uncertainty analysis; Experimental validations; Fractal media; Fractional order; Fractional order derivatives; Fractional order models; Rate-dependent behaviors; Thermodynamic balance; Uncertainty quantifications; Viscoelasticity",2-s2.0-85032822667

It is known that if the domain keeps expanding at a “subsonic” speed, then the associated finite energy decays uniformly. Here, the scenario of interest is when the domain remains bounded and undergoes phases of expansion and contraction. Although the energy identity in this case is not necessarily conservative, it is shown that the L2 space–time norm of the normal trace remains a priori bounded at small normal speeds of the boundary, analogously to the classical Dirichlet wave problem on a static domain. In addition, it is demonstrated that small normal velocity but very large acceleration of the boundary is compatible with the known existence theory, provided the magnitude of the deformations is relatively small.

Our aim is to obtain an averaging principle for such systems with fast–slow Markov switching processes. Under suitable conditions, it is proved that there is a limit process in which the fast changing “noise” is averaged out and the limit is an average with respect to the stationary measure of the fast-varying processes. The limit process, being substantially simpler than that of the original system, can be used to reduce the computational complexity. There are several difficulties in our problems. First, because of the use of fBm, the techniques of martingale problem formulation can no longer be used. Second, there is no strong solution available and the underlying FSPDEs admit only a unique mild solution. Moreover, although the regime-switching enlarges the applicability of the underlying systems, to treat such systems is more difficult.

The proposed linear FFC only requires the output to be regulated of the composite system and none of the internal states of the resulting third-order nonlinear system. The controller is designed on the basis of a drastic simplification of the combined single link-DC motor dynamics to a, perturbed, third-order pure integration system.

An important class of problems of this kind is lexicographic multi-objective problems where the first objective is incomparably more important than the second one which, in its turn, is incomparably more important than the third one, etc. In this paper, Lexicographic Multi-Objective Linear Programming (LMOLP) problems are considered. To tackle them, traditional approaches either require solution of a series of linear programming problems or apply a scalarization of weighted multiple objectives into a single-objective function. The latter approach requires finding a set of weights that guarantees the equivalence of the original problem and the single-objective one and the search of correct weights can be very time consuming. In this work a new approach for solving LMOLP problems using a recently introduced computational methodology allowing one to work numerically with infinities and infinitesimals is proposed. It is shown that a smart application of infinitesimal weights allows one to construct a single-objective problem avoiding the necessity to determine finite weights. The equivalence between the original multi-objective problem and the new single-objective one is proved.

For example, in the case of air and water c≈343m/s and c≈1500m/s respectively, while for seismic P-waves in linear solids we may have c≈6000m/s or higher. These waves can be generated by sources, possible away from the obstacles. We further assume that the dimensions of the obstacles are much smaller than that of the wave velocity, and that the problem transients are not excessively short. For their solution we consider two different approaches. The first directly uses a known space–time boundary integral equation to determine the problem solution. In the second one, after having defined an artificial boundary delimiting the region of computational interest, the above mentioned integral equation is interpreted as a non reflecting boundary condition to be coupled with a classical finite element method. For such problems, we show that in some cases the computational cost and storage, required by the above numerical approaches, can be significantly reduced by taking into account a property that till now has not been considered.

Descriptors inspired in thermodynamic concepts are derived to characterize such three-dimensional curves. The methodology is applied to characterize a sample of 48 human coronary arterial trees and compared with standard geometric descriptors. As an application, the usefulness of the thermodynamic descriptors is tested by assessing statistical associations between arterial shape and diseases. The feature space defined by arterial descriptors is analyzed using multivariate kernel density classification methods. A two-tailed U-test with 95% confidence interval showed that some of the proposed thermodynamic descriptors have different mean values for healthy/diseased left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries.

While the methods removed the noise, the useful structure (such as peripheral vascular) had also been smoothed, the fundamental reason is that the denoising methods cannot efficiently distinguish structural areas from flat areas. In this paper, we have proposed a spatially adaptive image denoising (SAID) method which contains two steps: spatially adaptive gradient descent (SAGD) image denoising and dual-domain filter (DDF). The SAGD denoising method contains the following parts: first of all, the wavelet shrinkage method is used to estimate redundant information which is composed of the noise and useful structures; secondly, according to the characteristic of second order matrix, a spatially adaptive gradient factor (SAGF) has been constructed to distinguish the structure from flat areas; finally, the SAGF replaces the original gradient factor and then the SAGD image denoising method is formed. To further improve the quality of the SAGD image, the SAGD image is re-denoised by a modified DDF which is guided with a rotationally invariant non-local filter (RINLF) in spatial domain and gets structural details by wavelet shrinkage in frequency domain. The results of simulation experiments verify that the proposed SAID method can get well quantitative and qualitative results which are even superior to those using the state-of-the-art denoising methods. Even more, the fluctuation of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value is very small with a small disturbance of SAGF, which illustrates that our algorithm is more robust than the prior progressive image denoising (PID) method. Moreover, the comparison results of the extensive experiments on clinical X-ray cardiovascular angiogram images further illustrate that our method can yield clearer cardiovascular images which can provide more useful vascular information for clinicians to analyze and diagnose the cardiovascular diseases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Gradient factor; Spatially adaptive denoising; Wavelet shrinkage; X-ray cardiovascular angiogram image","Frequency domain analysis; Shrinkage; Signal to noise ratio; Cardio-vascular disease; Gradient factor; Image denoising methods; Peak signal to noise ratio; Spatially adaptive; Structural details; Wavelet shrinkage; X-ray angiogram images; Image denoising; algorithm; angiocardiography; Article; Fourier transformation; image analysis; image quality; mathematical analysis; noise reduction; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; signal noise ratio",2-s2.0-85029812453

However, this representation may produce redundant material phases and the signed distance information is no longer available within the individual material regions. To fix these issues, a new multi-material level set topology optimization method is proposed in this paper, where m level set functions represent m material phases plus the void, and the signed distance information is straightforwardly available in each material phase. To be specific, each level set function corresponds to a material phase and the overlapping areas are filled with an artificial material type, the property of which is weaker than any of the involved material types. This artificial material plays the role of penalizing the overlap areas to vanish, which is different from the close-to-zero property material type for the void. Hence, the optimization process starts with any multi-level set interpolated input and the overlapping areas will gradually vanish. Based on this new method, we have successfully realized the component length scale control on multi-material structures and innovatively, an approach has been proposed to realize the uniform component thickness control without need of pre-specifying the thickness target. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Length scale control; Level set; Multi-material; Topology optimization","Rotational flow; Scale (deposits); Set theory; Shape optimization; Topology; Artificial material; Length scale; Level Set; Multi materials; Multi-material structure; Redundant materials; Structural representation; Topology Optimization Method; Numerical methods",2-s2.0-85032824897

To assess the sustainability performance of sugarcane biofuel production in Brazil, we utilised an extended multi-region input-output (MRIO) matrix to determine the multipliers of carbon emissions, primary energy use, labour, imports and economic stimulus, and their relationship to the Brazilian economic system. Furthermore, we performed a hybrid input-output (IO) life cycle assessment to analyse the triple bottom line (TBL) aspects of sugarcane production in São Paulo state. In particular, we appraised differences between land used for sugarcane or pasture, and between two distinct sugarcane production systems: 1) in which a mill purchases or rents an area and employs its own labourers and machinery (so-called owners), and 2) in which sugarcane is produced and directly sold by farmers to a mill (so-called suppliers). Our results suggest that if areas that were initially used as pasture for cattle are replaced to sugarcane production, energy consumption is increased by a factor of 3.7, employment is reduced by a factor of 5.4 and GHG emissions are reduced to only 2% for every monetary unit (R$) produced. Our assessments concerning Supplier- and Owner-sugarcane producers demonstrate that the total amount of imports required for both scenarios is similar. The owner scenario results in more direct full-time jobs in comparison to the Supplier scenario. For both scenarios, most of the employment is generated by the upstream sectors of their supply chains. Sugarcane production by suppliers uses less energy and produces less GHG emissions than sugarcane produced by owners. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Environment; Land use change; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability",,2-s2.0-85030155591

The purpose of this paper is to show that the strong metric subregularity shares the main features of these two most popular regularity properties and is not less instrumental in applications. We show that the strong metric subregularity of a mapping F acting between metric spaces is stable under perturbations of the form f+F, where f is a function with a small calmness constant. This result is parallel to the Lyusternik–Graves theorem for metric regularity and to the Robinson theorem for strong regularity, where the perturbations are represented by a function f with a small Lipschitz constant. Then we study perturbation stability of the same kind for mappings acting between Banach spaces, where f is not necessarily differentiable but admits a set-valued derivative-like approximation. Strong metric q-subregularity is also considered, where q is a positive real constant appearing as exponent in the definition. Rockafellar's criterion for strong metric subregularity involving injectivity of the graphical derivative is extended to mappings acting in infinite-dimensional spaces. A sufficient condition for strong metric subregularity is established in terms of surjectivity of the Fréchet coderivative, and it is shown by a counterexample that surjectivity of the limiting coderivative is not a sufficient condition for this property, in general. Then various versions of Newton's method for solving generalized equations are considered including inexact and semismooth methods, for which superlinear convergence is shown under strong metric subregularity. As applications to optimization, a characterization of the strong metric subregularity of the KKT mapping is obtained, as well as a radius theorem for the optimality mapping of a nonlinear programming problem.

These conditions improved on previous conditions in the following respects. They provided the first fully non-smooth Pontryagin Maximum Principle for problems involving delays in both state and control variables, only special cases of which were previously available. They provide a strong version of the Weierstrass condition for general problems with possibly non-commensurate control delays, whereas the earlier literature does so only under structural assumptions about the dynamic constraint.

Using a solution that can reduce the cost and time of assessment is very important. Using artificial neural networks in many facilitates operations on data engineering sciences. It is necessary to ensure that a comprehensive study is performed through considering all or most of the parameters affecting the behavior. The aim of this study is to provide an experimental model to estimate the rut depth of asphalt concrete by using viscoelastic parameters and artificial neural networks. Accordingly the asphalt concrete specimens containing 3, 5 and 7 percent void with two types of limestone and siliceous aggregates and PG64-22 and PG58-28 bitumens were made and exposed to dynamic creep tests under 50–60 °C and the stress range of 100–300 kPa. Then the viscoelastic parameters of asphalt specimens were extracted from the creep diagrams and eventually the asphalt concrete's rut depth prediction model was trained and provided by artificial neural network. Comparing the output results with the experimental test results show that by using this model it is possible to estimate the creep behavior and rut depth of asphalt concrete pavements based on the effective parameters without the need for costly and time-consuming tests. © 2017","Artificial neural network; Asphalt concrete; Dynamic creep; Rutting depth; Visco-elastic parameters","Asphalt concrete; Asphalt pavements; Concrete aggregates; Concretes; Consumer behavior; Creep; Elasticity; Neural networks; Viscoelasticity; Comprehensive research; Dynamic creeps; Effective parameters; Experimental modeling; Functional behaviors; Rutting depth; Structural parameter; Visco-elastic parameters; Asphalt",2-s2.0-85032200332

Apatite differs with sediment geology, and soil processes redistribute the P forms. Whether soil apatite loss with soil formation differs in sediment needs further research. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the relationship between soil genesis and the distribution of P fractions in soils formed in different parent materials, and (ii) determine the extent to which apatite loss rate with weathering differs due to parent material. Triplicate profiles for three soils representing sequences of development in loess, alluvium, shale residuum, and sandstone residuum were analyzed for various soil P forms and related parameters at genetic horizon levels. The labile P fractions, secondary phosphates of iron and aluminum, and apatite-P varied with parent materials and soil weathering. Apatite-P decreased exponentially with the sum of iron adsorbed and occluded P in soil, and fit the equation M(Y) = Mo[1-exp.(− λY)] where Mo is initial apatite-P in the sediment, M(Y) is the current apatite-P content in soil, Y is the cumulative iron sorbed P, and -λ, an empirical decrease-rate constant. The apatite loss model fits well for the all soils, except the shale soils that contained lithogenic iron oxides. At the Alfisols development stage, apatite-P loss was 48% in loess, 72% in sandstone and 93% in alluvium out of 1455, 675 and 945 kg ha− 1 per 0.9 m that arrived with the sediments, respectively. Fe-P50, the level of iron sorbed P content in soil, was 55.7 for loess, 46.8 for sandstone, and 20.4 kg ha− 1 per 0.9 m for alluvium, suggest the highest stability of apatite occurred in loess.

We introduce an integral operator with a function-dependent lower limit which is employed as a basic tool to prove the radial positive definiteness of the proposed basis functions and could be of independent interest in the RBF theory. We then show that using the introduced functions as expansion bases in the context of an RBF-based meshless collocation scheme, we could exactly impose the transparent boundary condition accompanying the heat equation. We prove that the condition numbers of the resulting collocation matrices are orders of magnitude less than those arising from other popular RBF families used in current literature.

Online learning has been used to solve the problem, most of which is based on least mean square (LMS). However, it is inefficient to implement the LMS on conventional digital hardware, because of the physical separation between the memory arrays and arithmetic module. To solve this problem, CMOS has been utilized. However, it costs too many powers and areas while designing CMOS synapses in the very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuit. As a novel device, memristor is believed to overcome this shortcoming as memristors could be utilized to store the weights which could be changed by a voltage pulse. The filamentary bipolar memristive switching in Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) has been proved to be an ideal choice for memristive materials. And it has two states—amorphous and crystalline, which can be changed by DC sweep. In this paper, we consider an artificial synapse which includes a GST-memristor and two MOSFET transistors (p-type and n-type). A number of artificial synapses are employed to form a circuit which is expected to consume 2−8% of the area compared to CMOS-only circuit.

While it questions the effectiveness of the traditional approach to risk scoring, the literature provides no alternative satisfying all the criteria stressed by the critics. In fact, different dimensions of uncertainty, along which a risk can be viewed, entail different quantifications. Most previous work, however, concentrates on supposedly all-purpose solutions that are often justified or promoted over others by reasons not necessarily applicable; little information is available on how to best select the needed scoring approach. This research investigates the issues involved in constructing a risk factor formula that is more consistent with the nature of the project and its goals. Major concerns addressed in the literature are organized, serving as a basis to evaluate and improve seven groups of alternative formulas in light of mathematical arguments without which fallacious conclusions-such as the myth that importance is implied by exponents greater than one-would be inferred. These groups are complemented by a multifaceted approach introduced for the first time in this paper, providing the observer with customized information about risks. A robust scoring system founded on these results will ensure that allocated risk factors are neither too high nor too low. Although expressed in the terminology of construction safety, the findings of this research can be extended to other industries that feature some element of uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Construction risk management; Mathematical formulas; Multifaceted information; Risk scoring","Accident prevention; Calculations; Risk management; Construction projects; Construction risk management; Customized information; Mathematical formulas; Multi-faceted approach; Multifaceted information; Risk scoring; Traditional approaches; Risks",2-s2.0-85028076549

Building a model checker directly for a Z specification will take considerable amount of effort and time due to the abstraction of the language. Translating a Z specification input into a specification in a language that an existing model checker tool accepts is an alternative method. Researchers at the University of Sheffield implemented a translation tool, Z2SAL, that takes a Z specification and translates it into the input for Symbolic Analysis Laboratory (SAL), a framework for combining different tools for abstraction, program analysis, theorem proving and model checking. This paper discusses support for model checking Z specifications, in which the capability of Z2SAL is extended. This support includes a translation of a generic constant and a schema calculus definition. Instead of translating these aspects of the Z language into the SAL language as Z2SAL does, a Z specification containing these two notations will be pre-processed, in which a generic constant definition is redefined to an equivalent axiomatic definition and a schema calculus definition is expanded to a new schema definition. As a result of a successful redefinition or expansion, a redefined or expanded Z specification is generated, otherwise the original Z specification is returned. Results show that the large number of our examples can be run successfully by our system. The redefined or expanded Z specification can be translated later by Z2SAL and the generated SAL file can be model checked or simulated by the SAL tool. Results also show that Z2SAL can translate outputs of our system to some extent. The majority of generated SAL files can be run by the SAL tool. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Generic constant; SAL; Schema calculus; Specification; Z; Z2SAL","Abstracting; Calculations; Program translators; Specifications; Translation (languages); Axiomatic definitions; Generic constant; Preprocessing tools; Program analysis; Schema calculus; Symbolic analysis; Translation tools; Z2SAL; Model checking",2-s2.0-85027835140

These might remain in the adult ovary and cannot proliferate in normally because of the inhibitory factors in the ovary, but under appropriate conditions, they can undergo proliferation and be differentiated into oocyte-like cells, and provide a mechanism for the self-renewal of FGSC. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Differentiation; Female germline stem cell; Oocyte-like cells; Oocytes; Oogenesis","Animals; Biomedical engineering; Cells; Cytology; Differentiation (calculus); Germline stem cells; High-efficiency; Oocytes; Oogenesis; Ovarian tissue; Reproductive technologies; Transgenic animals; Undifferentiated cells; Stem cells",2-s2.0-85030857760

First, the space of generalized white noise functionals will be revisited from the viewpoint of an analog (not digital) stochastic calculus, which means the calculus of functions of continuously many independent idealized random variables. Given a system of variables, it is natural to start with polynomials in those variables and to proceed to the space of generalized functions. In our case, those functions are to be generalized white noise functionals. Actual expressions of them are such that having the system of variables to be white noise, the time-derivatives B ={ B(t),t R1 }, the functionals are expressed as φ(B).Those functionals are naturally to be generalized functionals and they form a topological vector space. We then proceed to the analysis of those functionals with the help of the harmonic analysis arising from the infinite dimensional rotation group. In this line, we shall consider some of the new directions to be studied. Namely new noises are taken and the analysis of functionals of the noises will be studied.

The classical way for solving these integrals is by means of elementary Calculus (antiderivatives and limit computations) or using numerical approaches. In both situations different problems can arise. For example: the non-existence of antiderivative, the corresponding limit does not exist or integrals depending on parameters which complicate the use of numerical approaches. In order to solve this situation, Advanced Calculus techniques, such as Laplace or Fourier Transforms and the Residue Theorem can be applied. A brief review of the corresponding theoretical frame is included in this paper. Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) are pieces of software that allow symbolic computations. Nowadays, there are many CAS in the market with an increasing level of sophistication which make them a very powerful tool in Engineering. In this paper, a brief review on the history of CAS evolution is introduced. In this work, some Advanced Calculus techniques for computing improper integrals of the first kind which cannot be solved with standard procedures are described. These techniques could be easily integrated in almost every CAS. However, we have detected some lacks of these techniques in many widely used CAS. In this paper, some tests involving improper integrals have been developed. These tests have been used to check the capabilities of some CAS and the results have provided a classification of the CAS with respect to this field. One of the main contributions in this work is the generation of different rules to compute improper integrals of the first kind. The rules have been classified in specific rules (those coming from the tests) and general rules (those coming from theoretical frames and generalizations of the specific rules). These rules are easy to include in a CAS increasing the facilities of the CAS in the field of improper integral computation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","CAS; Improper integrals; Integration rules","Calcium; Computation theory; Fourier transforms; Laplace transforms; Anti-derivatives; Engineering applications; Improper integrals; Integration rule; Numerical approaches; Standard procedures; Symbolic computation; Unbounded domain; Calculations",2-s2.0-85009354791

Moreover, indeed, an effective fast calculus in OFN arithmetic has lost some of its reliability due to those shapes, which was indicated by the critics. First the authors presented the definition for the adoption of an order by the created OFN number, which has a significant impact on the results of the calculations.

This is a very unusual phenomenon, because for most other computations, better algorithms have been invented – even division is performed, in the computer, by an algorithm which is much more efficient that division methods that we have all learned in school. What is the explanation for the success of the Babylonians’ method? One explanation is that this is, in effect, Newton’s method, based on the best ideas from calculus. This explanations works well from the mathematical viewpoint – it explains why this method is so efficient, but since the Babylonians were very far from calculus, it does not explain why this method was invented in the first place.

Extreme value analysis reveals that, compared to NYC, Shanghai faces a significantly higher flood hazard. Flood inundation analysis indicates that Shanghai has a higher exposure to extreme flooding. Meanwhile, Shanghai's urban development, population, and economy have increased much faster than NYC's over the last three decades. These risk factors provide part of the explanation for the implementation of a relatively high level of protection (e.g. reinforced concrete sea-wall designed for a 200-year flood return level) in Shanghai and low protection (e.g. vertical brick and stone walls and sand dunes) in NYC.

To answer, we estimated the biodiversity impacts on the Brazilian biomes developed by 11 companies which's participated, uninterruptedly, in all ISE portfolios between 2005 and 2014. We used the LIFE certification methodology (Lasting Initiative for Earth) to qualify and quantify the minimum externalities, and mitigations of each corporation. Ten corporations generated 96% of total externalities, while mitigated only 10%. One financial institution did not develop mitigations, and one company of chemical/petrochemical sector described biodiversity in Brazil as irrelevant and insignificant. Only company of paper/cellulose mitigated their externalities. This company developed 77% of total scores calculated, by creating 41,600 ha of Protected Areas. Thus, the forest sector mitigated 30% of total externalities calculated for the 11 companies. That is, the organizations analyzed here demonstrated that they do not yet internalize the importance of promoting biodiversity conservation actions as a way to minimize their impacts. The LIFE certification methodology can be considered an additional tool for environmental management, indicating areas in which a company has the potential to improve management through the calculus of partial results of externalities.

Unfortunately, deriving equations for estimating kinetic parameters is challenging because it involves calculus; integration can be a frustrating barrier to the pharmacologist seeking to measure simple rate parameters. Here, a well-known tool for simplifying the derivation, the Laplace transform, is applied to models of receptor-ligand interaction. The method transforms differential equations to a form in which simple algebra can be applied to solve for the variable of interest, for example the concentration of ligand-bound receptor. Methods The goal is to provide instruction using familiar examples, to enable investigators familiar with handling equilibrium binding equations to derive kinetic equations for receptor-ligand interaction. First, the Laplace transform is used to derive the equations for association and dissociation of labeled ligand binding. Next, its use for unlabeled ligand kinetic equations is exemplified by a full derivation of the kinetics of competitive binding equation. Finally, new unlabeled ligand equations are derived using the Laplace transform. These equations incorporate a pre-incubation step with unlabeled or labeled ligand. Results Four equations for measuring unlabeled ligand kinetics were compared and the two new equations verified by comparison with numerical solution. Importantly, the equations have not been verified with experimental data because no such experiments are evident in the literature. Equations were formatted for use in the curve-fitting program GraphPad Prism 6.0 and fitted to simulated data. Discussion This description of the Laplace transform method will enable pharmacologists to derive kinetic equations for their model or experimental paradigm under study. Application of the transform will expand the set of equations available for the pharmacologist to measure unlabeled ligand binding kinetics, and for other time-dependent pharmacological activities. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Data analysis; Drug discovery; Drug kinetics; Ligand binding; Methods; Receptor binding kinetics; Receptor theory; Residence time","ligand; Article; association constant; binding kinetics; comparative study; equilibrium constant; laplace transform method; mathematical model; mathematical variable; protein interaction; receptor binding; receptor ligand interaction",2-s2.0-85032200480

We assume the classic approach to the evaluation of a degree of consensus due to Kacprzyk and Fedrizzi [19–21] in which a soft degree of consensus has been introduced as a degree to which, for instance, “most of the important individuals agree as to almost all of the relevant options”, using the fuzzy majority introduced into group decision making by Kacprzyk [17, 18] equated with a fuzzy linguistic quantifier (most, almost all,..) and handled via Zadeh’s [53] classic calculus of linguistically quantified propositions or some other method, notably Yager’s [50] OWA (ordered weighted average) operators. The consensus reaching process is run in a group of agents, which is assumed to be relatively small (e.g. human experts), by a moderator for whom some support, i.e. additional information may be useful. In our case, it is provided by a novel combination of, first, the use of the a soft degree of consensus alone within a decision support system setting along the lines of Fedrizzi et al. [5], Fedrizzi et al. [4], Kacprzyk and Zadrożny [28, 31]. Second, the linguistic data summaries in the sense of Yager [49], Kacprzyk and Yager [24], Kacprzyk et al. [25], in particular in its protoform based version proposed by Kacprzyk and Zadrożny [30, 32], are employed to indicate in a natural language some interesting relations between individuals and options to help the moderator identify crucial (pairs of) individuals and/options which pose some threats to the reaching of consensus. Third, we mention the use of some results obtained in our recent paper (Kacprzyk et al. [40]) on the use of a novel data mining tool, a so-called action rule proposed by Raś and Wieczorkowska [46], which are meant in our context to find best concessions to be offered to the individuals for changing their preferences to increase the degree of consensus. Fourth, our new results of the use of the concepts of a consensory and dissensory agent (cf.

This traditional model has been proved to be very hard to handle as it involves evolution of two intertwined quantities. moreover, the explicit form of its solution is, in general, impossible to obtain. In this article, we explore the possibility of generalizing evolution equation modeling the polymer chain degradation and analyze the model with β derivative. We consider the general case where the breakup rate depends on the size of the chain breaking up. In the process, the alternative version of Sumudu integral transform is used to provide an explicit form of the general solution representing the evolution of polymer sizes distribution. In particular, we show that this evolution exhibits existence of complex periodic properties due to the presence of cosine and sine functions governing the solutions. Numerical simulations are performed for some particular cases and proves that such a system describing the polymer chain degradation contains complex and simple harmonic poles whose effects are given by these functions or a combination of them.

Only recently, FOT has been employed to assess respiratory properties at low frequencies. When measuring at low frequencies interference between the imposed pressure oscillations and the breathing signal of the subject occurs. To deal with these challenges filtering techniques have been proposed to avoid biased correlates in the impedance, but none proved to successfully separate this disturbance signal. Hence, in this paper we are investigating the usefulness of empirical mode decomposition techniques to eliminate the bias introduced by the breathing signal. Respiratory data from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were analyzed and the results indicate that the method can successfully fill the gap in reducing the bias in the estimated impedance.

However, several difficulties have hindered the development of partitioned FSI algorithms in modeling cerebral arteries and aneurysms. For example, the relatively small values of the mass ratio between the arterial wall and the blood will cause instabilities in coupled solvers, the arterial wall responses are very complicated therefore difficult to be described by classical structural models, accurate simulations in patient-specific geometries require large CPU time, and so on. To resolve these difficulties, the investigation of proper models for the aneurysms and the design of efficient and stable numerical schemes of these models are considered in this chapter. To be specific, we first contribute on stabilizing the partitioned fluid-structure interaction procedure and resolving the added-mass effect, then develop and employ fractional PDEs to model the complex biomechanical viscoelastic properties of patient-specific aneurysms. To validate the optimal coefficient analysis, the FSI framework is applied to patient-specific aneurysms, hence demonstrating the general applicability of the proposed model and the developed methodology. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,"Medical applications; Viscoelasticity; Added mass effects; Biomedical applications; Cerebral arteries; Numerical scheme; Optimal coefficient; Patient specific; Structural models; Viscoelastic properties; Fluid structure interaction",2-s2.0-85028914358

Firstly, we handle when the boundary M has a point at which the mean curvature is negative. Secondly, we re-encounter the case when M has zero mean curvature and satisfies one of the following conditions: nonumbilic, umbilic and a component of the covariant derivative of the Ricci tensor on X is negative, or umbilic and nonlocally conformally flat. As a result, we replace the geometric restrictions given by González and Qing (2013) and González and Wang (2017) with simpler ones. Also, inspired by Marques (2007) and Almaraz (2010), we study lower-dimensional manifolds.

The pure set-based algorithm try to rearrange (take away) some amount of the material volume, originally used to minimize the nominal-compliance, to make a more balanced compliance-function-shape on the set of feasible directions which is less sensitive to the directional fluctuation. The objective is the area of the compliance function shape defined on the set of feasible directions. The area-minimal shape searching process is controlled by the maximum allowable increase of the nominal-compliance. The result will be a more robust compliance function shape which can be characterized by a higher nominal-compliance but a smaller curvature about it in any direction. Using the terminology of the classical variational problems, the proposed approach can be classified as a curve-length or surface-area minimizing inner-value problem where the inner condition, namely the maximum allowable increase of the nominal-compliance, expressed as a percentage of the original nominal compliance, the searching domain is defined implicitly as integration limits in the objective formulation and a usual equality relation is used to prescribe the allowable material volume expressed as a percentage of the total material volume.

The chapter presents the medical image processing and morphological analysis in the solution of urology and plastic surgery (hernioplasty) problems. Novel methodology for processing medical images using a color coding of contour representation obtained by Digital Shearlet Transform (DST) has been presented. The object contours in the medical urology images are obtained using the conventional filters, and then results are compared. Since medical images can contain some noise, it makes sense to suppress the noise at the preprocessing step. For this purpose, the optimized in implementation algorithms of the most frequently used filters, such as the mean filter, Gaussian filter, median filter, and 2D cleaner filter, had been developed. A comparison of the optimized and ordinary implementations of noise reduction filter shows great speed improvement of the optimized implementations (around 3–20 times). Additionally, the parallel implementation gives 2–3.5 times performance boost. The proposed methodology allows to improve the accuracy and decrease the error of the sought parameters and characteristics by 10–20% on average without a lack of significant details in the structural features of the examined objects.

In such processes the exponent γ(t) in ⟨r2⟩ ∼ tγ(t) at times might be approximated by a piecewise constant function, or it can be a continuous function. Variable order differential equations are an emerging mathematical tool with a strong potential to model these systems. However, variable order differential equations are not tractable by the classic differential equations theory. This contribution illustrates how a classic method can be adapted to gain insight into a system of this type. Herein a variable order Gierer–Meinhardt model is posed, a generic reaction– diffusion system of a chemical origin. With a fixed order this system possesses a solution in the form of a constellation of arbitrarily situated localised pulses, when the components’ diffusivity ratio is asymptotically small. The pattern was shown to exist subject to multiple step-like transitions between normal diffusion and sub-diffusion, as well as between distinct sub-diffusive regimes. The analytical approximation obtained permits qualitative analysis of the impact thereof. Numerical solution for typical cross-over scenarios revealed such features as earlier equilibration and non-monotonic excursions before attainment of equilibrium. The method is general and allows for an approximate numerical solution with any reasonably behaved γ(t). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fractional differential equations; Matched asymptotic expansions; Numerical estimates of memory integrals; Variable order differential equations","Diffusion; Numerical methods; Analytical approximation; Experimental evidence; Fractional differential equations; Matched asymptotic expansion; Mean square displacement; Numerical estimates of memory integrals; Piece-wise-constant functions; Variable order; Differential equations",2-s2.0-85020392649

As a generalization of nondeterminism, “alternation” gives computation models the power of existential choice and universal choice simultaneously. In this paper, we extend fuzzy nondeterministic automata to a model called fuzzy alternating automata over distributive lattices. Compared with the previous work, a weight labels a leaf node of the run tree rather than be involved in the edge between states when executing a transition. One advantage of our setting is that it is easy to complement a given fuzzy alternating automaton. It suffices to take the dual operation on the transition function and negate final costs on states. Moreover, we show that fuzzy alternating automata have the same expressive power as fuzzy nondeterministic automata, and the former ones are exponentially more succinct than the latter ones.

One way to express the interaction is through a combination index τ based on Loewe additivity. Regarding the statistical optimal design of trials to estimate τ, the problem generally corresponds to a c-optimality design problem. Unfortunately, c-optimal designs have several practical problems, commonly including an inability to also estimate the underlying dose–response parameters in the same trial. It is demonstrated how optimal designs for combination indices can be generated as well as how these designs can be adapted to guarantee that at least a satisfactory degree of precision can be maintained for all parameter estimates. This is achieved by introducing secondary constraints on efficiency regarding the D-criterion, and optimizing within these constraints only. All of the proposals are demonstrated using a practical toxicological example.

Solutions are interpreted as Stackelberg equilibria, where the borrower announces his repayment strategy u(t) at all future times, and lenders adjust the interest rate accordingly.

In contrast to transforming the DPS into a finite set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) prior to the design of control or fault detection schemes by using significant approximations, thus reducing the accuracy and reliability of the overall system, in this paper, the PDE representation of the system is directly utilized to construct a fault detection observer. A fault is detected by comparing the detection residual, which is the difference between measured and estimated outputs, with a predefined detection threshold. Once the fault is detected, an adaptive approximator is activated to learn the fault function. The estimated fault parameters are then compared with their failure thresholds to provide an estimate of the remaining useful life of the system. The scheme is verified in simulations on a heat system which is described by parabolic PDEs.

Unfortunately, since such an analysis belongs to the non-linear “parametric excitation” realm, its theoretical aspects and relations have been mostly carried out after linearization. In this paper a general framework, i.e. the Ladder Expansion Method, is developed to convert such equations to a series of coupled linear equations, up to any desired accuracy. This method is then applied to the single mode random fluctuations of the absorption cross sections in a power reactor which is modelled by the multigroup diffusion equation with multiple delayed neutron groups. A system of coupled pseudo steady state diffusion equations has been derived as the result. The procedure of numerically solving such a system, using the Finite Element Method is described and the previously reported GFEM code, which is a Galerkin FEM based diffusion solver and Linear Power Reactor Noise analyzer for two dimensional geometries, has been generalized to accommodate the LEM to evaluate the higher order power reactor noise moments. Use of these moments in the Power Spectral Density of the flux and its derivatives, such as the detection rate, has shown that the value of the PSD at the main harmonic of the fluctuation deviates with the predictions of the conventional LPRN method. Moreover, the generation of super-harmonic modes in the PSD of the neutron flux distribution has been shown to follow naturally by using the developed LEM. Three numerical benchmarks show the correctness and accuracy of the developed method. Finally, the error introduced in the linearization process is quantified by comparing numerical results of the LPRN method with that of the LEM, and some of the general trends of this error have been identified. As a result, the expectation of validity of the linearization process in the “sufficiently small perturbation” region is confirmed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Diffusion equation; Finite element method; Ladder expansion method; Power reactor noise; Super harmonic generation","Diffusion; Equations of state; Harmonic analysis; Ladders; Linearization; Nuclear fuels; Numerical methods; Partial differential equations; Power spectral density; Reactor cores; Spectral density; Absorption cross sections; Diffusion equations; Expansion methods; Neutron flux distributions; Nuclear power reactors; Parametric excitations; Power reactor; Two-dimensional geometry; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85029692351

For ductile materials, however, an additional contribution to the energy dissipation is present, related to plastic deformations. Of crucial importance, for the performance of the modeling approaches, is the way the coupling is realized between plasticity and phase field evolution.

Classical approaches to modeling this noise and neutron count distribution in the detection system rely on the stochastic transport equation for the probability generating function and on transfer function response to random perturbations. In recent years, a third modeling approach has been proposed, relying on Ito stochastic differential equations, which enjoys the tractability that the first aforementioned approach has, and at the same time accounts for fluctuations, by modeling noise in terms of Brownian motion. This paper develops the latter approach to incorporate the stochasticity in the detection process to the model equations. The resulting neutron count distributions are explicitly computable. As an application of our approach we present a straightforward derivation of the well-known Feynman-Y formula. We then propose an alternative to the traditional sampling scheme of this formula, based on mean absolute deviation, known from the statistics literature to be more robust than the mean square deviation estimator. The study focuses on a single energy point model and neglects the effect of the delayed neutrons. Extensions of the approach to multiple energy levels and the incorporation of delayed neutrons are discussed, as well as further applications of the approach and its advantages over existing diffusion scale approximations. © 2017","Diffusion approximations; Point reactor kinetics; Stochastic differential equations","Brownian movement; Differential equations; Neutrons; Probability distributions; Sampling; Diffusion approximations; Ito stochastic differential equations; Mean absolute deviations; Multiple energy level; Point reactor kinetics; Probability generating functions; Science and engineering; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic systems",2-s2.0-85030480989

The present paper adds to the literature by developing a generic numerical optimisation model that can be used to simulate non-renewable resource management regimes and the effects of different policy instruments deployed at different stages of the resource's life cycle. By including recycling and substitution, the model extends the seminal cake-eating Hotelling model that dominates the non-renewable resource economics literature.

A new theoretical pseudo SEM is developed which has a non positive definite dispersion matrix and is proved to yield the 3SLS estimator that would be derived if the modified SEM was estimated afresh. In addition, the computation of the iterative 3SLS estimator of the updated observations SEM is considered. The new recursive method utilizes efficiently previous computations, exploits sparsity in the pseudo SEM and uses as main computational tool orthogonal and hyperbolic matrix factorizations. This allows the estimation of large-scale SEMs which previously could have been considered computationally infeasible to tackle.

ICA is a novel method of detecting the levels of pairwise correlations within the set of criteria (termed here positive consonance, negative consonance and dissonance), which uses as input the dataset of measurements or evaluations of a set of objects against these criteria. The output of ICA, being a matrix of intuitionistic fuzzy pairs, gives all possible consonances and dissonances between the pairs of criteria, and it is a matter of either expert decision or algorithmic solution what thresholds of precision will be implemented to outline the top correlating pairs of criteria and yield certain domain-specific conclusions from the data.

Idempotent operators also guarantee that identical information items are not counted twice in the fusion process, a very important property in decentralized applications where the information origin cannot always be tracked (ad-hoc wireless networks are typical examples). In the theory of belief functions, a sound way to combine conjunctively multiple information items is to design a combination rule that selects the least informative element among a subset of belief functions more informative than each of the combined ones. In contrast, disjunctive rules can be retrieved by selecting the most informative element among a subset of belief functions less informative than each of the combined ones. One interest of such approaches is that they provide idempotent rules by construction. The notions of less and more informative are often formalized through partial orderings extending usual set-inclusion, yet the only two informative partial orders that provide a straightforward idempotent rule leading to a unique result are those based on the conjunctive and disjunctive weight functions. In this article, we show that other partial orders can achieve a similar goal when the problem is slightly relaxed into a distance optimization one. Building upon previous work, this paper investigates the use of distances compatible with informative partial orders to determine a unique solution to the combination problem. The obtained operators are conjunctive/disjunctive, idempotent and commutative, but lack associativity. They are, however, quasi-associative allowing sequential combinations at no extra complexity. Some experiments demonstrate interesting discrepancies as compared to existing approaches, notably with the aforementioned rules relying on weight functions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Belief functions; Combination; Convex optimization; Distance; Idempotence; Partial order","Convex optimization; Wireless ad hoc networks; Belief function; Combination; Distance; Idempotence; Partial order; Uncertainty analysis",2-s2.0-85030838520

In this article, we draw on numerical simulations to study crack nucleation in commonly encountered geometries for which closed-form solutions are not available.

As such, we characterized the dynamics and multiscale relationships of hourly electricity consumption data for 13 occupied Florida houses from calendar year 2013. Statistical approaches included: (1) exploratory data analyses with distribution-based descriptive statistics; (2) normality testing; (3) spectral and monofractal analyses; (4) multifractal detrended fluctuation analyses (MFDFA) with surrogate testing; and (5) Ward's minimum variance method for hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Results suggested the energy-use patterns were non-normal, nonlinear, and exhibited predominantly anti-persistent fractal complexities. Thus, classical descriptive statistics presuming Gaussian probability density function (PDF) distributions neither well fit, nor well described, the data and their interdependent characteristics. Notably, clusters of comparable houses were categorically and statistically different when using descriptors based on normality (e.g., mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) versus those based on fractality (e.g., Hurst exponent, multifractal spectrum width). We believe MFDFA statistical outputs may serve as novel indicators of residential building dynamics as they better characterize the complex, nonlinear asset and occupancy interactions and they require no assumptions regarding the PDF distribution shape. We offer guidance on the data management, transformation, parameterization, and interpretation processes necessary to apply MFDFA to whole-house, short-interval, electricity consumption time series data. Multifractal quantification of building performance time series data may be useful on multiple fronts: (1) detecting under-performing households; (2) improving segmentation, targeting, and pre/post analyses of energy efficiency interventions; (3) diagnosing building system failure risks; and (4) improving smart grid supply and load balancing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building performance; Complex systems; Electricity smart meter; Fractal dimension; Nonlinear dynamics; Probability density function","Buildings; Dynamics; Electric power measurement; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fractal dimension; Fractals; Higher order statistics; Houses; Housing; Information management; Large scale systems; Metadata; Probability distributions; Smart power grids; Statistical methods; Structural dynamics; Systems engineering; Time series; Time series analysis; Building performance; Electricity-consumption; Exploratory data analysis; Gaussian probability density functions; Hierarchical agglomerative clustering; Multi-fractal spectrum; Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis; Residential building energies; Probability density function",2-s2.0-85031308158

In this work, we investigate a mechanism that aims at helping users address these questions. The investigated mechanism relies on a hard-privacy model and allows users to share partial or complete profile data with broker and data-mining companies in exchange for an economic reward. The theoretical analysis of the trade-off between privacy and money posed by such mechanism is the object of this work. We adopt a generic measure of privacy although part of our analysis focuses on some important examples of Bregman divergences. We find a parametric solution to the problem of optimal exchange of privacy for money, and obtain a closed-form expression and characterize the trade-off between profile-disclosure risk and economic reward for several interesting cases.

First, we recall the standard problem of HOSM control, which corresponds to the design of a state feedback control and an observer for a particular Differential Inclusion (DI), which represents a family of dynamic systems, including bounded matched perturbations/uncertainties. Next we provide a large family of zero-degree homogeneous discontinuous controllers solving the state feedback problem based on a family of explicit and smooth homogeneous Lyapunov functions. We show the formal relationship between the control laws and the Lyapunov functions. This also gives a method for the calculation of controller gains ensuring the robust and finite time stability of the sliding set. The required unmeasured states can be estimated robustly and in finite time by means of an observer or differentiator, originally proposed by A. Levant. We give explicit and smooth Lyapunov functions for the design of gains ensuring the convergence of the estimated states to the actual ones in finite time, despite the non vanishing bounded perturbations or uncertainties acting on the system.

Incorporation of illicit and medicinal drugs into non-mineralized dental biofilm (plaque) seems likely but has not been investigated so far. Analysis of plaque could therefore extend the spectrum of potentially used matrices in postmortem toxicology. For this reason, a rapid, simple and sensitive method for the extraction, determination and quantification of ten drugs of abuse from plaque using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed and fully validated. Amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), cocaine, benzoylecgonine, morphine, codeine and 6-acetylmorphine were extracted from 2 mg of dried and powdered plaque via ultrasonication with acetonitrile. The extracts were analyzed on a triple-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode (sMRM). The method was fully validated and proved accurate, precise, selective and specific with satisfactory linearity within the calibrated ranges. The lower limit of quantification was 10–15 pg mg−1 for all compounds except for MDA (100 pg mg−1) and amphetamine (200 pg mg−1). The method has been successfully applied to three authentic postmortem samples with known drug history.

In many practical situations, only incomplete and inaccurate statistical knowledge on uncertain input parameters are available. Fortunately, to construct a finite-order expansion, only some partial information on the probability measure is required that can be simply represented by a finite number of statistical moments. Such situations, however, trigger the question to what degree higher-order statistical moments of input data are increasingly uncertain. On the one hand, increasing uncertainty in higher moments will lead to increasing inaccuracy in the corresponding chaos expansion and its result. On the other hand, the degree of expansion should adequately reflect the non-linearity of the analyzed model to minimize the approximation error of the expansion. Observation of the PCE convergence when statistical input information is incomplete demonstrates that higher-order PCE expansions without adequate data support are useless. Moreover, it makes apparent that PCE of a certain order is adequate just for a corresponding amount of available input data. The key idea of the current work is to align the order of expansion with a compromise between the degree of non-linearity of the model and the reliability of statistical information on the input parameters. To assure an optimal choice of the expansion order, we offer a simple relation that helps to align available input statistical data with an adequate expansion order. As fundamental steps into this direction, we propose overall error estimates for the statistical type of error that results from inaccurate statistical information plus the error that results from truncating the expansion of a non-linear model. Our key message is that any order of expansion is only justified if accompanied by reliable statistical information on input moments of a certain higher order. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adequate expansion order; Incomplete statistics; Orthonormal basis; Polynomial chaos expansion; Uncertainty quantification","Errors; Input output programs; Polynomials; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Adequate expansion order; Degree of non-linearity; Orthonormal basis; Polynomial chaos expansion; Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE); Statistical information; Stochastic model reduction; Uncertainty quantifications; Statistics",2-s2.0-85027895795

The authors of the paper present new algorithms for the defuzzyfication block which is the final process of the fuzzy controller (fuzzy control systems), for which a defuzzyfied value controls a given object. The presented new methods are: Golden Ratio (GR) and Mandala Factor (MF). The first of them uses the ancient Golden Ratio rule which is known, among others, from the Fibonacci sequence. The second proposal is based on the interpretation of drawing technique used in Asia, consisting in arranging pictures of color sand grains. In Tibetan Buddhism this technique is known as Mandala, a symbol of perfection and harmony. The interpretation of the perfection symbol and the Golden Ratio method in this paper has been referenced to other methods used in the defuzzyfication process, including weight averange method, centroid and mean of maxima. The scene for solutions presented here is provided by the ordered fuzzy numbers (OFN) theory which allows to use both the trend of a given phenomena, as well as more precisely wield mathematical methods. A special property of the proposed methods is their sensitivity to the OFN number order. This means that MF and GR operators applied to the numbers of the same shape but of opposite orders would result in different defuzzyfication values.

Subclinical disease has no recognizable clinical findings, thus it is desirable to segment the dental X-Ray image into groups and then use soft computing methods to check the possibility of whether or not any disease occurs therein. Methods The current work proposed a novel framework called Dental Diagnosis System (DDS) for dental diagnosis based on the hybrid approach of segmentation, classification and decision making. It utilized the best dental image segmentation method based on semi-supervised fuzzy clustering for the segmentation task. A new graph-based clustering algorithm called APC+ for the classification task was proposed. A new decision making procedure was designed to determine the final disease from a group of diseases found from the segments. Results The proposed DDS was modeled under the real dental case of Hanoi Medical University, Vietnam including 87 dental images of five popular diseases, namely: root fracture, incluse teeth, decay, missing teeth, and resorption of periodontal bone. The DDS accuracy is 92.74% which is superior to the other methods namely fuzzy inference system (89.67%), fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (80.05%), prim spanning tree (58.46%), kruskal spanning tree (58.46%), and affinity propagation clustering (90.01%).

The proposed GSA based FOLBFs consistently achieve the best solution quality with the fastest convergence rate as compared with the designs based on Real coded Genetic Algorithm (RGA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Many methods have been investigated to resolve this nontrivial problem, by using advanced data processing on the overall sEMG recorded signal. However, if they reduce ECG artifacts, those cancellation methods also deteriorate noiseless parts of the signal. This work proposes an original ECG cancellation method designed to limit the deterioration of sEMG information. To do that, the proposed techniques does not directly attempt to remove the ECG, but is based on two main steps: the localization of ECG and the cancellation of ECG but only where heart pulses have been detected. The phase of localization efficiently extracts the ECG contribution by combining the discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) and the method of independent component analysis (ICA). And finally, this phase takes advantage of quasi-periodic properties of ECG signals to accurately detect pulses localization with an original algorithm based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Intensive simulations were achieved in terms of relative errors, coherence and accuracy for different levels of ECG interference. And the correlation coefficients computed from the paraspinal muscles EMG signals of 12 healthy participants were also used to evaluate the developed method. The results from simulation and real data demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects pulses positions and efficiently removes the ECG from EMG signals, even when both signals are strongly overlapped, and greatly limits the deterioration of the EMG. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete wavelet transforms; ECG cancellation; Independent component analysis; Quasi-periodic signals detection","Data handling; Deterioration; Discrete wavelet transforms; Electrocardiography; Electromyography; Fast Fourier transforms; Independent component analysis; Wavelet transforms; Advanced data processing; Correlation coefficient; Independent component analysis(ICA); Original algorithms; Paraspinal muscles; Quasi-periodic signals; Recorded signals; Surface electromyography; Signal detection; adult; algorithm; Article; correlation coefficient; discrete wavelet transform; electrocardiogram; electromyograph electrode; electromyography; evaluation study; extraction; Fourier transformation; human; human experiment; independent component analysis; information; information processing; intermethod comparison; measurement accuracy; measurement error; normal human; paraspinal muscle; priority journal; pulse rate; sensor; signal detection; simulation; validation study; young adult",2-s2.0-85026728417

We formulate an appropriate initial-boundary-value problem and analyse the effect of the sharpness of vertical axisymmetric bottom disturbance and the disturbance duration on the generation of tsunami waves. The propagation of nonlinear waves on water and their evolution over a nonrigid elastic bottom are investigated. Some aspects and indeterminacy of the formulation of the initial-boundary-value problems dealing with the initiation and generation of tsunami waves are considered. We consider some typical types of tsunami waves that demonstrate the indeterminacy of their initiation in time because of the indeterminacy in the physical trigger mechanism of underwater earthquakes. Based on the three-dimensional formulation, evolution equations describing the propagation of nonlinear dispersive surface waves on water over a spatially inhomogeneous bottom are obtained with allowance for the bottom disturbances in time. We use the Laplace transform with respect to the time coordinate and the power series method with respect to the spatial coordinate to find a solution to the nonstationary problem of the diffraction of surface gravity waves by a radial bottom inhomogeneity that deviates from its initial position. The propagation and stability of nonlinear waves in a two-layer fluid with allowance for surface tension are analysed by the asymptotic method of multiscale expansions. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-85029377642

On the one hand, the dorsal stream analyzes the motion information by applying optical flow, which considers the fast features. On the other hand, the ventral stream analyzes the form information with slow features. The proposed approach suggests that the motion perception of the human visual system comprises fast and slow feature interactions to identify biological movements. The form features in the visual system follow the application of the active basis model (ABM) with incremental slow feature analysis (IncSFA). Episodic observation is required to extract the slowest features, whereas the fast features update the processing of motion information in every frame. Applying IncSFA provides an opportunity to abstract human actions and use action prototypes. However, the fast features are obtained from the optical flow division, which gives an opportunity to interact with the system as the final recognition is performed through a combination of the optical flow and ABM-IncSFA information and through the application of kernel extreme learning machine. Applying IncSFA into the ventral stream and involving slow and fast features in the recognition mechanism are the major contributions of this research. The two human action datasets for benchmarking (KTH and Weizmann) and the results highlight the promising performance of this approach in model modification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biologically inspired model; Dual processing pathways; Extreme learning machine; Human action recognition; Incremental slow feature analysis; Interaction between ventral and dorsal stream","Benchmarking; Image processing; Image recognition; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammals; Neural networks; Optical flows; Biologically inspired models; Dorsal stream; Dual processing pathways; Extreme learning machine; Human-action recognition; Incremental slow feature analysis; Functional neuroimaging",2-s2.0-85032451331

To deliver this vital societal need, data-inexpensive artificial intelligence models relying on historical inputs can be a useful scientific contrivance by energy analysts, engineers and climate-policy advocates. In this paper, a novel approach is adopted to construct a multilayer perceptron (MLP) hybrid model integrated with the Firefly Optimizer algorithm (MLP-FFA) trained with a limited set of historical (monthly) data (2004–2014) for a group of neighboring stations to predict windspeed at target sites in north-west Iran. Subsequently, the MLP-FFA model is developed to minimize the error rate of the resulting hybrid model and applied at each of the eight target sites one-by-one (namely: Tabriz, Jolfa, Sarab, Marand, Sahand, Kaleybar, Maraghe and Mianeh) such that the seven neighboring (reference) sites are used for training and the remainder eighth site for testing purposes. To ascertain conclusive results, the hybrid model's ability to predict windspeed at each target site is cross-validated with the MLP model without the FFA optimizer and the statistical performance is benchmarked with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS), Willmott's Index (d) and the Legates and McCabes Index (E1), including relative errors. For all eight target sites, the testing performance of the MLP-FFA model is found to be significantly superior than the classical MLP, resulting in lower values of the RMSE (0.202–0.50 ms−1 relative to 0.236–0.664 ms−1) and larger values of ENS, d and E1 (0.686–0.953 vs. 0.529–0.936, 0.874–0.976 vs. 0.783–0.966, 0.417–0.800 vs. 0.303–0.748). Despite a more accurate performance of hybrid models tested at each target site, the preciseness registered a distinct geographic signature with the least accurate result (for Kaleybar) and the most accurate result (for Jolfa). To accord with this result, we conclude that the utilization of the FFA as an add-in optimizer in a hybrid data-intelligent model leads to a significant improvement in the predictive accuracy, presumably due to the optimal weights attained in the hidden layer that allows a more robust feature extraction process. Accordingly, we establish that the hybrid MLP-FFA model can be explored further in a problem of long-term windspeed prediction with reference station input data, and feasibility studies on wind energy investments in data-scarce regions where a limited set of neighboring reference site data can be employed to forecast the target site windspeed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Firefly algorithm (FFA); Hybrid predictive model; Multilayer perceptron; Prediction; Windspeed","Bioluminescence; Energy conversion; Errors; Flood control; Forecasting; Investments; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Optimization; Planning; Wind power; Firefly algorithms; Multi layer perceptron; Predictive modeling; Robust feature extractions; Root mean square errors; Statistical performance; Wind energy conversion system; Windspeed; Climate models; accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; model validation; performance assessment; wind farm; wind velocity; East Azerbaijan; Iran; Kaleybar; Mianeh; Sahand; Sarab; Tabriz",2-s2.0-85030656566

The composition and properties of conditioning film have great influence on antifouling properties of stent materials. In our previous work, we modified polyurethane films by chondroitin sulfate (PU-CS) with different CS grafting densities to verify its anti-fouling properties. To obtain the in-depth understanding of encrustation on urinary stents, we investigated the impact of the composition and properties of conditioning film on the following inorganic salt deposition and bacteria adhesion in urine. The results showed that quantity of proteins and polysaccharides in conditioning films, and the roughness, water contact angle and zeta potential of PU-CSs covered with corresponding conditioning film decreased with the increase of CS grafting density on PU films.PU-CS(3) with highest CS grafting density (3.70 g/cm2) had the highest bacteria inhibition rate and least inorganic salt deposition among the PU-CSs in artificial urine. Moreover, inorganic salts depositing on the PU-CS(3) were less and smaller than those on other films. Bacteria were not detectable until day 21 in real urine. Meanwhile, the pH value was elevated. The results suggested that the component of conditioning films was more important than other surface properties such as hydrophilicity, zeta potential and roughness for inorganic salt deposition and bacteria adhesion.

From Leray–Schauder degree theory a signed count of the closed trajectories representing x in the complement of y is independent of the vector field. It therefore suffices to compute, or estimate the signed count of periodic orbits for a particularly convenient vector field.

Multilevel thresholding is a widely used technique that uses threshold values for image segmentation. However, from a computational stand point, the search for optimal threshold values presents a challenging task, especially when the number of thresholds is high. To get the optimal threshold values, a meta-heuristic or optimization algorithm is required. Our proposed algorithm is referred to as Rr-cr-IJADE, which is an improved version of Rcr-IJADE. Rr-cr-IJADE uses a newly proposed mutation strategy, “DE/rand-to-rank/1”, to improve the search success rate. The strategy uses the parameter F adaptation, crossover rate repairing, and the direction from a randomly selected individual to a ranking-based leader. The complexity of the proposed algorithm does not increase, compared to its ancestor. The performance of Rr-cr-IJADE, using Otsu's function as the objective function, was evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and swarm intelligence algorithms (SIs), under both ‘low-level’ and ‘high-level’ experimental sets. Within the ‘low-level’ sets, the number of thresholds varied from 2 to 16, within 20 real images. For the ‘high-level’ sets, the threshold numbers chosen were 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64, within 2 synthetic pseudo images, 7 satellite images, and three real images taken from the set of 20 real images.

Nevertheless, the use of such materials in supports of rotating machines, aiming at controlling vibration, is more recent, mainly when these supports present additional complexities like multiple degrees of freedom and require accurate models to predict the dynamic behavior of viscoelastic materials working in a broad band of frequencies and temperatures. Previously, the authors propose a methodology for an optimal design of viscoelastic supports (VES) for vibration suppression in rotordynamics, which improves the dynamic prediction accuracy, the speed calculation, and the modeling of VES as complex structures. However, a comprehensive numerical study of the dynamics of rotor-VES systems, regarding the types and combinations of translational and rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs), accompanied by the corresponding experimental validation, is still lacking. This paper presents such a study considering different types and combinations of DOFs in addition to the simulation of their number of additional masses/inertias, as well as the kind and association of the applied viscoelastic materials (VEMs). The results - regarding unbalance frequency response, transmissibility and displacement due to static loads - lead to: 1) considering VES as complex structures which allow improving the efficacy in passive vibration control; 2) acknowledging the best configuration concerning DOFs and VEM choice and association for a practical application concerning passive vibration control and load resistance.

Here we study a game theoretic model of cooperation for pest control among farmers. In our simple model, each farmer has a paddy of the same size arranged adjacently on a line. A pest outbreak occurs at an abandoned paddy at one end of the line, directly threatening the frontier farmer adjacent to it. Each farmer pays a cost of his or her choice to an agricultural collective, and the total sum held by the collective is used for pest control, with success probability increasing with the sum. Because the farmers’ incentives depend on their distance from the pest outbreak, our model is an asymmetric public goods game. We derive each farmer's cost strategy at the Nash equilibrium. We find that asymmetry among farmers leads to a few unexpected outcomes. The individual costs at the equilibrium do not necessarily increase with how much the future is valued but rather show threshold behavior. Moreover, an increase in the number of farmers can sometimes paradoxically undermine pest prevention. A comparison with a symmetric public goods game model reveals that the farmer at the greatest risk pays a disproportionate amount of cost in the asymmetric game, making the use of agricultural lands less sustainable. © 2017 The Authors","Asymmetry; Cooperation; Nash equilibrium; Public goods","asymmetry; game theory; paddy field; pest control; pest outbreak; public goods; agricultural land; agricultural worker; Article; asymmetric public goods game; calculation; comparative study; cost; epidemic; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; Nash equilibrium; pest control; priority journal; theoretical model",2-s2.0-85030154340

First the fractional differential equation is transformed into an equivalent Volterra integral equation of the second kind with a weakly singular kernel. Based on the a priori information about the exact solution, an integral discretization scheme on an a priori chosen adapted mesh is proposed. By applying the truncation error estimate techniques and a discrete analogue of Gronwall's inequality, it is proved that the numerical method is first-order convergent in the discrete maximum norm.

This region was characterized by frequent moderate shocks of Mw≥5.0 for more than a decade since the occurrence of 2001 Bhuj earthquake. The present study is therefore important for precursory analysis using this sequence. The selected long-sequence has been investigated first time for completeness magnitude Mc 3.0 using the maximum curvature method. Multi-fractal Dq spectrum (Dq∼q) analysis was carried out using effective window-length of 200 earthquakes with a moving window of 20 events overlapped by 180 events. The robustness of the analysis has been tested by considering the magnitude completeness correction term of 0.2 to Mc 3.0 as Mc 3.2 and we have tested the error in the calculus of Dq for each magnitude threshold. On the other hand, the stability of the analysis has been investigated down to the minimum magnitude of Mw≥2.6 in the sequence. The analysis shows the multi-fractal dimension spectrum Dq decreases with increasing of clustering of events with time before a moderate magnitude earthquake in the sequence, which alternatively accounts for non-randomness in the spatial distribution of epicenters and its self-organized criticality. Similar behavior is ubiquitous elsewhere around the globe, and warns for proximity of a damaging seismic event in an area.

However, the knowledge of how to analyze kidney stones is not widespread, and the experts learn only after being trained on a large number of samples of the different classes. In this paper we describe a new device specifically designed for capturing images of expelled kidney stones, and a method to learn and apply the experts knowledge with regard to their classification.

In the scope of SVAS, an event model method named Interval-Based Spatio-Temporal Model (IBSTM) is proposed. SVAS can learn action models and event models without any predefined threshold values and generates understandable and manageable IBSTM event models. Hybrid machine learning methods are proposed and used. A set of feature models named Threshold Model, which reflects the spatio-temporal motion analysis of an event, is kept as the first model. As the second model, Bag of Actions (BoA) model is used in order to reduce the search space in the detection phase. Markov Logic Network (MLN) model, which provides understandable and manageable logic predicates for users, is kept as the third model. SVAS has high performance event detection capability due to its interval-based hierarchical manner. It determines related candidate intervals for each main model of IBSTM and uses the related main model when needed rather than using all models as a whole. The main contribution of this study is to fill the semantic gap between humans and video computer systems such that, on the one hand it decreases human intervention through its learning capabilities, but on the other hand it also enables human intervention when necessary through its manageable event model method. The study achieves all of them in the most efficient way through its machine learning methods. The proposed system is applied to different event datasets from CAVIAR, BEHAVE and our synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that our approach improves the event recognition performance and precision as compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Event detection; Event inference; Event model learning; Markov logic networks; Video surveillance","Artificial intelligence; Computer circuits; Learning systems; Markov processes; Monitoring; Probabilistic logics; Semantics; Event detection; Event inference; Event model; Markov logic networks; Video surveillance; Security systems",2-s2.0-85026764328

Assuming that the effects of the mutations are small but nonzero, we show that the population's phenotypical distribution has at most two peaks and we give explicit conditions under which the population will be monomorphic (unimodal distribution) or dimorphic (bimodal distribution). More importantly, we provide a general method to determine the dominant terms of the population's distribution in each case. Our work, which is based on Hamilton-Jacobi equations with constraint, goes further than previous works where such tools were used, for different problems from evolutionary biology, to identify the asymptotic solutions, while the mutations vanish, as a sum of Dirac masses. The main elements for the computation of the dominant terms of the population's distribution are the convergence of the logarithmic transform of the solution to the unique solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the computation of the correctors. This method allows indeed to go further than the Gaussian approximation commonly used by biologists and makes a connection between the theories of adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics.

They stabilise the diffusion process exponentially at the desired reference on the controlled boundary. The process is actuated through the Neumann boundary while on other boundaries it is given with the Dirichlet data and, in higher dimensions, also with the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. Two systems, deterministic and stochastic, are compared as an ideal and real description of a physical system. Disturbance in the stochastic system is induced by a white noise on the controlled boundary. Physically, this noise represents different types of uncertainties like a side-reaction mass flux and other uncertainties that are not part of a deterministic model. At first the proportional control is analysed on the deterministic system and then it is represented in the feedback-integrated past controls form, and finally the developed controls are applied on the stochastic system, which boundary is disturbed with an unmeasured white noise. The regulation error that emerges in stochastic control is analysed and proved to be a zero-mean, bounded-variance Gaussian variable that is correlated temporarily.

A fundamental assertion resulting from CLT is the convergence in distribution (CID) of the interpolated standardized time series (ISTS) of tallies. In this work, the spectral analysis of ISTS has been conducted in order to assess the convergence of tallies in terms of CID. Numerical results obtained indicate that the power spectrum of ISTS is equal to the theoretically predicted power spectrum of Brownian motion for tallies of effective neutron multiplication factor; on the other hand, the power spectrum of ISTS of a strongly correlated series of tallies from local powers fluctuates wildly while maintaining the spectral form of fractional Brownian motion. The latter result is the evidence of a case where a series of tallies are away from CID, while the spectral form supports normality assumption on the sample mean. It is also demonstrated that one can make the unbiased estimation of the standard deviation of sample mean well before CID occurs. © 2017 Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

This study provides a theoretical view for understanding the mechanisms that lead to user loyalty toward MMAs. Although emotions and the dedication-constraint model are the two main research disciplines via which the formation of user loyalty has been investigated, few studies have unified these two disciplines. A theoretical model is developed by synthesizing emotional responses and the dedication-constraint model. Based on the ambivalent view of emotions, we examine the exact effects of positive and negative emotions on user loyalty to MMA. Moreover, we identify an encompassing set of antecedents to affective and calculative commitments in the MMA context.

The findings indicate that affective commitment significantly influences user loyalty, both directly and indirectly, through positive emotions. However, calculative commitment has significant positive effects on positive emotions and user loyalty, but it is also positively related to negative emotions. Perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and trust significantly influence affective commitment to MMAs, while social norms significantly affect calculative commitment to MMAs.

Reasonable fertilization can improve the quality and production of the natural rubber. Hence, there is a great interest in developing an accurate and robust model to detecting the nitrogen content of rubber tree to improve the production. In this study, we propose a new method for detecting the nitrogen content using fractional calculus augmented NIR spectra. Fractional calculus is applied as a tool to extract additional information from the original spectra. Three different mathematical transforms (R, 1/R, log(R)) are utilized before the fractional order derivative analysis. After derivative analysis with different orders (0–2), the PLS regression method is utilized to develop the estimation models with the wavelengths selected by significant test of correlation coefficient at 0.01 level. The optimal prediction result RP = 0.9245 is achieved by reciprocal spectrum with the order 0.6.

For early time, they found that the numerical predictions of pocket mass density depend on the similarity variable xt−1/4, representing sub-diffusion. They argue that the sub-diffusive behavior is a consequence of the time needed to establish a linear concentration profile inside a channel. By theoretical analysis of the diffusion equation for small time, they confirmed this finding. Nevertheless, they did not present an exact solution for the small time limit to compare with. Here, starting with their small-time leading order diffusion equation in (x,t) space, we use elements of fractional calculus to cast it into a form for which an analytical solution has been obtained in the literature for the same boundary and initial conditions in terms of the Fox H-function (Schneider and Wyss, 1989). For ease of computation, we express the solution in terms of the Meijer G-function. We compare the exact solution with Zhang and Padrino's numerical predictions, resulting in excellent agreement, thereby validating their numerical approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anomalous diffusion; Diffusion; Ensemble average; Fractional calculus; Porous media; Random network","Calculations; Differential equations; Integrodifferential equations; Partial differential equations; Porous materials; Anomalous diffusion; Boundary and initial conditions; Ensemble averages; Fractional calculus; Linear concentration; Numerical approaches; Numerical predictions; Random network; Diffusion",2-s2.0-85032458327

Then we introduce a general construction for signed dual volume to incorporate material information and take into account the case when circumcenters fall outside triangles or tetrahedrons, which may lead to negative dual volume without Delaunay triangulation. Then we examine the boundary terms induced by the dual mesh and provide a systematical treatment of various boundary conditions, including perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), perfect electric conductor (PEC), Dirichlet, periodic, and absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) within this method.

Alternative searches were made to collect further information on specific topics. The prevalence rate of uric acid stones was computed by the general renal stone prevalence rate and the frequency of uric acid stones in each country. After the initial search, 2180 papers were extracted. Out of them, 79 papers were selected after the reading of the titles and of the abstracts. For ten countries, papers relating to both the renal stone prevalence in the general population and the frequency of uric stones were available. Additional search produced 13 papers that completed information on 11 more countries in 5 continents. Estimated prevalence rate of uric acid stones was >0.75% in Thailand, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, South Africa (white population), United States and Australia; ranged 0.50–0.75% in Turkey, Israel, Italy, India (Southern), Spain, Taiwan, Germany, Brazil; and <0.50% in Tunisia, China, Korea, Japan, Caribe, South Africa (blacks), India (Northern). Climate and diet are major determinants of uric acid stone formation. A hot and dry climate increases fluid losses reducing urinary volume and urinary pH. A diet rich in meat protein causes low urinary pH and increased uric acid excretion. On the other hand, uric acid stone formation is frequently associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes type 2 that are linked to dietary energy excess mainly from carbohydrate and saturated fat and also present with low urine pH values.

The C reconstruction routines, accessible also from FORTRAN, allow the calculation of basis functions and their first derivatives at any position inside the plasma and in its vicinity.

Nature of problem: In plasma simulations, the equilibrium codes play a fundamental role in supplying the information about magnetic configuration for different more sophisticated plasma problems: stability, transport, particle orbit or gyro-kinetics. At present, there are two extreme approaches to make a choice of output data from numerical equilibria. One of them requires all functions, necessary for the client code, at all necessary positions to be supplied by the equilibrium codes. This approach works only for closely related pairs of codes, making them highly dependent on each other. It requires excessive storage capacities because the required data may not be very smooth. This approach is not-suitable also for the situation when the client codes need physics variables at unpredictable positions inside the plasma. The other approach uses only primitive information from the equilibrium codes, such as coordinates of grid points and a few radial profiles. Then, the client codes generate all the necessary functions from equilibrium data with their own mappers, which use interpolation and numerical differentiation of original data, both causing convergence problems in the client codes. Solution method: The Equilibrium Spline Interface (ESI), is proposed as a universal buffer between the equilibrium codes and the other plasma physics codes. ESI possesses comprehensive information about magnetic configuration and is able to provide it to magnetic confinement codes in the ready to use form.

The force due to the inner fluid is evaluated using Navier-Stokes equation. Also, Mori-Tanaka model is employed to take into account the agglomeration effect of SiO2 nanoparticles. The mathematical model of the structure is developed based on the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and the governing equations are derived using energy method and Hamilton's principle.

They are also termed as infection stones as these are associated with urinary tract infections. Numerous studies have been carried out to examine the growth and inhibition of struvite stones. Objective This review summarizes various reports on the factors responsible for inducing struvite stones in the kidney and gives a detailed account of studies on inhibition of growth of struvite crystals. Results The presence of urea-splitting bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis and alkaline pH plays a crucial role in struvite formation. In vitro inhibition of struvite stones by various chemical agents were examined mainly in artificial urine whereas inhibition by herbal extracts was studied in vitro by gel diffusion technique. Herbal extracts of curcumin, Boerhaavia diffusa Linn, Rotula aquatica and many other plants, as well as some chemicals like pyrophosphate, acetohydroxamic acid, disodium EDTA and trisodium citrate, were reported to successfully inhibit struvite formation. Conclusion The present review recapitulates various factors affecting the growth of struvite urinary stones and the inhibitory role of certain chemicals and herbal extracts. Most of the tested plants are edible hence can be easily consumed without any adverse effects whereas the side effects of chemicals are unknown due to lack of toxicity studies. Thus, the use of herbal extracts might serve as an alternate and safe therapy for prevention of struvite stones. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Acetohydroxamic acid; Calculi; Herbal extracts; Kidney; Proteus mirabilis; Pyrophosphate",,2-s2.0-85030873756

Under ultrasound guidance, an eighteen-gauge needle was placed inside the cyst cavity, and a guidewire was introduced followed by sequential dilation up to 28 F. The extra-parenchymal portion of cyst wall was dissociated and incised using either a Thulium or Holmium laser, and a pathological examination was performed. Renal calculi were treated simultaneously. For peripelvic cyst patients, one end of a double-J stent was inserted into the cyst cavity to prevent auto-closure.

Although event-based processing system has been widely used in various applications, however, consistency of event processing is still an open issue need further exploration. The inconsistency problem produces inaccurate detection result and corrupts the system correctness. In this paper, we propose a semantic approach for event modeling and detection model transformation with a semantic calculus system. Particularly, we first propose a complex event semantic model, OntoEvent, and define several key operators and properties to describe the logic, temporal and attribute relations in complex events. Second, we propose the concept of event constraint and elaborate the occurrence, temporal, and attribute functions to formalize the semantic implications in OntoEvent model. On that basis, we present the extraction rules and establish a calculus mechanism for constraints based on axioms. With these works, an automata-based detection model, named OntoCEP (Ontology-based Complex Event Detection), and a pipelined procedure for the assembly from constraints to OntoCEP model is proposed. The procedure is composed of several sequential phases and the consistency in each assembly phase is proved. Therefore, we establish a semantic-consistent mapping mechanism from event to detection model in the form of constraints. Experiments and evaluations prove that our approach ensure the consistency with event and detection models. Besides, our detection model consumes less computational resources and outperforms other selected benchmarked models in terms of computational efficiency and processing capability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Consistency; Data stream; Event processing; Internet of things; Ontology; Semantic","Calculations; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Data mining; Internet of things; Ontology; Attribute functions; Complex event detection; Computational resources; Consistency; Data stream; Event Processing; Processing capability; Processing systems; Semantics",2-s2.0-85029852331

This paper presents a method to determine pharmacokinetic parameters based on an andante constant-rate intravenous infusion. A mathematical model of the constant-rate intravenous infusion combined with the elimination of first-order kinetics was established. During infusion, the accumulation tendency of drugs was deduced as {C}={t}={C}={{0}}+({C}={ss}-{C}{{0}})\cdot (1-{e}^{-Kt}) C t = C 0 + (C s s-C 0) (1-e-K t) using the principle of calculus. Then, the method to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters was summed up. After collecting the blood drug concentration (C t )-Time (t) data from a constant-rate (v) infusion period, an exponential regression analysis was conducted to obtain the elimination rate constant (K) and plateau concentration (C ss ). Then, the half-life (t 1/2 ), apparent volume of distribution (V d ) and clearance rate (CL) were calculated based on the equations, t 1/2 = 0.693/K, V d = (v/K)/C ss and CL = v/C ss, respectively.

Since the seminal work of Feller, we know that virtually any one-dimensional, strong, homogeneous, continuous Markov process can be uniquely characterized via its infinitesimal generator and the generator's domain of definition. Unlike standard diffusions like Brownian motion, processes with spatial delay spend positive time at a single point of space. Interestingly, the set of times that a delay process spends at its delay point is nowhere dense and forms a positive measure Cantor set. The domain of definition of the generator has restrictions involving second derivatives. In this paper we provide a pathwise characterization for processes with delay in terms of an SDE and an occupation time formula involving the symmetric local time. This characterization provides an explicit Doob-Meyer decomposition, demonstrating that such processes are semi-martingales and that all of stochastic calculus including Itô formula and Girsanov formula applies. We also establish an occupation time formula linking the time that the process spends at a delay point with its symmetric local time there.

Gallstones are biomineralizations formed in the gallbladder which are able to trap trace elements from the bile. Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to analyze gallstone cross-sections to trace the elemental abundances and correlate them with the principal phases constituting gallstones, namely cholesterol, Ca bilirubinate salts, Ca carbonate, and Ca phosphate. Five different types of gallstones (pure, mixed, and composite cholesterol stones, pigment stone, and carbonate stone) were chosen according to a previous classification based on phase characterization by different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. These data were combined with bulk solution ICP-MS/OES analyses for total elemental concentrations. The results indicated that cholesterol has a zero capacity to retain elements except for Ca. Hence, pure cholesterol stones contained the lowest bulk metal concentrations, and the metals were found in the scarce carbonate and phosphate phases in these calculi. Calcium and trace element concentrations increased in other types of gallstones along with increasing amount of bilirubinate, carbonates and phosphates; pigment stones being the most enriched in metals. Phosphates were the principal carriers of Ca, P, Na, Mg, Mn, Fe, Pb, and Cd, whereas carbonate phases were enriched in Ca, Mg, Na, and Mn in order of decreasing abundance. Bilirubinate on the other hand was enriched in Ca, Cu, Ag, and Ni. The higher trace metal affinities of bilirubinate and phosphate explain the elevated metal concentrations observed in the pigment stones. These results give new insight to the trace metal behavior in the gallstone formation and the metal accumulation in the human body, validating the possible use of these biomineralizations as a proxy for exposure to metal pollution. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Bilirubinate; Biomineralization; Ca carbonate; Ca phosphate; Cholesterol; Pigment stone","bilirubin; cadmium; calcium; calcium carbonate; cholesterol; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; nickel; silver; sodium; trace metal; Article; binding affinity; bioaccumulation; biomineralization; black pigment stone; carbonate stone; cholesterol stone; composite cholesterol stone; gallstone; human; human tissue; long term exposure; mass spectrometry; mining; mixed cholesterol stone; pollution; priority journal; pure cholesterol stone; Spain",2-s2.0-85029602322

Methods: This work analyses EPN cases from the London North West Healthcare NHS Trust from October 2006 to July 2015 (population ≈ 850,000). Diagnosis and stage were confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Demographic, clinical, biochemical and microbiological characteristics were assessed. Treatment modalities were medical management, minimally invasive management (MIM) and surgical. Immediate and 6-month outcomes were analysed. Results: Thirteen cases were identified (f = 8, m = 5) from 5525 CT scans. EPN occurred in patients with diabetes mellitus (n = 11, 84.6%), hypertension (n = 10, 76.9%) or urinary tract calculi (n = 7, 53.85%). Unilateral EPN occurred predominantly (n = 11, 84.6%); 46.1% (n = 6) were class 1 or 2 and 53.8% (n = 7) class 3 or 4. Escherichia coli was most commonly cultured (n = 5, 38.46%). All patients received antibiotics, and ten cases required MIM. Two patients had a delayed nephrectomy, both survived. Mortality was 15.4% (n = 2, grade 1 and 3a), both died acutely post-MIM, neither underwent emergency nephrectomy. At 6 months, eight patients had ongoing renal impairment. No specific poor prognostic factors were identifiable. Conclusions: Patients with low-grade EPN may also have a high mortality rate. In the two cases who died, earlier consideration for nephrectomy may have been prudent. It may be beneficial to have a low threshold for prompt emergency nephrectomy in severe cases and where MIM treatment has failed.

However, there is little evidence on the natural history of these calculi if SWL fails. We set to look at the effectiveness of SWL in patients with a single, previously untreated renal stone and the natural history of those stones that failed treatment. We retrospectively reviewed all data from our prospectively collected database of patients undergoing a first treatment for a single renal stone between October 2010 and November 2013. Outcomes after SWL were categorised as success, subsequent intervention needed or conservative management. The medical records of patients managed conservatively were reviewed to determine whether further intervention was required and why. We further sought to define, in those patients where SWL failed, whether subsequent active intervention was needed. For the remainder, we examined whether conservative management was a reasonable management option. 313 patients fitted the inclusion criteria. Of these, 144 were treated successfully. Of the 170 patients with a residual stone, 51 went on to flexible ureteroscopy directly at their next clinical review mainly due to persistent symptoms. 79 patients were managed conservatively, and for 39 follow-up data were unavailable as their follow-up was at a different hospital. 63 patients (80%) were successfully managed conservatively with no recurrence of symptoms over the follow-up period (mean 2 years 4 months). 16 (20%) patients that were initially managed conservatively required subsequent intervention. Of these, 87% had a stone in an upper pole calyx. Conservative management of renal stones after failed SWL is a suitable option for asymptomatic patients with stones not located in the upper pole. For patients with upper pole stones, early intervention is warranted due to the high risk of requiring intervention. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Lithotripsy; Stones; Surveillance; Urolithiasis","adult; aged; Article; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; controlled study; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; female; flexible ureteroscopy; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; medical record; nephrolithiasis; priority journal; retrospective study; solitary kidney; treatment failure; ureteroscopy",2-s2.0-85015255395

A systematic search was performed in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library for articles published before March 2016. Twenty-six studies with 2775 patients were included. The primary outcome was the number of patients with successful stone expulsion. The data were subdivided into three groups according to duration of follow-up. A standard network model was established in each subgroup. In 15-day follow-up results, SUCRA outcome showed the ranking of effects was: doxazosin > tamsulosin > rowatinex > nifedipine > terazosin (88.6, 77.4, 58.6, 32.2 and 30.4, respectively).

Whilst there has been a rise in the number of original studies published on ureteroscopy (URS) in children, critical review still remains under-reported. Recent Findings: A Cochrane style systematic review was performed to identify all original articles on URS (minimum of 25 cases) for stone disease in paediatric patients between Jan. 1996 and Dec. 2016. Based on the number of reported cases, centres were divided into medium (25–49 cases) and high (≥ 50 cases) volume studies. Thirty-four studies (2758 children) satisfied our search criteria and were included in this review. The mean stone size was 8.6 mm with an overall stone-free rate (SFR) of 90.4% (range 58–100). Medium-volume centres reported a mean SFR of 94.1% (range 87.5–100), whilst high-volume centres reported a mean SFR of 88.1% (range 58–98.5). Mean number of sessions to achieve stone-free status in medium-volume and high-volume groups was 1.1 and 1.2 procedures/patient respectively. The overall complication rate was 11.1% (327/2994). Breakdown by Clavien grade was as follows: Clavien I 69% and Clavien II/III 31%. There were no Clavien IV/V complications, and no mortality was recorded across any of the studies. The overall failure to access rate was 2.5% (76/2944). Medium-volume and high-volume studies had overall complication rates of 6.9% (37/530) and 12.1% (287/2222) respectively, but there was no significant difference in major or minor complications between these two groups. Summary: Ureteroscopy is a safe and effective treatment for paediatric stone disease. Medium-volume centres can achieve equally high SFRs and safety profiles as high-volume centres. Despite the rarity of paediatric stone disease, our findings might increase the uptake of paediatric URS procedures. © 2017, The Author(s).","Complications; Paediatric; Success; Ureteroscopy; Urolithiasis; Volume",,2-s2.0-85032015017

PNL in supine position has important advantages over prone positon. However, studies comparing prone and supine positions for PNL in staghorn stone patients have conflicting results, and the aim of the current study was to compare prone and supine positions for PNL in staghorn stone cases. Patients and methods: Data of patients underwent PNL for staghorn stones in supine or prone position by a single urologist were collected prospectively. The supine and prone position groups were compared for stone free rate (SFR) and complication rates. All patients were evaluated with NCCT for evaluation of SFR. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables and Student t test was applied for continuous variables of the treatment groups. Results: The groups were similar for demographic and stone-related characteristics. Multi-caliceal and intercostal access was more common in prone position. Operation duration was significantly shorter and hemoglobin drop was significantly less in supine group. SFR was 64.1 and 60.4% in the supine and prone groups, respectively (p = 0.72). Complication rates were similar in the two groups but Clavien III complications were observed in two patients in the prone group. Conclusions: PNL in supine position is an effective treatment for management of staghorn stones. The need for multi-caliceal and intercostal puncture is less when combined with retrograde intrarenal surgery. PNL in supine position should be considered as primary treatment option in staghorn stone cases. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Complications; Endoscopy combined intrarenal surgery; Percutaneous nephrolithotomy; Staghorn stone; Stone free rate; Supine position","hemoglobin; adult; Article; bleeding; blood transfusion; chi square test; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; colon perforation; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; demography; female; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; operation duration; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; postoperative complication; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; prone position; prospective study; staghorn stone; Student t test; supine position; treatment outcome",2-s2.0-85016431445

CGM data was analyzed to find optimal values of parameters by using ordinary least squares fitting or maximum likelihood estimation using a kernel-density approximation. Matlab and R programs have been developed for each model to find optimal values of the parameters to fit observed data and to test the usefulness of each model.

To this end we focus on the mean curvature flow of a topological annulus with inner boundary meeting a standard n-sphere in ℝn+1 perpendicularly and outer boundary fixed to an (n−1)-sphere with radius R &gt; 1 translated by a vector hen+1 for h ∈ ℝ where {ei}i=1,&amp;,n+1 is the standard basis of ℝn+1.

Methods: A systematic literature review was performed up to June 2016 using Pubmed and Ovid databases to identify pertinent studies. The PRISMA criteria were followed for article selection. Separate searches were done using a combinations of several search terms: “laser lithotripsy”, “ureteroscopy”, “extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy”, “ESWL”, “rapid”, “immediate”, “early”, “delayed”, “late”, “ureteral stones”, “kidney stones”, “renal stones”. Only titles related to emergent/rapid/immediate/early (as viably defined in each study) versus delayed/late treatment of ureteral stones with either URS and/or ESWL were considered for screening. Demographics and operative outcomes were compared between emergent and delayed lithotripsy. RevMan review manager software was used to perform data analysis. Results: Four studies comparing emergent (n = 526) versus delayed (n = 987) URS and six studies comparing emergent (n = 356) versus delayed (n = 355) SWL were included in the analysis. Emergent URS did not show any significant difference in terms of stone-free rate (91.2 versus 90.9%; OR 1.04; CI 0.71, 1.52; p = 0.84), complication rate (8.7% for emergent versus 11.5% for delayed; OR 0.94; CI 0.65, 1.36; p = 0.74) and need for auxiliary procedures (OR 0.85; CI 0.42, 1.7; p = 0.85) when compared to delayed URS. Emergent ESWL was associated with a higher likelihood of stone free status (OR 2.2; CI 1.55, 3.17; p < 0.001) and a lower likelihood of need for auxiliary maneuvers (OR 0.49; CI 0.33, 0.72; p < 0.001) than the delayed procedure. No differences in complication rates were noticed between the emergent and delayed ESWL (p = 0.37). Conclusions: Emergent lithotripsy, either ureteroscopic or extracorporeal, can be offered as an effective and safe treatment for patients with symptomatic ureteral stone. If amenable to ESWL, based on stone and patient characteristics, an emergent approach should be strongly considered. Ureteroscopy in the emergent setting is mostly reserved for distally located stones. The implementation of these therapeutic approaches is likely to be dictated by their availability. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Emergency; Shock wave lithotripsy; Ureteral stone; Ureteroscopy","Article; comparative study; emergency care; emergency ward; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; hospital admission; human; laser lithotripsy; nephrolithiasis; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; priority journal; systematic review; therapy delay; treatment outcome; ureter obstruction; ureter stone; ureteroscopy; x-ray computed tomography",2-s2.0-85013673275

However, the experimental evidence provided in this work surprisingly shows that tight sandstone can deform in a viscoelastic way. Such an unexpected observation poses a challenge in accurately modelling the deformation process. We solve this problem by adopting the fractional Maxwell model to successfully derive the constitutive equation of tight sandstone, based on which not only all the experimental data can be interpreted quantitatively, but also reasonable and consistent predictions as to tight sandstone's long-term deformation behaviour can be made. We then investigate the typicality of our results in China's Changqing oilfield, which is one major centre of tight gas production and where the rock samples for experiments are obtained. It is estimated that a non-negligible portion of 18% tight sandstone samples in this area will probably display viscoelasticity.

From observable state variables, we want to estimate the connectivity of a model of such a network and determine the full state of the model at the termination of a temporal observation window during which measurements transfer information to a model of the network. The model state at the termination of a measurement window acts as an initial condition for predicting the future behavior of the network. This allows the validation (or invalidation) of the model as a representation of the dynamical processes producing the observations. Once the model has been tested against new data, it may be utilized as a predictor of responses to innovative stimuli or forcing. We describe a general framework for the tasks involved in the ""inverse"" problem of determining properties of a model built to represent measured output from physical, biological, or other processes when the measurements are noisy, the model has errors, and the state of the model is unknown when measurements begin. This framework is called statistical data assimilation and is the best one can do in estimating model properties through the use of the conditional probability distributions of the model state variables, conditioned on observations. There is a very broad arena of applications of the methods described. These include numerical weather prediction, properties of nonlinear electrical circuitry, and determining the biophysical properties of functional networks of neurons.

It is shown with extensive simulations that all the F-ROM exhibit closed-loop stability.

The common boundary is referred to as the junction hyperplane. The parabolic equations on the half-hyperplanes are in non-divergence form, fully non-linear and possibly degenerate, and they do degenerate and are quasi-convex along the junction hyperplane. More precisely, along the junction hyperplane the nonlinearities do not depend on second order derivatives and their sublevel sets with respect to the gradient variable are convex. The parabolic equations are supplemented with a non-linear boundary condition of Neumann type, referred to as a generalized junction condition, which is compatible with the maximum principle. Our main result asserts that imposing a generalized junction condition in a weak sense reduces to imposing an effective one in a strong sense.

Here, M1 and M2 are weighted volumes of {u⩽0}∩Ω and {u&gt;0}∩Ω respectively, and Φ is a nonnegative function of two real variables. We show that, for this problem, the Bernoulli constant, which determines the gradient jump condition across the free boundary, is of global type and it is indeed determined by the weighted volumes of the phases. In particular, the Bernoulli condition that we obtain can be seen as a pressure prescription in terms of the volume of the two phases of the minimizer itself (and therefore it depends on the minimizer itself and not only on the structural constants of the problem). Another property of this type of problems is that the minimizer in Ω is not necessarily a minimizer in a smaller subdomain, due to the nonlinear structure of the problem. Due to these features, this problem is highly unstable as opposed to the classical case studied by Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman. It also interpolates the classical case, in the sense that the blow-up limits of u are minimizers of the Alt–Caffarelli–Friedman functional. Namely, the energy of the problem somehow linearizes in the blow-up limit. As a special case, we can deal with the energy levels generated by the volume term Φ(0,r2)≃r2 [Formula presented], which interpolates the Athanasopoulos–Caffarelli–Kenig–Salsa energy, thanks to the isoperimetric inequality.

Since the performance of SA-AC scheme depends on the TP of the members in a group, the analytical model presents a joint view for the downlink (DL) and the uplink (UL) with TP of the members in a group. We present simple and closed form expressions for the DL and UL joint probability by using Poisson point process (PPP). Furthermore, we analyze the dynamic TP and the optimal TP to maximize the DL/UL joint probability, for which the inclusion of a member and the transmission of the member is determined by the DL and UL thresholds. Since the requirement of the DL/UL joint probability varies with the type of services, the optimal TP has to be determined for an efficient group communication service. The performance of the SA-AC scheme with the optimal TP is demonstrated, and it is shown to be superior over the other schemes. © 2017, The Author(s).","Group communication; Spatial Aloha; Stochastic geometry","Access control; Geometry; Probability; Stochastic systems; Wireless networks; Closed-form expression; Group communications; Large-scale group communication; Optimal transmission; Poisson point process; Slotted ALOHA protocol; Spatial Aloha; Stochastic geometry; Distributed computer systems",2-s2.0-85028344345

We used nationwide Swedish hospital records to identify patients with urinary tract stones (N = 211,718) and cancer registration data for cancer patients for years 1987 to 2012. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancer were calculated after the last medical contact for urinary tract stones. All cancers were increased after kidney (SIR 1.54, 95%CI: 1.50-1.58), ureter (1.44, 1.42-1.47), mixed (1.51, 1.44-1.58) and bladder stones (1.63, 1.57-1.70). The risk of kidney cancer was increased most of all cancers after kidney, ureter and mixed stones while bladder cancer was increased most after bladder stones. All SIRs decreased steeply in the course of follow-up time. Tumour sizes were smaller in kidney cancer and in situ colon cancers were more common in patients diagnosed after urinary tract stones compared to all patients. The results suggest that surveillance bias influenced the result which somewhat surprisingly appeared to extend past 10 years of follow-up and include cancers at distant anatomical sites.

We introduce a nestedness criterion relating the cost to the densities, under which it becomes possible to solve this problem uniquely by constructing an optimal map one level set at a time. This map is continuous if the target density has connected support. We use level-set dynamics to develop and quantify a local regularity theory for this map and the Kantorovich potentials solving the dual linear program. We identify obstructions to global regularity through examples. More specifically, fix probability densities f and g on open sets X ⊂ ℝm and Y ⊂ ℝn with m ≥ n ≥ 1. Consider transporting f onto g so as to minimize the cost –s(x, y). We give a nondegeneracy condition on s ∈ C1,1 that ensures the set of x paired with [g-a.e.] y ∈ Y lie in a codimension-n submanifold of X. Specializing to the case m &gt; n = 1, we discover a nestedness criterion relating s to (f,g) that allows us to construct a unique optimal solution in the form of a map F: X ➔ Y. When s ∈ C2 ∩ W3, 1 and g and f are bounded, the Kantorovich dual potentials (u,υ) satisfy υ ∈ C1,1 loc(Y), and the normal velocity V of F-1(y) with respect to changes in y is given by V(x) = υ''– Syy/ǀDx Syǀ (x, F(x)). Positivity of V locally implies a Lipschitz bound on f; moreover, υ ∈ C2 if F-1(y) intersects ∂X ∈ C1 transversally.

In this model, doves exemplify the cooperative behavior without intraspecies conflict, while hawks represent the aggressive behavior. In the absence of hawks, doves share the resource equally and avoid conflict, but having hawks around lead to doves escaping without fighting. Conversely, hawks fight for the resource at the cost of getting injured. Nevertheless, if doves are present in sufficient number to expel the hawks, they can aggregate to protect the resource, and thus avoid being plundered by hawks. We derive and numerically solve an exact equation for the evolution of the system in both finite and infinite well-mixed populations, finding the conditions for stable coexistence between both species.

Here, we propose a continuously tunable polarization-independent passband-flattened fiber comb filter with two BEs using a polarization-diversified loop structure for the first time. The proposed filter consists of a polarization beam splitter and two groups of a half-wave plate, quarter-wave plate, and polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF).

Orientation angle sets of the four waveplates, which can induce an arbitrary phase shift from 0 to 2π in the passband-flattened transmittance function, are found from the filter transmittance derived using Jones matrix formulation. From theoretical spectral analysis, it is confirmed that passband-flattened comb spectra can be continuously tuned. Theoretical prediction is verified by experimental demonstration.

One of our main findings establishes that, as soon as any steady-state solution of the non-spatial model is linearly unstable somewhere in the inhabiting territory, Ω any steady state of the spatial counterpart perturbing from it therein (as the diffusion rates, d1,d2, move away from 0) must be linearly unstable. From this general principle one can derive a number of rather astonishing consequences, as the multiplicity of the coexistence steady states when the non-spatial model exhibits founder control competition somewhere in Ω say Ωbi, even if Ωbi is negligible empirically. Actually, this is the first available multiplicity result for small diffusion rates. Finally, based on a celebrated identity by M.

Service time of a customer has phase-type (PH) distribution. Servers are subject to breakdowns and repairs. Breakdowns occurrence moments are defined by the Markovian Arrival Process (MAP). The breakdown causes a failure of any server, which is not under repair. When a server fails the repair period starts immediately. The duration of this period has PH distribution.

If he/she does not see an idle server, the customer goes to the buffer with some probability and permanently leaves the system with the complementary probability.

The proposed method has four steps; the first step is initial segmentation using mean-shift algorithm. The second step is giving markers manually to indicate the object and background region. The third step is determining the fuzzy region or ambiguous region in the images. The last step is fuzzy region merging using fuzzy similarity measurement. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to segment natural images and dental panoramic images successfully with the average value of misclassification error (ME) 1.96% and 5.47%, respectively.

However, it has been shown that, by means of a set-valued Lie bracket [f1,f2]set (which is defined everywhere), one can generalize classical results like the Commutativity theorem and Frobenius’ theorem, as well as a Chow–Rashevski’s theorem involving Lie brackets of degree 2 (we call ‘degree’ the number of vector fields contained in a formal bracket). As it might be expected, these results are consequences of the validity of an asymptotic formula similar to the one holding true in the regular case. Aiming to more advanced applications—say, a general Chow–Rashevski’s theorem or higher order conditions for optimal controls—we address here the problem of defining, for any m&gt; 2 and any formal bracket B of degree m, a Lie bracket B(f1, … , fm) corresponding to vector fields (f1, … , fm) lacking classical regularity requirements. A major complication consists in finding the right extension of the degree 2 bracket, namely a notion of bracket which admits an asymptotic formula. In fact, it is known that a mere iteration of the construction performed for the case m= 2 is not compatible with the validity of an asymptotic formula. We overcome this difficulty by introducing a set-valued bracket x↦ Bs e t(f1, … , fm) (x) , defined at each point x as the convex hull of the set of limits along suitable d-tuples of sequences of points converging to x. The number d depends only on the formal bracket B and is here called the diff-degree of B. It counts the maximal order of differentiations involved in B(g1, … , gm) (for any smooth m-tuple of vector fields (g1, … , gm)). The main result of the paper is an asymptotic formula valid for the bracket Bs e t(f1, … , fm) (x). © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Asymptotic formulas; Iterated Lie brackets; Nonsmooth vector fields",,2-s2.0-85032675595

Let n≥ 4 be an even integer, a solved binary puzzle is an n× n binary array that satisfies the following conditions: (1) no three consecutive ones and no three consecutive zeros in each row and each column; (2) the number of ones and zeros must be equal in each row and in each column; (3) there can be no repeated row and no repeated column. This paper proposes three approaches to solve the puzzle. The first method is based on a complete backtrack-based search algorithm. The idea is to propagate and fill an unsolved binary puzzle according to the three constraints, followed by a random guess if the puzzle remains unsolved. The second method of solving a binary puzzle is by representing it as an instance of a Boolean satisfiability problem which allows the solution for a binary puzzle to be obtained using SAT solvers. The third approach is based on expressing a binary puzzle as a system of polynomial equations over the binary field F2. The set of solutions for the equation system implies the solutions for the binary puzzle and it is obtained by computing a Gröbner basis of the ideal generated by the polynomials.

The flux of the photons inside the irradiation cell is introduced as the function of monopole, dipoles and quadruples in the Cartesian coordinate system. For the source distribution of the Gammacell-220, the values of the multipole moments are specified by direct integrating. To confirm the validation of the presented methods, the flux distribution inside the irradiation cell was determined utilizing MCNP simulations as well as experimental measurements. To measure the flux inside the irradiation cell, Amber dosimeters were employed. The calculated values of the flux were in agreement with the values obtained by simulations and measurements, especially in the central zones of the irradiation cell. In order to show that the present method is a good approximation to determine the flux in the irradiation cell, the values of the multipole moments were obtained by fitting the simulation and experimental data using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

These avoiding waypoints determined by computing the contact points between the ellipsoid and planes the normal vector of which are corresponded to the vehicle velocity vector. The information about geometry and dimension of the ellipsoid are computed from the information about obstacle geometry, which is assumed to be available, either from mission database or predicted from UAV’s ground detection system.

Individuals requesting others to commit to cooperate (proposers) incur a cost, while their co-players are not necessarily required to pay any, allowing them to free-ride on the proposal investment cost (acceptors). Although there is a clear complementarity in these behaviours, no dynamic evidence is currently available that proves that they coexist in different forms of commitment creation. Using a stochastic evolutionary model allowing for mixed population states, we identify non-Trivial roles of acceptors as well as the importance of intention recognition in commitments. In the one-shot prisoner's dilemma, alliances between proposers and acceptors are necessary to isolate defectors when proposers do not know the acceptance intentions of the others. However, when the intentions are clear beforehand, the proposers can emerge by themselves. In repeated games with noise, the incapacity of proposers and acceptors to set up alliances makes the emergence of the first harder whenever the latter are present. As a result, acceptors will exploit proposers and take over the population when an apology-forgiveness mechanism with too low apology cost is introduced, and hence reduce the overall cooperation level. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"forgiveness; human; noise; population model; prisoner dilemma; stochastic model",2-s2.0-85019982198

However, little is known about the effects of private information on social systems. Most indirect reciprocity studies assume public monitoring in which individuals share a single assessment for each individual. Here, we consider a private monitoring system that loosens such an unnatural assumption. We explore the stable norms in the private system using an individual-based simulation. We have three main findings. First, narrow and unstable cooperation: cooperation in private monitoring becomes unstable and the restricted norms cannot maintain cooperative regimes while they can in public monitoring. Second, stable coexistence of discriminators and unconditional cooperators: under private monitoring, unconditional cooperation can play a role in keeping a high level of cooperation in tolerant norm situations.

Despite their restricted form in the original DFOL formulation, bridge rules have influenced several works in the areas of heterogeneous knowledge integration, modular knowledge representation, and schema/ontology matching. This, in turn, has fostered extensions and modifications of the original DFOL that have never been systematically described and published.

The warm mud alters the temperature field and as a result thaws the permafrost. To determine the static temperature of the formation and permafrost thickness, one must wait for some period after completion of drilling before conducting temperature logs. The duration of the refreezing of the layer thawed during drilling strongly depends on the natural temperature of formation; therefore, the rocks at the bottom of the permafrost refreeze very slowly. A lengthy restoration period of up to ten years or more is required to determine the temperature and thickness of permafrost with a sufficient accuracy. In this study, we present a new method of estimation of the time of refreezing of thawed formations (surrounding the borehole) by utilizing temperature logs. It also shown that the same basic equation (modified Horner plot) can be used for predicting the formation temperature. To our best knowledge, this study is the first effort to determine the duration of the refreezing period. The physical basis of this approach consists of non-conventional utilizing of three temperature observations in borehole after the freezeback completion.

So, the recognition of clutters is crucial to detect targets and the role of clutters in detection cannot be ignored. The design of radar detectors and clutter classifiers are really complicated issues. Therefore, in this paper aims to classify radar clutters. The novel proposed MLP-based classifier for separating radar clutters is introduced. This classifier is designed with different hidden layers and five training algorithms. These training algorithms consist of Levenberg-Marquardt, conjugate gradient, resilient backpropagation, BFGS and one step secant algorithms. Statistical distributions are established models which widely used in the performance calculations of radar clutters. Hence In this research, Rayleigh, Log normal, Weibull and K-distribution clutters are utilized as input data. Then Burg's reflection coefficients, skewness and kurtosis are three features which applied to extract the best characteristics of input data. In the next step, the proposed classifier is tested in different conditions and the results represent that the proposed MLP-based classifier is very successful and can distinguish clutters with high accuracy. Comparing the results of proposed technique and RBF-based classifier show that proposed method is more efficient.

Since the full build of large software systems can take hours, the incremental build is a cornerstone of modern build systems. Incremental builds should only recompile deliverables whose dependencies have been changed by a developer. However, in many organizations, such dependencies still are identified by build rules that are specified and maintained (mostly) manually, typically using technologies like make. Incomplete rules lead to unspecified dependencies that can prevent certain deliverables from being rebuilt, yielding incomplete results, which leave sources and deliverables out-of-sync. In this paper, we present a case study on unspecified dependencies in the make-based build systems of the glib, openldap, linux and qt open source projects. To uncover unspecified dependencies in make-based build systems, we use an approach that combines a conceptual model of the dependencies specified in the build system with a concrete model of the files and processes that are actually exercised during the build. Our approach provides an overview of the dependencies that are used throughout the build system and reveals unspecified dependencies that are not yet expressed in the build system rules.

We are interested in two asymptotic regimes, that we investigate simultaneously: the paraxial approximation, where the wave is collimated and propagates along a privileged direction of propagation, and the white-noise limit, where random fluctuations in the background are well approximated in a statistical sense by a fractional white noise. The fractional nature of the fluctuations is reminiscent of the long-range correlations in the underlying random medium. A typical physical setting is laser beam propagation in turbulent atmosphere. Starting from the high frequency wave equation with fast non-Gaussian random oscillations in the velocity field, we derive the fractional Itô–Schrödinger equation, that is, a Schrödinger equation with potential equal to a fractional white noise. The proof involves a fine analysis of the backscattering and of the coupling between the propagating and evanescent modes. Because of the long-range dependence, classical diffusion-approximation theorems for equations with random coefficients do not apply, and we therefore use moment techniques to study the convergence. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,,2-s2.0-85026443608

The rapid advancements in computational performance, storage capacity, and big data management have allowed machine-learning techniques to improve in the areas of learning speed, non-linear data handling, and complex features identification. Machine-learning techniques have proven successful and been used in the areas of autonomous machines, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Though the application of artificial intelligence in the nuclear engineering domain has been limited, it has accurately predicted desired outcomes in some instances and has proven to be a worthwhile area of research. The objectives of this study are to create neural networks topologies to use Oregon State University's Multi-Application Small Light Water Reactor integrated test facility's data and evaluate its capability of predicting the systems behavior during various core power inputs and a loss of flow accident. This study uses data from multiple sensors, focusing primarily on the reactor pressure vessel and its internal components. As a result, the artificial neural networks are able to predict the behavior of the system with good accuracy in each scenario. Its ability to provide technical data can help decision makers to take actions more rapidly, identify safety issues, or provide an intelligent system with the potential of using pattern recognition for reactor accident identification and classification.

At each step, a vertex of the graph becomes active and its neighboring nodes become blocked. Given an initial number of vertices N growing to infinity, we study statistical properties of the proportion of explored (active or blocked) nodes in time using scaling limits. We obtain exact limits for homogeneous graphs and prove an explicit central limit theorem for the final proportion of active nodes, known as the jamming constant, through a diffusion approximation for the exploration process which can be described as a unidimensional process. We then focus on bounding the trajectories of such exploration processes on random geometric graphs, i.e., random sequential adsorption. As opposed to exploration processes on homogeneous random graphs, these do not allow for such a dimensional reduction. Instead we derive a fundamental relationship between the number of explored nodes and the discovered volume in the spatial process, and we obtain generic bounds for the fluid limit and jamming constant: bounds that are independent of the dimension of space and the detailed shape of the volume associated to the discovered node.

Stations may make a faulty decision at run time in an unreliable communication environment such as wireless medium due to the presence of transient faults. This faulty decision causes state inconsistency among the stations in the system. In this work, we extend state-based schedules to tolerate faulty decisions in environments where transient faults can occur at the communication layer.

We show that various analogs of Hindman’s theorem fail in a strong sense when one attempts to obtain uncountable monochromatic sets: Theorem 1. There exists a colouring c: R → Q, such that for every X ⊆ R with |X| = |R|, and every colour γ ∈ Q, there are two distinct elements x0, x1 of X for which c(x0 + x1) = γ. This forms a simultaneous generalization of a theorem of Hindman, Leader and Strauss and a theorem of Galvin and Shelah. Theorem 2. For every abelian group G, there exists a colouring c: G → Q such that for every uncountable X ⊆ G and every colour γ, for some large enough integer n, there are pairwise distinct elements x0,…, xn of X such that c(x0 + ・ ・ ・ + xn) = γ. In addition, it is consistent that the preceding statement remains valid even after enlarging the set of colours from Q to R. Theorem 3. Let _κ assert that for every abelian group G of cardinality κ, there exists a colouring c: G → G such that for every positive integer n, every X0,…,Xn ∈ [G]κ, and every γ ∈ G, there are x0 ∈ X0,…, xn ∈ Xn such that c(x0 + ・ ・ ・ + xn) = γ. Then (Formula Found) holds for unboundedly many uncountable cardinals κ, and it is consistent that (Formula Found) holds for all regular uncountable cardinals κ. © 2017 American Mathematical Society.","Commutative cancellative semigroups; Hindman’s theorem; JÓnsson cardinal; Strong coloring",,2-s2.0-85032257766

These metasurfaces display vast possibilities for highly sensitive chirality discrimination in biological and chemical systems. Here, we show that two-layer metasurfaces based on twisted nanorods can generate giant spin-selective transmission and support engineered chirality in the near-infrared region. Two designed metasurfaces with opposite spin-selective transmission are proposed for treatment as enantiomers and can be used widely for spin selection and enhanced chiral sensing. Specifically, we demonstrate that the chirality in these proposed metasurfaces can be adjusted effectively by simply changing the orientation angle between the twisted nanorods. Our results offer simple and straightforward rules for chirality engineering in metasurfaces and suggest intriguing possibilities for the applications of such metasurfaces in spin optics and chiral sensing. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"chemistry; chirality; enantiomer; human; infrared radiation; optics",2-s2.0-85027493230

From 100 stone formers and 200 UTI patients, only four pairs of EUK/EUU isolates had identical antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.

What makes the disease the worst of all is no specific effective treatment available, its dynamics is not much researched and understood. In this article a new mathematical model incorporating both vaccination and quarantine to study the dynamics of Ebola epidemic has been developed and comprehensively analyzed using fractional derivative in the sense of the Caputo derivative of order α∈ (0 , 1 ]. The existence as well as nonnegativity of the solution to the model is also verified and the basic reproduction number is calculated. Besides, stability conditions are also checked and finally simulation is done using both the Euler method and one of the top ten most influential algorithms known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Different rates of vaccination to predict the effect of vaccination on the infected individual over time and that of quarantine are discussed. The results show that quarantine and vaccination are very effective ways to control Ebola epidemic.

We applied manual acupuncture (MA) and electrical acupuncture (EA) separately at acupoints Tianshu (ST25), Qimen (LR14), Yanglingquan (GB34), and Yidan (CO11) in forty guinea pigs (4 groups) with or without atropinization under anesthesia while Sphincter of Oddi (SO) myoelectric activities and gallbladder pressure were monitored. In both MA and EA groups, stimulation at ST25 or LR14 significantly increased the frequency and amplitude of SO myoelectrical activities and simultaneously decreased the gallbladder pressure as compared to the pre-MA and pre-EA (P < 0.05). On the contrary, stimulation at GB34 or CO11 significantly decreased SO myoelectricity and increased the gallbladder pressure (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with atropine could abolish the effect of stimulation at acupoints ST25, GB34 and LR14 (P > 0.05), although significant myoelectricity increases were still inducible with MA or EA stimulation at CO11 (P < 0.05).

However, most of the traditional matrix learning algorithms are supervised ones which require labels of all patterns. In practice, the difficult acquisition of labeled patterns is a major challenge for supervised algorithms. An effective approach to handle this problem is the manifold regularization, which is known as one of the most elegant frameworks for the semi-supervised learning (SSL). The Laplacian regularized least squares (LapRLS) is a classical vector learning algorithm following this framework. Inspired by the advantages of the matrix learning and the SSL, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised matrix learning algorithm by incorporating the manifold regularization into the matrixized least squares support vector machine (MatLSSVM), termed as Laplacian matrixized LSSVM, or LapMatLSSVM for short. MatLSSVM, which has been built by combining the merits of the matrix learning and LSSVM, is a promising supervised algorithm. As an extension of MatLSSVM to the SSL, LapMatLSSVM can not only directly operate on matrix patterns, but also effectively exploit the geometric information embedded in unlabeled matrix patterns. Moreover, its generalization risk bound is tighter than that of LapRLS in terms of the Rademacher complexity. For the implementation, LapMatLSSVM learns in an iterative manner, and solves a least squares optimization problem at each iteration. Extensive experiments have been conducted across two kinds of datasets: image datasets and UCI datasets. Experimental results confirm the benefits of the proposed algorithm. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","LapRLS; Manifold regularization; MatLSSVM; Matrix learning; Semi-supervised learning","Iterative methods; Laplace transforms; Optimization; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Vectors; Classification performance; LapRLS; Least squares support vector machines; Low computational complexity; Manifold regularizations; MatLSSVM; Semi- supervised learning; Semi-supervised learning (SSL); Learning algorithms",2-s2.0-85030839207

By fully exploiting the Toeplitz-like structure of the resulting linear system, we provide a detailed spectral analysis of the coefficient matrix at each time step, both in the case of constant and variable diffusion coefficients. Such a spectral analysis has a very crucial role, since it can be used for designing fast and robust iterative solvers. In particular, we employ the obtained spectral information to define a Galerkin multigrid method based on the classical linear interpolation as grid transfer operator and damped-Jacobi as smoother, and to prove the linear convergence rate of the corresponding two-grid method. The theoretical analysis suggests that the proposed grid transfer operator is strong enough for working also with the V-cycle method and the geometric multigrid. On this basis, we introduce two computationally favourable variants of the proposed multigrid method and we use them as preconditioners for Krylov methods.

Therefore, long-Term routine urological surveillance is recommended. Objective: To describe urological surveillance in individuals with longterm SCI and to determine factors associated with urologic ultrasonography (UU) outcome. Methods: Wheelchair-dependent individuals with an SCI for 10 years or more were included. A medical assessment was done in 8 participating rehabilitation centers. The International Lower Urinary Tract Function Basic SCI Data Set was used to assess bladder-emptying methods and previous surgical procedures on the urinary tract. We studied urological surveillance: whether participants had routine urological checkups (including UU) and when latest urodynamic study was performed. Latest UU (performed <1 year ago) was retrieved or, when lacking, UU was performed as part of our study. Results: Median time since injury (TSI) was 22.0 years. Overall, 39% of the 282 participants did not have routine urological checkups and 33% never had a urodynamic study performed. UU data ( N = 243) revealed dilatation of the upper urinary tract (UUT) in 4.5% of the participants and urinary stones in 5.7%. Abnormal UU outcome was associated with increasing TSI, nontraumatic SCI, and previous surgical bladder or UUT stone removal. UU outcome was not associated with routine urological checkups or type of bladder-emptying method. Conclusions: Over one-Third of Dutch individuals with long-Term SCI did not receive routine urological surveillance. UU outcome was not associated with routine urological checkups or type of bladder-emptying method.

An experimental study was conducted to compare the artistic expression and originality between students learning with reflection support and learning with direct teaching in replication. Students learning with reflection support demonstrated significantly higher scores not only in four skill subcomponents—brushwork diversity, brushwork fluency, wet/dry contrast and replication similarity—and overall replication skill, but also in the originality of brushwork. Using this tablet app for continuous analysis, synthesis and practice will allow students to acquire creative illustration skills.

In this paper we give sufficient conditions under which this stabilization can be achieved by means of sparse feedback controls, i.e., feedback controls having the smallest possible number of nonzero components.

This tragedy can be escaped if cooperators have the possibility to invest in reward funds that are shared exclusively among cooperators (prosocial rewarding). Yet, the presence of defectors who do not contribute to the public good but do reward themselves (antisocial rewarding) deters cooperation in the absence of additional countermeasures. A recent simulation study suggests that spatial structure is sufficient to prevent antisocial rewarding from deterring cooperation. Here we reinvestigate this issue assuming mixed strategies and weak selection on a game-theoretic model of social interactions, which we also validate using individual-based simulations. We show that increasing reward funds facilitates the maintenance of prosocial rewarding but prevents its invasion, and that spatial structure can sometimes select against the evolution of prosocial rewarding. Our results suggest that, even in spatially structured populations, additional mechanisms are required to prevent antisocial rewarding from deterring cooperation in public goods dilemmas. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"reward; simulation; social interaction; theoretical model",2-s2.0-85025819346

SoS often support critical domains, being required to exhibit a reliable operation, specially because people’s safety relies on their services. In this direction, simulations enable the validation of different operational scenarios in a controlled environment, allowing a benchmarking of its response as well as revealing possible breaches that could lead to failures. However, simulations are traditionally manual, demanding a high level of human intervention, being costly and error-prone. A stimuli generator could aid in by continuously providing data to trigger a SoS simulation and maintaining its operation. Methods: We established a model-based approach termed Stimuli-SoS to support the creation of stimuli generators to be used in SoS simulations. Stimuli-SoS uses software architecture descriptions for automating the creation of such generators. Specifically, this approach transforms SoSADL, a formal architectural description language for SoS, into dynamic models expressed in DEVS, a simulation formalism. We carried out a case study in which Stimuli-SoS was used to automatically produce stimuli generators for a simulation of a flood monitoring SoS. Results: We run simulations of a SoS architectural configuration with 69 constituent systems, i.e., 42 sensors, 9 crowdsourcing systems, and 18 drones. Stimuli generators were automatically generated for each type of constituent. These stimuli generators were capable of receiving the input data from the database and generating the expected stimuli for the constituents, allowing to simulate constituent systems interoperations into the flood monitoring SoS. Using Stimuli-SoS, we simulated 38 days of flood monitoring in little more than 6 h. Stimuli generators correctly forwarded data to the simulation, which was able to reproduce 29 flood alerts triggered by the SoS during a flooding event. In particular, Stimuli-SoS is almost 65 times more productive than a manual approach to producing data for the same type of simulation. Conclusions: Our approach succeeded in automatically deriving a functional stimuli generator that can reproduce environmental conditions for simulating a SoS. In particular, we presented new contributions regarding productivity and automation for the use of a model-based approach in SoS engineering. © 2017, The Author(s).","Automatic generation; Model transformation; Simulation; Software architecture; Systems-of-systems","Computer software; Floods; Interoperability; Software architecture; Systems engineering; Architectural description languages; Architecture description; Automatic Generation; Environmental conditions; Model transformation; Simulation; Software intensive systems; Systems of systems; System of systems",2-s2.0-85032855271

However, as higher-order cooperators, survival of punishers is puzzling due to their extra cost in regulating norm violators. Previous works have highlighted the importance of individual mobility in promoting cooperation. Yet its effect on punishers remains to be explored. In this work we incorporate this feature into modeling the behavior of punishers, who are endowed with a choice between leaving current place or staying and punishing defectors. Results indicate that optimal mobility level of punishers is closely related to the cost of punishing. For considerably large cost, there exists medium tendency of migration which favors the survival of punishers. This holds for both the direct competition between punishers and defectors and the case where cooperators are involved, and can also be observed when various types of punishers with different mobility tendencies fight against defectors simultaneously. For cheap punishment, mobility does not provide with punishers more advantage even when they are initially rare. We hope our work provide more insight into understanding the role individual mobility plays in promoting public cooperation. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"behavior; competition; human; punishment",2-s2.0-85032271672

Although urinary risk factors have been measured in several of these, compelling evidence of a causal relationship has not been established. A shortcoming is that alterations in single urinary parameters rather than ratios and quotients, which provide a more synergistic risk evaluation, have been measured. Recently, we speculated about a possible association between chronic stress and stone recurrence. This presents an intriguing dichotomy of whether stress causes stones or vice versa, or whether they are linked in a self-propagating stress–stones–stress-recurrence cycle. We investigated the latter hypothesis in a retrospective case–control designed study in which we calculated urinary ratios and quotients which are regarded as diagnostic indicators of stone risk. These included Ca/Cr, Ox/Cr, Mg/Cr, Cit/Cr, urate/Cr and citrate–magnesium–calcium ratios, activity product quotient for calcium oxalate (CaOx) and relative supersaturation of CaOx, brushite and uric acid. Overnight urinary data from 128 participants comprising 31 first time (FS), 33 recurrent (RS) CaOx stone formers and 64 controls were used. All subjects had been previously assessed for chronic stress dimensions, as well as for stress caused by their stone episodes per se. Conditional and unconditional logistic regression (with a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests) and simple linear regression were used to analyse various components of the data. Although RS had more stressful life events, with greater intensity of perception than FS, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding any of the urinary risk factors. No significant association between stressful life events and any of the urinary ratios or quotients was observed. A direct causal link between stress and stone recurrence was not indicated. We believe that future studies should shift their focus from traditional urinary risk factors to other stone-forming mechanisms. However, we recognize that there is an inherent problem in attempting to solve the stress–stones dichotomy as it would be impossible to disentangle alterations in risk factors which arise from lifestyle stress and those arising from stone episodes themselves. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Chronic stress; Kidney stones; Stone recurrence; Urinary risk factors; Urinary risk quotients","calcium; calcium oxalate; calcium phosphate dibasic; chromium; citric acid; creatinine; magnesium; oxalic acid; phosphate; urate; uric acid; adult; aged; Article; case control study; chronic stress; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; perception; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; risk factor; stone formation; study design",2-s2.0-85015805135

Modern distributed stream processing engines (SPEs) address this requirement and provide low-latency and high-throughput data stream processing in cluster platforms, offering high-level programming interfaces that abstract from low-level details such as data distribution and hardware failures. The last decade saw a rapid increase in the number of available SPEs. However, each SPE defines its own processing model and standardized execution semantics have not emerged yet. This paper tackles this problem and analyzes the execution semantics of some widely adopted modern SPEs, namely Flink, Storm, Spark Streaming, Google Dataflow, and Azure Stream Analytics. We specifically target the notions of windowing and time, traditionally considered the key distinguishing factors that characterize the behavior of SPEs. We rely on the SECRET model, introduced in 2010 to analyze the windowing semantics for the SPEs available at that time. We show that SECRET models well some aspects of the behavior of modern SPEs, and we shed light on the evolution of SPEs after the introduction of SECRET by analyzing the elements that SECRET cannot fully capture. In this way, the paper contributes to the research in the area of stream processing by: (1) contrasting and comparing some widely used modern SPEs based on a formal model of their execution semantics; (2) discussing the evolution of SPEs since the introduction of the SECRET model; (3) suggesting promising research directions to direct further modeling efforts. © 2017, The Author(s).","Execution semantics; Modeling; SECRET; Stream processing; Stream processing engines; Time semantics; Windows",,2-s2.0-85018868379

Such an assessment is mainly due to easing both interpretation and computation. This becomes especially noticeable when those assessing fuzzy numbers to data have a weak knowledge, low background and little or no expertise in using fuzzy sets (as it happens when questionnaires whose responses involve a free fuzzy rating are conducted), since the required training to explain the meaning and use of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is definitely lower than that associated with other shapes. Nevertheless, a question that constantly arises in connection with this trapezoidal assessment is whether it can importantly affect the conclusions of the study involving such data. This paper aims to answer the last question from a statistical perspective. More concretely, the analysis of the influence of the choice of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to model data is to be based on the conclusions from statistical hypothesis testing about the mean values of the involved fuzzy datasets. For this purpose, the p-values of tests have been compared for trapezoidal assessment vs. other frequently used ones, like some LU assessments. The analysis is first performed by developing simulation-based pairwise comparisons, and it is later illustrated and corroborated to some extent with a real-life example. The analysis indicates that the shape of the fuzzy assessment scarcely affects statistical conclusions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Free fuzzy rating; LU fuzzy number; Random fuzzy number; Testing about means; Trapezoidal fuzzy number","Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Statistical tests; Surveys; Testing; Fuzzy assessments; Fuzzy numbers; Fuzzy rating; Hypothesis testing; Pair-wise comparison; Random experiments; Statistical hypothesis testing; Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers; Fuzzy sets",2-s2.0-85006851726

The basic idea is that if the failure-conditional probability density function of input variable is significantly different from its unconditional probability density function, then the input variable is sensitive to the failure of structure. The proposed reliability sensitivity indices contain both individual sensitivity index and interaction sensitivity index. The individual sensitivity index can measure the individual effect of input variable on the failure of structure. The asymmetrical interaction sensitivity index can measure how one input variable influences the effect of another input variable on the failure of structure. Additionally, the meanings of the proposed reliability sensitivity indices are also interpreted explicitly, and a data-driven estimation method is also proposed to estimate the proposed reliability sensitivity indices.

Results show that SP-UCI-based ANN outperforms other EA-based ANNs in the context of convergence and generalization. Results suggest that the SP-UCI algorithm possesses good potential in support of the weight training of ANN in real-word problems.

The aim of the current paper was to explore the experiences that might lead people to reduce their alcohol consumption and to compare these findings between respondents from 21 different countries. Methods Global Drug Survey is an online cross sectional, opportunistic anonymous survey. This paper includes 72,209 respondents from 21 counties with over 250 respondents (60.8% male). Results Almost a third (32.9%) of participants reported that they would like to drink less alcohol over the next 12 months, and a third thought their GP would tell them to cut down if they were honest about their drinking. The primary experiences that were rated as most likely to lead to a change in behaviour were related to physical health, sexual assault and having to seek emergency medical treatment. Respondents from Germany were more likely to select embarrassment as a motivation to reduce drinking than those from other counties. Females were more likely to report indicate motivations related to sexual regret, sexual assault or seeking treatment.

Telehealth has the potential to increase public access to healthcare in China, where large segments of the population remain underserved, yet little is known about current attitudes and use of telehealth in the country. Objective Our aim was to determine attitudes and use of telehealth in China among medical professionals and patients, as well as identify factors that may affect its use. Methods Using a custom-designed questionnaire, we performed a cross-sectional survey of medical professionals, medical students and patients at three large hospitals in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. We used a structural model to analyze the influence of factors that may affect use of telehealth. Results Of 600 questionnaires that were distributed, 550 (96.49%) were analyzed. Most respondents (63.28%) were familiar with using telehealth to “schedule medical appointments/pay medical fees online”, but relatively few (28.55%) used this feature. Nearly half of respondents were familiar with the concept of a “virtual visit” (46.18%), but only 12.18% had ever engaged in such visits. Medical professionals and students generally showed higher awareness and greater use of telehealth than patients. The strongest concern about telehealth among respondents was “authenticity and reliability of data from remote monitoring of patients” (75.17%). The proportion of respondents concerned about the potential disadvantages of telehealth was highest among students and lowest among patients. Awareness and use of telehealth were associated with previous experience with health-related use of the Internet and experience with traditional forms of telehealth, but not with social status or attitude toward telehealth. Conclusions Medical professionals and patients alike in China have a high awareness of telehealth, primarily traditional forms of telehealth, but only a small percentage actually use it. Patients have much lower awareness and use of telehealth than medical professionals and medical students, though they have generally positive attitudes towards telehealth. Telehealth is still in its infancy in China, and the environment for its development is largely favorable among current and future medical professionals. © 2017","Attitudes; Structural model; Telehealth; Usage","Health care; Home health care; Hospitals; mHealth; Remote patient monitoring; Students; Surveys; Attitudes; Cross-sectional surveys; Medical professionals; Positive attitude; Remote monitoring; Structural modeling; Telehealth; Usage; Medical computing",2-s2.0-85030483579

Thus, increasing amounts of biochar were added to a Quartzipsamment in order to evaluate its priming effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition. We hypothesised that biochar will increase negative priming on native SOC mineralisation as function of its application rate to soil. The biochar was produced from sugarcane straw through slow pyrolysis at 450 °C, and a laboratory incubation was conducted for 90 days with the following treatments: soil-alone (C3 source), biochar-alone (C4 source) and soil with biochar at rates equivalent to 0.4% (T1), 0.8% (T2) and 1.9% (T3) (w/w). In the first day of incubation, biochar amendment reduced soil C mineralisation rates from 58 to 88% compared to the soil-alone as a function of increasing biochar application rates. This reduction was mainly attributed to the mineralisation of easily available substrates from incomplete pyrolysis, which were preferentially used by soil micro-organisms at early stages of incubation. This effect, however, subsided after 7 days of incubation and it was not sufficient to induce co-metabolism of SOC decomposition, which were 43% (T1)-71% (T3) lower compared to the control (soil-alone) after 90 days of incubation. This was reflected in the priming effect data, which confirmed the hypothesis that increasing application rates of biochar to soil induce stronger negative priming on SOM mineralisation. The predicted size of recalcitrant biochar C pool varied from 98.8% (T1) to 99.9% (T3) of the total biochar C with respective mean residence time of 454 and 1539 years. It was concluded that increasing rates of biochar application to soil induce stronger negative priming effect on SOC due to the higher proportional quantity of biochar labile C and preferential utilisation of this easily available C source by micro-organisms. However, the size and long residence time of the recalcitrant C pool of biochar confirm its stability in soil, thus being considered an opportunity for C sequestration in OC-poor soils. Additionally, this study draws encouraging perspectives on the evaluation of sugarcane straw as a chemical feedstock and an alternative biofuel through pyrolysis, providing appreciable amounts of a renewable product with a great potential for carbon storage. © 2017 NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Carbon-13; Crop residue management; Priming effect; Slow pyrolysis","Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Cracking (chemical); Digital storage; Function evaluation; Microorganisms; Mineralogy; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Pyrolysis; Biochar amendments; Carbon-13; Chemical feedstocks; Crop residue management; Mean residence time; Priming effects; Slow pyrolysis; Soil micro-organisms; Soils",2-s2.0-85032570446

In experiment 2, thirty-one incipient presbyopes participated in a 5-minute sustained fixation task to evoke phoria adaptation where the magnitude and rate of phoria adaptation were measured. Then, the experiment was repeated after wearing PALs for one month. Linear regression analyses were conducted between the following parameters: near point of convergence, positive fusional vergence at near, vergence facility, net change in the magnitude of phoria adaptation, and the rate of phoria adaptation.

Twenty patients with SPD and eighteen healthy controls were recruited from a pool of 3000 first-year university undergraduates, and underwent MRI using a 3T scanner. Diffusion tensors were first normalized into ICBM-152 space followed by a supervoxel segmentation based on graph clustering to segment white matter tensors into diffusion homogeneous supervoxels. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values in supervoxels were compared between SPD and healthy controls using permutation test. Suprathreshold cluster size test was used to correct multiple comparison. At last, fibers with significant differences were extracted from supervoxel clusters with significance level P < 0.05. Results showed that FA values in genu of corpus callosum were significantly reduced (P = 0.012) in patients with SPD (FA = 0.565) compared with healthy controls (FA = 0.593). In summary, this study proposed a novel supervoxel segmentation method for diffusion tensor imaging using graph-based clustering, and extended permutation test and suprathreshold cluster size test to supervoxels for detection of white matter changes. © 2017","Diffusion tensor imaging; Schizotypal personality disorder; Statistical analysis; Supervoxel","adult; anterior corona radiate; Article; brain region; cingulum cingulate gyrus; clinical article; controlled study; corpus callosum; diffusion tensor imaging; fractional anisotropy; human; left hemisphere; male; middle temporal gyrus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; permutation test; priority journal; right hemisphere; schizotypal personality disorder; statistical analysis; superior longitudinal fasciculus; superior parietal lobule; supervoxe based statistical analysis; white matter",2-s2.0-85031784862

The Bcr/CflA efflux system has previously been identified as important for development of P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms, highlighting the potential for efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) to control catheter blockage. Here we evaluate the potential for drugs already used in human medicine (fluoxetine and thioridazine) to act as EPIs in P. mirabilis, and control crystalline biofilm formation. Both fluoxetine and thioridazine inhibited efflux in P. mirabilis, and molecular modelling predicted both drugs interact strongly with the biofilm-associated Bcr/CflA efflux system. Both EPIs were also found to significantly reduce the rate of P. mirabilis crystalline biofilm formation on catheters, and increase the time taken for catheters to block. Swimming and swarming motilies in P. mirabilis were also significantly reduced by both EPIs. The impact of these drugs on catheter biofilm formation by other uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was also explored, and thioridazine was shown to also inhibit biofilm formation in these species. Therefore, repurposing of existing drugs with EPI activity could be a promising approach to control catheter blockage, or biofilm formation on other medical devices. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85029746706

Motivated by results valid for the well-known Moran (M) and Wright–Fisher (WF) processes, we define a general class of Markov chains models which we term the Kimura class. It comprises the majority of the models used in population genetics, and we show that many well-known results valid for M and WF processes are still valid in this class. In all Kimura processes, a mutant gene will either fixate or become extinct, and we present a necessary and sufficient condition for such processes to have the probability of fixation strictly increasing in the initial frequency of mutants. This condition implies that there are WF processes with decreasing fixation probability—in contradistinction to M processes which always have strictly increasing fixation probability. As a by-product, we show that an increasing fixation probability defines uniquely an M or WF process which realises it, and that any fixation probability with no state having trivial fixation can be realised by at least some WF process. These results are extended to a subclass of processes that are suitable for describing time-inhomogeneous dynamics. We also discuss the traditional identification of frequency dependent fitnesses and pay-offs, extensively used in evolutionary game theory, the role of weak selection when the population is finite, and the relations between jumps in evolutionary processes and frequency dependent fitnesses. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fixation probabilities; Perron–Frobenius property; Population genetics; Stochastic processes; Stochastically ordered processes; Time-inhomogeneous Markov chains",,2-s2.0-85019160434

A feasible solution to the CPF problem lies in the moving of mobile agents where each agent has unique initial and goal positions. The abstraction adopted in CPF assumes that agents are discrete units that move over an undirected graph by traversing its edges. We focus specifically on makespan-optimal solutions to the CPF problem where the task is to generate solutions that are as short as possible in terms of the total number of time steps required for all agents to reach their goal positions. We demonstrate that reducing CPF to propositional satisfiability (SAT) represents a viable way to obtain makespan-optimal solutions. Several ways of encoding CPFs into propositional formulae are proposed and evaluated both theoretically and experimentally. Encodings based on the log and direct representations of decision variables are compared. The evaluation indicates that SAT-based solutions to CPF outperform the makespan-optimal versions of such search-based CPF solvers such as OD+ID, CBS, and ICTS in highly constrained scenarios (i.e., environments that are densely occupied by agents and where interactions among the agents are frequent). Moreover, the experiments clearly show that CPF encodings based on the direct representation of variables can be solved faster, although they are less space-efficient than log encodings. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Conflict-based search – CBS; Cooperative path-finding (CPF); Increasing cost tree search – ICTS; Makespan-optimality; Multi-agent pathfinding; Multi-robot path planning; Operator decomposition/independence detection – OD+ID; Pebble motion on graphs; Propositional satisfiability (SAT); Time-expanded graphs",,2-s2.0-85026749028

The aim of this paper is to explore Generation Z consumers' current perceptions, expectations and recommendations in terms of their future interactions in smart retailing contexts. To do so, we used a qualitative approach by conducting a series of semi-structured in depth interviews with 38 university students-consumers in the UK market. The findings showed that smart technologies have a significant influence on generation Z consumers' experiences. Moreover, this particular group of consumers expects various new devices and electronic processes to be widely available, thus offering consumers more autonomy and faster transactions. In addition, they expect the technology to enable them to make more informed shopping decisions.

First, simultaneous local field potential recording in the subthalamic nucleus (STN; BG input) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr; BG output) reveals task-dependent shifts in subthalamo-nigral signals. Second, unilateral electrical stimulation of the STN, SNr, and caudate nucleus results in strikingly different saccade directionality and latency biases across the BG. Third, a simple artificial neural network representing canonical BG signaling pathways suggests that pathway weightings can be altered by cortico-BG input activation.

Simulation may prove to be realistic, very close to real patient scanning experience for the sonographer and objectively able to assist the development of basic skills such as image manipulation, hand-eye coordination and examination technique. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the face and content validity of a virtual reality simulator (ScanTrainer®, MedaPhor plc, Cardiff, Wales, UK) as reflective of real transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) scanning. Method: A questionnaire with 14 simulator-related statements was distributed to a number of participants with differing levels of sonography experience in order to determine the level of agreement between the use of the simulator in training and real practice. Results: There were 36 participants: novices (n = 25) and experts (n = 11) who rated the simulator. Median scores of face validity statements between experts and non-experts using a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings ranged between 7.5 and 9.0 (p > 0.05) indicated a high level of agreement.

Synfire chains are a well-established model that can explain such sequences. However, it is unknown under which conditions synfire chains can develop in initially unstructured networks by self-organization. This work shows that with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), modulated by global population activity, long synfire chains emerge in sparse random networks. The learning rule fosters neurons to participate multiple times in the chain or in multiple chains. Such reuse of neurons has been experimentally observed and is necessary for high capacity. Sparse networks prevent the chains from being short and cyclic and show that the formation of specific synapses is not essential for chain formation. Analysis of the learning rule in a simple network of binary threshold neurons reveals the asymptotically optimal length of the emerging chains. The theoretical results generalize to simulated networks of conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons.

In particular, question as to whether animal movement is predominantly diffusive or superdiffusive has been a focus of discussion and controversy. We consider this problem using a theory of stochastic motion based on the Langevin equation with non-Wiener stochastic forcing that originates in animal's response to environmental noise. We show that diffusive and superdiffusive types of motion are inherent parts of the same general movement process that arises as interplay between the force exerted by animals (essentially, by animal's muscles) and the environmental drag. The movement is superballistic with the mean square displacement growing with time as 〈x2(t)〉 ∼ t4 at the beginning and eventually slowing down to the diffusive spread 〈x2(t)〉 ∼ t. We show that the duration of the superballistic and superdiffusive stages can be long depending on the properties of the environmental noise and the intensity of drag. Our findings demonstrate theoretically how the movement pattern that includes diffusive and superdiffusive/superballistic motion arises naturally as a result of the interplay between the dissipative properties of the environment and the animal's biological traits such as the body mass, typical movement velocity and the typical duration of uninterrupted movement. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"acceleration; biological trait; motion; muscle; noise; theoretical study",2-s2.0-85032588077

A detailed hydrogeochemical investigation has been performed in three CKDu hotspots in Sri Lanka to assess the geo-environmental aetiological factors influencing this disease. A total of 71 ground- and 26 surface water samples were collected from Girandurukotte, Wilgamuwa and Nikawewa regions and analysed for major constituents and trace elements. The affected regions are dominated by Ca-Mg-HCO3 facies groundwater that is mainly controlled by silicate weathering. Higher levels of fluoride associated with higher hardness is the main feature of groundwater from CKDu regions compared to non-CKDu regions. Results showed that 65% of the wells in the affected regions exceeded the fluoride concentration of 0.5 mg/L. Environmental isotopes of groundwater in the CKDu regions are represented by the regression line of δ2H = 5.42δ18O-3.59 (r2 = 0.916) with a clear isotopic differentiation between local precipitation and groundwater. None of the trace elements exceeded the recommended scales and in most cases levels are negligible in both surface and groundwater in study areas. Therefore, the involvement of trace elements such as Cd, As and Pb can be ignored as causative factors for CKDu.

Yet a theoretical framework has been lacking that allows the post-processing of F-Z data to extract their viscoelastic constitutive parameters. Here, we propose a new method to extract nanoscale viscoelastic properties of soft samples like living cells and hydrogels directly from conventional AFM F-Z experiments, thereby creating a common platform for the analysis of cell elastic and viscoelastic properties with arbitrary linear constitutive relations. The method based on the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle was validated using finite element (FE) simulations and by comparison with the existed AFM techniques on living cells and hydrogels. The method also allows a discrimination of which viscoelastic relaxation model, for example, standard linear solid (SLS) or power-law rheology (PLR), best suits the experimental data. The method was used to extract the viscoelastic properties of benign and cancerous cell lines (NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, NMuMG epithelial, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells). Finally, we studied the changes in viscoelastic properties related to tumorigenesis including TGF-β induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition on NMuMG cells and Syk expression induced phenotype changes in MDA-MB-231 cells. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85019242755

The reward values are calculated along a dynamically defined policy path connecting start topic or event node to a goal topic or event or issue nodes for incrementally defined time windows for a given network congestion situation. A hierarchy of agents of trusted roles is used to accomplish the sub-goals associated with sub-story or subtopic in the provenance structure where an agent role may assume the semantic role of the associated sub-topic. The twitted news story thread or plan of events is defined in this work from the starting topic or event node to the goal topic or event node for incrementally defined intervals of time. The graphs are clustered into subtopic and these sub-goals or sub topic nodes of a topic node at every level of granularity are associated with cluster of news reports which describe activities associated with sub-goal or sub-topic events. Such cluster of nodes may also represent drilled down sequence of sub-events describing a sub-topic or sub-goal node. The policy path in a topic or story graph model is defined by applying reinforcement learning principles on dynamically defined event models associated with evolution of topic definition observed from incrementally acquired samples of input training data spanning multiple time windows. We provide a methodology for unifying similar provenance graph models for adapting and averaging the policy path classifiers associated with individual models to produce a reduced set of unified models derived during training. A minimum set cover of classifiers is identified for the models and a clustering procedure of the models is suggested based on these classifiers. Other database clustering methods have also been suggested as alternatives for clustering these models. A collection of unified models are identified from the models identified within a cluster and the policy path classifiers associated with these models provide the story or topic descriptions destined to goal topic or event nodes characterizing these models within a cluster. © 2017, The Author(s).","Bayesian model; Computational trust; Database roles; Materialized views; Network congestion; Policy path; Provenance; Q Learning; Reinforcement learning; Reward",,2-s2.0-85032582624

To unravel the cultural project of the past, we apply chronological modelling of radiocarbon dates within a Bayesian statistical framework, to interrogate the Neolithic cultural sequence in Lower Alsace, in the upper Rhine valley, in broad terms from the later sixth to the end of the fifth millennium cal BC. Detailed formal estimates are provided for the long succession of cultural groups, from the early Neolithic Linear Pottery culture (LBK) to the Bischheim Occidental du Rhin Supérieur (BORS) groups at the end of the Middle Neolithic, using seriation and typology of pottery as the starting point in modelling. The rate of ceramic change, as well as frequent shifts in the nature, location and density of settlements, are documented in detail, down to lifetime and generational timescales. This reveals a Neolithic world in Lower Alsace busy with comings and goings, tinkerings and adjustments, and relocations and realignments. A significant hiatus is identified between the end of the LBK and the start of the Hinkelstein group, in the early part of the fifth millennium cal BC. On the basis of modelling of existing dates for other parts of the Rhineland, this appears to be a wider phenomenon, and possible explanations are discussed; full reoccupation of the landscape is only seen in the Grossgartach phase.

Triterpenoids are the major active components of RA, and its extract is mainly composed of alisol A (ALA), alisol B (ALB), alisol C 23-acetate (ALC-23A), alisol A 24-acetate (ALA-24A), and alisol B 23-acetate (ALB-23A). In this study, a simple, reliable, and sensitive ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) method was created and validated for the quantification of the five major triterpenoids in rat plasma and various tissues biosamples (including intestine, stomach, liver, kidney, fat, muscle, brain, heart, lung, spleen, and testes). The plasma and tissues biosamples were pretreated by direct precipitation deproteinization method with acetonitrile. 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone was used as internal standard (IS). The chromatography was performed on a Phenomenex C8 column (30 × 2.00 mm, 1.8 μm) at room temperature with gradient elution. Compounds were quantified by selected multi-reactions monitoring (SRM) scanning with positive electric spray ionization mode. The linearity of detection for each triterpene was respectively from 1 to 1000 ng/mL for ALC-23A and ALA, from 4 to 4000 ng/mL for ALA-24A, from 10 to 10,000 ng/mL for ALB, and from 2 to 2000 ng/mL for ALB-23B (r &gt; 0.99) with low quantification limits of 1–10 ng/mL for all analytes. All of the other validation parameters were also in an acceptable range. The validated UHPLC–MS/MS method subsequently applied for the pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies of RA extract. After orally given 100 mg/kg of RA extract, ALA was the most exposed component, followed by ALB and ALA-24A. Whereas significant gender difference was observed for ALB, ALA, and ALA-24A between female and male rats. The AUC (0-∞) of ALA, ALB, and ALA-24A in female rats were approximately 2–5 fold larger than that in male rats. These triterpenoids also displayed approximately 1.5–2 times longer half-life (t1/2) in female rats. Appearant Km, Vmax and Clint of ALA, ALB, and ALA-24A were calculated by substrate depletion approach, rat P450 CYP3A2 plays an important role in the metabolism of ALA, ALB, and ALA-24A, which is an important factor leading to the different exprosures of ALA, ALB, and ALA-24A between the male rats and the female rats. Furthermore, results from tissue distribution in male rats showed that the main tissue depots of five triterpenoids were the stomach/intestine, followed by the liver, brain, and fat. However, ALA was still measured in the kidney after a long elimination time. ALB and ALB-23B exhibited lower elimination rate in the testis.

First, we question the message found in popular textbooks that the traditional process of reversing the order of integration is necessary when solving well-known problems. Second, we illustrate that the method of integration by parts can be directly applied to many of the classic pedagogical problems in the literature concerning double integrals, without taking the well-worn steps associated with reversing the order of integration. Third, we examine the benefits and limitations of such a method. In our conclusion, we advocate for integration by parts to be a part of the pedagogical conversation in the learning and teaching of double integral methods; and call for more debate around its use in the learning and teaching of other areas of mathematics.

Methods: Blood and saliva samples were collected from 112 CKD patients and 108 subjects without CKD for quantitative analysis of urea and creatinine. Spearman’s correlation coefficients between salivary and serum urea as well as creatinine were obtained. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was done to assess the diagnostic tests of salivary urea and creatinine. Cut-off values were determined based on the best trade-off between the sensitivity and specificity for both salivary urea and creatinine. Results: Salivary urea and creatinine concentrations were significantly higher in CKD patients than those in control subjects; and increased by the stages of the severity of the disease. The positive correlation was significantly found between salivary and serum creatinine (r = 0.90) and between salivary and serum urea (r = 0.73). Area under the curve for salivary urea was 0.76 and a cut-off value of 14.25 mmol/L gave a sensitivity of 82.9% and specificity of 57.8%. Area under the curve for salivary creatinine was 0.92 and a cut-off value of 0.24 mg/dL gave a sensitivity of 86.5% and specificity of 87.2%. Conclusions: Both salivary urea and creatinine have a high capacity for serum creatinine estimation.

The geometric acceleration and jolt associated to a gyroscopic signal are evaluated through the rules of calculus prescribed by differential geometry. Such an endeavor is motivated by recent studies on the smoothness of human body movement in biomechanical engineering, sports science, and rehabilitation neuroengineering. Two indexes of smoothness are compared, namely, a normalized proper geometric acceleration index and a normalized proper geometric jolt index.

Differential quadrature method with modified cubic B-spline basis functions is implemented to solve three-dimensional hyperbolic equations. B-spline functions are employed to discretize the space variable and their derivatives. The weighting coefficients are obtained by semi-explicit algorithm. The partial differential equation results into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The obtained system of ODEs has been solved by employing a fourth stage Runge–Kutta method. Efficiency and reliability of the method has been established with five linear test problems and one nonlinear test problem. Obtained numerical solutions are found to be better as compared to those available in the literature. Simple implementation, less complexity and computational inexpensiveness are some of the main advantages of the scheme. Further, the scheme gives approximations not only at the knots but also at all the interior points in the domain under consideration. The scheme is found to be providing convergent solutions and handles different cases.

The first is security considerations and the second is context awareness. Modern workflow systems cross the boundaries of organisations, each may have its own security requirements, policies and constraints. Even within one organisation, activities in a workflow system may be executed, in one of its instances, within a platform, but in another instance it may be executed or performed on a different platform with completely different environment. Indeed it may not even be automated. This lends modern workflow systems to be security and context-critical. This is in addition to the fact that some of its activities must satisfy variety of hard timing constraints. Current specification and design languages for workflow systems are inadequate in dealing with context-aware secure workflows. This paper presents a sound wide-spectrum language, CS−Flow for the specification and design of context-aware, secure workflow systems. As workflow systems have strong temporal aspects (e.g. activity sequencing, deadline, scheduling constraints, etc.), the proposed CS−Flow is equipped with a rich set of temporal constructs together with temporal proof rules which can be used to be integrated with temporal expert systems, hence enhancing the capabilities of current workflow software. In addition, CS−Flow is supported by a proof system which underpins the workflow engine that provides decision service using its state to make some decision and update the workflow state. CS−Flow therefore provides a sound linkage between expert systems and workflow engines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Context-aware; Security; Specification; Workflows","Engines; Expert systems; Context-Aware; Scheduling constraints; Security; Security considerations; Security requirements; Specification and designs; Wide spectrum language; Work-flows; Specifications",2-s2.0-85020453420

On the one hand, the study of gradient Schrödinger operators on manifolds with density ϕ. We classify the space of solutions when the underlying manifold is ϕ-parabolic. As an application, we extend the Naber–Yau Liouville Theorem and we prove that a complete manifold with density is ϕ-parabolic if, and only if, it has finite ϕ-capacity. Moreover, we show that the linear space given by the kernel of a nonnegative gradient Schrödinger operator is one dimensional provided there exists a bounded function in the kernel and the underlying manifold is ϕ-parabolic. On the other hand, the topological and geometrical classification of complete weighted Hϕ-stable hypersurfaces immersed in a manifold with density (N,g,ϕ) satisfying a lower bound on its Bakry–Émery–Ricci tensor. Also, we classify weighted stable surfaces in a three-manifold with density whose Perelman scalar curvature, in short, P-scalar curvature, together with the squared norm of the gradient of the density satisfy a lower bound. Finally, we discuss the relationship of manifolds with density, Mean Curvature Flow (MCF), Ricci Flow and Optimal Transportation Theory. We obtain classification results for stable self-similar solutions to the MCF, and also for stable translating solitons to the MCF (as far as we know, the first classification result). Moreover, for gradient Ricci solitons, we recover the Hamilton–Ivey–Perelman classification assuming only a L2-type bound on the scalar curvature and a inequality between the scalar curvature and the Ricci tensor. We also classify gradient Ricci solitons when the scalar curvature does not change sign. We finish by classifying critical transportation plans for the Boltzman entropy on ϕ-parabolic manifolds.

This is non-trivial and goes beyond current certification requirements, for human-controlled vehicles, in that these vehicles can act autonomously. In this paper, we show how formal verification can contribute to the analysis of these new, and increasingly autonomous, systems. An appropriate overall representation for vehicle platooning is as a multi-agent system in which each agent captures the “autonomous decisions” carried out by each vehicle. In order to ensure that these autonomous decision-making agents in vehicle platoons never violate safety requirements, we use formal verification. However, as the formal verification technique used to verify the individual agent's code does not scale to the full system, and as the global system verification technique does not capture the essential verification of autonomous behaviour, we use a combination of the two approaches. This mixed strategy allows us to verify safety requirements not only of a model of the system, but of the actual agent code used to program the autonomous vehicles. © 2017 The Authors","Agent programming; Model checking; Vehicle platooning","Decision making; Formal verification; Model checking; Multi agent systems; Vehicles; Agent programming; Autonomous decision; Autonomous Vehicles; Certification requirements; Human controlled vehicles; Multiple autonomous vehicles; Safety requirements; Verification techniques; Autonomous agents",2-s2.0-85020766753

Changes in vaccination strategies, prophylactic measures or usual habits, may also change the distribution of the genogroups in the ecosystem but, usually, this competition is ignored in most epidemiological models, despite it can be highly influential in the evolution of infection diseases and outbreaks. Our goal is to propose a susceptible–carrier–susceptible (SCS) epidemiological model to determine the percentage of carriers in the population, and introduce a fractional Lotka–Volterra competition model to describe the evolution of the meningococcal genogroups in Spain among the carriers.

Then, we estimate the probability of having a possible outbreak of meningococcus W-135 in Spain over the next few years.

Meanwhile, the heterogeneity can be implemented by a non-uniform investment mechanism regarding A−type cooperators, where a contribution from a cooperative agent into a PGG group is represented as a power function of fraction of cooperators inside this group. Extensive simulations indicate that the cooperation can be driven into a very high level by integrating these two components into the PGG model.

The Bayesian calibration technique is one of the popular automatic calibration methods Allowing for all sources of uncertainty, the method attempts to correct inadequate models and parameters that produce discrepancies between prediction and observed data. Bayesian calibration requires numerous iterations of simulation. To reduce the computational cost, a meta-model is often used to replace the original detailed model. This paper evaluates and analyzes the influence of meta-model accuracy on the outcomes of the Bayesian calibration for building energy simulation model. The following five meta-models: multiple linear regression model, neural network, support vector machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and Gaussian process emulator are investigated and compared. The study varies the ranges of input parameters to explore the associated accuracy of the built meta-models. The calibration results are evaluated and compared using three criteria: simulation time, the coefficient of variation with root mean square error (CVRMSE) to true input parameter values, and CVRMSE to observed outputs (monthly and annual energy use intensity). The paper confirms that there are significant differences in simulation time and accuracy for different types of meta-models. The most accurate meta-model tested is the Gaussian process emulator (GPE), while it requires the longest computing time. The multiple linear regression model is the fastest but shows the worst performance in the calibration for the true input parameters.

In this paper, a wavelet-hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) model integrated with iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm (IIS-W-ANN) is evaluated for its statistical preciseness in forecasting monthly streamflow, and it is then benchmarked against M5 Tree model. To develop hybrid IIS-W-ANN model, a global predictor matrix is constructed for three local hydrological sites (Richmond, Gwydir, and Darling River) in Australia's agricultural (Murray-Darling) Basin. Model inputs comprised of statistically significant lagged combination of streamflow water level, are supplemented by meteorological data (i.e., precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, mean solar radiation, vapor pressure and evaporation) as the potential model inputs. To establish robust forecasting models, iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm is applied to screen the best data from the predictor matrix and is integrated with the non-decimated maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) applied on the IIS-selected variables. This resolved the frequencies contained in predictor data while constructing a wavelet-hybrid (i.e., IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree) model. Forecasting ability of IIS-W-ANN is evaluated via correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (ENS), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), including the percentage RMSE and MAE. While ANN models are seen to outperform M5 Tree executed for all hydrological sites, the IIS variable selector was efficient in determining the appropriate predictors, as stipulated by the better performance of the IIS coupled (ANN and M5 Tree) models relative to the models without IIS. When IIS-coupled models are integrated with MODWT, the wavelet-hybrid IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree are seen to attain significantly accurate performance relative to their standalone counterparts. Importantly, IIS-W-ANN model accuracy outweighs IIS-ANN, as evidenced by a larger r and WI (by 7.5% and 3.8%, respectively) and a lower RMSE (by 21.3%). In comparison to the IIS-W-M5 Tree model, IIS-W-ANN model yielded larger values of WI = 0.936–0.979 and ENS = 0.770–0.920. Correspondingly, the errors (RMSE and MAE) ranged from 0.162–0.487 m and 0.139–0.390 m, respectively, with relative errors, RRMSE = (15.65–21.00) % and MAPE = (14.79–20.78) %. Distinct geographic signature is evident where the most and least accurately forecasted streamflow data is attained for the Gwydir and Darling River, respectively. Conclusively, this study advocates the efficacy of iterative input selection, allowing the proper screening of model predictors, and subsequently, its integration with MODWT resulting in enhanced performance of the models applied in streamflow forecasting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Drought in Murray-Darling Basin; Iterative input selection algorithm, MODWT; Streamflow forecasting; Wavelet-hybrid model","Discrete wavelet transforms; Drought; Errors; Forecasting; Forestry; Iterative methods; Matrix algebra; Meteorology; Neural networks; Optimization; Stream flow; Water levels; Water resources; Wavelet transforms; Hybrid artificial neural network; Hybrid model; Input selection; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Maximum overlap discrete wavelet transforms; Murray-Darling Basin; Performance optimizations; Streamflow forecasting; Trees (mathematics); algorithm; artificial neural network; drought; forecasting method; hydrological modeling; optimization; precision; streamflow; water level; water resource; wavelet analysis; Australia; Darling River; Gwydir River; Murray-Darling Basin; New South Wales; Richmond River",2-s2.0-85021292297

Within this novel geometrical scenario, the standard electroweak theory of leptons based on the SU(2)L ⊗ U(1)Y as well as on the conformal groups of space-time Weyl’s transformations is analysed within the framework of a general-relativistic, conformally covariant scalar-tensor theory that includes the electromagnetic and the Yang-Mills fields. A Higgs mechanism within a spontaneous symmetry breaking process is identified and this offers formal connections between some relevant properties of the elementary particles and the dark energy content of the Universe. An ‘effective cosmological potential’: Veff is expressed in terms of the dark energy potential: |VΛ| ≡ M2 Λ via the ‘mass reduction parameter’: ζ ≡ |Veff|/|VΛ|, a general property of the Universe. The mass of the Higgs boson, which is considered a ‘free parameter’ by the standard electroweak theory, by our theory is found to be proportional to the mass Meff ≡ |Veff| which accounts for the measured cosmological constant, i.e. the measured content of vacuum-energy in the Universe. The non-integrable application of Weyl’s geometry leads to a Proca equation accounting for the dynamics of a φρ-particle, a vector-meson proposed as an an optimum candidate for dark matter. On the basis of previous cosmic microwave background results our theory leads, in the condition of cosmological ‘critical density’, to the assessment of the average energy content of the φρ-excitation. The peculiar mathematical structure of Veff offers a clue towards a very general resolution of a most intriguing puzzle of modern quantum field theory, the ‘Cosmological Constant Paradox’ (here referred to as the ‘Λ-Paradox’). Indeed, our ‘universal’ theory offers a resolution of the Λ-Paradox for all exponential inflationary potentials: VΛ(T, φ) ∝ e−nφ, and for all linear superpositions of these potentials, where n belongs to the mathematical set of the ‘real numbers’. An explicit solution of the Λ-Paradox is reported for n=2. The resolution of the Λ-Paradox cannot be achieved in the context of Riemann’s differential geometry.

However, it is particularly difficult to establish a generalized analytical model to predict the amplitude- and frequency-dependent behaviors of an air spring resulting from many factors such as thermodynamics, friction, and damping. In this paper, an air spring dynamic model is developed by considering the thermodynamics of the bellow-pipe-tank pneumatic system, the effective friction, and viscoelastic damping of the bellow rubber. It is worth mentioning that parameters in the friction model depend on the standard deviation of the displacement excitation through a statistics method rather than constant values in the classic Berg's friction model. The bellow rubber viscoelastic property is modeled by a fractional calculus element with only two parameters. The proposed model parameters are identified and further validated by conducting bench tests of the stand-alone air spring component and the bellow-pipe-tank system, separately. Several models for the air spring are compared with the proposed model and the measurements in harmonic excitations with different amplitudes and frequencies, and random excitations with both large and small displacement cases. The results of comparison show that the proposed model can accurately predict the dynamic characteristics of the air spring in an acceptable computation time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air spring; Fractional derivative; Friction; Nonlinear dynamics","Calculations; Damping; Dynamic models; Dynamics; Friction; Pneumatic control; Pneumatic equipment; Pneumatics; Rubber; Tanks (containers); Thermodynamics; Tribology; Viscoelasticity; Air springs; Dynamic characteristics; Fractional calculus; Fractional derivatives; Frequency dependent; Harmonic excitation; Viscoelastic damping; Viscoelastic properties; Springs (components)",2-s2.0-85027519183

Vortex methods have been extensively applied to reduce the dimensionality of these aerodynamic models, based on the proper estimation of the strength and distribution of the vortices in the wake. In such modelling approaches, one of the most fundamental questions is how the vortex sheets are generated and released from sharp edges. To determine the formation of the trailing-edge vortex sheet, the classical steady Kutta condition can be extended to unsteady situations by realizing that a flow cannot turn abruptly around a sharp edge. This condition can be readily applied to a flat plate or an airfoil with cusped trailing edge since the direction of the forming vortex sheet is known to be tangential to the trailing edge. However, for a finite-angle trailing edge, or in the case of flow separation away from a sharp corner, the direction of the forming vortex sheet is ambiguous. To remove any ad hoc implementation, the unsteady Kutta condition, the conservation of circulation as well as the conservation laws of mass and momentum are coupled to analytically solve for the angle, strength and relative velocity of the trailing-edge vortex sheet. The two-dimensional aerodynamic model together with the proposed vortex-sheet formation condition is verified by comparing flow structures and force calculations with experimental results for several airfoil motions in steady and unsteady background flows. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Aerodynamics; swimming/flying; vortex shedding","Aerodynamics; Airfoils; Flow separation; Vortex shedding; Ad hoc implementation; Aerodynamic modeling; Aerodynamic models; Force calculation; Relative velocity; Swimming/flying; Two-dimensional airfoils; Unsteady aerodynamics; Vortex flow; aerodynamics; momentum; strength; swimming; two-dimensional flow; unsteady flow; vortex shedding; wake; wave-structure interaction",2-s2.0-85030310191

It seems to be related to different socio-demographic and climatic factors, lifestyle and pre-existing comorbidity. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between socio-demographic variables, certain risk factors and chronic diseases and the renal lithiasis. Patients and method A cross-sectional population-based study was carried out, selecting the Spanish population aged from 40 to 65 years, combining 2 random samples (PreLiRenA and PreLiRenE studies). Data were collected by personal telephone surveys, gathering information on socio-demographic variables and perceived morbidity. Data on annual average temperatures in each Spanish region were also collected. A bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed. Results A total of 4,894 subjects were surveyed; 51.3% were women; 25% were aged 40-45 years, 36% had primary school education and 31.4% were of low social class. The overall prevalence of renal lithiasis was 15.0% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 14.5-15.5). By means of multivariate analysis, the variables that showed a strong statistical relationship with the presence of renal lithiasis were: older age (61-65 years; OR = 1.39; 95% CI 1.06-1.80), high social class (OR = 1.98; 95% CI 1.29-2.62), family history of renal lithiasis (OR = 2.22; 95% CI 1.88-2.65), high blood pressure (OR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.39-2.02) and overweight/obesity (OR = 1.31; 95% CI 1.12-1.54). A correlation was observed between renal lithiasis and average annual temperatures in the Spanish regions (r = 0.59; P =.013). Conclusions A relationship was observed between renal lithiasis and older age, belonging to higher social classes, the existence of a family history of urolithiasis, and hypertension and overweight or obesity.

The fact that M is self-translating means that the moving surface S(t)=M+tez evolves by mean curvature flow, or equivalently, that M satisfies the equation HM=ν⋅ez where HM denotes mean curvature, ν is a choice of unit normal to M, and ez is a unit vector along the z-axis.

We define a (rather weak) notion of “compressability” for operators acting on relative differential forms with values in a relative tractor bundle. Then we develop a general machinery which converts a compressable operator to an operator on bundles associated to completely reducible representations on relative Lie algebra homology groups. Applying this machinery to a specific compressable invariant differential operator of order one, we obtain a relative version of BGG (Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand) sequences.

We characterize cases in which the relative BGG sequences are complexes or even fine resolutions of certain sheaves and describe these sheaves.

Leaf epidermis contains jigsaw puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells whose shape has been proposed to be a result of subcellular variations in expansion rate that induce local buckling events. Paradoxically, such local compressive buckling should not occur given the tensile stresses across the epidermis. Using computational modeling, we show that the simplest scenario to explain pavement cell shapes within an epidermis under tension must involve mechanical wall heterogeneities across and along the anticlinal pavement cell walls between adjacent cells. Combining genetics, atomic force microscopy, and immunolabeling, we demonstrate that contiguous cell walls indeed exhibit hybrid mechanochemical properties. Such biochemical wall heterogeneities precede wall bending. Altogether, this provides a possible mechanism for the generation of complex plant cell shapes. Pavement cells in the leaf epidermis are multi-lobed like jigsaw puzzle pieces.

Our interest is twofold: we investigate the existence/nonexistence of travelling waves, and the propagation properties of the Cauchy problem. When the dispersion kernel J is exponentially bounded, travelling waves are known to exist and solutions of the Cauchy problem typically propagate at a constant speed [7,10,11,22,26,27]. On the other hand, when the dispersion kernel J has heavy tails and the nonlinearity f is nondegenerate, i.e. f′(0)&amp;#x003E;0, travelling waves do not exist and solutions of the Cauchy problem propagate by accelerating [14,20,27].

For this purpose, dynamic shear flow experiments and scanning electron microscopy investigations were performed. The nonzero value of the elastic modulus of the spring element (Ge) of the FZM for ABS-rich blends was explained by the formation of a networklike structure because of the agglomeration of the rubber phases of the ABS matrix, whereas for the PA6-rich blends with a high content of ABS, the interactions and/or interconnectivity of the ABS dispersed phase led to a nonzero value of Ge. The value of the fitting parameter of the Coran model (f) was near to 0.5 for the 50/50 blend; this was fully in agreement with the formed cocontinuous morphology for this blend composition. On the other hand, the f value for the blends with a matrix–droplet-type morphology was near to zero for the PA6-rich blends; this indicated the lower continuity of the ABS dispersed phase as a harder phase compared to the PA6 soft matrix, whereas the f value was near to 1 for ABS-rich blends.

An observer system is then designed to estimate the state at the time interval when the observation is available, and a predictor system is designed to predict the state at the time interval when the observation is not available.

Although it is a highly effective and safe procedure for the fragmentation of pancreatic stones, it is still not complication-free. Just like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), pancreatitis is the most common complication. To date, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have proven to be the only effective prophylactic medication for post-ERCP pancreatitis and the European, American and Japanese Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines have recommended prophylactic rectally administered indomethacin for all patients undergoing ERCP. Given the little research about effective prevention for post P-ESWL pancreatitis, we aim to determine whether rectally administered indomethacin can reduce post-ESWL-pancreatitis. Methods/design: The RIPEP study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. One thousand three hundred and seventy patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic stones (>5 mm in diameter) treated with P-ESWL at Changhai Hospital will be randomly allocated to rectally administered indomethacin or placebo therapy before the procedure. The primary endpoint is the incidence of post-ESWL pancreatitis. Secondary endpoints include the severity of pancreatitis, occurrence rate of asymptomatic hyperamylasemia and other complications. Discussion: The RIPEP trial is designed to show that rectally administered indomethacin reduces the development and severity of post-ESWL pancreatitis and benefits patients treated with P-ESWL.

This paper shows that the ammonium phosphate precipitation from complex waste of decaying urine is identical to the product in model and other organic systems, i.e., struvite. We have shown that titration assays are possible for struvite, but they are difficult and hence we have also used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. NMR shows the high purity of struvite. Surprisingly, the crystals from this system are large and generate improved structural determination by X-ray crystallography compared to struvite prepared in solution or discovered in other natural systems.

Reachable set enclosures are used for uncertainty propagation, robust control, and global optimization of dynamic systems arising in a variety of applications. However, existing methods often provide an unworkable compromise between cost and accuracy. For example, fast interval methods often produce divergent bounds, while methods based on more complex sets scale poorly with problem size. To overcome this, a novel method is introduced for reducing the conservatism of fast interval methods through the select addition of redundant model equations that can be exploited in the bounding procedure. Several case studies demonstrate that such redundancy can dramatically reduce conservatism.

Successive cycles of dental plaque growth and calcification make it an unusually well-preserved, long-term record of host-microbial interaction in the archaeological record. Recent studies have confirmed the survival of authentic ancient DNA and proteins within historic and prehistoric dental calculus, making it a promising substrate for investigating oral microbiome evolution via direct measurement and comparison of modern and ancient specimens. Objective: We present the first comprehensive characterization of the human dental calculus metabolome using a multi-platform approach. Methods: Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) quantified 285 metabolites in modern and historic (200 years old) dental calculus, including metabolites of drug and dietary origin. A subset of historic samples was additionally analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography–MS (GC–MS) and UPLC–MS/MS for further characterization of metabolites and lipids. Metabolite profiles of modern and historic calculus were compared to identify patterns of persistence and loss. Results: Dipeptides, free amino acids, free nucleotides, and carbohydrates substantially decrease in abundance and ubiquity in archaeological samples, with some exceptions. Lipids generally persist, and saturated and mono-unsaturated medium and long chain fatty acids appear to be well-preserved, while metabolic derivatives related to oxidation and chemical degradation are found at higher levels in archaeological dental calculus than fresh samples. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that certain metabolite classes have higher potential for recovery over long time scales and may serve as appropriate targets for oral microbiome evolutionary studies. © 2017, The Author(s).","Archaeology; Dental plaque; GC–MS; Metabolomics; Oral microbiome; UPLC–MS/MS","5,8,11 icosatrienoic acid; alanine; amino acid; asparagine; carbohydrate; citrulline; dipeptide; glucose; glutamine; lipid; methionine; nicotinic acid; nucleotide; orotic acid; pantothenic acid; peptide; phosphatidylcholine; pipecolic acid; plasticizer; proline; pyroglutamic acid; RNA 16S; sphingomyelin; sulfate; threonine; tyrosine; unindexed drug; vitamin; xanthine; xenobiotic agent; acetylation; adult; aged; Article; biofilm; clinical article; deamination; energy; evolution; female; genetic analysis; human; human tissue; hydrophobicity; hydroxylation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; mass fragmentography; metabolism; metabolomics; Methanobrevibacter; middle aged; mouth flora; oxidation; preservation; saliva; solubility; tooth calculus; tooth plaque; young adult",2-s2.0-85030764239

This paper proposes an alternative way to optimizing the route problems which is based on multi-constrained optimal path (MCOP) and operator calculus approach. A novel routing protocol called Path Operator Calculus Centrality (POCC) is proposed as a new method to determine the main path which contains high centrality nodes in a wireless sensor network deployment. The estimation of centrality is using the operator calculus approach based on network topology which provides optimal paths for each source node to base station. Some constraints such as energy level and bit error rate (BER) of node are considered to define the path centrality in this approach.

Besides showing that several local transformations are optimizations, a main result of this paper is a proof that common subexpression elimination is correct and an improvement, which proves a conjecture and thus closes a gap in the improvement theory of Moran and Sands. The improvement relation used in this paper is generic in which essential computation steps are counted and thus the obtained results apply for several notions of improvement. Besides the small-step operational semantics, also an abstract machine semantics is considered for counting computation steps. We show for several length measures that the call-by-need calculus of Moran and Sands and our calculus are equivalent. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Functional programming; Improvement; Lambda calculus; Lazy evaluation; Semantics","Computation theory; Computational mechanics; Differentiation (calculus); Functional programming; Semantics; Call by need lambda calculus; Common subexpression elimination; Improvement; Lambda calculus; Lazy evaluation; Local transformations; Operational semantics; Program transformations; Calculations",2-s2.0-85010618989

However, there are no standard guidelines for the treatment of patients who have concomitant hepatolithiasis of the left liver and abdominal adhesions. The aim of the current research was to compare the outcomes of open versus laparoscopic common bile duct exploration with left hepatectomy (OCBDH vs. LCBDH) in patients with choledocholithiasis concomitant with left-sided hepatolithiasis, and to evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic surgery for choledocholithiasis in patients with abdominal adhesions. Methods: Between October 2012 and October 2015, a total of 321 consecutive patients with choledocholithiasis underwent surgical treatment. LCBDE was performed in 107 patients, and open common bile duct exploration (OCBDE) was performed in 111 patients. Further, 31 patients and 72 patients underwent LCBDH and OCBDH, respectively. A total of 133 patients who underwent LCBDE or OCBDE had abdominal adhesions, which were classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to an abdominal adhesion scoring system, which was validated in the LCBDE group and OCBDE group. The perioperative results were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. Results: In the mild adhesion group, blood loss, postoperative recovery in the LCBDE group was lesser than those in the OCBDE group. In the moderate adhesion group, the postoperative recovery was significantly shorter in the LCBDE group than in the OCBDE group. In the severe adhesion group, the operation time and blood loss in the LCBDE group were higher than those in the OCBDE group. The postoperative recovery was significantly better in the LCBDH group than in the OCBDH group. Conclusion: LCBDH can obviously improve recovery and shorten the hospitalization period. Further, LCBDE is safe and feasible for patients of choledocholithiasis with mild and moderate abdominal adhesions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Abdominal adhesions; Choledocholithiasis; Hepatectomy; Hepatolithiasis; Laparoscopic",,2-s2.0-85017443072

Thirty-two extracted human teeth, partially covered with calculus on the root surface, were evaluated by using a portable Raman spectrophotometer, and a 785-nm, 100-mW laser was applied for fluorescence/Raman excitation. The collected spectra were normalized to the hydroxyapatite Raman band intensity at 960 cm−1. Raman spectra were recorded from the same point after changing the focal distance of the laser and the target radiating angle. In seven teeth, the condition of calculus, cementum, and dentin were evaluated. In 25 teeth, we determined the fluorescence/Raman intensity ratio following three strokes of debridement. Raman spectra collected from the dentin, cementum, and calculus were different. After normalization, spectra values were constant. The fluorescence/Raman intensity ratio of calculus region showed significant differences compared to the cementum and dentin (p &lt; 0.05). The fluorescence/Raman intensity ratio decreased with calculus debridement. For this analysis, the delta value was defined as the difference between the values before and after three strokes, with the final 2 delta values close to zero, indicating a gradual asymptotic curve and the change in intensity ratio approximating that of individual constants. Fluorescence/Raman intensity ratio was effectively used to cancel the angle- and distance-dependent fluctuations of fluorescence collection efficiency during measurement. Changes in the fluorescence/Raman intensity ratio near zero suggested that cementum or dentin was exposed, and calculus removed. © 2017, The Author(s).","Dental calculus; Diagnostic system; Hydroxyapatite; Periodontal debridement; Periodontitis; Raman spectroscopy","Article; calcification; clinical article; dental debridement; dentin; fluorescence; fluorescence intensity ratio; histology; human; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; tooth calculus; tooth cementum; tooth root",2-s2.0-85025828015

Patients and Methods: The new-generation SMP endoscopic system consists of (i) a 40 000-pixel super-mini nephroscope with an 8.0-F outer diameter and 7.5-F inner diameter dismountable sheath, and (ii) a newly designed irrigation-suction sheath available in either 12 F or 14 F. The irrigation-suction sheath is a two-layered metal structure. The key feature of the irrigation-suction sheath is to allow irrigation and suction respectively (the inflow through the space between the two layers of the sheath, the outflow through the central lumen of the sheath). This property improves irrigation and stone clearance despite reduced instrument dimension. In all, 59 patients with renal stones underwent new-generation SMP between April 2016 and December 2016. The percutaneous tract dilatation was carried out to 14 F. Lithotripsy was performed using either holmium laser or a pneumatic lithotripter. Stone fragments were sucked out by vacuum suctioning through the sheath. A nephrostomy tube or JJ stent was placed only if clinically indicated. Low-dose computed tomography was performed to assess the stone-free status on the morning after the procedure. Results: The mean stone burden was 2.4 cm. Of the 59 patients, nine had diabetes and five had hypertension. SMP was completed successfully in all patients with a mean operation duration of 32.9 min and a mean haemoglobin decrease of 13 g/L. The stone-free rate was 91.5%. Complications occurred in 5.1% of the patients, all of them were Clavien–Dindo Grade I (minor fever managed by antipyretic therapy), and no transfusions were needed. Conclusion: The new-generation SMP system is safe, feasible, and effective for managing renal calculi of <3 cm, with the advantages of a small percutaneous tract, less blood loss, high efficacy in stone clearance, improved visual field, short operation duration, and ease of operating. © 2017 The Authors BJU International © 2017 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","irrigation-suction sheath; miniaturisation; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; renal calculi; SMP","antipyretic agent; hemoglobin; adult; Article; computer assisted tomography; diabetes mellitus; feasibility study; female; fever; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypertension; irrigation suction sheath; laser lithotripsy; major clinical study; male; miniaturization; nephrolithiasis; operation duration; patient safety; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; pneumatic lithotripter; priority journal; radiation dose; suction; super mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy; vacuum suction; devices; endoscopy; equipment design; Kidney Calculi; lavage; middle aged; percutaneous nephrostomy; procedures; Adult; Endoscopy; Equipment Design; Humans; Kidney Calculi; Middle Aged; Miniaturization; Nephrostomy, Percutaneous; Therapeutic Irrigation",2-s2.0-85026662002

First, a general sufficient maximum principle for optimal control for a system, driven by a Markov regime-switching forward–backward jump–diffusion model, is developed. In the regime-switching case, it might happen that the associated Hamiltonian is not concave and hence the classical maximum principle cannot be applied. Hence, an equivalent type maximum principle is introduced and proved. In view of solving an optimal control problem when the Hamiltonian is not concave, we use a third approach based on Malliavin calculus to derive a general stochastic maximum principle. This approach also enables us to derive an explicit solution of a control problem when the concavity assumption is not satisfied. In addition, the framework we propose allows us to apply our results to solve a recursive utility maximization problem. © 2017, The Author(s).","Forward–backward stochastic differential equations; Malliavin calculus; Recursive utility maximization; Regime switching; Stochastic maximum principle",,2-s2.0-85027183646

Some conditions of stability at the origin (the trivial equilibrium point) are provided for the model. The error analysis shows that the method converges and is concluded thanks to Fubini–Tonelli theorem for non-negative functions and the Mean value theorem for definite integrals.

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analysed the outcomes of PCNL in 3402 patients, who underwent the procedure between 1997 and 2014, obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data analysis included patients’ age and sex, laboratory investigations, imaging, punctured calyx, duration of operation, volume of irrigation fluid, radiation exposure time, blood transfusion, complications and stone-free status at 1-month follow-up. For the present analysis, outcomes in relation to complications and success were divided in two eras, 1997–2005 and 2006–2014, to study the differences. Results: Of the 3402 patients, 2501 (73.5%) were male and 901 (26.5%) were female, giving a male:female ratio of 2.8:1. Staghorn (partial or complete) calculi were found in 27.5% of patients, while 72.5% had non-staghorn calculi. Intracorporeal energy sources used for stone fragmentation included ultrasonography in 917 patients (26.9%), pneumatic lithoclast in 1820 (53.5%), holmium laser in 141 (4.1%) and Lithoclast® master in 524 (15.4%). In the majority of patients (97.4%) a 18–22-F nephrostomy tube was placed after the procedure, while 69 patients (2.03%) underwent tubeless PCNL. The volume of the irrigation fluid used ranged from 7 to 37 L, with a mean of 28.4 L. The stone-free rate after PCNL in the first era studied was 78%, vs 83.2% in the second era, as assessed by combination of ultrasonography and plain abdominal film of the kidney, ureter and bladder. The complication rate in the first era was 21.3% as compared with 10.3% in the second era, and this difference was statistically significant. Stone analysis showed pure stones in 41% and mixed stones in 58% of patients. The majority of stones consisted of calcium oxalate. Conclusions: This is the largest series of PCNL reported from any single centre in Pakistan, where there is a high prevalence of stone disease associated with infective and obstructive complications, including renal failure.

One powerful framework to account for anomalous diffusion in biological and structurally heterogeneous tissues is the use of diffusion operators based on fractional calculus theory, which generalises the physical principles of standard diffusion in homogeneous media. However, their non-locality makes analytical solutions often unavailable, limiting the applicability of these modelling and analysis techniques. In this paper, we derive compact analytical signal decays for practical MRI sequences in the anisotropic fractional Bloch–Torrey setting, as described by the space fractional Laplacian and importantly the time Caputo derivative. The attained solutions convey relevant characteristics of MRI in biological tissues not replicated by standard diffusion, including super-diffusive and sub-diffusive regimes in signal decay and the diffusion-driven incomplete refocusing of spins at the end of the sequence. These results may therefore have significant implications for advancing the current interpretation of MRI, and for the estimation of tissue properties based on exact solutions to underlying diffusive processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anomalous diffusion; Fractional calculus; Magnetic resonance imaging","Calculations; Diffusion; Histology; Magnetism; Resonance; Tissue; Anomalous diffusion; Diffusion operators; Fractional calculus; Fractional Laplacian; Heterogeneous tissues; Modelling and analysis; Physical principles; Tissue microstructures; Magnetic resonance imaging",2-s2.0-85018285763

An integrated inventory model is established to find the optimal solutions of lot size, setup cost, and the total number of shipments from the vendor to the buyer in one production run, so that the joint expected total cost incurred has the minimum value. We consider three types of continuous probabilistic defective function to find the associated cost of the system. The expected total cost function is derived for each of these three distributions, its convexity is proved via differential calculus. An efficient iterative algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solution of the model. The computational effort and time are small for the proposed algorithm and it is simple to implement. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are used to demonstrate the application and the performance of the proposed methodology.

Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed the records of 125 children who were diagnosed with renal calculi and underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy between March 2011 and April 2016. Predictive scores, which consisted of Guy's Stone Score, S.T.O.N.E. (stone size, tract length, obstruction, number of involved calyces and essence/stone density) nephrolithometry and CROES (Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society) nomogram, were calculated for all patients included in the study. Patient demographics, stone-free rate and complications were all analyzed and are reported. Results Median Guy's Stone Score was 2 (IQR 2 to 3) in patients with residual stones (group 1) and 2 (1 to 2) in those who were stone-free (group 2). Median respective CROES nomogram scores were 215 (IQR 210 to 235) and 257 (240 to 264), and S.T.O.N.E. nephrolithometry scores were 8 (7 to 9) and 5 (5 to 6, all p <0.0001). S.T.O.N.E. score demonstrated the greatest accuracy in predicting stone-free rate. Guy's Stone Score was significantly correlated with complications but the CROES and S.T.O.N.E. scores were not significantly correlated with complications. Conclusions The scoring systems analyzed could be used to predict success of percutaneous nephrolithotomy in the pediatric setting. However, further studies are needed to formulate modifications for use in children. The main variables in the scoring systems, ie stone burden, tract length and case volume, were measured using records from adult patients. Besides these variables, the relatively small pelvicalyceal system and higher incidence of anatomical malformations in children could potentially affect percutaneous nephrolithotomy outcomes. © 2017 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.","kidney calculi; nephrostomy; pediatrics; percutaneous; postoperative complications; treatment outcome","antibiotic agent; antibiotic therapy; Article; blood transfusion; child; clinical decision making; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society score; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlational study; double J stent; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; female; Guy Stone Score; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; medical record review; nephrolithiasis; nephrostomy tube; pediatric surgery; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative infection; postoperative period; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; probability; prognosis; prognostic assessment; retrospective study; school child; sensitivity and specificity; septicemia; stone analysis; stone size tract length obstruction number of involved calyces and essence stone density score; ureteroscopy; urine incontinence; watchful waiting; Youden index",2-s2.0-85029705943

Objective: We aimed to analyze the salivary the major metabolites in the saliva of children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) before and after hemodialysis. Method: Thirty-six children diagnosed with CKD and forty healthy children were recruited for the study. 1H-NMR spectra were analyzed using multivariate and univariate approaches. Results: The CKD and the healthy control groups presented with similar numbers of dental caries (p &gt; 0.05) as determined by the number of decayed, missing, or filled deciduous teeth (0.87 ± 2.2 and 0.67 ± 2.1, respectively) or permanent teeth (0.79 ± 1.30 and 0.90 ± 1.7, respectively). The amount of dental calculus was significantly higher in the CKD group than in the healthy control group (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analyses using PLS-DA and O-PLS-DA demonstrated differences in the salivary metabolome of CKD patients before and after hemodialysis, as well as between post-dialysis CKD patients and healthy controls, suggesting that HD was not able to recover oral homeostasis. PLS-DA and OPLS-DA models showed satisfactory accuracy (ACC = 0.72) and prediction (0.64). On multivariate and univariate analyses, urea, acetate, ethanol, and fatty acid were significantly decreased in CKD saliva after hemodialysis. By contrast, saliva from the healthy controls had significantly higher levels of acetate and propionate and lower levels of ethanol, lactate, butyrate, phenylalanine, and creatinine than saliva from post-dialysis CKD patients. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that hemodialysis alters the expression of salivary metabolites; however, this alteration does not reestablish the healthy salivary metabolome, as the salivary metabolomic profile of healthy children is significantly different from that of children and adolescents with CKD, both before and after hemodialysis. The unique salivary characteristics of children with CKD may influence their oral health status. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adolescent; Children; Chronic kidney disease; Metabolomics; Saliva","acetic acid; alcohol; butyric acid; creatinine; fatty acid; glycoprotein; isoleucine; lactic acid; leucine; lipid; phenylalanine; propionic acid; urea; valine; adolescent; Article; blood sampling; child; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; deciduous tooth; dental caries; female; hemodialysis; human; major clinical study; male; metabolite; metabolomics; molecular weight; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; receiver operating characteristic; saliva analysis; tooth calculus",2-s2.0-85032856377

The new scalar curvature contains its Riemannian counterpart as the commutative limit. Similar to the results on noncommutative two tori, the quantum part of the curvature consists of actions of the modular derivation through two local curvature functions. Explicit expressions for those functions are obtained for all even dimensions (greater than two). In dimension four, the one variable function shows striking similarity to the analytic functions of the characteristic classes appeared in the Atiyah–Singer local index formula, namely, it is roughly a product of the j-function (which defines the Aˆ-class of a manifold) and an exponential function (which defines the Chern character of a bundle). By performing two different computations for the variation of the Einstein–Hilbert action, we obtain deep internal relations between two local curvature functions. Straightforward verification for those relations gives a strong conceptual confirmation for the whole computational machinery we have developed so far, especially the Mathematica code hidden behind the paper. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Connes–Landi deformation; Heat kernel expansion; Modular curvature; Pseudo differential calculus; Toric noncommutative manifolds",,2-s2.0-85027467819

A multi-objective optimization problem is defined to maximize critical buckling load and minimize mass of the beam, simultaneously. To this end, Timoshenko beam theory is employed and equilibrium equations for two-dimensional functionally graded porous (2D-FGP) beam are derived. For the solution, we present generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM) and consider two symmetric boundary conditions (Clamped-Clamped and Hinged-Hinged). Solving generalized eigenvalue problem, critical buckling load for 2D-FGP beam is then obtained. During optimization procedure, a cubic polynomial spline interpolating on a finite number of design variables is considered as porosity distribution function. Solving the multi-objective optimization problem using bio-inspired genetic algorithm (NSGA II), leads to a set of optimal porosity distributions known as Pareto optimal solutions. To show the validity of the proposed formulation, we compare results with those reported (1D and 2D porosity distributions) in the literature as well as finite element simulations. We also compare Pareto solutions with optimization result of one dimensional porosity distribution which clearly demonstrates the importance of the presented optimization procedure. In general, optimum porosity distributions are different in each boundary condition. However, in most of the optimum solutions, middle line of the beam is composed of the material with higher values of porosity and outer corners have lower values of porosity. Pareto optimal solutions also indicate that, sharp decreasing of the mass makes a slight decline in critical buckling load when it has large values. The proposed approach can be used for design of porosity distribution in FGP structures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buckling analysis; Generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM); Timoshenko beam theory; Two-dimensional porosity distribution","Boundary conditions; Buckling; Differentiation (calculus); Distribution functions; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Finite element method; Genetic algorithms; Interpolation; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Particle beams; Polynomial approximation; Problem solving; Buckling analysis; Finite element simulations; Generalized differential quadrature methods; Generalized eigenvalue problems; Multi-objective optimization problem; Pareto optimal solutions; Porosity distributions; Timoshenko beam theory; Porosity",2-s2.0-85028465526

Hepatic steatosis has also been linked to visceral obesity and nephrolithiasis. We evaluated the association of noncontrast computerized tomography based diagnosis of visceral obesity and hepatic steatosis with 24-hour urine parameters and stone composition in kidney stone formers. Materials and Methods A total of 98 kidney stone formers were included in study who had computerized tomography imaging and 24-hour urine studies available. For each patient a single computerized tomography axial area measurement was obtained of the visceral fat area. Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed by comparing the HU of regions from the liver and spleen. Univariate analysis was performed to compare patients with or without an elevated visceral fat area and hepatic steatosis. Multivariate linear and logistic regression was done to assess for variables associated with 24-hour urine parameters and stone composition. Results An elevated visceral fat area was associated with higher 24-hour urine sodium (175 vs 157 mg per day, p &lt;0.036) and lower 24-hour urine pH (5.724 vs 6.478, &lt;0.0001). Urine pH less than 6 (OR 2.52) was associated with hepatic steatosis. Low urine pH less than 6 (OR 11.1, p = 0.004) and stone volume greater than 65 mm3 (OR 5.12, p = 0.023) were associated with an elevated visceral fat area. Low urine pH less than 6 (OR 5.87) and visceral fat area greater than 48% (OR 5.33) were associated with uric acid stones. Linear regression demonstrated that the percent of visceral fat area was associated with lower 24-hour urine pH (β-coefficient –0.438, p &lt;0.0001).

With advances in technology, it is unclear which treatment is most effective and/or safest. Objective To systematically review literature reporting benefits and harms of SWL and URS in the management of upper ureteric stones. Evidence acquisition Databases including Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched from January 2000 to November 2014. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials, and nonrandomised studies comparing any subtype or variation of URS and SWL were included. The primary benefit outcome was stone-free rate (SFR). The primary harm outcome was complications. Secondary outcomes included retreatment rate, need for secondary, and/or adjunctive procedures. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess RCTs, and an extended version was used to assess nonrandomised studies. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was used to assess the quality of evidence. Evidence synthesis Five thousand-three hundred and eighty abstracts and 387 full-text articles were screened. Forty-seven studies met inclusion criteria; 19 (39.6%) were RCTs. No studies on children met inclusion criteria. URS and SWL were compared in 22 studies (4 RCTs, 1 quasi-randomised controlled trial, and 17 nonrandomised studies). Meta-analyses were inappropriate due to data heterogeneity. SFR favoured URS in 9/22 studies. Retreatment rates were higher for SWL compared with URS in all studies but one. Longer hospital stay and adjunctive procedures (most commonly the insertion of a JJ stent) were more common when primary treatment was URS. Complications were reported in 11 out of 22 studies. In eight studies, it was possible to report this as a Clavien-Dindo Grade. Higher complication rates across all grades were reported for URS compared with SWL. For intragroup (intra-SWL and intra-URS) comparative studies, 25 met the inclusion criteria. These studies varied greatly in outcomes measured with data being heterogeneous. Conclusions Compared with SWL, URS was associated with a significantly greater SFR up to 4 wk but the difference was not significant at 3 mo in the included studies. URS was associated with fewer retreatments and need for secondary procedures, but with a higher need for adjunctive procedures, greater complication rates, and longer hospital stay. Patient summary In this paper, the relative benefits and harms of the two most commonly offered treatment options for urinary stones located in the upper ureter were reviewed. We found that both treatments are safe and effective options that should be offered based on individual patient circumstances and preferences. Both ureteroscopy and shock wave lithotripsy are safe and effective treatments for proximal ureteric stones. However, ureteroscopy appears to result in superior short-term stone-free rates and a lower rate of retreatment, but associated with more adjunctive procedures, higher complication rate, and longer hospital stay. © 2017 European Association of Urology","Shock wave lithotripsy; Ureteral calculi; Ureteroscopy; Urolithiasis","bibliographic database; body mass; comparative effectiveness; cost benefit analysis; emergency ward; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; health care cost; hematuria; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; hydronephrosis; length of stay; medical record; meta analysis; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; pregnant woman; priority journal; quality of life; retreatment; Review; systematic review; ureter stone; ureteroscopy",2-s2.0-85018683243

The weighted coefficients are determined, and with them, the original equation is transformed into a group of general ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are discretized by an effective difference scheme or Runge–Kutta method. The stability is investigated under a mild theoretical condition. Secondly, based on a set of cubic B-splines, we develop a new Crank–Nicolson type DQ method for the 2D space-fractional ADEs without advection. The DQ approximations to fractional derivatives are introduced, and the values of the fractional derivatives of B-splines are computed by deriving explicit formulas. The presented DQ methods are evaluated on five benchmark problems and the simulations of the unsteady propagation of solitons and Gaussian pulse.

The acceleration and transport of energetic particles in astrophysical plasmas can be described by the so-called Parker equation, which is a kinetic equation comprising diffusion terms both in coordinate space and in momentum space. In the past years, it has been found that energetic particle transport in space can be anomalous, for instance, superdiffusive rather than normal diffusive. This requires a revision of the basic transport equation for such circumstances. Aims. Here, we extend the Parker equation to the case of anomalous diffusion by means of fractional derivatives that generalize the usual second-order spatial diffusion operator. Methods. We introduce the left and right Caputo fractional derivatives in space. These derivatives are one of the tools used to describe anomalous transport. We consider the case of steady-state solutions upstream and downstream of a planar shock. Results. We obtain an estimate of the particle acceleration time at shocks in the case of superdiffusion. An analytical solution of the steady-state fractional Parker equation is given by the Mittag-Leffler functions, which correspond to a power-law profile for the energetic particle intensity far upstream of the shock, in agreement with the results obtained from a probabilistic approach to superdiffusion. These functions also correspond to a stretched exponential close upstream of the shock. Conclusions. These results can help to model more precisely the measured fluxes of energetic particles that are accelerated at both interplanetary shocks and supernova remnant shocks. © ESO, 2017.","Acceleration of particles; Cosmic rays; Diffusion; Methods: analytical; Plasmas; Shock waves","Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Differentiation (calculus); Diffusion; Integral equations; Particle accelerators; Plasma (human); Shock waves; Solar system; Acceleration of particles; Caputo fractional derivatives; Fractional derivatives; Interplanetary shocks; Methods:analytical; Mittag-Leffler functions; Particle acceleration; Probabilistic approaches; Equations of state",2-s2.0-85032673897

Review Methods: Published prospective or retrospective English-language studies with reported outcomes of more than one patient undergoing the combined endoscopic-transfacial procedure for parotid sialolithiasis were included. Two independent authors screened all eligible studies and reviewed and extracted data from relevant publications. Weighted pooled proportions for stone removal, symptom improvement, gland preservation, and complications were calculated. Results: Ten studies, primarily retrospective single-institution studies, were included in the final analysis, with a total of 184 patients. Overall, the procedure was noted to be successful with low risk; the weighted pooled proportions were 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97 to 1.00) for stone removal, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93 to 0.99) for symptom improvement, 1 (95% CI: 0.99 to 1.00) for gland preservation, and 0.06 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.15) for complications. Conclusions: Although our analysis is primarily based on retrospective data, the evidence shown here suggests that the combined endoscopic–transfacial technique is an effective treatment for parotid gland sialolithiasis not amenable to intraoral or purely endoscopic removal. This approach results in high rates of symptom improvement and gland preservation. The complication rates are low, further supporting the use of this technique.

A nonlinear formulation is developed with regard to the first-order shear deformation theory, von Karman geometrical nonlinearity in conjunction with the Hamilton principle. A Pasternak elastic foundation is assumed to be in contact with the annular plate during deformation. The distribution of electric potential across the thickness of piezoelectric layers is simulated via a combination of sinusoidal and linear functions. Both closed and open circuit electrical boundary conditions are taken into account for the bottom and top surfaces of piezoelectric layers. Generalized differential quadrature method is utilized to discretize the nonlinear equations of motion, Maxwell equation and boundary conditions, and then direct iterative method is used to solve the nonlinear system of equations. An extensive parametric study is directed to provide an insight into effects of the thickness of piezoelectric layers, piezoelectric materials, volume fraction and distribution of CNTs, geometrical parameters, elastic foundation coefficient, and mechanical/electrical boundary conditions on the nonlinear dynamic responses of the annular plate. It is found that both distribution and volume fraction of CNTs have a remarkable effect on nonlinear natural frequencies of FG-CNTRC annular plates. It is also revealed that the type of piezoelectric materials, thickness of piezoelectric layers and electrical boundary condition play a pivotal role in improving dynamic responses of FG-CNTRC annular plates.

While most prior studies have approached this issue by focusing on technology-related innovation, the role of balancing exploration and exploitation in other important organizational domains, i.e., marketing, and the interaction effect of ambidexterity across different domains have been overlooked. This study contributes to this line of research by investigating how firms simultaneously balance exploration and exploitation across two critical domains, namely technology innovation and market innovation. The study distinguishes four types of configurations: market leveraging (technology exploration and market exploitation), technology leveraging (technology exploitation and market exploration), pure exploitation (technology exploitation and market exploitation), and pure exploration (technology exploration and market exploration). From an organizational ambidexterity perspective, the current work investigates whether and how these different combinations exert distinctive effects on firm performance. Specifically, the article posits that (a) technology exploration and market exploitation complement each other, and (b) technology exploitation and market exploration also complement each other, such that both market leveraging and technology leveraging strategies have positive effects on firm performance. The article also maintains that such positive relationships are fully mediated by differentiation and low cost advantages. Conversely, it is argued that (c) technology exploration and market exploration conflict with each other, and (d) so do technology exploitation and market exploitation, such that both pure exploration and pure exploitation have negative effects on firm performance. Hypotheses were tested using survey data collected from 292 manufacturing and service firms in China. The results supported most of the hypotheses, except that pure exploration demonstrated no significant relationship with firm performance. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association","differentiation; exploitation; exploration; low cost; market; technology","Commerce; Differentiation (calculus); Engineering research; Marketing; Natural resources exploration; Technology; Balance exploration; Balancing exploration and exploitations; Exploitation; Interaction effect; Low costs; Market innovation; Technology exploitation; Technology innovation; Innovation",2-s2.0-85007484191

Methods: Retrospectively 392 consecutive patients with ureteric stone on NECT were included. Three radiologists independently measured the stone size. Stone location, side, hydronephrosis, CRP, medical expulsion therapy (MET) and all follow-up radiology until stone expulsion or 26 weeks were recorded. Logistic regressions were performed with spontaneous stone passage in 4 weeks and 20 weeks as the dependent variable. Results: The spontaneous passage rate in 20 weeks was 312 out of 392 stones, 98% in 0–2 mm, 98% in 3 mm, 81% in 4 mm, 65% in 5 mm, 33% in 6 mm and 9% in ≥6.5 mm wide stones.

Methods: A high-quality animation video was created for each of the respective fluoroscopic techniques, focusing into the parallel projection of external surgical manoeuvres and their effect in the three-dimensional space of the kidney. Results: Four predominant fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous access techniques are available, each with different advantages and limitations. Monoplanar access is used when a stable single-axis fluoroscopic generator is available and is mostly based on surgeons’ experience. Biplanar access uses a second fluoroscopy axis to assess puncture depth. The ‘bull's eye’ technique follows a coaxial to fluoroscopy puncture path and is associated with a shorter learning curve at the cost of increased hand radiation exposure. Hybrid and conventional triangulate techniques use target projection by two fluoroscopic planes to define the exact localisation of the target in space and access it through a third puncture site. Conclusions: Fluoroscopic guidance during PCNL puncture is a very efficient method for access establishment.

Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals, the major crystalline composition of kidney stones, have been demonstrated to be able to cause tight junction disruption to accelerate renal cell injury. However, the cellular signaling involved in COM crystal-induced tight junction disruption remains largely to be investigated. In the present study, we proved that COM crystals induced tight junction disruption by activating ROS/Akt/p38 MAPK pathway. Treating Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with COM crystals induced a substantial increasing of ROS generation and activation of Akt that triggered subsequential activation of ASK1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Western blot revealed a significantly decreased expression of ZO-1 and occludin, two important structural proteins of tight junction. Besides, redistribution and dissociation of ZO-1 were observed by COM crystals treatment. Inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) attenuated the activation of Akt, ASK1, p38 MAPK, and down-regulation of ZO-1 and occludin. The redistribution and dissociation of ZO-1 were also alleviated by NAC treatment. These results indicated that ROS were involved in the regulation of tight junction disruption induced by COM crystals. In addition, the down-regulation of ZO-1 and occludin, the phosphorylation of ASK1 and p38 MAPK were also attenuated by MK-2206, an inhibitor of Akt kinase, implying Akt was involved in the disruption of tight junction upstream of p38 MAPK.

The obtained results demonstrated that alkali-free bioactive glasses possess higher stimulating towards differentiation of hMSCs in comparison to the control 45S5 Bioglass®. The von Kossa assay demonstrated that all bioactive glasses studied were able to induce the appearance of calcium deposits even when the cells were cultured in DMEM, proving that these biomaterials per se induce hMSCs cell differentiation. It was also observed that in both cell culture medium used (DMEM, and osteogenesis differentiation medium) alkali-free bioactive glasses clearly induced the appearance of more calcium deposits than the 45S5 Bioglass®, indicating their greater ability to induce cell differentiation.

In addition, the effective doses are respectively: 0.63 mSv (x-ray), no radiation dose (Sono), 2.6 mSv (IVU) and 8–16 mSv (CT). Although CT has the highest detection rate for calculus, it also has the highest radiation dose. This research sought to lower the radiation dose by using CT scans with different dose conditions of standard dose (SD), 50% SD, 25% SD, and 15% SD to diagnose patients who suffer from urolithiasis and thus explore the feasibility of examining urolithiasis via CT with lower dose conditions. This research simulated the examination of patients with RANDO phantom, collocating PMMA slice phantom and pig's kidney. Fake calculuses made of five different materials of different sizes were put into the phantom and scanned individually. The results of the scanned images were given to two physicians who had many years of diagnostic experience to interpret the urolithiasis images.

In addition, this research used thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) to measure the radiation doses and compared the results with the dose values shown on the screen of the CT scanner to estimate the dose conversion factor (k).

To improve the performance of magnetostrictive actuator (MA), SAF is introduced to identify the hysteresis model of MA in this paper. In addition, a direct approach that is convenient to implement to derive the inverse model directly from experimental data is proposed to decrease the difficulty of obtaining the accurate inverse model. In order to improve the identification accuracy, a variable order fractional-order least mean square (VO-FLMS) algorithm is formulated for SAF by exploiting the fractional calculus concepts in parameters adaptation mechanism. VO-FLMS dynamically adapts the order of the fractional derivative based on the error power to achieve faster convergence rate with smaller steady-state error than least mean square algorithm and modified fractional-order least mean square algorithm. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of SAF with VO-FLMS for nonlinear system identification. In particular, VO-FLMS can adapt nonlinearity better than other compared algorithms.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate what percentage of echogenic nonshadowing renal lesions larger than 4 mm found at ultrasound are angiomyolipomas (AMLs) and to review how to diagnose AMLs, with particular emphasis on the increasing role played by MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study data were obtained at a single institution over a period of 45 months. Although some patients were being reviewed for specifc symptoms, such as hematuria, pain, or recurrent urinary tract infections, most of the fndings were incidental. Follow-up data on 158 lesions in 132 patients were available. Confrmation of diagnosis was made with follow-up imaging or with histopathologic examination. RESULTS. Ninety-eight (62.0%) of the lesions were AMLs, eight (5.1%) were renal cell carcinomas, three (1.9%) were oncocytomas, 17 (10.8%) were artifacts, seven (4.4%) were fat, fve (3.2%) were calculi, another eight (5.1%) were scars, and 12 (7.6%) were complicated cysts. The mean age of patients with AML was signifcantly lower than that of patients without AML (61.71 [SD, 13.25] years vs 68.80 [SD, 17.85] years; p = 0.005). There was a female association with AMLs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. Echogenic nonshadowing renal lesions larger than 4 mm seen at ultrasound should not be assumed to represent an AML without follow-up because a percentage of renal cell carcinomas will be missed. Although certain ultrasound features can be useful in differentiating an AML from a renal cell carcinoma and CT is frequently diagnostic, an understanding of MRI is important because it can potentially detect lipid-poor AMLs. © 2017 American Roentgen Ray Society.","Angiomyolipoma; Echogenic renal lesion; MRI; Renal cell carcinoma; Ultrasound",,2-s2.0-85032668236

In addition to the advancement of the finer instruments, laser technology with different powers has improved fragmentation of the stones. The advancement of stone retrival devices and baskets facilitated the procedures by decreasing the complications. Open stone surgery has almost disappeared and together with laparoscopy, it is only reserved for stones in children with anatomical abnormalities (pelvic kidneys, spinal deformities, etc.). Beyond surgical alternatives, although its use has proportionally decreased over time, shock wave lithotripsy is here to stay as a valuable option. Nevertheless, personalized management is the key to treat pediatric stone disease and it is the task of the surgeons to find out the best alternative according to the size and location of the stone, and age and body size of the child. Future technical improvements are also awaited and will soon improve the efficiency of the current endourological procedures. Personalized medicine has reached stone treatment in children. A multitude of different techniques with highly improved technical equipment allows for very fine tuning of stone treatment in children of all ages.

However, Fokker-Planck equations do not exist for stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) since the solutions to SDDEs are not Markov processes and have no corresponding infinitesimal generators. In this paper, we address the open question of finding governing equations for probability densities of SDDEs with discrete time delays. In the governing equation, densities for SDDEs with discrete time delays are expressed in terms of those for SDEs without delay. The latter have been well studied and can be obtained by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equations. The governing equation is given in a simple form that facilitates theoretical analysis and numerical computation. Some example are presented to illustrate the proposed governing equations.","Brownian motions; Discrete time delay; Probability density; Stochastic delay differential equations; Stochastic differential equations",,2-s2.0-85025812989

We wanted to review the literature for urolithiasis in pregnancy with a practical management guide for urologists. Methods: A non-systematic review of literature was carried out for all English language literature using Medline. To ensure a more comprehensive search, the review of diagnosis and management of pregnant patients with urolithiasis was carried out separately, by two authors independently. Due to diagnostic complexity, investigations (US, CT, MRI) carried out were assessed separately. Results: Our search included diagnostic studies such as US, CT and MRI (73, 20 and 27 articles, respectively) and management studies (55 articles in total). Details on etiology, radiation risk, safety of various diagnostic modalities, medications and treatment options are covered through an evidence-based approach. We provide a practical guide for urologists in what is clearly a stressful situation for patient and physician alike. Conclusions: Urolithiasis in pregnancy needs a careful multidisciplinary management to achieve good outcomes for both mother and baby.

Methods: A total of 190 male patients with distal ureteral stones were randomly divided into three groups. Patients in group 1 were administered tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day (n = 60). Patients in group 2 were asked to have sexual intercourse at least three times a week (n = 66). Patients in group 3 received standard medical therapy alone and acted as the controls (n = 64). The expulsion rate was controlled after 2 and 4 weeks. Differences between the groups were analyzed statistically by the Chi-square and Student’s t test. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The mean ages of the patients in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 34.4 ± 13.5 (18–60), 38.6 ± 14.1 (18–63), and 36.92 ± 12.4 (18–59) years, respectively (p > 0.05). The mean stone size was 7.09 ± 1.4 mm in group 1, 7.01 ± 1.4 mm in group 2, and 7.1 ± 1.3 mm in group 3 (p > 0.05). Spontaneous passage rates in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 81.6, 81.8, and 51.5%, respectively, and it was significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.0394) and group 2 (p = 0.0350). There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.9925). The analgesic needs in groups 1, 2, and 3 were found to be 1.3 ± 0.4, 1.2 ± 0.6, and 1.4 ± 0.4 times, respectively, and were significantly lower in the sexual intercourse group than in the control group (p = 0.0276). Conclusions: Tamsulosin and sexual intercourse increase the spontaneous passage of distal ureteral stones 5–10 mm in size. At least three sexual intercourses per week seem to be at least as effective as tamsulosin. Sexual intercourse also reduces the need for analgesics in ureteric colic due to ureteral stones. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Medical expulsive therapy; Sexual intercourse; Tamsulosin; Ureteral stone","analgesic agent; tamsulosin; adult; age; Article; controlled study; follow up; human; lithotripsy; major clinical study; male; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sexual intercourse; single drug dose; time factor; ureter stone; ureterorenoscopic lithotripsy",2-s2.0-85027329279

We focused specifically on a set of flipped classroom studies in which pre-class instructional videos were provided prior to face-to-face class meetings. We examined the following four major issues: (a) the types of out-of-class and in-class instructional activities used, (b) the effect of flipped learning on student achievement, (c) the participant perceptions of flipped classroom benefits, and (d) the main challenges of flipped classroom implementations. A meta-analysis of 21 comparison studies showed an overall significant effect in favor of the flipped classroom over the traditional classroom for mathematics education (Hedges’ g = 0.298, 95% CI [0.16, 0.44]), with no evidence of publication bias. A broader research synthesis of 61 studies revealed that the flipped classroom approach benefited student learning in three main aspects: increasing in-class time for task/practice, integrating new knowledge with existing beliefs, and real-time feedback. The two most frequently reported flipped classroom challenges were students’ unfamiliarity with flipped learning and significant start-up effort on the part of instructors. We hence propose a set of design principles to help foster the transition to the flipped classroom and improve the out-of-class and in-class learning designs. This set of design principles can also provide a more focused agenda for future research to examine the effect of the flipped classroom approach on student learning and motivation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Flipped classroom; Inverted classroom; Mathematics education; Statistics education; Teaching approach",,2-s2.0-85028315857

Materials and Methods Clinical data on 207 patients (mean ± standard deviation, 13.6 ± 8.0 months) with melamine-induced urolithiasis were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to treatment. A 5-year follow-up study was conducted with 95.7% (198 of 207) of the children. Ultrasonography, renal function evaluation, and urinalysis were analyzed. Results A total of 149 (72.0%) patients accepted conservative treatment. Fifty-eight (28.0%) patients accepted surgical intervention after conservative treatment proved ineffective. Of the 48 patients in whom retrograde ureteral catheterization was performed, 33 discharged the stone successfully, 4 had residual stones, 2 were switched to percutaneous nephrolithotripsy, and 9 underwent ureteroscopic lithotripsy. Six patients underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, and other 4 patients underwent ureteral lithectomy. The age of onset, clinical presentations, size and location of stones, renal function, and mean time of hospitalization in patients with surgical intervention were significantly different from those of patients who accepted conservative treatment only (P <.001). The main component of the 12 melamine-contained stone samples was urate. The results of 5-year follow-up (mean ± standard deviation, 72.7 ± 4.1 months) study in 198 children did not show any significant difference of stone residue, renal function, and urinalysis between 2 groups. Conclusion If the stones were treated appropriately in patients with melamine-induced urolithiasis, there is no medium-term risk for stone formation. Still, a longer time follow-up study is required to determine if there is any long-term poisonous effect on these patients. © 2017",,,2-s2.0-85028044887

Objective To provide an update on the various techniques of small-calibre nephrolithotomy (SC-PCNL) analyse their efficacy, safety and indications and determine their degree of implantation at this time. Material and methods We performed a review in PubMed of Spanish and English medical literature on the various techniques of SC-PCNL. Results The use of SC-PCNL has reduced the morbidity associated with standard PCNL, particularly bleeding, and has enabled tubeless nephrolithotomy with greater safety. There are various techniques with blurred terminology (Miniperc, Microperc, Mini-microperc, Ultraminiperc), which differ in terms of gauge employed and in certain technical aspects that require their indications be specified. Currently, SC-PCNL competes with techniques that are less invasive than standard PCNL such as ESWL and the RIRS in treating small stones, but the role of SC-PCNL is still not sufficiently understood and continues to be the subject of debate. Conclusions The indications for PCNL are expanding to small stone sizes due to the miniaturisation of the technique. PCNL competes in this field with ESWL and RIRS.

The ATWS are considered events which might produce a severe accident in a Boling Water Reactor (BWR). To mitigate this accident, a borated water solution is injected to absorb neutrons to control the power. This action is an alternative way to shutdown the reactor quickly and effectively. The boron in the reactor core produces atypical neutron absorption in combination with the intrinsic feedback mechanisms, producing effects of anomalous diffusion in neutron behavior. To describe this effect in this work we apply the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetics (FNPK) equation. The FNPK equations is ad hoc to modeling the dynamic behavior, due to considering in explicit form the macroscopic cross section due to absorption, and anomalous diffusion effects, which are not possible with the classical representation of neutron point kinetics equation.

The ways students handle graphs are frequently researched. Students' misconceptions are highlighted, and methods of improvement suggested. While kinematics graphs are to represent a real motion, they are also algebraic entities that must satisfy conditions for being algebraic functions. To be algebraic functions, they must pass certain tests before they can be used to infer more about motion. A preliminary survey of some physics resources has revealed that little attention is paid to verifying if the position, velocity and acceleration versus time graphs, that are to depict real motion, satisfy the most critical condition for being an algebraic function; the vertical line test. The lack of attention to this adherence shows as vertical segments in piecewise graphs. Such graphs generate unrealistic interpretations and may confuse students. A group of 25 college physics students was provided with such a graph and asked to analyse its adherence to reality. The majority of the students (N = 16, 64%) questioned the graph's validity. It is inferred that such graphs might not only jeopardize the function principles studied in mathematics but also undermine the purpose of studying these principles. The aim of this study was to bring this idea forth and suggest a better alignment of physics and mathematics methods. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-85032177778

Patients and methods: The first 34 consecutive modified supine percutaneous nephrolithotomy cases performed by a single consultant urologist inserting their own percutaneous tracts using ultrasound-guidance and fluoroscopy were evaluated. Operative data was collected prospectively over a 10-month period including any complications. The stone-free rate was evaluated three months post-operatively with a plain film or non-contrast computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters and bladder. Results: Renal access was achieved in all 34 cases. Mean age was 57 years (19–82) with 14 males and 20 females. Mean stone size 37.2 mm (20–72 mm). Overall stone-free rate was 85.3% at a mean follow up of 11.2 months. There was one Clavien Grade I, and three Clavien Grade II complications of post-operative fever requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics. No patients developed urosepsis, required blood transfusion or sustained any visceral injury. Median in-patient stay was one night (1–4).

Two relations are related to the asymptotic uncoupled heterogeneous problems, while the two remaining ones result from the viscoelastic coupling that manifests itself in the transient regime.

However, due to the nature of hardwood tree growth and bucking practices, the assessment of ellipticity in this manner may not be accurate. Trees grown on hillsides often develop supporting wood that gives the first few feet of the log butt a significant degree of ellipticity, while the rest of the log may be more circular. Good log bucking methods dictate that a log be bucked near a fork or a large knot, creating a higher-valued lower log and a jump cut or a lower-valued upper log. This practice and the additional supporting (buttress) wood below the knot can make the upper end of a log exhibit ellipticity. In this study, 703 hardwood logs from Appalachian forests were scanned using a high-resolution laser scanner, and the ellipticity and the angle of the greater axis was recorded for every foot along each log. Approximately one-third of the logs exhibited moderate to severe eccentricity on the small end. However, most logs (99%) did not exhibit significant ellipticity along the entire length. Furthermore, the mean length of the elliptical zone for all species was 3.3 feet.","Appalachian; Eccentricity; Ellipticity; Hardwoods; Ovality","Forestry; Appalachian; Appalachian hardwoods; Eccentricity; Ellipticity; High resolution; Laser scanner; Ovality; Supporting woods; Hardwoods",2-s2.0-85032701994

Patients and methods: 60 patients presenting with solitary lower pole kidney stones up to 15 mm were included in the study between March 2013 and December 2015. Patients were randomized into Microperc or RIRS groups with computer-generated numbers. Results: The mean stone size was 10.6 (5–15) and 11.5 (7–15) mm for Microperc and RIRS groups, respectively (P = 0.213). In the Microperc group, the scopy time was 158.5 s, while in the RIRS group, the scopy time was 26.6 s (P = 0.001). The hospitalization period in the Microperc group was 542 h, while it was 19 h in the RIRS group (P = 0.001). No statistical differences were observed during the operating time, pre-operative–post-operative hemoglobin (Hb), serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration speed (e-GFR) values and stone-free rates. No intraoperative complications were observed in either of the groups, while post-operative complications were observed in six patients in Microperc Group and five patients belonging to the RIRS Group (P = 0.922). Conclusions: Both Microperc and RIRS are safe and effective alternatives, and have similar stone clearance and complication rates for the management of lower pole kidney stones up to 15 mm in diameter. However, prolonged hospital stay and scopy times are the main disadvantages of Microperc and further research is needed to evaluate the renal tubular damages caused by both of these methods. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Flexible; Lower pole kidney stones; Microperc; Percutaneous nephrolithotomy; Retrograde intrarenal surgery; Ureteroscopy",,2-s2.0-85020280775

Next, we study the stability of such systems by taking into account the fact that the perturbation parameter is sufficiently small. For linear ODE coupled with fast hyperbolic PDE systems the stability of both subsystems implies the stability of the full system. On the other hand, a counterexample shows that the full system can be unstable even though the two subsystems are stable for a PDE coupled with fast ODE system.

The effect of the tested substance on the crystallization processes was monitored by spectrophotometric measurements and microscopic observations. The results obtained show that, in the presence of (-)-epicatechin, struvite nucleation occurs faster when compared with the control test. This means that its nucleation is shifted toward lower pH values.

We developed a model based on the course over time of commonly used biochemical parameters to reduce the rate of unnecessary endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and the risk of perioperative discovery of CBDS. Methods: Medical charts of patients who presented between 2010 and 2015 for symptomatic gallstone disease with suspected choledocholithiasis were reviewed and compared according to the presence/absence of CBDS on preoperative ERCP or during cholecystectomy. Results: 210 patients were included. Unnecessary ERCP and the discovery rate of CBDS were 9.0 and 22.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated age ≥80 years, neutrophils ≥12000/µL and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) ≥300 units/L at admission, alkaline phosphatase ≥180 units/L at days 3–5 post admission, and a decrease in C-reactive protein ≤10%, aspartate aminotransferase ≤35%, GGT ≤25%, and total bilirubin ≤15% between day 0 and days 3–5 to be predictive of CBDS. The area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve was 0.881. When used to select patients for preoperative ERCP, diagnostic accuracy was 94.8% when three predictors were present. Negative and positive predictive values were 100% in the absence of predictors and when five predictors were present, respectively. Unnecessary ERCP and CBDS discovery rates both decreased to 2.6%. Conclusions: Commonly used biochemical parameters correctly predict CBDS when they are analysed in a dynamic setting rather than at discrete time points. The proposed model constitutes a reliable tool to decrease unnecessary ERCP and perioperative discovery rates of CBDS. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cholecystectomy; Choledocholithiasis; Endoscopic; Laparoscopic; Liver function tests; Logistic models; Sphincterotomy",,2-s2.0-85017458337

Considering the significant risk of stone recurrence in primary stone-formers, repeated imaging studies are not uncommon. Cumulative effects of ionizing radiation exposure from various imaging studies could potentially increase the risk for developing cataracts and solid malignancies in urolithiasis patients. Therefore, practitioners planning or performing imaging studies with ionizing radiation are compelled to keep radiation exposure to humans and the environment as low as possible, thus strictly adhering to the ALARA (As Low as Reasonably Achievable) principles. This chapter will review the latest literature on lifetime radiation exposure of nephrolithiasis patients and present the latest recommendations in minimizing radiation exposure to them pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. For patients presenting with acute renal colic, especially those with body mass index of < 30, low-dose noncontrast computed tomography is the current gold standard of imaging. Patients with opaque stones are followed with ultrasonography (US) and plain radiography (kidney, ureter, and bladder or KUB). Intraoperatively, pulsed fluoroscopy could be used to significantly reduce radiation during ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Immediately postoperatively and in the long term, US and KUB could be used to follow up patients with nephrolithiasis. Only symptomatic patients suspected of ureteral stricture should obtain tri-phasic CT urography.

Comparing with the previous work, the main results given in this paper show that the Lyapunov-Razumikhin function is allowed to have a indefinite or positive definite derivative for almost everywhere along the solution trajectories of RDI. However, in most of the existing literature, the derivative (if it exists) of Lyapunov-Razumikhin function is required to be negative or semi-negative definite for almost everywhere. In addition, the Lyapunov-Razumikhin function in this paper is allowed to be non-smooth. To deal with the stability, we also drop the specific condition that the Lyapunov-Razumikhin function should have an infinitesimal upper limit. Finally, we apply the proposed Razumikhin techniques to handle the stability or stabilization control of discontinuous time-delayed neural networks.

Distributed knowledge can be seen as the sum of the knowledge in a group; it is sometimes referred to as the potential knowledge of a group, or the joint knowledge they could obtain if they had unlimited means of communication. In epistemic logic, a formula of the form DGφ is intended to express the fact that group G has distributed knowledge of φ, that the total information in the group can be used to infer φ. In this paper we show that this is not the same as φ necessarily being true after the members of the group actually share all their information with each other – perhaps contrary to intuitive ideas about what distributed knowledge is. We furthermore introduce a new operator RG, such that RGφ means that φ is true after G have shared all their information with each other – after G's distributed knowledge has been resolved. The RG operators are called resolution operators. We study logics with different combinations of resolution operators and operators for common and distributed knowledge.

Medium within the slab is NID in direction normal to the dielectric interfaces of the slab. Transcendental equations in terms of non-integer order Hankel functions have been derived. The order of non-integer order Hankel functions depends on parameter describing dimension of the NID space. Using graphical treatment, it has been shown that behavior of propagating mode changes substantially when value of the parameter describing dimension of the NID space changes. It has also been noted that NID parameter significantly effects the value of propagation constant, attenuation constant and cutoff frequency.

However, as the detection time and network size increase, the data volume may become very large in terms of both dimension and scale. To address this concern, various traffic flow data compression methods have been proposed, which archive the low-dimensional subspace rather than the original data. Many studies have shown the traffic flow data consist of different components, i.e. low-dimensional intra-day trend, Gaussian type fluctuation and burst components. Existing compression methods cannot compress the burst components well and provide very limited choices of compression ratio (CR). A better compression method should have the ability to archive all the dominant information in different components of traffic flow data. In this study, the authors compare the influence of different data reformatting, archive the bursts defined before in descending order with respect to the absolute value of the burst points and propose a flexible compression framework to balance between burst components and low-dimensional intra-day trend. Experimental results show that the proposed framework promotes the reconstruction accuracy significantly. Moreover, the proposed framework provides more flexible choices with respect to CR, which can benefit a variety of applications. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Intelligent systems; Real time systems; Absolute values; Compression methods; Detection time; Intelligent transportation systems; Low dimensional; Low-dimensional subspace; Reconstruction accuracy; Traffic flow; Data compression",2-s2.0-85031923752

A key insight is that distance computation can be split into two stages: First find the direction along which distance is increasing, then compute the distance itself. The heat method is robust, efficient, and simple to implement since it is based on solving a pair of standard sparse linear systems. These systems can be factored once and subsequently solved in near-linear time, substantially reducing amortized cost. Real-world performance is an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. The method can be applied in any dimension, and on any domain that admits a gradient and inner product-including regular grids, triangle meshes, and point clouds. Numerical evidence indicates that the method converges to the exact distance in the limit of refinement; we also explore smoothed approximations of distance suitable for applications where greater regularity is desired. © 2017 ACM.",,"Graph theory; Linear systems; Distance computation; Multiple source; Near-linear time; Numerical evidence; Real-world performance; Shortest path problem; Sparse linear systems; State-of-the-art methods; Numerical methods",2-s2.0-85032458325

Moreover, even when schedulers can provide real-time guarantees, it is unlikely that these guarantees are properly quantified using theoretical analysis that carries on to the implementation. To be able to analyze the guarantees offered by operating systems’ schedulers, we developed a publicly available tool that analyzes timing properties extracted from the execution of a set of threads and computes the lower and upper bounds to the supply function offered by the execution platform, together with information about migrations and statistics on execution times. rt-muse evaluates the impact of many application and platform characteristics including the scheduling algorithm, the amount of available resources, the usage of shared resources, and the memory access overhead. Using rt-muse, we show the impact of Linux scheduling classes, shared data and application parallelism, on the delivered computing capacity. The tool provides useful insights on the runtime behavior of the applications and scheduler.

Thus, performance improvements are relevant and can be achieved by using topology optimization methods. In particular, this work aims to develop a topological derivative formulation to design radial flow machine rotors by considering laminar flow. Based on the concept of traditional topology optimization approaches, in the adopted topological derivative formulation, solid or fluid material is distributed at each point of the domain. This is achieved by combining Navier–Stokes equations on a rotary referential with Darcy’s law equations. This strategy allows for working in a fixed computational domain, which leads to a topology design algorithm of remarkably simple computational implementation. In the optimization problem formulation, a multi-objective function is defined, aiming to minimize the energy dissipation, vorticity and power considering a volume constraint. The constrained optimization problem is rewritten in the form of an unconstrained optimization problem by using the Augmented Lagrangian formalism. The resulting multi-objective shape functional is then minimized with help of the topological derivative concept. In the context of this article, the topological derivative represents the exact sensitivity with respect to the nucleation of an inclusion within the design domain and the obtained analytical (closed) formula can be evaluated through a simple post processing of the solutions to the direct and adjoints problems. Both mentioned features allow for obtaining the optimized designs in few iterations by using a minimal number of user defined algorithm parameters. All equations and the derived continuous adjoint equations are solved through finite element method. As a result, two-dimensional designs of flow machine rotors are obtained by using this methodology. Their performance is analyzed by evaluating velocity and pressure distributions inside rotor. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Darcy’s law; Laminar flow machine rotor design; Navier-Stokes; Topological derivative; Topology optimization","Constrained optimization; Energy dissipation; Finite element method; Flow of fluids; Laminar flow; Navier Stokes equations; Radial flow; Shape optimization; Topology; Computational implementations; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Flow machines; Multi-objective functions; Navier Stokes; Topological derivatives; Topology Optimization Method; Unconstrained optimization problems; Optimization",2-s2.0-85019084661

The AVF method is a geometric integrator, i.e. it preserves the energy of the Hamiltonian systems and energy dissipation of the gradient systems. In this work, we show that the fully discrete energy of the FHN equation satisfies the mini-maximizer property of the continuous energy for the skew-gradient systems.

The key step of such methods is the computation of an optimal low-rank tensor to enrich the obtained iterative tensorial approximation. In variational problems, this step can be carried out by alternating minimization (AM) technics, but the convergence of such methods presents a real challenge. In the present work, the convergence of rank-one AM algorithms for a class of variational linear elliptic equations is studied. More precisely, we show that rank-one AM-sequences are in general bounded in the ambient Hilbert tensor space and are compact if a uniform non-orthogonality condition between iterates and the reaction term is fulfilled. In particular, if a rank-one AM-sequence is weakly convergent then it converges strongly and the common limit is a solution of the rank-one optimization problem. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Alternate minimization; Proper generalized decomposition (PGD); Tensor Hilbert spaces","Optimization; Tensors; Alternating minimization; Elliptic equations; High-dimensional problems; Numerical treatments; Optimization problems; Proper generalized decomposition (PGD); Separated representation; Variational problems; Iterative methods",2-s2.0-85021301889

The two lower concentrations of hydroxyapatite were distinguishable from oxalate at all energy thresholds and tube voltages, whereas discrimination at higher concentrations depended primarily on the energy thresholds used.

In this study we determined whether urologists use clinical practice guidelines when making clinical decisions, and whether demographic factors are associated with not using the guidelines or with a lack of guideline awareness. Methods We examined the 2014 AUA Census. Our outcome was a question regarding whether the participant used AUA clinical practice guidelines in clinical decision making. We performed comparative statistical analyses, stratifying our outcome by demographic and practice specific variables. Results A total of 2,204 urologists completed the census, representing 18.9% of practicing urologists in the United States. Median age was 53 years and 91.1% were male. The majority of urologists used clinical practice guidelines (94.8%) in clinical decision making. Clinical practice guidelines had the lowest use among urologists 65 years old or older (89.2%), those in solo practice (88.3%) and pediatric specialists (87.9%). Based on a multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors associated with not using clinical practice guidelines included increasing age, metropolitan practice setting and solo practice. Gender, AUA section, level of rurality and fellowship training were not statistically associated with clinical practice guideline use. Conclusions The majority of urologists (approximately 95%) use AUA clinical practice guidelines to inform clinical decisions. Our findings support the importance of clinical practice guidelines and highlight potential opportunities for better targeted outreach to improve clinical practice guideline use among practicing urologists. © 2017 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.","censuses; practice guidelines as topic; urology",,2-s2.0-85030455629

This assumption enables observers to work backward from agents' observed behavior to their underlying beliefs, preferences, and competencies. Intuitively, however, agents may have incomplete, uncertain, or wrong beliefs about what they want. More formally, agents try to maximize their expected utilities. This understanding is crucial when reasoning about others' behavior: It dictates when actions reveal preferences, and it makes predictions about the stability of behavior over time. In a set of 7 experiments we show that 4- and 5-year-olds understand that agents try to maximize expected utilities, and that these responses cannot be explained by simpler accounts. In particular, these results suggest a modification to the standard belief/desire model of intuitive psychology.

It is based on a non-classical formulation of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle given in variational form, which handles efficiently various control and/or state-dependent constraints. They arise naturally due to both physical limits of the actuators of the non-holonomic systems and potential existence of obstacles in the workspace. The method proposed here provides continuous solutions in infinite-dimensional control space. It seems to be in contrast to majority of known optimization algorithms which project infinite-dimensional control space into finite-dimensional one and then apply techniques of linear and/or nonlinear programming, thus resulting only in near-optimal trajectories. Moreover, the offered control schemes do not require computation of inverse or pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian in the case of classic non-holonomic motion planning what also results in numerical stability of our approach. The performance of the proposed control strategies is illustrated through computer simulations for a chosen class of non-holonomic structures operating in both an obstacle-free workspace and a workspace including obstacles.

A recent alternative to these techniques is based on the calculation of higher derivatives by using the Infinity Computer—a new computational device allowing one to work numerically with infinities and infinitesimals. Two variants of a one-step multi-point method closely related to the classical Taylor formula of order three are considered. It is shown that the new formula is order three accurate, though requiring only the first two derivatives of y(t) (rather than three if compared with the corresponding Taylor formula of order three). To get numerical evidence of the theoretical results, a few test problems are solved by means of the new methods and the obtained results are compared with the performance of Taylor methods of order up to four. © 2016 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS)","Infinity computer; Initial value problems; Numerical infinitesimals; Ordinary differential equations; Taylor methods","Algorithms; Differential equations; Digital arithmetic; Initial value problems; Ordinary differential equations; Analytical computations; Automatic differentiations; Computational devices; Higher order derivatives; Multi-point methods; Numerical infinitesimals; Successive derivatives; Taylor methods; Numerical methods",2-s2.0-84964626523

The approach is based on sum-of-squares and semidefinite programming techniques. It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand side is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls. The key idea, first described but not implemented by Chernyshenko et al., is that the difficult problem of optimizing a cost function involving long-time averages is replaced by an optimization of the upper bound of the same average. As such, a controller design requires the simultaneous optimization of both the control law and a tunable function, similar to a Lyapunov function. This paper introduces a method resolving the well-known inherent nonconvexity of this kind of optimization. The method is based on the formal assumption that the control is expensive, from which it follows that the optimal control is small. The resulting asymptotic optimization problems are convex. The derivation of all the polynomial coefficients in the controller is given in terms of the solvability conditions of state-dependent linear and bilinear inequalities. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of designing a full-information feedback controller that mitigates vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in the laminar regime via rotary oscillations. Control results on a reduced-order model of the actuated wake and in direct numerical simulation are reported. © 2017 IEEE.","Cylinder wake flow; expensive control; flow control; long-time average cost; small-feedback; sum of squares (SOS) of polynomials","Circular cylinders; Cost functions; Dynamical systems; Feedback; Feedback control; Lyapunov functions; Optimization; State feedback; Wakes; Asymptotic optimization; Long-time average costs; Nonlinear state feedback control; Polynomial coefficients; Reduced order models; Semi-definite programming; Simultaneous optimization; Solvability conditions; Controllers",2-s2.0-85013668232

A number of mechanisms have been proposed as playing a role in deterioration, some of which involve biological processes. Uric acid in bird excreta is broken down by fungi into urea and glyoxylic acid. This paper examines the effect of exposing stone and cement specimens to glyoxylic acid solutions. These materials were a limestone, a sandstone and two cement pastes – Portland and calcium sulfoaluminate cement. Specimens of these materials were submerged in acid solutions and deterioration characterised using mass loss measurements, micro-CT scanning, and analysis of the solutions at the end of the experiment and the acid-degraded layers at the specimen surface. Attempts were made to synthesise and characterise calcium salts of glyoxylic acid. Additionally, geochemical modelling was conducted to provide further understanding of the deterioration processes. The results indicate that the main processes involved in glyoxylic acid attack of the materials investigated are acidolysis and complex formation. No calcium glyoxylate salts were present in the degraded materials. Instead, a conversion of glyoxylate to oxalate occurred leading to precipitation of calcium oxalate compounds. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bird excreta; Cement; Fungi; Glyoxylic acid; Limestone; Sandstone","Birds; Calcium; Cements; Computerized tomography; Fungi; Limestone; Oxalic acid; Salts; Sandstone; Urea; Biological process; Calcium sulfoaluminate cement; Complex formations; Deterioration process; Geochemical modelling; Glyoxylic acids; Mass-loss measurement; Specimen surfaces; Deterioration; bird; building; cement; fungus; limestone; organic acid; sandstone; Aves; Fungi",2-s2.0-85029347938

We extend our previous qualitative type analysis based on rough sets theory which make it possible to partition the set of voting procedures considered into some subsets within which the voting procedures are indistinguishable, i.e. (very) similar. Then, we propose an extension of those analyses towards a quantitative evaluation via the use of degrees of similarity and dissimilarity, not necessarily metrics and dual (in the sense of summing up to 1). We consider the amendment, Copeland, Dodgson, max-min, plurality, Borda, approval, runoff, and Nanson, voting procedures, and the Condorcet winner, Condorcet loser, majority winner, monotonicity, weak Pareto winner, consistency, and heritage criteria. The satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the particular criteria by the particular voting procedures are represented as binary vectors.

In our setting, a weight is the label of a leaf node of the run tree when executing a transition, which is helpful in complementing L-ABAs. Taking the dual operation on the transition function and negating final costs on states, we can get the complement of a given L-ABA. We point out that L-ABAs have the same expressive power as L-valued fuzzy nondeterministic Büchi automata (L-NBAs). A construction presented here shows that languages accepted by L-valued fuzzy alternating co-Büchi automata (L-ACAs) are also ω-regular languages.

Methods: Data on patients who had LCBDE over a 3-year period were collected retrospectively. Patients who had ongoing choledocholithiasis after unsuccessful LCBDE were considered for the test group and patients who had successful LCBDE were considered for the control group. Preoperative, day 1 post-operative and day 2 post-operative alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine transaminase (ALT) and bilirubin levels were recorded. Proportions of patients who had worsening LFTs were analysed in each group. Results: Proportions of patient who had worsening LFTs on day 1 were not statistically different between two groups and they were statistically equal on equivalence testing (two one-sided tests). On day 2, proportions of patient were again not statistically different. Bilirubin and ALT were statistically equivalent (P = 0.022 and P = 0.025 respectively) but GGT and ALP failed to achieve statistical equivalence (P = 0.062 and P = 0.138 respectively) on day 2. Twelve patients with normal appearing final intraoperative cholangiogram needed reintervention due to retained choledocholithiasis diagnosed subsequently. LFTs progressively improved despite presence of choledocholithiasis in eight of these 12 patients (75%) and only four were diagnosed by worsening post-operative LFTs during index admission. Conclusion: LFTs in the early post-operative period are not useful in determining which patients require biliary imaging or intervention after an apparently successful LCBDE. © 2015 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons","cholangiography; choledocholithiasis; common bile duct; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; liver function tests; retrospective studies",,2-s2.0-85032709575

Incorporating the effect of all these layers explicitly in a hydraulic fracture simulator would require a prohibitively fine mesh. To avoid such a scenario, a suitable homogenization, which would represent the effect of multiple layers in an average sense, should be performed. We consider a sample variation of elastic properties and minimum horizontal stress versus depth that has more than a hundred layers. We evaluate methodologies to homogenize the stress and the elastic properties. The elastic response of a layered material is found to be equivalent to that of a transversely isotropic material, and the explicit relations for the effective parameters are obtained. To illustrate the relevance of the homogenization procedure for hydraulic fracturing, the propagation of a plane strain hydraulic fracture in a finely layered shale is studied. To reduce the complexity of the numerical model, elastic layering is neglected and only the effect of the stress layers is analyzed. The results demonstrate the ability of the homogenized stress model to accurately capture the hydraulic fracture behavior using a relatively coarse mesh. This result is obtained by using a special asymptotic solution at the tip element that accounts for the local stress variation near the tip, which effectively treats the material at the tip element as nonhomogenized. © 2017 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,"Elasticity; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Mesh generation; Shale; Strain; Asymptotic solutions; Effective parameters; Elastic properties; Homogenization approach; Homogenization procedure; Homogenized stress; Layered Structures; Transversely isotropic materials; Hydraulic fracturing",2-s2.0-85028460696

They have attracted interest over the last years. Methods to estimate the parameters of an MCARMA process require an identifiable parametrization such as the Echelon form with a fixed Kronecker index, which is in the one-dimensional case the degree p of the autoregressive polynomial. Thus, the Kronecker index has to be known in advance before parameter estimation can be done. When this is not the case, information criteria can be used to estimate the Kronecker index and the degrees (p, q), respectively. In this paper, we investigate information criteria for MCARMA processes based on quasi maximum likelihood estimation. Therefore, we first derive the asymptotic properties of quasi maximum likelihood estimators for MCARMA processes in a misspecified parameter space. Then, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for information criteria to be strongly and weakly consistent, respectively. In particular, we study the well-known Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as special cases. © 2017 ISI/BS.","AIC; BIC; CARMA process; Consistency; Information criteria; Kronecker index; Law of iterated logarithm; Quasi maximum likelihood estimation",,2-s2.0-85019158718

These nonlinearities are usually associated to large deformations or the use of smart materials such as piezo actuators and memory shape alloys. Including them in the controller model results in passive dynamic controllers with nonlinear potential energy function and/or nonlinear damping forces. First it is shown that under very natural assumptions the solutions of the partial differential equation with the nonlinear dynamic boundary conditions exist globally. Secondly, when energy dissipation is present in the controller, then it globally asymptotically stabilizes the partial differential equation.

Methods: Consecutive ureterorenoscopic (URS) and percutaneous (PNL) urinary stone procedures over a 5-year period were reviewed. Procedures were divided into LSDs and RSP. Differences between the groups were separately analysed for URS and PNL. Primary outcomes included intra- and post-operative complication rates and grades. Secondary outcomes were operation time, length of hospital stay, stone-free rate, and retreatment rate. Pearson’s Chi-square analysis, Mann–Whitney U test, and logistic and linear regression were used to compare outcomes between LSDs and RSP. Results: During the study period, we performed 666 URSs and 182 PNLs, and 151 of these procedures were LSDs. Among URSs, the overall intra-operative complication rate was 3.2% for LSDs and 2.5% for RSP (p = 0.72) and the overall post-operative complication rate was 13.7% for LSDs and 8.8% for RSP (p = 0.13). Among PNLs, the overall intra-operative complication rate was 8.9% for LSDs and 5.6% for RSP (p = 0.52) and the overall post-operative complication rate was 28.6% for LSDs and 34.9% for RSP (p = 0.40). For both URSs and PNLs, no statistically significant differences in complication grade scores were observed between LSDs and RSP. Operation time was significantly longer for LSD-URS group, but there was no difference between the PNL groups. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay and stone-free rate. The retreatment rate was higher in the LSD-URS group compared with RSP-URS group but similar between the PNL groups. Multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusting for confounders, revealed no association between LSD and more or less favourable outcomes as compared to RSP. Conclusion: Live surgical demonstrations do not seem to compromise patients’ safety and outcomes when performed by specialised endourologists. © 2017, The Author(s).","Demonstrations; Lithotomy; Live; Percutaneous; Stones; Surgical; Ureteroscopy; Urolithiasis",,2-s2.0-85019623598

Because of industrial constraint (e.g. calculation time), the cross-sections can not be calculated on the fly due to the huge number of them. Hence, a reconstruction (or interpolation) process is used in order to evaluate the cross-sections at every point required, from (as few as possible) pre-calculated points. With most classical methods (for example: multilinear interpolation which is used in the core code COCAGNE of EDF (Électricité De France)), high accuracy for the reconstruction often requires a lot of pre-calculated points. We propose to use the Tucker decomposition, a low-rank tensor approximation method, to deal with this problem. The Tucker decomposition allows us to capture the most important information (one parameter at a time) to reconstruct the cross-sections. This information is stored as basis functions (called tensor directional basis functions) and the coefficients of the decomposition instead of pre-calculated points. Full reconstruction is done at the core code level using these decompositions. In this paper, a simplified multivariate analysis technique (based on statistical analysis) is also proposed in order to demonstrate that we can improve the quality of the acquired information as well as the accuracy of our approach. Using the Tucker decomposition, we will show in proposed use cases that we can reduce significantly the number of pre-calculated points and the storage size (compared to the multilinear interpolations) while achieving high accuracy for the reconstruction, even on a larger domain of parameters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-section reconstruction; Interpolation; Low-rank tensor approximation; Statistical analysis; Tucker decomposition","Decomposition; Functions; Interpolation; Multivariant analysis; Neutron scattering; Nuclear reactors; Reactor cores; Statistical methods; Tensors; Basis functions; Calculation time; Classical methods; Low-rank tensor approximations; Multivariate analysis techniques; Neutron cross sections; Physical parameters; Tucker decompositions; Quality control",2-s2.0-85019677477

These values can easily be determined by using laboratory equipment. For developing the correlations, an experimental dataset from the literature covering 35 samples was collected to be employed in the training and validation steps. The obtained optimum parameters of artificial neural network in the training stage by ELM were employed to develop new correlations. The HHVs calculated by using density-based correlation (HHV = 50823.183 − 12.34095ρ) showed the mean absolute and relative errors of 145.8048 kJ/kg and 0.3695 %, respectively.

This concept is a generalization of binary density inversion to the models described by any number of discrete model parameters. The multinary inversion makes it possible to explicitly exploit the sharp contrasts of the density between the host media and anomalous targets in the inversion of gravity and gravity gradiometry data. In the framework of the multinary inversion method, we use the given values of density and error functions to transform the density distribution into the desired step-function distribution. To accommodate a possible deviation of the densities from the fixed discrete values, we develop an adaptive technique for selecting the corresponding standard deviations, guided by the inversion process. The novel adaptive multinary inversion algorithm is demonstrated to be effective in determining the shape, location, and densities of the anomalous targets. We find that this method can be effectively applied for the inversion of the full tensor gravity gradiometry (FTG) data computer simulated for the SEG salt density model and for the field FTG data collected in the Nordkapp Basin, Barents Sea. © 2017 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,"Distribution functions; Adaptive technique; Density distributions; Density inversion; Gravity gradiometry; Inversion algorithm; Inversion methods; Inversion process; Standard deviation; Metadata",2-s2.0-85028472876

As surgical providers in a high risk subspecialty, urologists are at particularly high risk. Interventions for nephrolithiasis are especially common in practice, and understanding the risks associated with high volume procedures is critical for quality improvement and cost containment. Methods Using the Westlaw legal database we identified all legal briefs with the search terms “medical malpractice” and “kidney stone” or “nephrolithiasis” for dates between January 2000 and December 2015. Each case was evaluated for alleged cause of malpractice, resulting injury and indemnity payments. Results The initial search yielded 55 cases, which was decreased to 29 after exclusions. Most cases (15, 52%) were decided in favor of the defendant, while the remaining suits led to indemnity payments, including 6 cases that were settled and 8 with verdicts for the plaintiff. Of named defendants 75% were urologists. The mean settlement amount was $158,400 while the mean indemnity payment for verdicts decided in favor of the plaintiff was $124,400. The most commonly alleged breach of duty was negligent performance in surgery (15 cases), followed by negligent postoperative care (6 cases), and failure to diagnose and treat (5 cases). The most commonly claimed damage was death (13 cases). Conclusions Malpractice cases related to the management of nephrolithiasis most commonly involve allegations of negligent performance in surgery, negligent postoperative care, or failure to diagnose or treat.

This strategy is an application of the matrix–vector–product approach in Tau formulation of the problem. We first study the regularity of the exact solution and show that some derivatives of the exact solution have a singularity at origin dependence on both order of fractional derivative and weakly singular kernel function which makes poor convergence results for the Tau discretization of the problem. In order to recover high-order of convergence, we propose a new variable transformation to regularize the given functions and then to approximate the solution via a satisfactory order of convergence using an operational Tau method.

For instance, in the analysis of methylxanthines in urine, a solid-phase extraction is often required. In the current work, a rapid and highly sensitive “dilute-and-shoot” method combining ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/HRMS) was validated for urinary determination of twelve analytes: uric acid, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 1-methyluric acid, 1,3-dimethyluric acid, 1-methylxanthine, 3-methylxanthine, 7-methylxanthine, theophylline, theobromine, paraxanthine and caffeine. These analytes are the major physiological metabolites of caffeine, theobromine or theophylline, or final products of purine catabolism. The separation was carried out on a core-shell Kinetek EVO C18 column coupled to a Q Exactive Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) probe, that operated both in positive and negative ionization modes. The twelve analytes eluted from between 1.5 and 10.5 min. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values ranged from 0.25 to 2.5 ng/mL, and the calibration curves were linear from the LLOQ to 100 ng/mL. The only pretreatment needed was to dilute each urine sample (typically to 1/500) with 0.1% formic acid solution, and then filter the diluted sample before injecting it into the UHPLC system. With this high dilution, there were no significant matrix effects, and the intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy values were acceptable (coefficients of variance and relative errors below 15%, except for the LLOQ, for which they were below 20%). Furthermore, the analysis of spiked urine samples with 25 ng/mL of the target analytes showed excellent recoveries and precision levels for the twelve analytes. To our knowledge, there is no other published method that allows for the simultaneous determination of the concentrations of these twelve compounds, nor has a previously reported method been indicated to show such low LLOQ values as we have for the majority of the analytes.

Since depolarization originates from light that has been multiply-scattered inside the sample, measurements were done by a polarimetric scatterometer equipped with large aperture optics to efficiently capture direct and scattered light. We made measurements in both, real and Fourier planes to study the distribution of polarization across the surface as well as their angular distribution respectively. We show that when properly averaged, the information obtained from images in both planes is equivalent. Rough stretched plastic sheets are used as model samples representing anisotropic turbid media which show both retardance and depolarization. The plastic sheets were stacked in different orientations to create different distributions of form birefringence, which in turn gave rise to different polarimetric properties such as linear (0°–90°, 45°–135°) and circular birefringence. We show that the dependency on the values of both, polarization properties and depolarization follows the theory of the fluctuating medium model, formulated in the framework of the differential Mueller matrix formalism.

With the rising prevalence of stone disease in the face of finite resources, there is increasing pressure to undertake procedures as a day case avoiding in-patient stay. There are a limited number of studies reporting on the feasibility of ureteroscopy as a day-case procedure. This study aimed to investigate the prospective outcomes and predictors precluding to DC-URS for stone disease in patients treated in our university teaching hospital. Materials and methods: Between March 2012 and July 2016, consecutive cases of adult stone ureteroscopy performed or supervised by a single surgeon were recorded in a prospective database. Patients underwent pre-operative counselling in a specialist stone clinic and were admitted to a dedicated ‘Surgical day unit’ on the day of surgery. A standardised anaesthetic protocol was adhered to in all cases. Data on patient demographics, stone parameters, pre-operative assessment, operative details, length of stay, stone-free rate and complication rates were collected and analysed. Results: A total of 544 consecutive adult ureteroscopy for stone disease were conducted over the study period with a day-case rate of 77.7%. Thirty-nine percent of failed day-case ureteroscopy were due to late completion of ureteroscopy and due to associated social circumstances of patients. The mean stone size, operating time duration and post-operative stent insertion rates for DC-URS patients were 14 mm, 46 min and 96.5%, respectively. Post-operatively, the mean stone-free rate (SFR), unplanned re-admissions and complications for DC-URS patients were 95, 4 and 4%, respectively. A higher failure of DC-URS was related to patient’s age (p = 0.003), positive pre-operative urine culture (p < 0.001), elevated pre-operative serum creatinine (p < 0.001) and higher mean operating time (p < 0.02). Conclusion: Based on our results, a day-case ureteroscopy rate of nearly 78% can be achieved. With its acceptable complication rate, and low re-admission rates, DC-URS is a safe and feasible option in a majority of patients with stone disease. © 2017, The Author(s).","Day case; Kidney; Laser; Stones; Ureterorenoscopy; Ureteroscopy; Urolithiasis",,2-s2.0-85020533679

In the original Zener theory, nonlinear Hertzian contact law was used, and it was assumed that impact forces are transmitted through natural intensity factors depending on coupled physical properties of the plate and the impactor. However, when the force histories were predicted, a diverging trend appeared for softer materials with elastic moduli below 20 GPa. It is hypothesized that the primary reasons for this divergence are due to the contact time delay and the viscoelastic dissipation of energy, which are not considered in current Zener models. Several modifications of the model have been proposed since its inception, but it has been found that they are not independently sufficient to accurately predict impact force histories. In this article, a modified Zener theory is proposed introducing two new parameters in the governing differential equation derived from the sensor phase lag index and the dominant frequency band through a set of experiments employing a spiral sensing mechanism followed by an optimization process. The spiral lag index shows an unexpected peculiar trend with soft impactors (< 20 GPa), which are distinctly different from hard impactors and are judicially incorporated in the model. Furthermore, the force histories are accurately reconstructed with the proposed modifications. © 2017, Society for Experimental Mechanics.","Impact force history; Passive monitoring; Spiral Sensing; Viscous damping; Zener theory","Differential equations; Frequency bands; Impact force history; Passive monitoring; Spiral Sensing; Viscous damping; Zener theory; Forecasting",2-s2.0-85026920450

Different types of ω-automata differ in their succinctness and complexity of their emptiness problems, as a result, theory of ω-automata has received considerable research attention. Pushdown automata over infinite words (called ω-PDAs), a generalization of ω-automata, are a natural model of recursive programs. Our goal in this paper is to conduct a relatively complete investigation on the complexity of the emptiness problems for variants of ω-PDAs. For this purpose, we consider ω-PDAs of five standard acceptance types: Büchi, Parity, Rabin, Streett and Muller acceptances. Based on the transformation for ω- automata and the efficient algorithm proposed by Esparza et al. in CAV’00 for verifying the emptiness problem of ω-PDAs with Büchi acceptance, it is trivial to check the emptiness problem of other ω-PDAs. However, this naive approach is not optimal. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for the emptiness problem of ω-PDAs based on the observations of the structure of accepting runs. Our algorithms outperform algorithms that go through Büchi PDAs. In particular, the space complexity of the algorithm for Streett acceptance that goes through Büchi acceptance is exponential, while ours is polynomial. The algorithm for Parity acceptance that goes through Büchi acceptance is in O(k3n2m) time and O(k2nm) space, while ours is in O(kn2m) time and O(nm) space, where n (resp. m and k) is the number of control states (resp. transitions and index). Finally, we show that our algorithms yield a better solution for the pushdown model checking problem against linear temporal logic with fairness. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","emptiness; linear temporal logic; model checking; pushdown automata; ω-words","Computer circuits; Model checking; Temporal logic; Automata-theoretic approach; emptiness; Emptiness problem; Linear temporal logic; Muller acceptance; Push-down automata; Recursive programs; System verifications; Computational complexity",2-s2.0-85024101258

For particular settings, such as anisotropic ℓ1 and TV-type regularization, previously used debiasing techniques are shown to be special cases. The proposed approach is, however, easily applicable to a wider range of regularizations. The two-step debiasing is shown to be well-defined and to optimally reduce bias in a certain setting.

Nevertheless, a number of phenomena such as heat, energy, pollution, also including social and mobility aspects would undoubtedly benefit from using a model that is explicitly focused on defining the urban architectural void and its characteristics as continuous field, interconnected network or series of spatial units. Therefore, this paper aims to suggest a versatile data model that would allow to separate, interpret, analyze and visualize the urban architectural void using a standardized automated procedure.

Since these inspection approaches are both tedious and extremely costly, a need for a method facilitating reliable, remote monitoring of the blades has been identified. In this article, it is examined whether a vibration-based damage localization approach proposed by the authors can provide such reliable monitoring of the location of a structural damage in a wind turbine blade. The blade, which is analyzed in idle condition, is subjected to unmeasured hits from a mounted actuator, yielding vibrations that are measured with a total of 12 accelerometers; of which 11 are used for damage localization. The employed damage localization method is an extended version of the stochastic dynamic damage location vector method, which, in its origin, is a model-based method that interrogates damage-induced changes in a surrogate of the transfer matrix. The surrogate’s quasi-null vector associated with the lowest singular value is converted into a pseudo-load vector and applied to a numerical model of the healthy structure in question, hereby, theoretically, yielding characteristic stress resultants approaching zero in the damaged elements. The proposed extension is based on outlier analysis of the characteristic stress resultants to discriminate between damaged elements and healthy ones; a procedure that previously, in the context of experiments with a small-scale blade, has proved to mitigate noise-induced anomalies and systematic, non-damage-associated adverse effects. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","damage localization; damage location vectors; outlier analysis; structural health monitoring; system identification; Wind turbine blades","Identification (control systems); Location; Statistics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Structural analysis; Structural health monitoring; Transfer matrix method; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Vectors; Vibration analysis; Wind turbines; Damage localization; Damage location; Model-based method; Outlier analysis; Stochastic dynamics; Structural damages; Vibration-based damage; Wind turbine blades; Damage detection",2-s2.0-85031298300

The problem is to find a stabilizing measurement-free quantum controller for a quantum plant so as to minimize a mean square cost for the fully quantum closed-loop system. The plant and controller are open quantum systems interconnected through bosonic quantum fields. In comparison with the observation–actuation structure of classical controllers, coherent quantum feedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics. The plant and controller variables satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of a quantum harmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to such oscillators, these QSDEs must satisfy physical realizability (PR) conditions in the form of quadratic constraints on the state-space matrices, reflecting the CCR preservation in time. The symmetry of the problem is taken into account by introducing equivalence classes of coherent quantum controllers generated by symplectic similarity transformations. We discuss a modified gradient flow, which is concerned with norm-balanced realizations of controllers. A line-search gradient descent algorithm with adaptive stepsize selection is proposed for the numerical solution of the CQLQG control problem. The algorithm finds a local minimum of the LQG cost over the parameters of the Hamiltonian and coupling operators of a stabilizing coherent quantum controller, thus taking the PR constraints into account. A convergence analysis of the algorithm is presented.

A probabilistic integration of different classifiers recently proposed is employed herein, considering several spatiotemporal features, in order to classify daily activities. The classification model relies on the computed confidence belief from base classifiers, combining multiple likelihoods from three different classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, artificial neural networks and support vector machines, into a single form, by assigning weights from an uncertainty measure to counterbalance the posterior probability. In order to attain an improved performance on the overall classification accuracy, multiple features in time domain (e.g., velocity) and frequency domain (e.g., fast Fourier transform), combined with geometrical features (joint rotations), were considered. A dataset from five daily activities performed by six participants was acquired using FatoXtract.

However, it has proved challenging to measure health related quality of life for urolithiasis, given the distinct chronic and acute phases of this disease. We evaluated the use of PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement System) to assess the patient experience through acute stone episode stages. Materials and Methods PROMIS pain measures (intensity and interference) were obtained from patients at a subspecialty kidney stone clinic. Four types of clinical encounters were considered, including emergency department followup, trial of passage, stent removal and 1-month postoperative findings. Raw scores were translated into population normed T-scores with a T-score of 50 considered the reference population mean and a score of 60 considered 1 SD above the mean. T-scores were compared across encounter types on univariate and multivariate analysis. Results A total of 2,018 complete surveys were available from 1,162 patients. Mean pain intensity and pain interference T-scores differed significantly by encounter type (p <0.001). On multivariate analysis the OR of T-scores greater than 60 was higher for pain intensity and interference for all encounter types relative to postoperative findings, including emergency department followup 37.9 vs 124.9, passage trial 5.4 vs 10.5 and stent removal 9.4 vs 30.2 (p <0.001).

Only one case showed predominantly calcium oxalate. Thus, CAP was found to be the only or predominant component in most cases of subcutaneous calcifications. Chemical analyses of the mineral compositions may aid in the development of new treatment regimes to improve the solubility of mineral components and to decrease extraosseous calcifications. © 2017 Acta Dermato-Venereologica.","Carbonate apatite; Subcutaneous calcifications; Tumoural calcinosis","apatite; calcium oxalate; carbonic acid; mineral; struvite; weddellite; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; dermatomyositis; female; hemodialysis; human; hyperparathyroidism; male; mineral metabolism; panniculitis; priority journal; retrospective study; skin calcification; skin disease; syndrome CREST; tumor calcinosis",2-s2.0-85032705543

Patients who had gallstone-related cholangitis and underwent successful endoscopic clearance of BD stones were eligible for enrollment. This population-based, propensity score (PS)-matched cohort study involved 2 cohorts; (1) patients who underwent cholecystectomy after ERCP with BD stone clearance as the study group; and (2) those who had no cholecystectomy after ERCP with BD stone clearance as the control group.

We derive sharp Korn’s first (linear geometric rigidity estimate) and second inequalities on that kind of shell for zero or periodic Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin type boundary conditions. We prove that if the Gaussian curvature is positive, then the optimal constant in the first Korn inequality scales like h, and if the Gaussian curvature is negative, then the Korn constant scales like h4/3, where h is the thickness of the shell. These results have a classical flavour in continuum mechanics, in particular shell theory. The Korn first inequalities are the linear version of the famous geometric rigidity estimate by Friesecke et al. for plates in Arch Ration Mech Anal 180(2):183–236, 2006 (where they show that the Korn constant in the nonlinear Korn’s first inequality scales like h2), extended to shells with nonzero curvature.

To reduce use of CTU in this population, we instigated a new imaging and management guideline in our ED. Methods This was a quasi-experimental prospective study, whereby a new guideline was commenced at the intervention site (Monash Medical Centre) and the existing guideline continued at the control site (Dandenong Hospital). The new guideline promotes focused ultrasound for diagnosing renal colic and restricts CT to those with poor response to analgesia or red flags'. A consecutive series of patients with suspected renal colic were prospectively enrolled and outcomes compared between the sites. The primary outcome was CTU utilisation and secondary outcomes were radiation exposure, stone rate on CTU, admission, ED length of stay and rates of urological intervention and returns to ED at 4-week follow-up. Results Preintervention CTU rates were 76.7% at Monash and 72.1% at Dandenong. 324 patients were enrolled; 148 at Monash and 176 at Dandenong. Median age 47 years vs 49 years, males 76.4% vs 66.5% and medianSex, Timing, Origin, Nausea, Erythrocytes (STONE) score 10 vs 10 for Monash and Dandenong, respectively. CTU was performed in 54.1% vs 75.0% (p<0.001), median radiation exposure 2.8 vs 4.0 mSv (p<0.001) and urological intervention occurred in 16.4% vs 15.7% for Monash and Dandenong, respectively. Conclusions We found that use of CTU for renal colic was significantly reduced by introduction of a guideline promoting ultrasound and encouraging selective CTU. Although intervention rates were similar between the two sites, further prospective study is needed to ensure other patient-centred outcomes do not differ. © 2017 Article author(s).","abdomen-uro-genital; guidelines; imaging, CT/MRI; ultrasound; uro-genital",,2-s2.0-85032226439

Like other studies, this research proposes an explanation based on the form of property rights; however, it uses specific definitions of market, private planning and collective planning that establish unambiguous links between them and the structure of ownership. Thus, the article supports the position that the employment of planning or market mechanisms in economic and social activities depends solely on the structure of property rights. The contribution of this article is the formulation of two criteria for the allocation of property rights derived from Coase’s seminal works, termed in this text as Coase’s criterion of institutional optimisation and Coase’s market cost criterion. An important aspect of this proposal is the suggestion that Coase’s theory can be a powerful tool with which to study shared/common entitlements. It illuminates the nature and the mechanisms of private and collective planning and their relationship to the market. The article concludes that private planning may exist only if it is good enough to improve the efficiency of the market. Collective planning is indispensable when markets employ shared/collectively owned resources. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","collective planning; market-planning relationship; nomocracy; private planning; property rights","collective action; cost analysis; economic theory; employment; intellectual property rights; market development; private sector; transaction cost",2-s2.0-85031419866

Methods: Diffusion MRI images were acquired from brain tumor patients using a special Stejskal-Tanner diffusion sequence with variable diffusion gradient amplitudes and separation times. Patients with histopathologically confirmed gliomas, including astrocytic and oligoastrocytic tumors, were selected. The FM-related parameters, including the Noah exponent (α), the Hurst exponent (H), and the memory parameter (μ =H-1/α), were calculated and compared between low- and high-grade gliomas using a two-sample t-test. The grading performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: Twenty-two patients were included in the present study. The calculated α, H, and μ permitted the separation of tumor lesions from surrounding normal tissues in parameter maps and helped differentiate glioma grades. Moreover, α showed greater sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing low- and high-grade gliomas compared with the apparent diffusion coefficient. Conclusion: The FM model could improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating low- and high-grade gliomas.

Rather, in what is called multi-level governance, institutional designs at lower governance levels (e.g., national legislation at the national level) are governed by higher level institutions (e.g., directives, human rights charters and supranational agreements). When an institution design is found to be non-compliant, punishments can be issued by annulling the legislation or imposing fines on the responsible designers (i.e., government). In order to enforce multi-level governance, higher governance levels (e.g., courts applying human rights) must check lower level institution designs (e.g., national legislation) for compliance; in order to avoid punishment, lower governance levels (e.g., national governments) must check their institution designs are compliant with higher-level institutions before enactment. However, checking non-compliance of institution designs in multi-level governance is non-trivial. In particular, because institutions in multi-level governance operate at different levels of abstraction. Lower level institutions govern with concrete regulations whilst higher level institutions typically comprise increasingly vague and abstract regulations. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a formal framework with a novel semantics that defines compliance between concrete lower level institutions and abstract higher level institutions. The formal framework is complemented by a sound and complete computational framework that automates compliance checking, which we apply to a real-world case study. © 2017, The Author(s).","Institutions; Multi-level governance; Normative reasoning","Concretes; Human computer interaction; Laws and legislation; Semantics; Social aspects; Social sciences; Societies and institutions; Compliance checking; Computational framework; Institutional design; Levels of abstraction; Multi-level governance; National governments; National legislation; Normative reasoning; Compliance control",2-s2.0-85017161511

We introduce a skeletal linking structure for the collection of regions which simultaneously captures the regions', individual shapes and geometric properties as well as the ""positional geometry"", of the collection. The linking structure extends in a minimal way the individual ""skeletal structures"", on each of the regions. This allows us to significantly extend the mathematical methods introduced for single regions to the configuration of regions. We prove for a generic configuration of regions the existence of a special type of Blum linking structure which builds upon the Blum medial axes of the individual regions. As part of this, we introduce the ""spherical axis"", which is the analogue of the medial axis but for directions. These results require proving several transversality theorems for certain associated ""multi-distance"", and ""height-distance"", functions for such configurations. We show that by relaxing the conditions on the Blum linking structures we obtain the more general class of skeletal linking structures which still capture the geometric properties. The skeletal linking structure is used to analyze the ""positional geometry"", of the configuration. This involves using the ""linking flow"", to identify neighborhoods of the configuration regions which capture their positional relations. As well as yielding geometric invariants which capture the shapes and geometry of individual regions, these structures are used to define invariants which measure positional properties of the configuration such as: measures of relative closeness of neighboring regions and relative significance of the individual regions for the configuration. All of these invariants are computed by formulas involving ""skeletal linking integrals"", on the internal skeletal structures of the regions. These invariants are then used to construct a ""tiered linking graph"", which for given thresholds of closeness and/or significance, identifies subconfigurations and provides a hierarchical ordering in terms of order of significance.","Blum medial axis; Generic linking properties; Height-distance functions; Linking flow; Measures of closeness; Measures of significance; Medial and skeletal linking structures; Model configurations; Multi-distance functions; Partial multi-jet spaces; Radial flow; Skeletal structures; Spherical axis; Tiered linking graph; Transversality theorems; Whitney stratified sets",,2-s2.0-85027960223

This paper demonstrates how the scale-sensitivity can be circumvented by means of a hierarchical approach, using a single scalar parameter. Together with careful consideration of the development of algorithms which encode probability measure equivalences as the hierarchical parameter is varied, this leads to well-defined Gibbs-based MCMC methods found by alternating Metropolis–Hastings updates of the level set function and the hierarchical parameter.

Building on prior work, we draw on the concept of a welfare tradeoff ratio (WTR), an internally computed index of the extent to which one person values another person's welfare relative to his or her own. We test several predictions regarding the effects of benefit delivery on changes in WTR, gratitude, and subsequent cooperation. We show that benefit delivery by a stranger: (i) raises the beneficiary's valuation of the stranger's welfare, (ii) predicts downstream cooperative behavior by the beneficiary toward the stranger, and (iii) is coincident with beneficiaries' expressions of gratitude. We find evidence that cooperation and gratitude, while both sparked via benefit delivery and both underpinned by estimates of welfare valuation, are nevertheless produced in parallel via different paths. Specifically, the updated magnitude—not the initial magnitude or degree of change—of a beneficiary's WTR toward a stranger predicts the beneficiary's downstream cooperative behavior. By contrast, the extent to which the beneficiary's WTR positively changes—and not the initial or updated WTR magnitude—predicts gratitude production, a feature proposed to reinforce the benefactor's actions and foreshadow future cooperative intent on the part of the beneficiary. Taken together, our findings point to the possibility that cooperative behavior might operate via internal estimates of welfare valuation, and that gratitude signals benefit reception and the intent to engage in a cooperative relationship. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cooperation; Gratitude; Welfare trade-off ratio (WTR)",,2-s2.0-85028568386

To achieve optimal efficiency, it is important to gain proportional performance growth with power. However, power over/under provisioning often exists. To properly evaluate and guide NoC DVFS techniques, it is highly desirable to formalize and quantify power over/under provisioning. In this paper, we first show that application performance does not grow linearly with network power in an NoC-based CMP. Instead, their relationship is non-linear and can be captured using performance-power characteristics curve (PPCC) with three distinct regions: an inertial region, a linear region, and a saturation region. We note that conventional DVFS metrics such as Performance Per Watt (PPW) cannot accurately evaluate such non-linear relationship. Based on PPCC, we propose a new figure of merit called Marginal Performance (MP) which evaluates the incremental performance per power increment after the inertial region. The MP concept enables to formally define power over- and under-provisioning with reference to the linear region in which an efficient NoC DVFS should operate. Applying the PPCC and MP concepts in full-system simulations with PARSEC and SPEC OMP2012 benchmarks, we are able to identify power over/under provisioning occurrences, measure and compare their statistics in two latest NoC DVFS techniques. Moreover, we show evidences that MP can accurately and consistently evaluate the NoC DVFS techniques, avoiding the misjudgement and inconsistency of PPW-based evaluations. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","CMP; DVFS; network-on-chip (NoC); Performance evaluation; power efficiency","Benchmarking; Energy efficiency; Measurements; Nickel; Program processors; Servers; Software testing; Benchmark testing; DVFS; Network-on-chip(NoC); Performance evaluation; Power demands; Power efficiency; Shape; Network-on-chip",2-s2.0-85021826419

The purpose of the present paper is to make a step in this direction through a combination of numerical and analytical work. The analytical part is mainly concerned with the behavior of 2D3C flows in isolation and the connection between the geometry of the nonlinear interactions and the resulting energy transfer directions. Special emphasis is given to the role of helicity. We show that a generic 2D3C flow can be described by two stream functions corresponding to the two helical sectors of the velocity field. The projection onto one helical sector (homochiral flow) leads to a fully 3D constraint and to the inviscid conservation of the total (three-dimensional) enstrophy and hence to an inverse cascade of the kinetic energy of the third component also. The coupling between several 2D3C flows is studied through a set of suitably designed direct numerical simulations, where we also explore the transition between 2D and fully 3D turbulence. In particular, we find that the coupling of three 2D3C flows on mutually orthogonal planes subject to small-scale forcing leads to stationary 3D out-ofequilibrium dynamics at the energy containing scales. The transition between 2D and 3D turbulence is then explored through adding a percentage of fully 3D Fourier modes in the volume.",,"Dynamics; Energy transfer; Fourier series; Kinetics; Velocity; Nonlinear interactions; Orthogonal plane; Third component; Three component; Three-dimensional (3D) flow; Three-dimensional turbulence; Two Dimensional (2 D); Velocity field; Turbulence",2-s2.0-85022336684

From a structural point of view, such systems are made of components linked together through their provided and required services, the code of components being defined by modules (e.g., jar files). Today, the ability to reconfigure component-based systems at runtime faces limitations. Some component frameworks allow to dynamically reconfigure components – starting or stopping them, or changing how they are wired together for instance – but forbid any dynamic evolution of the modules defining their code. Other frameworks allow to dynamically update modules but at the cost of loosing control on component wires, preventing software architects or tools alike to decide how components are wired together. In this paper, we propose a component framework that addresses these limitations through a unified approach for the management of components and modules. Our approach uniquely enables to reconfigure both components and modules at runtime, without restrictions.

In the context of motion systems, this means that for instance structural mechanics, control engineering and thermal analysis are considered early in the design. In addition, the prospect of producing freeform device components using additive manufacturing at full scale allows designers to even further refine components to a specific purpose, or even integrate multiple functions into a single component. The design freedom offered by additive manufacturing is far greater than that offered by traditional techniques. To exploit this freedom a topology optimization framework is proposed that allows to determine the optimal material quantity and distribution within a design volume. In particular, this article focuses on the closed-loop control performance of a motion system component, while simultaneously ensuring that mechanical requirements are met. Based on an example, it is demonstrated that this leads to nontrivial and non-intuitive designs which provide improved performance at lower structural mass compared to eigenfrequency designs.

For a nonhomogeneous medium, groundwater velocity is considered as a linear function of space and analytical solutions are obtained for n = 1, 1.5, and 2.0. For n = 1, the dispersivity (ratio of dispersion coefficient and velocity) remains uniform, representing a homogeneous medium, while it varies with position in the finite domain (aquifer) for any other permissible value of n representing the heterogeneity of the medium.

These solutions are used to compute, in a singleshooting approach, three-dimensional solar-sail trajectories, for transfer scenarios involving a small change of the orbital inclination. The proposed homotopic approachistested againsta conventional approach, basedon the useofa genetic algorithm. Numerical test cases are performed both on Earth-Mars and Earth-Apophis rendezvous. The results show that the proposed method is advantageous, in terms of accuracy of the solution and computational time. © Copyright 2017 by Nicola Sullo, Alessandro Peloni, and Matteo Ceriotti.",,"Genetic algorithms; Optimal control systems; Orbits; Solar equipment; Solar radiation; Computational time; Conventional approach; Numerical continuation; Optimal control problem; Orbital inclination; Planar Solutions; Single-shooting approach; Solar sail trajectory; Solar sails",2-s2.0-85031691769

This definition shows the detailed information on individuals satisfying some conditions but ignores the structural information. In this paper, applying the structured granules in a coarsened-grained universe, we introduce structured probabilistic rough set approximations between the power sets of the original universe and the coarsened-grained universe. By using the zooming-in and structured probabilistic rough approximation operators, two pairs of probabilistic rough lower and upper approximations on the same universe are investigated. Related properties and relationships of them are investigated. Furthermore, applying the Bayesian decision procedure, conditional probability and loss functions, three-way classifications in structured probabilistic rough set approximations are then proposed to classify the structured granules of the coarsened-grained universe into three disjoint structured probabilistic regions. This method gives the values of the pair of thresholds. Meanwhile, by using the minimum-risk decision rules, we also can construct the structured probabilistic rough lower and upper approximations. Finally, we discuss the monotonicity of structured probabilistic positive and negative regions. © 2017","Bayesian decision procedure; Coarsened-grained universe; Structured probabilistic rough set; Three-way decisions; Zooming-in",,2-s2.0-85027992191

Objective: To determine the most effective advanced virtual monochromatic imaging energy level for maximizing pediatric brain parenchymal image quality in dual-energy unenhanced brain CT and to compare this technique with conventional monochromatic reconstruction and polychromatic scanning. Materials and methods: Using both conventional (Mono) and advanced monochromatic reconstruction (Mono+) techniques, we retrospectively reconstructed 13 virtual monochromatic imaging energy levels from 40 keV to 100 keV in 5-keV increments from dual-source, dual-energy unenhanced brain CT scans obtained in 23 children. We analyzed gray and white matter noise ratios, signal-to-noise ratios and contrast-to-noise ratio, and posterior fossa artifact. We chose the optimal mono-energetic levels and compared them with conventional CT. Results: For Mono+maximum optima were observed at 60 keV, and minimum posterior fossa artifact at 70 keV. For Mono, optima were at 65–70 keV, with minimum posterior fossa artifact at 75 keV. Mono+ was superior to Mono and to polychromatic CT for image-quality measures.

The welfare of Finnraccoons in the current housing conditions has not been thorough documented. The aim of the present study is to measure the juvenile Finnraccoons’ interaction with a commonly used activity object, namely bovine cortical bone. The subjects of the study were 16 sister pairs of juvenile Finnraccoons (born in May) housed in commercial housing conditions. The behaviour of the Finnraccoons was recorded and the interaction with the bone was registered from video recordings in two time points; at the time when the deciduous teeth are being replaced with the permanent ones (September), and later in autumn (November). In order to evaluate how much the Finnraccoons value the access to the bone, the effect of two-weeks deprivation of the bone was recorded in half of the animals (8 pairs of Finnraccoons) in both time points. The duration and frequency of various types of interactions with the bone were continuously recorded for 15 mins from each hour of the day and statistically analysed by using Linear Mixed Model (SAS). The Finnraccoon pairs interacted with the bone a mean from 2 to 8% of time. The time (month) did not affect the interaction with the bone, but both the percentage of time and frequency of the interaction with the bone increased after the deprivation treatments (after returning the access to the bone) in the Finnraccoons deprived of the bone. Oral activities were the most frequent activities with the bone, but oral activity combined with the use of paws was the longest duration interaction with the bone. The interaction with the bone was not randomly distributed throughout the day, but was most intense in early morning. The present results show that the Finnraccoons interact regularly with a bovine cortical bone, and they do not lost interest towards the bone with time. The bone induces various behaviours and provides a long lasting, biologically and behaviourally relevant activity object in the Finnraccoon.

Building on theoretical models that address the political economy of fiscal expansions and adjustments and the fiscal policy preferences of voters and policymakers, this article examines whether those procyclical effects are symmetric between boom and recession. The analysis reveals that the procyclical effects of cyclical revenue increases (in upturn years) on expenditures are smaller than those of cyclical revenue decreases (in downturn years), whereas the procyclical effects of cyclical revenue increases on tax rates are larger than those of cyclical revenue decreases. That is, policymakers prefer tax cuts to spending increases in pursuing expansionary fiscal policy during booms and spending cuts to tax increases in making fiscal adjustments during recessions. Taken together, the results suggest that cyclical fluctuations in revenue availability have procyclical effects on state fiscal policies in a manner that is asymmetric between boom and recession and fiscally conservative. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","cyclical asymmetry; political economy; state fiscal policy; tax base gap",,2-s2.0-85031493225

The cut finite element method is based on embedding the surface in a three dimensional finite element mesh and using finite element spaces defined on the three dimensional mesh as trial and test functions. Since we consider a partial differential equation on a surface, the resulting discrete weak problem might be severely ill conditioned. We propose a full gradient and a normal gradient based stabilization computed on the background mesh to render the proposed formulation stable and well conditioned irrespective of the surface positioning within the mesh. Our formulation extends and simplifies the Masud–Hughes stabilized primal mixed formulation of the Darcy surface problem proposed in Hansbo and Larson (2016) on fitted triangulated surfaces. The tangential condition on the velocity and the pressure gradient is enforced only weakly, avoiding the need for any tangential projection. The presented numerical analysis accounts for different polynomial orders for the velocity, pressure, and geometry approximation which are corroborated by numerical experiments. In particular, we demonstrate both theoretically and through numerical results that the normal gradient stabilized variant results in a high order scheme. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","A priori error estimates; Condition number; Cut finite element method; Darcy problem; Stabilization; Surface PDE","Mesh generation; Number theory; Polynomial approximation; Stabilization; Condition numbers; Darcy problem; Finite element space; Mixed formulations; Numerical experiments; Priori error estimate; Three dimensional finite elements; Triangulated surfaces; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85028846465

To non-invasively image this phenomenon on a time-resolved basis, we pursued the first application of a recently developed flow visualization technique called vector projectile imaging (VPI) that can track the spatiotemporal dynamics of flow vector fields at a frame rate of 10,000 fps (based on plane wave excitation and least-squares Doppler vector estimation principles). For this investigation, we designed a new anthropomorphic urethral tract phantom to reconstruct urinary flow dynamics under controlled conditions (300 mm H2O inlet pressure and atmospheric outlet pressure). Both a normal model and a diseased model with BO obstruction were developed for experimentation. VPI cine loops were derived from these urinary flow phantoms. Results show that VPI is capable of depicting differences in the flow dynamics of normal and diseased urinary tracts. In the case with BO obstruction, VPI depicted the presence of BO flow jet and vortices in the prostatic urethra. The corresponding spatial-maximum flow velocity magnitude was estimated to be 2.43 m/s, and it is significantly faster than that for the normal model (1.52 m/s) and is in line with values derived from computational fluid dynamics simulations.

Additionally, loss framing changes how decisions are made: In the domain of losses, trustors and trustees become less calculative — trust decisions involving losses are less sensitive to changes in expected value and reciprocity decisions are less sensitive to the financial temptation to betray trust. Critically, these changes in the process of decision-making are more pronounced when people interact with a human (vs computer) partner, pointing to uniquely social consequences of loss framing.

However, automation can sometimes be linked to a lack of interpretability. Two whole-brain, automated and voxelwise methods exist: voxel-based analysis (VBA) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). In VBA, the amount of smoothing has been shown to influence the results. TBSS is free of this step, but a projection procedure is introduced to correct for residual misalignments. This projection assigns the local highest fractional anisotropy (FA) value to the mean FA skeleton, which represents white matter tract centers. For both methods, the normalization procedure has a major impact. These issues are well documented in humans but, to our knowledge, not in rodents. In this study, we assessed the quality of three different registration algorithms (ANTs SyN, DTI-TK and FNIRT) using study-specific templates and their impact on automated analysis methods (VBA and TBSS) in a rat pup model of diffuse white matter injury presenting large unilateral deformations. VBA and TBSS results were stable and anatomically coherent across the three pipelines. For VBA, in regions around the large deformations, interpretability was limited because of the increased partial volume effect. With TBSS, two of the three pipelines found a significant decrease in axial diffusivity (AD) at the known injury site.

The approach is motivated by the fact that the more accurate description of the physics in the cDFT model is required only near the charged surfaces, while away from these regions the PNP equations provide an acceptable representation of the ionic system. We formulate the hybrid approach in two stages. The first stage defines a coupled hybrid model in which the PNP and cDFT equations act independently on two overlapping domains, subject to suitable interface coupling conditions. At the second stage we apply the principles of the alternating Schwarz method to the hybrid model by using the interface conditions to define the appropriate boundary conditions and volume constraints exchanged between the PNP and the cDFT subdomains. Numerical examples with two representative examples of ionic systems demonstrate the numerical properties of the method and its potential to reduce the computational cost of a full cDFT calculation, while retaining the accuracy of the latter near the charged surfaces. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Alternating Schwarz method; Charged fluids; Classical density functional theory; Hard sphere model; PNP",,2-s2.0-85026662101

We evaluate an approach to derive the traveltime parameters in a single homogeneous anisotropic layer of tilted orthorhombic symmetry for one- and two-way traveling waves. The approach allows us to obtain the traveltime parameters of pure and converted modes. We use numerical models to illustrate the dependence of the high-order traveltime parameters on the Euler angles and the anisotropy parameters. The traveltime parameter inversion is a strongly ill-posed problem in anisotropic media, and improvements due to inclusion of the high-order traveltime parameters can sufficiently reduce the space of equivalent kinematic models. We perform a numerical model parameter inversion using the concept of artificial neural networks to demonstrate the accuracy improvements due to inclusion of the highorder traveltime parameters over the inversion of the second- order coefficient, conventionally known as normal moveout velocity, only.

One performance goal is a measure of how quickly faults are detected. Such prioritization can be performed by exploiting the fault exposing potential (FEP) parameters associated to the test cases. The FEP is usually approximated by mutation analysis under certain fault assumptions. Although this technique is effective, it could be relatively expensive compared to the other prioritization techniques. This study proposes a cost-effective FEP approximation for prioritizing modified condition decision coverage (MCDC) test cases. A strict negative correlation between the FEP of an MCDC test case and the influence value of the associated input condition allows to order the test cases easily without the need of an extensive mutation analysis. The method is entirely based on mathematics and it provides useful insight into how spectral analysis of Boolean functions can benefit software testing.

The role of Li2O in CaO-Al2O3-Li2O-Ce2O3 slag system was investigated through measuring viscosity combined with the FTIR spectra analysis. It was noted that Li2O show obvious effect of decreasing viscosity in the CaO-Al2O3-based slag system. The viscosity of the CaO-Al2O3-Li2O-Ce2O3 slag melts decreased with increasing Li2O content. The relationship between the viscosity and the slag structure was discussed. Under the condition of increasing Li2O addition from 10 to 14 mass%, the relative ratio of [AlO4]-tetrahedrons and [AlO6]-octahedrons remain constant. The O2– dissociated from Li2O just cut the network formed by [AlO4]-tetrahedrons. The depolymerization of [AlO4]-tetrahedrons from Q4 units to Q3 and Q2 units was the main reason of the decrease of the viscosity. When the content of Li2O increased from 14 to 18 mass%, more and more O2– dissociated from Li2O reacted with [AlO4]-tetrahedrons to form [AlO6]-octahedrons. The decrease of viscosity was mainly induced by the increase of free oxygen and the formation of [AlO6]-octahedrons, which acts as a network modifier. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CaO-Al2O3-based melt; Continuous casting; Lithium oxide; Mold flux; Slag structure; Viscosity","Continuous casting; Fluxes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Molds; Slags; FT-IR spectrum; Heat-resistant steel; Lithium oxides; Mold fluxes; Network modifiers; Relative ratios; Slag structure; Structure property; Viscosity",2-s2.0-85028852489

Single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers (SVTNNs), which are elements in single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic sets (SVTNSs), have a strong capacity to model such complex evaluation information. However, only few studies simultaneously consider the imprecise and inconsistent information inherent in the evaluation data. Moreover, much literature overlooks the different priority levels and interrelationships among criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper outlines a novel integrated decision system consisting of the following three modules: (1) information acquisition; (2) the single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (SVTN-DEMATEL) module; and (3) the integration module. In this study, we used the information acquisition module to gather the SVTNN information provided by experts, applied the SVTN-DEMATEL module to analyze the causal relationships among criteria, and proposed the integration module for information fusion with consideration of interdependencies and different priority levels of criteria. Furthermore, we conducted a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposal along with the sensitivity and comparison analyses to verify its stability and superiority.

With such a development, it has been referred that the VSD changes monotonically with respect to to both the texture and depth distortions. In this paper, we find that the VSD does not always change monotonically with them by both theoretical analysis and experimental test, when the effect of the texture and depth errors is considered together. Specifically, first, we prove that the VSD is non-monotonic with the texture distortion. That is, the VSD increases with the increasing texture distortion at higher distortion range but conversely decreases with it at lower range. It is different from the general scenario that only considering the effect of the texture errors. We also analytically depict their relationship with low computational cost and identify the turning point at which the change of the VSD is converted. Second, we confirm that the VSD is always monotonic with the depth distortion, which is consistent with the general scenario that only considering the effect of the depth errors. The non-monotonicity property of the VSD can be utilized to improve the viewing performance of 3D video in relevant applications, since a minimal value of the VSD exists at the turning point. We conduct two applications for this purpose. First, it is used to generate the synthesis view of minimal distortion, which achieves 0.51-dB gain of PSNR on average for the tested scenarios. Second, it is used for lossy compression of texture videos in 3D video, which reduces the coding rate by 24% on average for the tested scenarios, meanwhile, keeps the VSD not increased simultaneously. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","Depth-based 3D video; DIBR; lossy compression; non-monotonicity; view synthesis distortion","Computer graphics; Distortion (waves); Errors; Image coding; Image compression; Rendering (computer graphics); Turning; Uncertainty analysis; 3-D videos; DIBR; Distortion measurement; Lossy compressions; Measurement uncertainty; Non-monotonicity; Three-dimensional display; View synthesis; Three dimensional computer graphics",2-s2.0-85023161728

Methods: A total of 1938 patients who underwent LC for benign gallbladder lesion were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were categorized into two groups according to the development of CBD stones at least 6 months after LC (case group, control group). The risk factors for and the time of development of CBD stones after LC were evaluated. Results: In a univariate analysis, the significant factors for the development of CBD stones were old age, acute cholecystitis, the presence of periampullary diverticulum, and the presence of gall bladder stones sized <0.55 cm. By multivariate analysis, acute cholecystitis (OR: 3.082, 95% CI: 1.306–7.272, p = 0.010), the presence of periampullary diverticulum (OR: 7.950, 95% CI: 3.425–18.457, p < 0.001), and the presence of gall bladder stones sized < 0.55 cm (OR: 5.647, 95% CI: 1.310–24.346, p = 0.020) were independent factors that could predict the development of CBD stones at least 6 months after LC.

Progress in SAT solving algorithms has motivated an ever increasing number of practical applications in recent years. However, many practical uses of SAT involve solving function as opposed to decision problems. Concrete examples include computing minimal unsatisfiable subsets, minimal correction subsets, prime implicates and implicants, minimal models, backbone literals, and autarkies, among several others. In most cases, solving a function problem requires a number of adaptive or non-adaptive calls to a SAT solver. Given the computational complexity of SAT, it is therefore important to develop algorithms that either require the smallest possible number of calls to the SAT solver, or that involve simpler instances. This paper addresses a number of representative function problems defined on Boolean formulae, and shows that all these function problems can be reduced to a generic problem of computing a minimal set subject to a monotone predicate. This problem is referred to as the Minimal Set over Monotone Predicate (MSMP) problem.

Using new data, this article presents a common set of core constructs structuring both American and European attitudes about foreign policy. Surveys conducted in four countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany) provide an expanded set of foreign policy-related survey items that are analysed using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). Measurement equivalence is specifically tested and a common four-factor structure that fits the data in all four countries is found. Consequently, valid, direct comparisons of the foreign policy preferences of four world powers are made.

The fluid flow is governed by incompressible and steady-state Navier-Stokes equations. Both domains are solved with the finite element method and simplifying conditions are assumed for the fluid-structure coupling, such as small structural displacements and deformations in a staggered method. The presented BESO method aims to minimize structural compliance in a so called “wet” optimization problem, in which the fluid loads location, direction and magnitude depend on the structural layout. In this type of design-dependent loading problem, density-based topology optimization methods require extra numerical techniques (usually mixed models with overlapping domains) in order to model the interaction of different governing equations during the optimization procedures. In this work, the discrete nature of the evolutionary topology optimization approach allows the fluid-structure boundaries to be modelled and modified straightforwardly by switching the discrete design variables between fluid and structural finite elements. Therefore, separate domains are used in this approach. Numerical results show that the BESO-based methods can be applied to this kind of multiphysics problem effectively and efficiently. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","BESO method; Design-dependent loads; Fluid-structure Interaction; Topology optimization","Finite element method; Flow of fluids; Fluid structure interaction; Navier Stokes equations; Numerical methods; Optimization; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; Structural optimization; Topology; Viscous flow; BESO method; Bi-directional evolutionary structural optimizations; Design-dependent loads; Discrete design variables; Steady state Navier-Stokes equations; Structural design problems; Structural finite elements; Topology Optimization Method; Structural design",2-s2.0-85025160452

Total sample includes 15,321 respondents. Results indicate that 19% of respondents are unwilling to pay for road pricing, including a low average estimate for road tolls.

The results are further interpreted in the context of a transition country, with high percentage of low income citizens, and lack of trust in public institutions. Planners can use the findings to determine the road toll price by relying on both willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept values, while also aiming for financial sustainability. In order to provide recommendations for planning and policy learning in SEE, discussion provides recommendations for further analysis that should account for both economic and socio-political aspects.

In this paper, a novel delayed fractional-order model of small-world networks is introduced and several topics related to the dynamics and control of such a network are investigated, such as the stability, Hopf bifurcations, and bifurcation control. The nonlinear interactive strength is chosen as the bifurcation parameter to analyze the impact of the interactive strength parameter on the dynamics of the fractional-order small-world network model. Firstly, the stability domain of the equilibrium is completely characterized with respect to network parameters, delays and orders, and some explicit conditions for the existence of Hopf bifurcations are established for the delayed fractional-order model. Then, a fractional-order Proportional-Derivative (PD) feedback controller is first put forward to successfully control the Hopf bifurcation which inherently happens due to the change of the interactive parameter. It is demonstrated that the onset of Hopf bifurcations can be delayed or advanced via the proposed fractional-order PD controller by setting proper control parameters. Meanwhile, the conditions of the stability and Hopf bifurcations are obtained for the controlled fractional-order small-world network model. Finally, illustrative examples are provided to justify the validity of the control strategy in controlling the Hopf bifurcation generated from the delayed fractional-order small-world network model. © 2017 The Franklin Institute",,"Bifurcation (mathematics); Controllers; Distributed computer systems; Small-world networks; Bifurcation control; Bifurcation parameter; Dynamics and control; Feedback controller; Fractional order models; Fractional-order PD; Fractional-order systems; Proportional derivatives; Hopf bifurcation",2-s2.0-85030844269

We attempted to predict CEC using different statistical methods including monotone analysis of variance (MONANOVA), artificial neural networks (ANNs), principal components regressions (PCR), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in order to compare the utility of these approaches and identify the best predictor. We analyzed 170 soil samples from four different nations (USA, Spain, Iran and Iraq) under three land uses (agriculture, pasture, and forest). Seventy percent of the samples (120 samples) were selected as the calibration set and the remaining 50 samples (30%) were used as the prediction set. The results indicated that the MONANOVA (R2 = 0.82 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 6.32) and ANNs (R2 = 0.82 and RMSE = 5.53) were the best models to estimate CEC, PSO (R2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 5.54) and PCR (R2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 6.48) also worked well and the results were very similar to each other. While the most influential variables for the various countries and land uses were different and CEC was affected by different variables in different situations, clay (positively correlated) and sand (negatively correlated) were the most influential variables for predicting CEC for the entire data set. Although the MANOVA and ANNs provided good predictions of the entire dataset, PSO gives a formula to estimate soil CEC using commonly tested soil properties. Therefore, PSO shows promise as a technique to estimate soil CEC. Establishing effective pedotransfer functions to predict CEC would be productive where there are limitations of time and money, and other commonly analyzed soil properties are available. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural networks; MONANOVA; Particle swarm optimization; Pedotransfer functions; Principal components regressions","artificial neural network; calibration; cation exchange capacity; data set; error analysis; optimization; prediction; principal component analysis; sampling; soil quality; variance analysis; Iran; Iraq; Spain; United States",2-s2.0-85022334121

Multiscale analysis including micro-CT, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and histological stainings was performed to reveal the fundamental degradation mechanism of the pure zinc stent and its biocompatibility. The pure zinc stent was able to maintain mechanical integrity for 6 months and degraded 41.75 ± 29.72% of stent volume after 12 months implantation. No severe inflammation, platelet aggregation, thrombosis formation or obvious intimal hyperplasia was observed at all time points after implantation. The degradation of the zinc stent played a beneficial role in the artery remodeling and healing process. The evolution of the degradation mechanism of pure zinc stents with time was revealed as follows: Before endothelialization, dynamic blood flow dominated the degradation of pure zinc stent, creating a uniform corrosion mode; After endothelialization, the degradation of pure zinc stent depended on the diffusion of water molecules, hydrophilic solutes and ions which led to localized corrosion. Zinc phosphate generated in blood flow transformed into zinc oxide and small amounts of calcium phosphate during the conversion of degradation microenvironment.

This work uses a recently developed fracture mechanics testing methodology to quantify the critical strain energy release rate under nearly pure mode II conditions, GIIC, of a series of borate-based glass coating/Ti6Al4V alloy substrate systems. Incorporating increasing amounts of SrCO3 in the glass composition was found to increase the GIIC almost twofold, from 25.3 to 46.9 J/m2. The magnitude and distribution of residual stresses in the coating were quantified, and it was found that the residual stresses in all cases distributed uniformly over the cross section of the coating. The crack was driven towards, but not into, the glass/Ti6Al4V substrate interface due to the shear loading.

We show that these invariants coincide with previous invariants defined by Khovanov for sl2 and sl3 and by Mazorchuk-Stroppel and Sussan for sln. Our technique is to study 2-representations of 2-quantum groups (in the sense of Rouquier and Khovanov-Lauda) categorifying tensor products of irreducible representations. These are the representation categories of certain finite dimensional algebras with an explicit diagrammatic presentation, generalizing the cyclotomic quotient of the KLR algebra. When the Lie algebra under consideration is sln, we show that these categories agree with certain subcategories of parabolic category O for glk. We also investigate the finer structure of these categories: they are standardly stratified and satisfy a double centralizer property with respect to their self-dual modules. The standard modules of the stratification play an important role as test objects for functors, as Vermas do in more classical representation theory. The existence of these representations has consequences for the structure of previously studied categorifications. It allows us to prove the non-degeneracy of Khovanov and Lauda's 2-category (that its Hom spaces have the expected dimension) in all symmetrizable types, and that the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebras are symmetric Frobenius. In work of Reshetikhin and Turaev, the braiding and (co)evaluation maps between representations of quantum groups are used to define polynomial knot invariants. We show that the categorifications of tensor products are related by functors categorifying these maps, which allow the construction of bigraded knot homologies whose graded Euler characteristics are the original polynomial knot invariants. © 2017 Ben Webster.",,,2-s2.0-85030546329

As expected, the optimal geometries have the shape of an extension of the high conductivity material into the low conductivity material. For the case of corrugations and inserts, the optimum shapes are triangular for small perimeters; for large perimeters and thick slabs they are elliptical and tend to cover the whole width/period of the domain.

Methods An online survey, including questions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of CP and several controversial clinical case vignettes, was send by e-mail to members of various international pancreatic associations: IHPBA, APA, EPC, ESGE and DPSG. Results A total of 288 pancreatologists, 56% surgeons and 44% gastroenterologists, from at least 47 countries, participated in the survey. About half (48%) of the specialists used a classification tool for the diagnosis of CP, including the Mayo Clinic (28%), Mannheim (25%), or Büchler (25%) tools. Overall, CT was the preferred imaging modality for evaluation of an enlarged pancreatic head (59%), pseudocyst (55%), calcifications (75%), and peripancreatic fat infiltration (68%). MRI was preferred for assessment of main pancreatic duct (MPD) abnormalities (60%). Total pancreatectomy with auto-islet transplantation was the preferred treatment in patients with parenchymal calcifications without MPD abnormalities and in patients with refractory pain despite maximal medical, endoscopic, and surgical treatment. In patients with an enlarged pancreatic head, 58% preferred initial surgery (PPPD) versus 42% initial endoscopy. In patients with a dilated MPD and intraductal stones 56% preferred initial endoscopic ± ESWL treatment and 29% preferred initial surgical treatment. Conclusion Worldwide, clinical decision-making in CP is largely based on local expertise, beliefs and disbeliefs. Further development of evidence-based guidelines based on well designed (randomized) studies is strongly encouraged. © 2017 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Inc.",,"Article; chronic pancreatitis; classification; clinical decision making; computer assisted tomography; e-mail; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; gastroenterologist; health survey; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; pancreas calcification; pancreas islet transplantation; pancreatectomy; pancreatic duct; pancreaticoduodenectomy; pancreaticojejunostomy; pancreatologist; pseudocyst; questionnaire; surgeon; surgical technique",2-s2.0-85027404919

It was found that the methanol transport was non-Fickian for all catalyst samples. The methanol transport was described in the frame of the time-fractional diffusion equation. The fractional order of the temporal derivative, characterizing the regime of the transport, was found to depend on the zeolite content. Increasing zeolite content leads to a decreasing fractional order and results in slowing down the rate of the methanol transport. The same trend was also observed for the methanol time-fractional diffusion coefficient. The obtained results for the dependence of the fractional order on catalyst composition allowed us to speculate that the methanol anomalous diffusion is governed by the adsorption of the methanol on a catalyst surface.

In order for learning to occur, non-local information must be communicated to the deep synapses through a communication channel, the deep learning channel.

Random backpropagation (RBP) addresses the second and third symmetry, and some of its variations, such as skipped RBP (SRBP) address the first and the fourth symmetry. Here we address the last two desirable symmetries showing through simulations that they can be achieved and that the learning channel is particularly robust to symmetry variations. Specifically, random backpropagation and its variations can be performed with the same non-linear neurons used in the main input–output forward channel, and the connections in the learning channel can be adapted using the same algorithm used in the forward channel, removing the need for any specialized hardware in the learning channel. Finally, we provide mathematical results in simple cases showing that the learning equations in the forward and backward channels converge to fixed points, for almost any initial conditions. In symmetric architectures, if the weights in both channels are small at initialization, adaptation in both channels leads to weights that are essentially symmetric during and after learning.

The identified taxa include representatives of Xenarthra (Eremotherium laurillardi, cf.

The model is able to describe the behavior of moving elasto-plastic dielectric solids as well as viscous and inviscid fluids in the presence of electro-magnetic fields. It is actually a very peculiar feature of the proposed PDE system that viscous fluids are treated just as a special case of elasto-plastic solids. This is achieved by introducing a strain relaxation mechanism in the evolution equations of the distortion matrix A, which in the case of purely elastic solids maps the current configuration to the reference configuration. The model also contains a hyperbolic formulation of heat conduction as well as a dissipative source term in the evolution equations for the electric field given by Ohm's law. Via formal asymptotic analysis we show that in the stiff limit, the governing first order hyperbolic PDE system with relaxation source terms tends asymptotically to the well-known viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. Furthermore, a rigorous derivation of the model from variational principles is presented, together with the transformation of the Euler–Lagrange differential equations associated with the underlying variational problem from Lagrangian coordinates to Eulerian coordinates in a fixed laboratory frame. The present paper hence extends the unified first order hyperbolic model of Newtonian continuum mechanics recently proposed in [110,42] to the more general case where the continuum is coupled with electro-magnetic fields. The governing PDE system is symmetric hyperbolic and satisfies the first and second principle of thermodynamics, hence it belongs to the so-called class of symmetric hyperbolic thermodynamically compatible systems (SHTC), which have been studied for the first time by Godunov in 1961 [61] and later in a series of papers by Godunov and Romenski [67,69,119]. An important feature of the proposed model is that the propagation speeds of all physical processes, including dissipative processes, are finite. The model is discretized using high order accurate ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes with a posteriori subcell finite volume limiter and using high order ADER-WENO finite volume schemes. We show numerical test problems that explore a rather large parameter space of the model ranging from ideal MHD, viscous and resistive MHD over pure electro-dynamics to moving dielectric elastic solids in a magnetic field. © 2017 The Author(s)","Arbitrary high-order ADER Discontinuous Galerkin schemes; Finite signal speeds of all physical processes; Nonlinear hyperelasticity; Path-conservative methods and stiff source terms; Symmetric hyperbolic thermodynamically compatible systems (SHTC); Unified first order hyperbolic model of continuum physics (fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, electro-dynamics)",,2-s2.0-85026425019

A single plant or mushroom may produce both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on immune cells, depending on experimental conditions, but the reason behind this dichotomy remains obscure. We present here a large body of experimental data showing that water extracts of plants and mushrooms usually activate immune cells, whereas ethanol extracts inhibit immune cells. The mode of extraction of plants and mushrooms may thus determine the effects produced on immune cells, possibly due to differential solubility and potency of stimulatory and inhibitory compounds. We also examine the possibility of using such plant and mushroom extracts to treat immune system disorders. Plants and mushrooms contain molecules that modulate immune cell activities, but the factors that determine whether a plant or mushroom may activate or inhibit immune cells remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that the solvent used to prepare a plant or mushroom extract may determine whether the extract produces immunosuppressive or immunostimulant effects. Accordingly, water extracts tend to activate immune cells, while ethanol extracts inhibit immune cell activity. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials suggest that many herbal and mushroom-based preparations may reduce immune disorder symptoms in humans.

The observations supporting this picture come from a range of measurements encompassing estimates of galaxy cluster masses, the Hubble diagram derived from type-Ia supernovae observations, the measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background radiation anisotropies, etc. The present accelerated expansion of the universe can be explained by admitting the existence of a cosmic fluid, with negative pressure. In the simplest scenario, this unknown component of the universe, the Dark Energy, is represented by the cosmological constant (Î), and accounts for about 70% of the global energy budget of the universe. The remaining 30% consist of a small fraction of baryons (4%) with the rest being Cold Dark Matter (CDM). The Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ÎCDM) model, i.e. General Relativity with cosmological constant, is in good agreement with observations. It can be assumed as the first step towards a new standard cosmological model. However, despite the satisfying agreement with observations, the ÎCDM model presents lack of congruence and shortcomings and therefore theories beyond Einstein's General Relativity are called for. Many extensions of Einstein's theory of gravity have been studied and proposed with various motivations like the quest for a quantum theory of gravity to extensions of anomalies in observations at the solar system, galactic and cosmological scales. These extensions include adding higher powers of Ricci curvature R, coupling the Ricci curvature with scalar fields and generalized functions of R. In addition, when viewed from the perspective of Supergravity (SUGRA), many of these theories may originate from the same SUGRA theory, but interpreted in different frames. SUGRA therefore serves as a good framework for organizing and generalizing theories of gravity beyond General Relativity. All these theories when applied to inflation (a rapid expansion of early universe in which primordial gravitational waves might be generated and might still be detectable by the imprint they left or by the ripples that persist today) can have distinct signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation temperature and polarization anisotropies. We give a review of ÎCDM cosmology and survey the theories of gravity beyond Einstein's General Relativity, specially which arise from SUGRA, and study the consequences of these theories in the context of inflation and put bounds on the theories and the parameters therein from the observational experiments like PLANCK, Keck/BICEP, etc. The possibility of testing these theories in the near future in CMB observations and new data coming from colliders like the LHC, provides an unique opportunity for constructing verifiable models of particle physics and General Relativity. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","CMB; inflation; SUGRA",,2-s2.0-85021991444

Their integration into agent-based computational demography depends largely on suitable support by a modelling language. We are developing the Modelling Language for Linked Lives (ML3) to describe the diverse decision processes of linked lives succinctly in continuous time. The context of individuals is modelled by networks the individual is part of, such as family ties and other social networks. Central concepts, such as behaviour conditional on agent attributes, age-dependent behaviour, and stochastic waiting times, are tightly integrated in the language.

But how can we determine the growth patterns to achieve a given shape from another shape? We solve this geometric inverse problem of determining the growth factors and directions (the metric tensors) for a given isotropic elastic bilayer to grow into a target shape by posing and solving an elastic energy minimization problem. A mathematical equivalence between bilayers and curved monolayers simplifies the inverse problem considerably by providing algebraic expressions for the growth metric tensors in terms of those of the final shape. This approach also allows us to prove that we can grow any target surface from any reference surface using orthotropically growing bilayers. We demonstrate this by numerically simulating the growth of a flat sheet into a face, a cylindrical sheet into a flower, and a flat sheet into a complex canyon-like structure. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

In this paper, we provide a method for computing this maximum possible efficiency under perfect rankings for any choice of the set size and the number of stages. The maximum efficiency tends to infinity as the number of stages increases, and, for large numbers of stages, the efficiency-maximizing distributions are symmetric multi-modal distributions where the number of modes matches the set size.

While PMCA1 and PMCA4 play major role in regulating Ca2+ reabsorption, the role for PMCA2 remains vaguely defined. To define PMCA2 function, PMCA2-interacting complex was characterized by immunoprecipitation followed by nanoLC-ESI-Qq-TripleTOF MS/MS (IP-MS). After subtracting non-specific binders using isotype-controlled IP-MS, 474 proteins were identified as PMCA2-interacting partners. Among these, eight were known and 20 were potential PMCA2-interacting partners based on bioinformatic prediction, whereas other 446 were novel and had not been previously reported/predicted. Quantitative immuno-co-localization assay confirmed the association of PMCA2 with these partners. Gene ontology analysis revealed binding activity as the major molecular function of PMCA2-interacting complex. Functional validation using calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystal-protein binding, crystal-cell adhesion, and crystal internalization assays together with neutralization by anti-PMCA2 antibody compared to isotype-controlled IgG and blank control, revealed a novel role of PMCA2 as a COM crystal-binding protein that was crucial for crystal retention and uptake. In summary, a large number of novel PMCA2-interacting proteins have been defined and a novel function of PMCA2 as a COM crystal-binding protein sheds light onto its involvement, at least in part, in kidney stone pathogenesis. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature","Crystal adhesion; Crystal internalization; Immuno-co-localization; Interactomics; IP-MS; Kidney stone; Renal calculi; Renal tubular cells",,2-s2.0-85032680584

Methods: Four hundred and seventy-six kidney stone patients treated with urologic surgical procedures in our hospital from January to December 2016 were selected as the subjects. They were randomly divided into the intervention group and control group, with 238 cases in each group. The control group received routine nursing care, while the intervention group received routine nursing care andcomprehensive care intervention, including psychological care, health education, pain nursing, drainage tubenursing, infection prevention and control measures, etc. Then, the changes in patients’ body temperatures were observed, the incidence of postoperative infection was compared, the surgical wound healing was observed and the postoperative hospital stays were compared between the two groups. Results: After comprehensive care intervention, the number of the patients whose body temperaturesweremore than 39°C in the intervention group (6 cases) was significantly less than that in the control group (27 cases, P<0.001). The postoperative infection rate in the intervention group (2.1%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (8.8%, P=0.001). The surgical wound healing in the intervention group was better than that in the control group (P=0.017). The postoperative hospital stays in the intervention group (8.8±2.0 days) were significantly shorter than those in the control group (11.2±1.8 days, P<0.001). Conclusion: Comprehensive care intervention can effectively prevent the incidence of postoperative infection of kidney stone surgery, promote surgical wound healing and shorten the length of hospital stays.

How to predict the optimal laser parameters without producing damage to substrate still remains challenging for accurate paint stripping. On the basis of ablation morphologies and combining experiments with numerical modelling, the underlying mechanisms and the optimal conditions for paint removal by laser ablation are thoroughly investigated. Our studies suggest that laser paint removal is dominated by the laser vaporization effect, thermal stress effect and laser plasma effect, in which thermal stress effect is the most favoured while laser plasma effect should be avoided during removal operations. Based on the thermodynamic equations, we numerically evaluated the spatial distribution of the temperature as well as thermal stress in the paint and substrate under the irradiation of laser pulse at 1064 nm. The obtained curves of the paint thickness vs. threshold fluences can provide the reference standard of laser parameter selection in view of the paint layer with different thickness. A multi-pulse model is proposed and validated under a constant laser fluence to perfectly remove a thicker paint layer. The investigations and the methods proposed here might give hints to the efficient operations on the paint removal and lowering the risk of substrate damages. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","laser effects; laser plasma; laser vaporization; Paint removal; thermal stress","Ablation; Laser ablation; Laser beams; Laser produced plasmas; Plasma interactions; Thermal stress; Vaporization; Different thickness; Laser effects; Laser plasma; Laser vaporization; Optimal laser parameters; Paint removals; Thermal stress effects; Thermodynamic equations; Paint",2-s2.0-85023169133

Moreover, in this paper, convergence and misadjustment conditions of the proposed ACLMK algorithm are derived from the steady-state analysis.

This is becoming increasingly relevant with heatwaves becoming longer, more intense, and more frequent with climate change. This study aimed to extend the known relationship between daily temperature and kidney disease to include the incidence of eight temperature-prone specific renal disease categories - total renal disease, urolithiasis, renal failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), urinary tract infections (UTIs), lower urinary tract infections (LUTIs) and pyelonephritis. Methods: Daily data was acquired for maximum, minimum and average temperature over the period of 1 July 2003 to 31 March 2014 during the warm season (October to March) in Adelaide, South Australia. Data for daily admissions to all metropolitan hospitals for renal disease, including 83,519 emergency department admissions and 42,957 inpatient admissions, was also obtained. Renal outcomes were analyzed using time-stratified negative binomial regression models, with the results aggregated by day. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for associations between the number of admissions and daily temperature. Results: Increases in daily temperature per 1 °C were associated with an increased incidence for all renal disease categories except for pyelonephritis. Minimum temperature was associated with the greatest increase in renal disease followed by average temperature and then maximum temperature. A 1°C increase in daily minimum temperature was associated with an increase in daily emergency department admissions for AKI (IRR 1.037, 95% CI: 1.026-1.048), renal failure (IRR 1.030, 95% CI: 1.022-1.039), CKD (IRR 1.017, 95% CI: 1.001-1.033) urolithiasis (IRR 1.015, 95% CI: 1.010-1.020), total renal disease (IRR 1.009, 95% CI: 1.006-1.011), UTIs (IRR 1.004, 95% CI: 1.000-1.007) and LUTIs (IRR 1.003, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006). Conclusions: An increased frequency of renal disease, including urolithiasis, acute kidney injury and urinary tract infections, is predicted with increasing temperatures from climate change.

They also cause blackleg on potato. These pectinolytic phytopathogens are responsible for significant economic losses, mostly within the potato production sector. Importantly, there are no methods to eradicate these microorganisms once they have infected plant material. Solely preventive measures remain, including early detection and identification of the pathogens, monitoring of their spread in addition to planting certified seed material tested for latent infections. As proper identification of the causative agent allows for efficient limitation of disease spread, numerous detection and differentiation methods have been developed. Most commonly followed procedures involve: isolation of viable bacterial cells (alternatively post-enrichment) on semi-selective media, identification to species level by PCR (single, multiplex, Real time), serology or fatty acids profiling. Differentiation of the isolates is often accomplished by sequencing the housekeeping genes or molecular fingerprinting. In view of lowering total costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS), a huge amount of generated data reveals subtle differences between strains that have proven to be potentially useful for the establishment of specific novel detection pipelines. Successful implementation of molecular diagnostic methods is exemplified by 20-year studies on the populations of pectinolytic bacteria on potatoes in Poland. The presented work aims to gather the characteristics of Dickeya spp. and Pectobacterium spp. important for the identification process in addition to providing an overview of modern and newly developed specific, rapid, high-throughput and cost-effective screening methods for the detection and identification of these phytopathogens. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Detection; Differentiation; Erwinia; Identification; Pectinolytic bacteria; Plant protection","Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Differentiation (calculus); Disease control; Error detection; Fatty acids; Identification (control systems); Losses; Pathogens; Seed; Detection and identifications; Differentiation methods; Erwinia; Identification process; Molecular diagnostics; Molecular fingerprinting; Next-generation sequencing; Plant protection; Bacteria; fatty acid; bacterial cell; bacterial infection; Dickeya; Enterobacteriaceae; housekeeping gene; microbial identification; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; Pectobacterium; plant disease; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; serology; Short Survey; soft rot",2-s2.0-85028729455

Recently, researchers have proposed different fractional-time operators (namely: the Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu) which, differently from the well-known Riemann-Liouville operator, are defined by non-singular memory kernels. Here we proposed to use these new operators to generalize the usual diffusion equation. By analyzing the corresponding fractional diffusion equations within the continuous time random walk framework, we obtained waiting time distributions characterized by exponential, stretched exponential, and power-law functions, as well as a crossover between two behaviors. For the mean square displacement, we found crossovers between usual and confined diffusion, and between usual and sub-diffusion. We obtained the exact expressions for the probability distributions, where non-Gaussian and stationary distributions emerged. This former feature is remarkable because the fractional diffusion equation is solved without external forces and subjected to the free diffusion boundary conditions. We have further shown that these new fractional diffusion equations are related to diffusive processes with stochastic resetting, and to fractional diffusion equations with derivatives of distributed order. Thus, our results suggest that these new operators may be a simple and efficient way for incorporating different structural aspects into the system, opening new possibilities for modeling and investigating anomalous diffusive processes. © 2017 Tateishi, Ribeiro and Lenzi.","Anomalous diffusion; Continuous time random walk; Fractional calculus; Fractional order derivatives; Fractional-time operators",,2-s2.0-85032566905

Due to this attention, recently, fractional order controllers (FOCs) have found new applications in power system stability issues. Here, a tilt-integralderivative power system stabilizer (TID-PSS) is proposed to enhance the dynamic stability of a multi-machine power system by providing additional damping to the LFOs. The TID is an extended version of the classical proportional-integralderivative (PID) applying fractional calculus. The design of the proposed three-parameter tunable TID-PSS is systematized as a nonlinear time domain optimization problem in which the tunable parameters are adjusted concurrently using a modified group search optimization (MGSO) algorithm. An integral of the time multiplied squared error (ITSE) performance index is considered as the objective function. The proposed stabilizer is simulated in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment using the FOMCON toolbox and the dynamic performance is evaluated on a 3-machine 6-bus power system. The TID-PSS is compared with both classical PID-PSS (PID-PSS) and conventional PSS (CPSS) using eigenvalue analysis and time domain simulations. Sensitivity analyses are performed to assess the robustness of the proposed controller against large changes in system loading conditions and parameters. The results indicate that the proposed TID-PSS provides the better dynamic performance and robustness compared with the PID-PSS and CPSS. © 2017 KIEEME.

In COM-induced cells, after treated with SB203580, overexpression of KIM-1 could reverse the protection effect of SB203580 on COM-induced cell damage and the inhibition of SB203580 on COM-induced excessive autophagy, suggesting p38/MAPK regulated KIM-1 to regulate COM-induced cell apoptosis and autophagy.

We first consider a planar interface, and show that, with a constant viscosity ratio, the constant injection rate is optimal. When the viscosity of the displacing fluid, , gradually increases over time, as may occur with a slowly gelling polymer solution, the optimal injection rate, , involves a gradual increase in the flow rate with time. This leads to a smaller initial value of flow rate than the constant injection rate, finishing with a larger value. Such optimisation can lead to a substantial suppression of the instability as compared to the constant injection case if the characteristic gelling time is comparable to . In contrast, for either relatively slow or fast gelling, there is much less benefit in selecting the optimal injection rate, , as compared to the constant injection rate. In the case of a constant injection rate from a point source, , then with a constant viscosity ratio the fastest-growing perturbation on the radially spreading front involves axisymmetric modes whose wavenumber increases with time. Approximating the discrete azimuthal modes by a continuous distribution, we find the injection rate that minimises growth, . We find that there is a critical time for injection, , such that if t [f]]> then can be chosen so that the interface is always stable. This critical time emerges from the case with an injection rate given by . As the total injection time is reduced to values < t f, the system becomes progressively more unstable, and the optimal injection rate for an idealised continuous distribution of azimuthal modes asymptotes to a flow rate that increases linearly with time. As for the one-dimensional case, if the viscosity of the injection fluid gradually increases over time, then the optimal injection rate has a smaller initial value but gradually increases to larger values than for the analogous constant viscosity problem. If the displacing fluid features shear-thinning rheology, then the optimal injection rate involves a smaller flow rate at early times, although not as large a reduction as in the Newtonian case, and a larger flow rate at late times, although not as large an increase as in the Newtonian case. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Hele-Shaw flows; instability control","Calculations; Elasticity; Flow rate; Gelation; Shear thinning; Stability; Variational techniques; Viscosity; Axisymmetric modes; Continuous distribution; Hele-Shaw flow; Instability control; Optimal injection; Saffman-Taylor instability; Shear-thinning rheology; Viscous instability; Viscosity ratios; Shear flow",2-s2.0-85030850633

The relations equate the dissipation rate for either passive or active scalars to the variance of scalar inputs from the initial values, boundary values and internal sources, as those are sampled backward in time by stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. New probabilistic concepts are required to represent scalar boundary conditions at the walls: the boundary local-time density at points on the wall where scalar fluxes are imposed and the boundary first hitting time at points where scalar values are imposed. These concepts are illustrated both by analytical results for the problem of pure heat conduction and by numerical results from a database of channel-flow turbulence, which also demonstrate the scalar mixing properties of near-wall turbulence. As an application of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, we examine for wall-bounded flows the relation between anomalous scalar dissipation and Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity, i.e. the persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity. In Part I of this series, we showed that spontaneous stochasticity is the only possible mechanism for anomalous dissipation of passive or active scalars, away from walls. Here it is shown that this remains true when there are no scalar fluxes through walls. Simple examples show, on the other hand, that a distinct mechanism of non-vanishing scalar dissipation can be thin scalar boundary layers near the walls. Nevertheless, we prove for general wall-bounded flows that spontaneous stochasticity is another possible mechanism of anomalous scalar dissipation. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","mathematical foundations; turbulence theory; turbulent mixing","Boundary layers; Heat conduction; Lagrange multipliers; Mixing; Stochastic systems; Turbulence; Viscosity; Fluctuation-dissipation relation; Lagrangian particles; Lagrangian trajectories; Mathematical foundations; Near-wall turbulence; Turbulence theory; Turbulent mixing; Vanishing viscosity; Dissipation relation; Wall flow; boundary condition; channel flow; mixing; turbulence; turbulent flow",2-s2.0-85030756052

Method: In all, 62 patients with stroke who were admitted to the rehabilitation ward were randomly assigned to two groups: 33 patients to the intervention group and 29 to the control group. The OHCP, including tooth brushing education and professional tooth cleaning, was administered to the intervention group twice a week six times during in-hospital rehabilitation. Oral health status was examined both at baseline and three months after discharge from the hospital. Oral hygiene status was examined at three- to four-day intervals five times during the hospitalization period. Results: After OHCP, oral hygiene status including the plaque index, calculus index, and O’Leary plaque index improved significantly in the intervention group, compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In the intervention group, after administration of the OHCP for the fourth time, the O’Leary index improved significantly, and remained high when checked three months after discharge (p < 0.001). Conclusions: An OHCP conducted during in-hospital rehabilitation was effective in improving oral health and plaque control performance among patients with stroke, with effects still seen three months after discharge from the hospital.Implications for Rehabilitation Initial oral hygiene status and plaque control performance were poor in stroke patients who were in rehabilitation center.

We aimed to investigate the possibility of a tapered non-vascularized bladder graft as a novel substitute for ureteral reconstruction. Methods: This experimental study was conducted on nine beagles. Under general anesthesia, a full-thickness graft with 5-6 cm in length was disassociated from the anterior upper wall of the bladder, and tapered into 1/3 to 1/2 thickness, remaining the urothelial surface. After removal of 5 cm of right-sided mid-ureter, the tapered bladder graft was tubularized along the long axis and then respectively anastomosed to the upper and lower stumps of the ureter. A retrograde urography through a cystostomy was performed 8 weeks after the ureteral reconstruction. The animals were euthanized, and histopathologic examinations of the neoureters were performed. Results: There were no severe complications during postoperative follow-up. The urography indicated patent urine excretion and no fistula or stenosis. Histopathologic examinations of the neoureters showed open lumen with urothelial lining. Nutrient vessels were observed in healthy submucosa, lamina muscularis and peripheral connective tissue.

Rev. Lett. 117, 180402 (2016)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.117.180402]. This is because the exponential scaling with the number of spins of the thermally assisted quantum tunneling rate and the Kramers escape rate of QMC are identical [Jiang, Phys. Rev. A 95, 012322 (2017)2469-992610.1103/PhysRevA.95.012322], a result of a dominant instantonic tunneling path. In Isakov et al., it was also conjectured that the escape rate in open-boundary QMC is quadratically larger than that of conventional periodic-boundary QMC; therefore, open-boundary QMC might be used as a powerful tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The intuition behind this conjecture is that the action of the instanton in open-boundary QMC is a half of that in periodic-boundary QMC. Here, we show that this simple intuition - although very useful in interpreting some numerical results - deviates from the actual situation in several ways. Using a fully connected quantum spin model, we derive a set of conditions on the positions and momenta of the end points of the instanton, which remove the extra degrees of freedom due to open boundaries. In comparison, the half-instanton conjecture incorrectly sets the momenta at the end points to zero. We also found that the instantons in open-boundary QMC correspond to quantum tunneling events in the symmetric subspace (maximum total angular momentum) at all temperatures, whereas the instantons in periodic-boundary QMC typically lie in subspaces with lower total angular momenta at finite temperatures.

The formation mechanisms of these spherulites and their morphology evolution were postulated. It was proposed that spherical particles of an inorganic and biological composite formed first. In the centre of each spherical particle a double-layer disk of vaterite crystal sandwiching a biological sheet developed.

An important concept that has emerged over recent years is the use of active physical methods for agitating these fluids to improve their penetration within areas that are not reached by endodontic instruments and to accelerate the chemical actions of these alkaline fluids against planktonic microorganisms, biofilms, soft tissue remnants and smear layers. Ultrasonic agitation and more recently pulsed lasers have emerged as two promising methods for activating endodontic irrigation fluids. Ultrasonic agitation with piezoelectric devices employs a moving tip, while laser agitation uses a stationary tip. Both methods cause cavitation, followed by implosions and shear forces which assist with debridement. Fluid streaming further enhances the activity of the fluids. While agitation enhances performance of irrigants, extrusion of fluids from the root canal during activation is a hazard that must be controlled. © 2017 by the authors.","EDTA; Endodontics; Fluid extrusion; Irrigation; Laser activation; Smear layer; Sodium hypochlorite; Ultrasonics","Alkalinity; Chemical activation; Chlorine compounds; Dentistry; Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; Extrusion; Hydraulic structures; Hydrometallurgy; Irrigation; Sodium; Sodium compounds; Ultrasonics; Alkaline solutions; Endodontic treatment; Endodontics; Physical methods; Root canal system; Smear layers; Sodium hypochlorites; Ultrasonic agitation; Pulsed lasers",2-s2.0-85032502420

Both landmasses were covered by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 years before present [YBP]); after the glacier retreated, ice patches remained on the island until ca. 9,000 calibrated (cal) YBP [1]. Nevertheless, indigenous peoples, whose ancestors had trekked some 5,000 km from the west coast, arrived approximately 10,000 cal YBP in Labrador and ca. 6,000 cal YBP in Newfoundland [2, 3]. Differential features in material culture indicate at least three settlement episodes by distinct cultural groups, including the Maritime Archaic, Palaeoeskimo, and Beothuk. Newfoundland has remained home to indigenous peoples until present day with only one apparent hiatus (3,400–2,800 YBP). This record suggests abandonment, severe constriction, or local extinction followed by subsequent immigrations from single or multiple source populations, but the specific dynamics and the cultural and biological relationships, if any, among these successive peoples remain enigmatic [4]. By examining the mitochondrial genome diversity and isotopic ratios of 74 ancient remains in conjunction with the archaeological record, we have provided definitive evidence for the genetic discontinuity between the maternal lineages of these populations. This northeastern margin of North America appears to have been populated multiple times by distinct groups that did not share a recent common ancestry, but rather one much deeper in time at the entry point into the continent. Duggan et al. generate 74 whole mitochondrial genomes and stable-isotope data from three ancient aboriginal populations from coastal Eastern Canada, spanning eight millennia as well as European contact.

Here we describe the case of a large bladder stone formed around a migrated Copper T380A device that was neglected and detected 15 years after insertion. Case presentation: A 48-year-old Sri Lankan woman underwent a workup for lower urinary tract symptoms and recurrent urinary tract infections over the previous 6 months. The radiographs showed a large bladder stone with an imprint of an intrauterine contraceptive device in the center of it. The device had been inserted 15 years previously. Two years after the insertion, it was considered to be missing, but our patient did not comply with the recommended follow-up. She had been completely asymptomatic until she developed lower urinary tract symptoms. After confirming the location of the stone via ultrasonography, a vesicolithotomy was performed, revealing a stone with three limbs corresponding to the shape of the Copper T380A device. The device and the threads were fully covered with the stone material. Our patient was asymptomatic following the surgery. Conclusions: A migrated intrauterine contraceptive device can act as the nidus for the formation of a secondary bladder stone. The detailed imprint of the device inside the stone and the laminated appearance of the stone material were characteristic of a secondary bladder stone formed around an intrauterine contraceptive device.

Traditional mechanical systems are replaced by hybrid or completely electric ones. In addition to the combustion, the electromechanical sources are considered. But in such small electric grids, in order to reduce the impact of load fluctuations on the power system, energy storage devices are proposed. Such devices are able to supply a peak power. As examples the batteries, flywheels, but primarily supercapacitors can be considered. Unfortunately, a very low voltage causes supercapacitors to work in stacks. This paper presents the results of analysis of the influence of changes in selected supercapacitor parameters changes on its terminal voltage during the cycles of charging and discharging. The model parameters are estimated based on the test measurements, while the differ-integral calculus of fractional order is used to derive the model output.

Recently, a rare L530R variation (rs757494578) of TRPV5 was found to be associated with recurrent kidney stones in a founder population. However, it was unclear to what extent this variation alters the structure and function of TRPV5. To evaluate the function and expression of the TRPV5 variant, Ca2+ uptake in Xenopus oocytes and western blot analysis were performed. The L530R variation abolished the Ca2+ uptake activity of TRPV5 in Xenopus oocytes. The variant protein was expressed with drastic reduction in complex glycosylation. To assess the structural effects of this L530R variation, TRPV5 was modeled based on the crystal structure of TRPV6 and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. Simulation results showed that the L530R variation disrupts the hydrophobic interaction between L530 and L502, damaging the secondary structure of transmembrane domain 5. The variation also alters its interaction with membrane lipid molecules. Compared to the electroneutral L530, the positively charged R530 residue shifts the surface electrostatic potential towards positive. R530 is attracted to the negatively charged phosphate group rather than the hydrophobic carbon atoms of membrane lipids. This shifts the pore helix where R530 is located and the D542 residue in the Ca2+-selective filter towards the surface of the membrane. These alterations may lead to misfolding of TRPV5, reduction in translocation of the channel to the plasma membrane and/or impaired Ca2+ transport function of the channel, and ultimately disrupt TRPV5-mediated Ca2+ reabsorption. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Ca2+-selective channel; Kidney stone; L530R variation; Membrane interaction; TRPV5","alanine; L530R protein; leucine; membrane protein; tyrosine; unclassified drug; vanilloid receptor 5; calcium; TRPV5 protein, human; vanilloid receptor; amino acid sequence; Article; calcium transport; cell membrane; controlled study; crystal structure; genetic variation; hydrophobicity; lipid bilayer; molecular dynamics; nephrolithiasis; nonhuman; oocyte; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein glycosylation; protein misfolding; protein protein interaction; protein secondary structure; protein structure; recurrent disease; sequence homology; single nucleotide polymorphism; static electricity; Western blotting; Xenopus; animal; chemistry; genetics; human; metabolism; molecular model; nephrolithiasis; Animals; Calcium; Genetic Variation; Humans; Kidney Calculi; Models, Molecular; Oocytes; TRPV Cation Channels; Xenopus",2-s2.0-85028463228

It is well established that the force-induced structural changes of minima and saddle points, i.e., the movement of the stationary points on the original or stress-free potential energy surface, can be described by a Newton Trajectory (NT). Given a reactive molecular system, a well-fitted pulling direction, and a sufficiently large value of the force, the minimum configuration of the reactant and the saddle point configuration of a transition state collapse at a point on the corresponding NT trajectory. This point is called barrier breakdown point or bond breaking point (BBP). The Hessian matrix at the BBP has a zero eigenvector which coincides with the gradient. It indicates which force (both in magnitude and direction) should be applied to the system to induce the reaction in a barrierless process. Within the manifold of BBPs, there exist optimal BBPs which indicate what is the optimal pulling direction and what is the minimal magnitude of the force to be applied for a given mechanochemical transformation. Since these special points are very important in the context of mechanochemistry and catalysis, it is crucial to develop efficient algorithms for their location. Here, we propose a Gauss-Newton algorithm that is based on the minimization of a positively defined function (the so-called σ-function). The behavior and efficiency of the new algorithm are shown for 2D test functions and for a real chemical example. © 2017 Author(s).",,"Catalysis; Electron energy levels; Molecular physics; Potential energy surfaces; Quantum chemistry; Bond-breaking points; Chemical transformations; Defined functions; Gauss-Newton algorithm; Mechano-chemistry; Mechanochemical transformations; Newton trajectory; Stationary points; Potential energy",2-s2.0-85026873035

Focusing on contact-sport players who are at great risk of mTBI, our study was designed to examine the moderating role of internal locus of control. Specifically, we predicted that following diagnosis threat (reminder of their risk of sustaining mTBI and of its consequences), low-internal contact-sport players would underperform (assimilation to the stereotype), while their high-internal counterparts would outperform (contrast effect). We predicted that effort and anxiety would mediate these effects. Method: Contact-sport players and non-contact-sport players (“control” group) were randomly assigned to one condition (diagnosis threat or neutral) and then completed attention, executive, episodic memory, and working memory tasks. Regarding mediating and moderating variables, participants rated their effort and anxiety (self-report measures) and completed the Levenson (1974) locus of control scale. Regression-based path analyses were carried out to examine the direct and indirect effects. Results: As expected, there was no effect of condition on the control group’s performance. Contact-sport players with moderate and high levels of internal control outperformed (contrast effect) on executive and episodic memory tasks following diagnosis threat compared to the neutral condition. Additionally, the less anxiety moderate- and high-internal contact-sport participants felt, the better they performed on episodic memory and executive tasks. However, contact-sport players low in internal control did not underperform (assimilation effect) under diagnosis threat. Conclusions: Our results suggest that diagnosis threat instructions may have challenged moderate- and high-internal contact-sport participants, leading them to outperform compared to the neutral condition. Individuals who have moderate and high levels of internal locus of control may have higher performance under diagnosis threat compared to the neutral condition because of their feeling of control over their cognitive performance. © 2017 Fonds National De La Recherche Scientifique (F.N.R.S.).","Diagnosis threat; locus of control; neuropsychological assessment; sports-related concussion; stereotype threat",,2-s2.0-85010670218

They hankered for a new vision of mind and society. The traumatism of WW2 was implicit but omnipresent, and the Cold War was beginning. Macy key tools and concepts about information, the value of information, and computer artefacts have finally produced a new world, in particular an organisational world, which is far removed from their original dreams. Organisational members are now involved in difficult situations in terms of organising, that is, new modes of performativity which are difficult to comprehend and deal with; a transformation of meaning and knowledge in collective activity; and a threat to well-being and happiness as mental activities, cognition and bodies are increasingly disconnected. We use the Macy conferences as an entry point to reflect on the ‘longue durée’ evolution of the material underpinnings of information and their relationship with organising. We first explore the new conceptualisations at the core of the Macy conferences, information, value of information, and computer artefacts.

CBD exploration, either by open or laparoscopic approach nowadays, is usually reserved for ERCP failures, complicated stone locations, along with altered anatomical situations. The aim of this study was to highlight the increasing role of laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy which is not only a reliable but also as a rescue procedure for those failed ERCP cases due to complicated bile duct stones. Materials and methods: It is a retrospective review of the database, from a tertiary care teaching institution from India, from Jan 2012 up to December 2016. Results: Out of total 30 patients who underwent laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomy, 28 had failed ERC stone clearance while two patients were directly offered drainage in view of unfavorable anatomy. The major reasons for failed ERC stone clearance were as follows—multiple large calculi (42.8%), recurrent stones (21.4%), and associated stricture (21.4%). Mean operating time was 130 (± 27) minutes with mean blood loss of 60 (± 19) ml. Stone extraction was successful, primarily by milking in 13 (43.33%) patients, rest required augmentation by Dormia basket/balloon. Two patients (6.66%) developed controlled bile leak which resolved with conservative treatment. The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR 3–9). Mean duration of follow-up was 17 (± 3.2) months. Conclusion: Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration with choledochoduodenostomy has been shown to be a safe, reliable, and efficient method for treating complex CBDS, especially after failed ERCP procedures. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Biliary calculi; Biliary drainage; Choledochoduodenostomy; ERCP; Laparoscopy",,2-s2.0-85031710190

In Dell’Isola et al. (2015 Zeitschrift für angewandte Mathematik und Physik 66, 3473- 3498. (doi: 10.1007/s00033-015-0556-4)), it was proved that, with a pantographic microstructure constituted by ‘long’ microbeams it is possible to obtainmetamaterials whose elastic range spans up to an elongation exceeding 30%. In this paper, we demonstrate that the same behaviour can be obtained bymeans of an internal microstructure based on a king post motif. This solution shows many advantages: it involves only microbeams; all constituting beams are undergoing only extension or compression; all internal constraints are terminal pivots. While the elastic deformation energy can be determined as easily as in the case of long-beam microstructure, the proposed design seems to have obvious remarkable advantages: it seems to be more damage resistant and therefore to be able to have a wider elastic range; it can be realized with the same three-dimensional printing technology; it seems to be less subject to compression buckling. The analysis which we present here includes: (i) the determination of Hencky-type discrete models for king post trusses, (ii) the application of an effective integration scheme to a class of relevant deformation tests for the proposed metamaterial and (iii) the numerical determination of an equivalent second gradient continuum model.

In this paper, we consider a firm that has the opportunity to suspend and to resume production infinitely many times subject to a time lag after each startup decision. We contribute to the literature by allowing the firm to determine its level of installed capacity in conjunction with its optimal investment timing. We find that an increase in the length of the time lag results in an increase in the optimal capacity level. Capacity optimization also interacts with the length of the time lag to affect investment timing and the triggers to suspend and resume production, thereby weakening the result about hysteresis from a standard real options model. Under the assumption of a fixed level of capacity, a longer lag speeds up the decision to resume operations due to a positive upside to the revenue but delays the suspension of operations. By contrast, with capacity optimization, a longer time lag results in a larger capacity choice, which can indirectly delay the investment decision and the timing to resume operations. This indirect effect dominates when the level of market uncertainty is low and the time lag is initially small. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity optimization; Investment analysis; Real options; Time lag","Economics; Risk assessment; Capacity optimization; Installed capacity; Investment analysis; Investment decisions; Market uncertainty; Optimal investment timing; Real Options; Time lag; Investments",2-s2.0-85018392165

Due to the fact that both the control and state variables contain delays, we derive a necessary conditions for our optimal problem. Based on these results, numerical simulations are implemented not only to show the optimal therapeutic schedules for different infection and release rates, but also to compare the effective of three treatment programs. Furthermore, comparison of therapeutic effects under different maximum tolerable dosages is shown. Our research indicates that (1) the proper and specific treatment program should be determined according to the infection rates of different virus particles; (2) the optimal combined drug treatment is the most efficient; (3) the appropriate proportion of medicament must be formulated during the therapy due to the non-monotonic relationship between maximum tolerable dosages and therapeutic effects; (4) the therapeutic effect is advantageous when the pharmacological delay is considered. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","optimal control; pharmacological delay; therapy; virus replication",,2-s2.0-85032187497

This is achieved through the separation of control plane and data plane in a network. In Software Defined Networks (SDN), the network control functions are removed from the data forwarding nodes and placed into a logically centralized controller. So, these functions can be updated with a cost of a simple software change and without any changes in the hardware modules. But an important question arises about the performance of SDNs. This question becomes more serious regarding the central control unit as a probable obstacle to the scalability of SDNs. To have a precise image of this problem, in this paper an analytical model is provided for SDNs implemented based on pure OpenFlow standard. This model which is based on the network calculus framework, computes the worst case delay bound of such SDNs. The delay bound is estimated according to the similarities between the caches and flow tables in OpenFlow switches. The results show the interaction of different parameters such as network size, flow table size, traffic characteristics and the delay of SDNs. This can be used to evaluate SDN prototypes in the early stages of the design phase.

Typing ensures that these ports are plugged together appropriately, so that data can flow out of each output port and into an input port. These interfaces typically consider the direction of data flow and the type of values flowing. Components, connectors, and systems are often parameterised in such a way that the parameters affect the interfaces. Typing such connector families is challenging. This paper takes a first step towards addressing this problem by presenting a calculus of connector families with integer and boolean parameters. The calculus is based on monoidal categories, with a dependent type system that describes the parameterised interfaces of these connectors. We use families of Reo connectors as running examples, and show how this calculus can be applied to Petri Nets and to BIP systems. The paper focuses on the structure of connectors—well-connectedness—and less on their behaviour, making it easily applicable to a wide range of coordination and component-based models. A type-checking algorithm based on constraints is used to analyse connector families, supported by a proof-of-concept implementation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Calculus of connectors; Composition of families; Tile Model; Type system; Variability in connectors","Petri nets; Semantics; Component-based models; Dependent type system; Monoidal categories; Output ports; Proof of concept; Tile models; Type systems; Typechecking; Calculations",2-s2.0-85017519291

It is assumed that GPL reinforcements are randomly oriented and uniformly dispersed in each individual GPL-reinforced composite (GPLRC) layer but the concentration follows a layer-wise variation across the plate thickness. The modified Halpin-Tsai micromechanics model that takes into account the GPL geometry effect is adopted to estimate the effective Young's modulus of GPLRC layers. Within the framework of the first-order shear deformation theory, the nonlinear governing equations are derived by applying the principle of virtual displacements and then solved by using a differential quadrature-based iteration technique. Parametric studies are conducted to examine the influences of GPL distribution pattern, concentration and geometry, as well as in-plane force on the thermal buckling and postbuckling behaviours. Our results show that distributing more GPLs near the surface layers is capable of reinforcing the thermal buckling and postbuckling performances of GPLRC plates. Whether the thermal buckling and postbuckling resistance increases or decreases with the increases in GPL weight fraction, aspect ratio and width-to-thickness ratio is highly dependent on the GPL distribution pattern. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Differential quadrature method; Functionally graded plate; Graphene nanocomposite; Postbuckling; Thermal buckling","Aspect ratio; Differentiation (calculus); Elastic moduli; Graphene; Iterative methods; Nanocomposites; Nonlinear equations; Plates (structural components); Reinforcement; Shear deformation; Differential quadrature methods; Functionally graded plates; Graphene nanocomposites; Postbuckling; Thermal buckling; Buckling",2-s2.0-85024370775

We present finite element (FE) geodynamical simulations of Ceres to identify the internal structures and compositions that best reproduce its topography as observed by the NASA Dawn mission.

The fluid is acted by an arbitrary time-dependent pressure gradient, an external electric field and an external magnetic field. The governing equations are considered as fractional partial differential equations based on the Caputo–Fabrizio time-fractional derivatives without singular kernel. The usefulness of fractional calculus to study fluid flows or heat and mass transfer phenomena was proven. Several experimental measurements led to conclusion that, in such problems, the models described by fractional differential equations are more suitable. The most common time-fractional derivative used in Continuum Mechanics is Caputo derivative. However, two disadvantages appear when this derivative is used. First, the definition kernel is a singular function and, secondly, the analytical expressions of the problem solutions are expressed by generalized functions (Mittag-Leffler, Lorenzo–Hartley, Robotnov, etc.) which, generally, are not adequate to numerical calculations. The new time-fractional derivative Caputo–Fabrizio, without singular kernel, is more suitable to solve various theoretical and practical problems which involve fractional differential equations. Using the Caputo–Fabrizio derivative, calculations are simpler and, the obtained solutions are expressed by elementary functions. Analytical solutions of the biofluid velocity and thermal transport are obtained by means of the Laplace and finite Hankel transforms. The influence of the fractional parameter, Eckert number and Joule heating parameter on the biofluid velocity and thermal transport are numerically analyzed and graphic presented.

The one-third rule which has been found in the frequency dependent Moran process also holds for our model. We obtain the conditions of strategy being an evolutionarily stable strategy in our model, and then make a comparison with the standard Moran process. Besides, the analytical results show that compared with the standard Moran process, fixation occurs with higher probabilities under a prisoner's dilemma game and coordination game, but with lower probabilities under a coexistence game. The simulation result shows that the fixation time in our mixed process is lower than that in the standard Fermi process. In comparison with the standard Moran process, fixation always takes more time on average in spatial populations, regardless of the game.

This particularly includes the special case ρ=μ=0 of a nutrient taxis system with food-dependent cell proliferation, but beyond that the system (⋆) for general parameter choices is also used as a model for Lotka–Volterra-type interaction involving prey taxis. It is firstly shown that if n≤5, then for all suitably regular initial data an associated no-flux initial-boundary value problem admits a global weak solution. To the best of our knowledge, this inter alia provides the first result on global existence in a system of the form (⋆) in a spatially three-dimensional setting when arbitrarily large initial data and parameters are involved. Secondly, under the additional hypotheses that n≤3, ρ=0 and μ&amp;#x003C;16Dαχ2 it is seen that each of these solutions becomes eventually smooth and stabilizes toward a spatially homogeneous equilibrium in the sense that u(⋅,t)→u∞in L∞(Ω)andv(⋅,t)→0in L∞(Ω) as t→∞, where u∞ is a constant satisfying u∞≥1|Ω|∫Ωu0.

Apart from that, (0.1) complements previous findings on convergence to equilibria in prey-taxis systems of type (⋆), which seem to exclusively concentrate on cases in which unlike in (0.1) the constant limit functions are a priori known, and in which thereby the corresponding asymptotic analysis is apparently simplified to a considerable extent. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Chemotaxis; Eventual regularity; Prey taxis; Stabilization",,2-s2.0-85020773396

There are several methods used to find the optimal thresholding values such as Otsu and Kapur based methods. These methods are suitable for bi-level thresholding case and they can be easily extended to the multilevel case, however, the process of determining the optimal thresholds in the case of multilevel thresholding is time-consuming. To avoid this problem, this paper examines the ability of two nature inspired algorithms namely: Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) to determine the optimal multilevel thresholding for image segmentation. The MFO algorithm is inspired from the natural behavior of moths which have a special navigation style at night since they fly using the moonlight, whereas, the WOA algorithm emulates the natural cooperative behaviors of whales. The candidate solutions in the adapted algorithms were created using the image histogram, and then they were updated based on the characteristics of each algorithm. The solutions are assessed using the Otsu's fitness function during the optimization operation. The performance of the proposed algorithms has been evaluated using several of benchmark images and has been compared with five different swarm algorithms. The results have been analyzed based on the best fitness values, PSNR, and SSIM measures, as well as time complexity and the ANOVA test. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods outperformed the other swarm algorithms; in addition, the MFO showed better results than WOA, as well as provided a good balance between exploration and exploitation in all images at small and high threshold numbers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Image segmentation; Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO); Multilevel thresholding; Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)","Behavioral research; Benchmarking; Image segmentation; Bilevel thresholding; Co-operative behaviors; Exploration and exploitation; Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO); Multilevel thresholding; Nature inspired algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Optimization operation; Optimization",2-s2.0-85018397343

Our results show that: (i) the fluctuations of protein synthesis rate and maximum dilution rate enhance the emergent bimodality of the probability distribution phenomenon, while the cross-correlation between two noises(λ), the time delay(τ) and the strength of the feedback loop(K) cause it to disappear; and (ii) the mean first passage time(MFPT) as functions of the noise strengths exhibits a maximum, this maximum is called noise-delayed switching (NDS) of the high concentration state.

The method is an extension of the simplified refined instrumental variable method developed for the linear fractional-order continuous-time system, denoted. The advantage of this novel extension, compared with published methods, is that the static output non-linearity of the Wiener model part does not need to be invertible. The input and output static non-linear functions are represented by a sum of the known basis functions. The proposed approach estimates the parameters of the linear fractional-order continuous-time subsystem and the input and output static non-linear functions from the sampled input-output data by considering the system to be a multi-input-single-output linear fractional-order continuoustime model. These extra inputs represent the basis functions of the static input and output non-linearity, where the output basis functions are simulated according to the previous estimates of the fractional-order linear subsystem and the static input nonlinear function at every iteration. It is also possible to estimate the classical integer-order model counterparts as a special case. Subsequently, the proposed extension to the simplified refined instrumental variable method is considered in the classical integer-order continuous-time Hammerstein-Wiener case. In this paper, a Monte Carlo simulation analysis is applied for demonstrating the performance of the proposed approach to estimate the parameters of a fractional-order Hammerstein-Wiener output model. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017.",,"Functions; Intelligent systems; Iterative methods; Monte Carlo methods; Parameter estimation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Continuous time models; Hammerstein-Wiener models; Input-output data; Linear subsystems; Multi input single outputs; Nonlinear functions; Refined instrumental variables; Single input single output; Continuous time systems",2-s2.0-85029771282

On digital cervical examination, she was found to have a large semi-solid anterior vaginal mass, shown by trans-vaginal ultrasound to have a nearly solid appearance of a 5x7 cm mass with septation. Maternal Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology consultations were obtained primary cesarean section with vaginal biopsy in the Operating Room were recommended. Following an uncomplicated cesarean delivery and with the patient still under spinal anesthesia, the anterior vaginal mass was examined and found to contain 200 ml of purulent material. Because a diagnosis of urethral diverticulum was made, a biopsy was not performed. The patient was placed on antibiotic prophylaxis for the remainder of her hospital course. Follow-up CT scan confirmed a large urethral diverticulum, and she was referred to the Fetal Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) and Urogynecology units for treatment.

Utilizing these observations, we design a composite damper design where a poroelastic layer is sandwiched between two hard materials, and load transfer occurs across interfaces with multiple length scales. Modeling those interfaces with fractional Zener elements in parallel configuration, and manipulating the distribution of the Zener elements across different peak relaxation frequencies, we obtain a relatively constant loss factor within an unprecedented frequency range (3-3 kHz).

Closed-loop asymptotic stability is certified by continuous Lyapunov functions that are viscosity solutions of the steadystate Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation for the controlled system. Since it is difficult to find viscosity solutions of partial differential equations for numerous problems of practical interest, they extend an inverse optimality framework to provide explicit closed-form solutions of differential game problems, which involve affine in the controls dynamical systems with quadratic cost functions and linear dynamical systems with Lagrangians in polynomial form.

Allocation of marketing budgets to these valuable assets is critical; because the way companies allocate their marketing budgets to customers affects their profitability. The purpose of this research is to provide a new approach to allocate marketing budgets to customer segments in a long-term view and a dynamic process. The contribution of the model is as follows: (1) unlike the previous modeling efforts where a predefined budget level was assigned to acquisition and retention, the suggested model sets and allocates marketing budgets simultaneously; (2) the model is multi-period which means the strategies for setting and allocation of marketing budgets may be different in each period. The proposed approach aims at maximizing customer equity in a long-term planning horizon with several periods. Decision variables determine how the budgets should be assigned to customer acquisition and retention in each period. Formulation of the model is followed by a numerical illustration.

We show that the resulting stochastic bridges are identical, whether derived from a forward or a backward time stochastic process. A numerical algorithm is obtained to sample these distributions. This technique, which uses partial stochastic equations, is robust and easily implemented. Examples are given, and comparisons are made to previous work. In stochastic equations without a gradient drift, our results confirm an earlier conjecture, while generalizing this to cases with path-dependent weights. An example of a two-dimensional stochastic equation with no potential solution is analyzed and numerically solved.

Typically passive counting is used for Pu and mixed Pu-U items and active methods are used for U materials. Three measured counting rates, singles, doubles and triples are measured and, in combination with a simple analytical point-model, are used to calculate characteristics of the measurement item in terms of known detector and nuclear parameters. However, the measurement problem usually involves more than three quantities of interest, but even in cases where the next higher order count rate, quads, is statistically viable, it is not quantitatively applied because corrections for dead time losses are currently not available in the predominant analysis paradigm. In this work we overcome this limitation by extending the commonly used dead time correction method, developed by Dytlewski, to quads. We also give results for pents, which may be of interest for certain special investigations. Extension to still higher orders, may be accomplished by inspection based on the sequence presented. We discuss the foundations of the Dytlewski method, give limiting cases, and highlight the opportunities and implications that these new results expose. In particular there exist a number of ways in which the new results may be combined with other approaches to extract the correlated rates, and this leads to various practical implementations. © 2017","Dead time corrections; Neutron coincidence counting; Neutron multiplicity counting","Binary alloys; Neutrons; Radioactive materials; Dead-time correction; Measurement problems; Neutron coincidence counting; Neutron multiplicity counting; Nuclear parameters; Nuclear Safeguards; Quantities of interests; Special nuclear materials; Nuclear materials safeguards",2-s2.0-85026226148

I argue that a pluralistic variant of Hedonism can match its theoretical attractions while also accommodating the heterogeneity of pleasure.

METHODS This retrospective analysis identifed 168 patients with painful chronic pancreatitis hospitalized during January 2010-January 2015 in a Romanian tertiary referral center. Data on demographics, medical history, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, clinical parameters, type and number of endoscopic procedures and hospital admissions number were collected from the medical charts and analyzed. The absence or substantial reduction of pain (mild pain) at the end of the follow-up associated with the technical success of endotherapy was considered as clinical success. RESULTS Among the 168 patients with painful chronic pancreatitis admitted to our department during the study period, 39 (23.21%) had optimal response to the medical therapy. One hundred and twenty-nine patients required endoscopic treatment. The median follow-up period was 15 mo (range, 0-60 mo). Overall, technical success of endotherapy was achieved in 105 patients (81.39%). More than two-thirds of patients (82.78%) had substantial improvement of pain after the endoscopic treatment, including frequency and severity of the pain attacks. Patients younger than 40 years had signifcantly more successful endoscopic procedures (P = 0.041). Clinical success was higher in non-smoking patients (P = 0.003). The hospital admission rate was higher in patients with recognized alcohol consumption (P = 0.03) and in smokers (P = 0.027).

Synthesis problems are tasks comprising multiple concepts typically taught in different chapters. Mathematical performance refers to the formulation, combination, and simplification of equations. Generally speaking, formulation and combination of equations require conceptual reasoning; simplification of equations requires manipulation of equations as computational tools. Mathematical complexity is operationally defined by the number and the type of equations to be manipulated concurrently due to the number of unknowns in each equation. We use two types of synthesis problems, namely, sequential and simultaneous tasks. Sequential synthesis tasks require a chronological application of pertinent concepts, and simultaneous synthesis tasks require a concurrent application of the pertinent concepts. A total of 179 physics major students from a second year mechanics course participated in the study. Data were collected from written tasks and individual interviews. Results show that mathematical complexity negatively influences the students' mathematical performance on both types of synthesis problems. However, for the sequential synthesis tasks, it interferes only with the students' simplification of equations. For the simultaneous synthesis tasks, mathematical complexity additionally impedes the students' formulation and combination of equations. Several reasons may explain this difference, including the students' different approaches to the two types of synthesis problems, cognitive load, and the variation of mathematical complexity within each synthesis type. © 2017 authors.

The pathomechanism of XP is not yet fully understood. Microscopically, XP is indicated by the presence of multinucleated giant cells and lipidladen macrophages, as well as inflammatory infiltration and intensive renal fibrosis. The lipid accumulation in kidney parenchyma may be secondary to the altered flow of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol particles inside the affected cells. Physiologically, the process of LDL-derived cholesterol transport from lysosomes to the sites of its esterification is dependent on vimentin, which is a molecule comprising the cytoskeleton in mesenchymal cells. Case Report: A 7-year old girl was hospitalized because of the finding of unexplained kidney lesions on an abdominal ultrasound examination (an enlarged and deformed collecting system of the right kidney with hyperechogenic, solid, staghorn lesions in the calyces). Three months earlier, the patient had experienced recurrent urinary tract infection. Based on the subsequent laboratory and imaging diagnostics, the final diagnosis of XP was established and the girl was qualified for right-sided nephrectomy Microscopic examination revealed numerous foci of granuloma formations with no evident exponents of dysplastic or neoplastic abnormalities. Significant CD68-positive cell infiltrations and scattered foam cells arranging the numerous foci of granuloma inflammation were noticed. Renal parenchyma, adjacent to granuloma lesions, presented a vimentin expression. Conclusions: Vimentin expression in XP may confirm a focal character of chronic granuloma formation and may suggest the complexity of XP pathogenesis involving not only macrophage and fibroblast activation but also local lipid deregulation and fibrosis. © Am J Case Rep.","Immunohistochemistry; Interstitia; Nephritis; Pyelonephritis; Xanthogranulomatous","CD68 antigen; lipid; vimentin; Article; case report; cell infiltration; child; clinical article; clinical feature; disease course; female; fibroblast; granuloma; human; kidney injury; kidney parenchyma; macrophage activation; microscopy; nephrectomy; pathogenesis; protein expression; recurrent infection; school child; stomach examination; urinary tract infection; xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis",2-s2.0-85030835095

The current study explores the contribution of both EFs and IQ in mathematics through an SEM approach. A total of 118 8- to 12-year-olds were administered measures of EFs, crystallized (Gc) and fluid (Gf) intelligence, and math abilities (i.e., number production, mental calculus and arithmetical problem-solving).

The model is based on the assumption that in many cases it is desirable to replace equalities on values in data tables by similarity relations expressing degrees to which the values are similar. In this context, we study various phenomena which emerge in the model, including similarity-based queries and similarity-based data dependencies. Central notion in our model is that of a ranked data table over domains with similarities which is our counterpart to the notion of relation on relation scheme from the classical relational model. Compared to other approaches which cover related problems, we do not propose a similarity-based or ranking module on top of the classical relational model. Instead, we generalize the very core of the model by replacing the classical, two-valued logic upon which the classical model is built by a more general logic involving a scale of truth degrees that, in addition to the classical truth degrees 0 and 1, contains intermediate truth degrees. While the classical truth degrees 0 and 1 represent nonequality and equality of values, and subsequently mismatch and match of queries, the intermediate truth degrees in the new model represent similarity of values and partial match of queries. Moreover, the truth functions of many-valued logical connectives in the new model serve to aggregate degrees of similarity. The presented approach is conceptually clean, logically sound, and retains most properties of the classical model while enabling us to employ new types of queries and data dependencies. Most importantly, similarity is not handled in an ad hoc way or by putting a “similarity module” atop the classical model in our approach. Rather, it is consistently viewed as a notion that generalizes and replaces equality in the very core of the relational model. We present fundamentals of the formal model and two equivalent query systems which are analogues of the classical relational algebra and domain relational calculus with range declarations. In the sequel to this paper, we deal with similarity-based dependencies. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","domain relation calculus; relation algebra; residuated lattices; Similarity-based databases","Algebra; Calculations; Data handling; Many valued logics; domain relation calculus; Domain relational calculus; Relation algebras; Relational Database; Relational similarities; Residuated lattices; Similarity relations; Similarity-based database; Search engines",2-s2.0-85026918653

While the Euclidean approach to a priori bounds on solutions is somewhat manageable in the learning and teaching of the proofs involving second-order, linear problems with constant co-efficients, we believe it is not pedagogically optimal. Moreover, the Euclidean method becomes pedagogically unwieldy in the proofs involving higher-order cases. The purpose of this work is to propose a simpler pedagogical approach to establish a priori bounds on solutions by considering a different way of measuring the size of a solution to linear problems, which we refer to as the Uber size. The Uber form enables a simplification of pedagogy from the literature and the ideas are accessible to learners who have an understanding of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the exponential function, both usually seen in a first course in calculus. We believe that this work will be of mathematical and pedagogical interest to those who are learning and teaching in the area of differential equations or in any of the numerous disciplines where linear differential equations are used. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","a priori bounds; higher-order differential equations; initial value problems; linear differential equations; Manhattan distance; ordinary differential equations; Pedagogy; second-order differential equations; taxicab geometry; Uber metric; uniqueness of solutions",,2-s2.0-85014542760

In terms of the fidelity term, we use piecewise polynomials to approximate the inner and outer regions of the contour of the objective image. For more accurate approximation of the image, the proposed model has no constraint on the regularization term for polynomials. Moreover, we apply the anisotropic control to drive the initial contour to the desirable position. The proposed model generalizes the well-known Chan–Vese model and improves Vese's model, which is almost the simplest framework to apply piecewise polynomials to approximate the original Mumford–Shah model. Instead of solving the Euler–Lagrange equation by evolution implementation, we utilize the split Bregman iteration, which is shown to be a fast algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has more desirable performance in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and robustness, compared with several other variational models in addressing some challenging segmentation scenarios. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anisotropic control; Image segmentation; intensity heterogeneity; piecewise-polynomial approximation; split Bregman iteration","Anisotropy; Equations of motion; Iterative methods; Polynomial approximation; Polynomials; Initial contour; Intensity heterogeneity; Lagrange equation; Piecewise polynomials; Regularization terms; Segmentation accuracy; Split bregman iterations; Variational models; Image segmentation",2-s2.0-85009975890

The main advantage of the method of parametric penalty functions is the fact that a parametric penalty function can be both smooth and exact unlike the standard (i.e. non-parametric) exact penalty functions that are always nonsmooth. We obtain several necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the exactness of parametric penalty functions, and for the zero duality gap property to hold true for these functions. We also prove some convergence results for the method of parametric penalty functions, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a parametric penalty function to not have any stationary points outside the set of feasible points of the constrained optimization problem under consideration. In the second part of the paper, we apply the general theory of exact parametric penalty functions to a class of parametric penalty functions introduced by Huyer and Neumaier, and to smoothing approximations of nonsmooth exact penalty functions.

We describe a series of psychometric models to supplement the use of CTT in neuropsychological research and test development. Method: We introduce increasingly complex psychometric models as measurement algebras, which include model parameters that represent abilities and item properties. Within this framework of parametric model measurement (PMM), neuropsychological assessment involves the estimation of model parameters with ability parameter values assuming the role of test ‘scores’. Moreover, the traditional notion of measurement error is replaced by the notion of parameter estimation error, and the definition of reliability becomes linked to notions of item and test information. The more complex PMM approaches incorporate into the assessment of neuropsychological performance formal parametric models of behavior validated in the experimental psychology literature, along with item parameters. These PMM approaches endorse the use of experimental manipulations of model parameters to assess a test’s construct representation. Strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated by their implications for measurement error conditional upon ability level, sensitivity to sample characteristics, computational challenges to parameter estimation, and construct validity. Conclusion: A family of parametric psychometric models can be used to assess latent processes of interest to neuropsychologists. By modeling latent abilities at the item level, psychometric studies in neuropsychology can investigate construct validity and measurement precision within a single framework and contribute to a unification of statistical methods within the framework of generalized latent variable modeling. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","construct validity; measurement precision; Neuropsychology; parametric models; psychometric theory","behavior; construct validity; experimental model; family; mathematics; measurement error; measurement precision; neuropsychology; psychological model; reliability; statistical analysis; statistical model; theoretical model",2-s2.0-85020540689

However, research has shown that learners tend to have a limited understanding of partitive division when the divisor is a proper fraction. To extend research on conceptions of partitive division in this study, we used Moschkovich’s (1999) transitional conceptions perspective to examine how conceptions of partitive division evolve. This article reports on preservice teachers’ (PSTs) conceptions of partitive division with proper-fraction divisors before and after they explored partitive division in a mathematics content course for elementary teachers (N = 17). Our analysis of pre- and post-interviews revealed an initial transitional conception and two levels of refinement of their conceptions. Furthermore, we identified two perturbations that PSTs experienced during refinement of their conceptions. By identifying ordered levels of refinement and associated perturbations, this exploratory study extends the transitional conceptions perspective. Furthermore, this study adds new insights into the conceptual complexities that the partitive model for division of fractions presents to PSTs (and to learners in general) and suggests new hypotheses about ways that conceptions of partitive division undergo refinement. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,2-s2.0-85031770993

Recently, much interest has been aroused by an approach involving the use of the realized covariance (RCOV) matrix constructed from high-frequency returns as the ex-post realization of the covariance matrix of low-frequency returns. For the analysis of dynamics of RCOV matrices, we propose the generalized conditional autoregressive Wishart (GCAW) model. Both the noncentrality matrix and scale matrix of the Wishart distribution are driven by the lagged values of RCOV matrices, and represent two different sources of dynamics, respectively. The GCAW is a generalization of the existing models, and accounts for symmetry and positive definiteness of RCOV matrices without imposing any parametric restriction. Some important properties such as conditional moments, unconditional moments, and stationarity are discussed.

The underlying assumption is that these indicators are highly correlated, and thus it matters little as to which one the researcher chooses. I call this PTT's power consensus and argue that this consensus is problematic, as the choice of power indicator is often crucial. For PTT, it does not only matter whether such indicators come to similar results by and large; the position of certain singular actors—such as the dominant power, its prime challengers, and the top ranked great powers generally—is even more essential. However, it is precisely with regard to the positions of these actors that we find important discrepancies between what PTT's favored indicators (GDP and CINC) suggest. Analysis of some crucial historical and recent cases supports my challenge to the power consensus. First, the celebrated peaceful power transition between the United Kingdom and the United States in the nineteenth century becomes suspect under closer scrutiny, as GDP places the United States entering the parity zone at a time during which it must arguably be counted as a dissatisfied power. Second, a number of CINC-exclusive power transitions in the twentieth century are not accounted for by GDP. A few possible options might mitigate the power-problem for the cases under scrutiny, however scholars of PTT should generally be much more conscious about their choice of power indicator. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-85022209988

Material and methods On each of 50 extracted teeth, a calculus-positive and calculus-free root surface was evaluated by two independent examiners with a low-power indium gallium arsenide phosphide diode laser (DIAGNOdent) fitted with a periodontal probe-like sapphire tip and emitting visible red light at 655 nm wavelength. Laser autofluorescence intensity readings of examined root surfaces were scored on a 0–99 scale, with duplicate assessments performed using the laser probe tip directed both perpendicular and parallel to evaluated tooth root surfaces. Pearson correlation coefficients of untransformed measurements, and kappa analysis of data dichotomized with a >40 autofluorescence intensity threshold, were calculated to assess intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility of the laser device. Mean autofluorescence intensity scores of calculus-positive and calculus-free root surfaces were evaluated with the Student's t-test. Results Excellent intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility was found for DIAGNOdent laser autofluorescence intensity measurements, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 94%, and kappa values ranging between 0.96 and 1.0, for duplicate readings taken with both laser probe tip orientations. Significantly higher autofluorescence intensity values were measured when the laser probe tip was directed perpendicular, rather than parallel, to tooth root surfaces. However, calculus-positive roots, particularly with calculus in markedly-raised ledges, yielded significantly greater mean DIAGNOdent laser autofluorescence intensity scores than calculus-free surfaces, regardless of probe tip orientation. DIAGNOdent autofluorescence intensity values >40 exhibited a stronger association with calculus (36.6 odds ratio) then measurements of ≥5 (20.1 odds ratio) when the laser probe tip was advanced parallel to root surfaces. Conclusions Excellent intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility of autofluorescence intensity measurements was obtained with the DIAGNOdent laser fluorescence device on human tooth roots. Calculus-positive root surfaces exhibited significantly greater DIAGNOdent laser autofluorescence than calculus-free tooth roots, even with the laser probe tip directed parallel to root surfaces.

Granny smith). Drying was performed at 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C and 30%, 50%, 70%RH based on a 32 experimental design. The drying curves were analyzed to determine the effective diffusion (Deff) using two methods: Fick's second law and anomalous diffusion model based on fractional calculus approach. Our results showed that the anomalous diffusion mechanism fit the experimental data better and revealed a super-diffusive behavior (α &gt; 1). Therefore, Deff values were estimated using the anomalous diffusion model with α = 1.735. With respect to the use of anomalous diffusion model solution based on fractional calculus at different operations conditions allow to get better fitting of drying data than second Fick's law model, even keeping the Arrhenius behavior of Deff with temperature. Practical applications: Diffusion process is typically analyzed using models based on Fick's second law. However, several assumptions inherent in Fick's second law are not fulfilled in food materials (e.g., structural heterogeneity). In addition, Fick's second law does not consider structural variations during the drying process, and it is well known that fruits such as apples experience significant structural changes during drying. Fractional calculus is a tool for mathematically representing the anomalous diffusion of solutes whose movements can be faster or slower than postulated in Fick's second law due to food structure. In general, with second Fick's law model not good fitting to data are obtained, therefore the prediction capacity of the model is limited. Based on this, anomalous diffusion solution based on fractional calculus was applied. The results showed good fit the data to the model, and also by the time exponent (α) is possible to identify the kind of diffusion process. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Calculations; Drying; Fruits; Anomalous diffusion; Anomalous diffusion model; Diffusion mechanisms; Effective diffusion; Fractional calculus; Relative humidity and temperatures; Structural heterogeneity; Structural variations; Diffusion",2-s2.0-85017552740

The central issue is the characterization of the admissible deformations of piecewise differentiable sections of a fibre bundle Vn+1→R, in the presence of arbitrary non-holonomic constraints. Asynchronous displacements of the corners are explicitly considered. The coordinate-independent representation of the variational equation and the associated concepts of infinitesimal control and absolute time derivative are reviewed. In the resulting algebraic environment, every admissible section is assigned a corresponding abnormality index, identified with the co-rank of a suitable linear map. Sections with vanishing index are called normal. A section is called ordinary if every solution of the variational equation vanishing at the endpoints is tangent to some finite deformation with fixed endpoints. The interplay between abnormality index and ordinariness — in particular the fact that every normal evolution is automatically an ordinary one — is discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Abnormality index; Constrained variational calculus; Finite deformations",,2-s2.0-85019909050

This study is aimed at evaluating the factors affecting the success of semirigid ureterorenoscopy (URS) using the ""decision tree"" method. Materials and Methods: From January 2005 to November 2015, the data of consecutive patients treated for proximal ureteral stone were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 920 patients with proximal ureteral stone treated with semirigid URS were included in the study. All statistically significant attributes were tested using the decision tree method. Results: The model created using decision tree had a sensitivity of 0.993 and an accuracy of 0.857. While URS treatment was successful in 752 patients (81.7%), it was unsuccessful in 168 patients (18.3%). According to the decision tree method, the most important factor affecting the success of URS is whether the stone is impacted to the ureteral wall. The second most important factor affecting treatment was intramural stricture requiring dilatation if the stone is impacted, and the size of the stone if not impacted. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the impacted stone, intramural stricture requiring dilatation and stone size may have a significant effect on the success rate of semirigid URS for proximal ureteral stone. Further studies with population-based and longitudinal design should be conducted to confirm this finding. © 2017 S.

To achieve this goal, some fundamental concepts of b-geometry are utilized and adapted to the general framework of Analytical Dynamics. These concepts refer to the theory of manifolds with boundary and provide a suitable and strong theoretical foundation. First, the boundary is defined within the original configuration manifold of the system by the equality in the unilateral constraint. Then, an appropriate vector bundle is considered, involving only smooth vector fields, even at the boundary. After determining the essential geometric properties (i.e., the metric and the connection) near the boundary, Newton's law of motion is applied. In this way, the equations of motion during the contact phase are derived as a system of ordinary differential equations. These equations possess a special form inside a thin boundary layer. In particular, the essential dynamics of the systems examined is found to be governed by a single second order ordinary differential equation, which is investigated fully. Moreover, a critical comparison of the present formulation with the classical formulations applied to systems with a frictionless contact is performed. Finally, the effect of the dominant parameters on the dynamics during the contact phase and the steps for the application process to mechanical systems are illustrated by two selected examples, referring to contact of a particle and a rigid body with a plane. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical dynamics; Frictionless contact; Manifold with boundary; Unilateral constraint","Calculations; Differential equations; Dynamics; Equations of motion; Geometry; Mechanics; Analytical dynamics; Configuration manifold; Frictionless contacts; Manifold with boundary; Second-order ordinary differential equations; System of ordinary differential equations; Theoretical foundations; Unilateral constraints; Ordinary differential equations",2-s2.0-85021136804

However, little is known regarding use or outcomes associated with MET outside of pediatric-specific practices. Using a national administrative dataset, we sought to characterize utilization patterns of MET as well as assess outcomes associated with MET exposure. Study design We interrogated the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database to identify children under the age of 18 presenting to the emergency department (ED) with any diagnosis of upper urinary tract calculi (UUTC, including renal and ureteral calculi). MET exposure was defined as having a prescription filled for a MET agent within 1 week of the ED encounter. Characteristics of children receiving MET were defined and outcomes compared between children with and without MET exposure. Results Of 1325 children included in the study, 13.2% received MET, including 15.4% of children with a diagnosis of “calculus of the ureter.” MET use increased significantly throughout the study period (p = 0.004), although only 30.4% of children considered potential MET candidates received MET in the final year of the study (2013). Among all patients, receipt of MET was associated with male gender, presence of comorbidity, provider-type (urologist), and year of diagnosis, although among those with a specific diagnosis of “calculus of the ureter,” only year of diagnosis remained a significant factor. Rates of unplanned physician visits and surgical interventions were similar between groups. Children receiving MET were more likely to receive follow-up imaging, although only 46% of children with ureteral calculi had appropriate follow-up imaging within 90 days, regardless of MET exposure. Odds ratios of factors and outcomes associated with MET exposure are shown in the Table. Discussion Although early data support safety and efficacy MET in children, nationwide use in children is low among potential candidates for MET. For children with ureteral calculi, only year of diagnosis was a significant factor associated with MET use. No difference in unplanned physician visits or surgical interventions was noted. Most notable, however, was the low rate of follow-up imaging within 90 days for children presenting acutely with UUTC. Conclusions Use of MET for children with ureteral calculi is increasing, although still fewer than a third of children considered potential candidates receive this treatment. Follow-up imaging is not obtained for many children with ureteral calculi. Future work is needed to standardize management and follow-up protocols for children with acute renal colic.

Obstacle characteristics and treatment were analyzed. Material and methods Patients presenting with an episode of acute submaxillitis between 2009 and 2015 were retrospectively included. All underwent salivary duct imaging and/or sialendoscopy, with pathologic examination if the salivary gland was removed for etiologic diagnosis. For etiological treatment, if the causal lesion could not be treated by isolated sialendoscopy, surgery used a direct approach assisted by sialendoscope. In case of failure of these procedures, submaxillectomy was indicated. Results Twenty-nine patients were included, 28 of whom showed salivary duct abnormality. At least 1 calculus was found in 27 patients; calculi were usually single (n = 20), situated in the mid-third (n = 21), and large (mean 7.7 mm). Ten patients showed stenosis, associated with salivary calculus in 9 cases. Twenty-five patients with salivary duct obstruction underwent sialendoscopy. Isolated sialendoscopy was used in 5 cases, and a combined approach in 13 cases.

As is commonly known, fractional calculus has been incorporated into artificial neural networks, mainly because of its long-term memory and nonlocality. Some researchers have made interesting attempts at fractional neural networks and gained competitive advantages over integer-order neural networks. Therefore, it is naturally makes one ponder how to generalize the first-order Hopfield neural networks to the fractional-order ones, and how to implement FHNN by means of fractional calculus. We propose to introduce a novel mathematical method: Fractional calculus to implement FHNN. First, we implement fractor in the form of an analog circuit. Second, we implement FHNN by utilizing fractor and the fractional steepest descent approach, construct its Lyapunov function, and further analyze its attractors. Third, we perform experiments to analyze the stability and convergence of FHNN, and further discuss its applications to the defense against chip cloning attacks for anticounterfeiting. The main contribution of our work is to propose FHNN in the form of an analog circuit by utilizing a fractor and the fractional steepest descent approach, construct its Lyapunov function, prove its Lyapunov stability, analyze its attractors, and apply FHNN to the defense against chip cloning attacks for anticounterfeiting. A significant advantage of FHNN is that its attractors essentially relate to the neuron's fractional order.

With a growing variety of activation patterns considered in real-Time systems, some of them capture arbitrary activation patterns. As a consequence, the existing scheduling approaches in mixed-criticality systems (MCs), which assume the sporadic tasks with implicit deadlines, have sometimes become inapplicable or are ineffective. In this paper, we extend the sporadically activated task model to the arbitrarily activated task model in MCs with the preemptive fixed-Task-priority schedule. By using the event arrival curve to model task activations, we present the necessary and sufficient schedulability tests that are based on the well-established results from Real-Time Calculus. We propose to use the busy-window analysis to do the sufficient test because it has been shown to be tighter than the sufficient test of using Real-Time Calculus. According to our experimental results, for sporadic task sets, our proposed test can achieve the same performance as the state-of-The-Art schedulability test.

Hence each type of crystals may have similar defects due to the same failure mechanism originated from the same microstructure, if they are under the same loading conditions. In this work, we propose a multiscale crystal defect dynamics (MCDD) model that models defects by considering its intrinsic microstructure derived from the microstructure or material genome of the original perfect crystal. The main novelties of present work are: (1) the discrete exterior calculus and algebraic topology theory are used to construct a scale-up (coarse-grained) dual lattice model for crystal defects, which may represent all possible defect modes inside a crystal; (2) a higher order Cauchy–Born rule (up to the fourth order) is adopted to construct atomistic-informed constitutive relations for various defect process zones, and (3) an hierarchical strain gradient theory based finite element formulation is developed to support an hierarchical multiscale cohesive (process) zone model for various defects in a unified formulation. The efficiency of MCDD computational algorithm allows us to simulate dynamic defect evolution at large scale while taking into account atomistic interaction. The MCDD model has been validated by comparing of the results of MCDD simulations with that of molecular dynamics (MD) in the cases of nanoindentation and uniaxial tension. Numerical simulations have shown that MCDD model can predict dislocation nucleation induced instability and inelastic deformation, and thus it may provide an alternative solution to study crystal plasticity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crystal plasticity; Defect mechanics; Discrete exterior calculus; Dislocation; High-order Cauchy–Born rules; Multiscale simulation; Void","Calculations; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Crystal microstructure; Defects; Dislocations (crystals); Finite element method; Lattice theory; Microstructure; Molecular dynamics; Topology; Born rule; Crystal plasticity; Discrete exterior calculus; Multi-scale simulation; Void; Crystal defects",2-s2.0-85024403104

Research demonstrates that an EV equipped with a multi-speed transmission can provide the desired power in more than one way, and therefore, reduce the energy consumption of the vehicle through gear-shifting. However, gear-shifting should be as swift and seamless as possible. We investigate the gear-shifting of a multi-speed transmission for EVs with optimum performance under functional constraints. After deriving the kinematics of the transmission, calculus of variations is employed to find the schedules of the angular velocities during gear-shifting for a swift, seamless operation, which leads to the optimal trajectory in the space of transmission angular velocities. To this end, we resort to polynomial transition functions in the time-domain.

Furthermore, the distribution of the critical points is crucial for geometry processing and shape analysis; e.g., for controlling the number of patches in quadrilateral remeshing and the number of nodes of Reeb graphs and Morse–Smale complexes. In this context, we address the design of a smooth function, whose maxima, minima, and saddles are selected by the user or imported from a template (e.g., Laplacian eigenfunctions, diffusion maps). In this way, we support the selection of the saddles of the resulting function and not only its extrema, which is one of the main limitations of previous work. Then, we discuss the meshless approximation of an input scalar function by preserving its persistent critical points and its local behaviour, as encoded by the spatial distribution and shape of the level-sets. Both problems are addressed by computing an implicit approximation with radial basis functions, which is independent of the discretisation of differential operators and of assumptions on the sampling of the input domain. This approximation allows us to introduce a meshless iso-contouring and classification of the critical points, which are characterised in terms of the differential properties of the meshless approximation and of the geometry of the input surface, as encoded by its first and second fundamental form. Furthermore, the computation is performed at an arbitrary resolution by locally refining the input surface and by applying differential calculus to the meshless approximation.

In this paper, we are concerned with a fundamental problem of encoding-decoding of information granules. The essence of the problem is outlined as follows: Given a finite collection of granular data X1, X2,...,XN (sets, fuzzy sets, etc.), construct an optimal codebook composed of information granules A1, A2,..., Ac, where typically c &lt;&lt; N, so that any Xk represented in terms of Ai's and then decoded (reconstructed) with the help of this codebook leads to the lowest decoding error. A fundamental result is established, which states that in the proposed encoders and decoders, when encoding-decoding error is present, the information granule coming as a result of decoding is of a higher type than the original information granules (say, if Xk is information granule of type-1, then its decoded version becomes information granule of type-2). It would be beneficial to note that as the encoding-decoding process is not lossless (in general, with an exception of a few special cases), the lossy nature of the method is emphasized by the emergence of information granules of higher type (in comparison with the original data being processed). For instance, when realizing encoding-decoding of numeric data (viz., information granules of type-0), the losses occur and they are quantified in terms of intervals, fuzzy sets, probabilities, rough sets, etc., where, in fact, the result becomes an information granule of type-1. In light of the nature of the constructed result when Xk is an interval or a fuzzy set, an optimized performance index engages a distance between the bounds of the interval-valued membership function. We develop decoding and encoding mechanisms by engaging the theory of possibility and fuzzy relational calculus and show that the decoded information granule is either a granular interval or interval-valued fuzzy set. The optimization mechanism is realized with the aid of the particle swarm optimization (PSO). A series of experiments are reported with intent to illustrate the details of the encoding-decoding mechanisms and show that the PSO algorithm can efficiently optimize the granular codebook. © 2017 IEEE.","Encoding and decoding; granular computing; higher type information granules; information granule; particle swarm optimization (PSO); reconstruction error; representation and reconstruction","C (programming language); Calculations; Computation theory; Decoding; Encoding (symbols); Errors; Fuzzy sets; Granular computing; Granulation; Membership functions; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Particles (particulate matter); Signal encoding; Encoders and decoders; Encoding and decoding; Encoding mechanism; Encoding-decoding; Interval-valued fuzzy sets; Optimized performance; Reconstruction error; Relational calculus; Information granules",2-s2.0-85014677246

In order to discretize the governing equations along with different combinations of boundary conditions, the generalized differential quadrature method is used and then a direct iterative method (Picard) is employed to solve the nonlinear system of equations. The presented results reveal that when thickness of the nanoplate increases, especially at high orientation and anisotropicity, ignoring shear deformation could cause some noticeable errors in the response of nonlinear bending, large amplitude vibration and postbuckling of nanoplates. Moreover, although orientation has a very direct effect on large amplitude vibration of nanoplates, it is observed that at a specific amplitude, the natural frequencies are independent from the orientation.

Imperfect interfaces are modeled according to the Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic law. State space differential equations are derived using differential equations of motion as well as stress-displacement relations. For sandwich cylindrical shell with simply supported boundary conditions, these equations are solved analytically by using Fourier series expansion along the axial and circumferential direction.

This alternative is obtained by a mathematical manipulation of a rational function in a similar way to the reported for the synthesis of the variable-state filters. The advantage of the proposed implementation is the requirement of only simple analog design blocks, such as integrators (of integer order), differential amplifiers and two-input adder amplifiers. Most important, contrarily to other reported solutions, the proposed realization can be fulfilled using commercially available resistors and capacitors, with a reduced number of calculations, and without negative impedance converters or inductors.

Both the initial value problem and the non-homogeneous forcing problem (with zero initial data) are considered. The solution operator E(t) for the initial value problem can be written as a Dunford-Taylor integral involving the Mittag-Leffler function e,1 and the resolvent of the underlying (non-fractional) spatial operator over an appropriate integration path in the complex plane. Here α denotes the order of the fractional time derivative. The solution for the non-homogeneous problem can be written as a convolution involving an operator W(t) and the forcing function F(t). We develop and analyze semi-discrete methods based on finite element approximation to the underlying (non-fractional) spatial operator in terms of analogous Dunford-Taylor integrals applied to the discrete operator. The space error is of optimal order up to a logarithm of 1 h . The fully discrete method for the initial value problem is developed from the semi-discrete approximation by applying a sinc quadrature technique to approximate the Dunford-Taylor integral of the discrete operator and is free of any time stepping. The sinc quadrature of step size k involves k-2 nodes and results in an additional O(exp(-ck)) error. To approximate the convolution appearing in the semi-discrete approximation to the non-homogeneous problem, we apply a pseudo-midpoint quadrature. This involves the average of Wh(s), (the semi-discrete approximation to W(s)) over the quadrature interval. This average can also be written as a Dunford-Taylor integral.We first analyze the error between this quadrature and the semi-discrete approximation. To develop a fully discrete method, we then introduce sinc quadrature approximations to the Dunford-Taylor integrals for computing the averages.We show that for a refined grid in time with a mesh of O(Nlog(N)) intervals, the error between the semi-discrete and fully discrete approximation is O(N-2 + log(N) exp(-ck )). We also report the results of numerical experiments that are in agreement with the theoretical error estimates. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Caputo Fractional Derivative; Dunford-Taylor; Finite Element Method; Fractional Diffusion; Sinc Quadrature; Time Dependent Problem","Convolution; Differential equations; Differentiation (calculus); Errors; Initial value problems; Partial differential equations; Caputo fractional derivatives; Dunford-Taylor; Fractional diffusion; Sinc quadrature; Time-dependent problem; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85031023756

However, previous studies only examine changes occurring in patients 30–240 min after ESWL. The main aim of the present study was to determine whether oxidative stress may modulate the hemostatic activity of plasma in patients with nephrolithiasis before ESWL and the day after treatment ESWL. This will be performed by measuring selected parameters of hemostasis in these patients, both before ESWL and the following day, and assessing the level of oxidative damage to plasma proteins in these patients by measuring two biomarkers. Methods: Twelve patients with nephrolithiasis and 10 healthy participants were included. The following parameters of hemostasis were measured: the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and thrombin time (TT) of plasma, the level of fibrinogen, the level of D-dimer and blood platelet count. In addition, two selected biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured: protein carbonylation level and the number of protein thiol groups. Results: No difference was observed between patients with nephrolithiasis before and after ESWL and healthy controls with regard to PT, TT or APTT. Fibrinogen concentration and blood platelet count were lower in the nephrolithiasis patients in the period after ESWL than before ESWL. The nephrolithiasis patients demonstrated elevated D-dimer concentration after ESWL. However, although oxidative damage was observed in the plasma proteins in the nephrolithiasis patients, this was not influenced by ESWL. Conclusion: Oxidative stress may induce changes of hemostasis in patients with nephrolithiasis, both before and after ESWL. In addition, changes of hemostasis parameters such as fibrinogen, blood platelet count and D-dimer level can be observed in these patients, especially after ESWL, and this may suggest that ESWL modulates hemostasis. By having a better understanding of the influence of ESWL on hemostasis, this could lead to modifying patient care for those patients at increased risk of bleeding. © 2017 Woźniak et al.

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature review was performed to identify articles published between 1995 and July 2016 that reported data on bilateral single-session endoscopic surgery for renal stones. Articles were separated into the following categories: bilateral PCNL, bilateral FURS and bilateral PCNL with contralateral FURS. We used a narrative synthesis for the analyses of the studies. EVIDENCE SYNTESIS: Five reports of bilateral FURS were identified in the literature search. These studies included a total of 218 patients that underwent bilateral FURS for renal stones. The primary SFR ranged from 64% to 92.8%. Postoperative complications were mostly described as minor complications; one major complication (0.5%) (grade V) was reported. Thirteen reports of bilateral PCNL were identified. These case studies included a total of 729 patients undergoing bilateral PCNL for renal stones. The primary SFR ranged from 24% to 100%. In all the studies a total of 29 (4%) major complications were described: 28 of them grade III while one was grade IV. One single study of bilateral PCNL with contralateral FURS for renal stones was identified. This report included 26 patients and the primary SFR was 92.3%. Two major complications (7.7%) (Grade III) were described. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral single-session endoscopic procedures for bilateral renal stones are effective and safe. It should be considered a viable treatment option in carefully selected patients, performed by experienced urologists in high-volume centers. Key to success is the proper selection of patients and extending surgery on the second side only when the first side has been uneventful. © 2017 Edizioni Minerva Medica.","Kidney calculi; Nephrostomy; Percutaneous; Ureteroscopy","creatinine; endoscopic surgery; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; fluoroscopy; guide wire; human; kidney function; length of stay; nephrolithiasis; operation duration; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; postoperative complication; Review; safety; shock wave lithotripter; stent; systematic review; transfusion; ureter catheter; ureter obstruction; ureteroscopy",2-s2.0-85026380578

To this, the Gurtin–Murdoch surface elasticity theory in combination with the modified couple stress theory is employed to capture the simultaneous effects of surface energy and microstructure size phenomenon. Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam models considering the von Kármán geometric nonlinearity are adopted. The material properties of the bulk and surface of the FG beam are assumed to be changed continuously through the thickness according to a power law scheme and Mori–Tanaka homogenization technique. The geometrically nonlinear size–dependent governing equations and corresponding nonclassical boundary conditions are exactly obtained through Hamilton's principle. The generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM) is employed to discretize the nonlinear nonclassical governing differential equations and the nonclassical boundary conditions for various end supports. A good agreement between the results of the present model and those available in the literature is obtained.

Although its efficacy and safety are well known, the literature about major complications is still poor. This study highlighted some cases of life-Threatening complications after semi-rigid ureteroscopy (s-URS) or flexible ureteroscopy (f-URS). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Experienced endourologists (more than 75 cases/year in the last 3 years) we enrolled, and a survey was performed asking to review their series and report the cases encumbered by major complications (Clavien- Dindo IIIb-IV grade). A literature search was also conducted in the Medline (PubMed) and Cochrane Libraries databases in July, 2016 to identify all studies reporting the presence of major complications in patients underwent URS procedures. A PubMed search was performed using the following key words in combination: ""kidney injury,"" ""ureteroscopy,"" ""nephrectomy,"" ""life-Threatening,"" ""urinary stones,"" ""complications."" EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eleven urologists reported on 12 major complications (4 after s-URS, 8 after f-URS). Eight patients developed a kidney injury, 1 an arteriovenous fistula, 2 a ureter avulsion and 1 acute sepsis. Six patients underwent open nephrectomy, two surgical repair, one open pyeloplasty, one coil artery embolization and two superselective artery embolization. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines and clinical practice give useful recommendations about intraoperative safety and prevention of life-Threatening events. The careful postoperative observation and the surgical active treatment of this complications play a key role in reducing morbidity, kidney loss and mortality.

The FG-CNTRC sandwich beam consists of two FG-CNTRC face sheets and homogenous core subjected to longitudinal magnetic field. In the FG-CNTRC face sheets, carbon nanotubes are disseminated in different patterns as uniform distribution, FG-X, FG-V, and FG-O. Based on von Kármán geometric nonlinearity, the nonlinear governing equations are derived by the Hamilton's principle. Accuracy and convergence of this study are validated by comparing the numerical results with those found in literature. Various parameters effects are examined on the nonlinear 1st frequency of the sandwich beam. The results reveal that composition of the CNTRC face sheets and homogenous core in sandwich beam can be achieved remarkable stiffness in comparison to only CNTRC beam or only homogenous beam. For achieving the highest stiffness of FG-CNTRC sandwich beam, the value of thickness ratio is obtained about 0.34 and 0.27 in the presence and absence of Pasternak foundation, respectively. Moreover, the linear and nonlinear 1st frequencies increase with an increase in the magnetic field for all of CNT distribution types of sandwich beam and different boundary conditions whereas the frequency ratio decreases.

Development of materials and cell culture platforms that improve differentiation of either autologous or allogenic stem cell sources into specific lineages would enhance clinical utilization of MCSs. In this study, nanoscale amyloid fibrils were evaluated as substrate materials to encourage viability, proliferation, multipotency, and differentiation of MSCs. Fibrils assembled from the proteins lysozyme or β-lactoglobulin, with and without chitosan coatings, were deposited on planar mica surfaces. MSCs were cultured and differentiated on fibril-covered surfaces, as well as on unstructured controls and tissue culture plastic. Expression of CD44 and CD90 proteins indicated that multipotency was maintained for all fibrils, and osteogenic differentiation was similarly comparable among all tested materials. MSCs grown for 7 days on fibril-covered surfaces favored multicellular spheroid formation and demonstrated a > 75% increase in adipogenesis compared to tissue culture plastic controls, although this benefit could only be achieved if MSCs were transferred to TCP for the final differentiation step. The largest spheroids and greatest tendency to undergo adipogenesis was evidenced among MSCs grown on fibrils coated with the positively-charged polysaccharide chitosan, suggesting that spheroid formation is prompted by both topography and cell-surface interactivity and that there is a connection between multicellular spheroid formation and adipogenesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adipogenesis; Amyloid fibril; Chitosan; Differentiation; Mesenchymal stem cells; Osteogenesis","Cell membranes; Cells; Chitin; Chitosan; Cytology; Differentiation (calculus); Flowcharting; Glycoproteins; Mica; Plastic coatings; Proteins; Silicate minerals; Stem cells; Tissue; Tissue culture; Adipogenesis; Amyloid fibril; Mesenchymal stem cell; Multicellular spheroid; Osteogenesis; Osteogenic differentiation; Polysaccharide chitosan; Tissue culture plastics; Cell culture",2-s2.0-85019198269

Study quality was assessed by Jadad and Newcastle-Ottawa Scales. Standard mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidential intervals (95% CIs) were pooled for meta-analysis. In addition, data was evaluated the quality of the body of evidence by means of grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE).RESULTS: Data from 4 studies (231 PCNL, 212 RIRS cases) were analyzed. There was no significant difference in operation time (SMD: 1.39; 95% CIs: -0.049 to 2.82; P = .058), overall stone-free rate (OR: 3.72; 95% CIs: 0.55-25.22; P = .18), or complication rate (OR: 1.92; 95% CIs: 0.90-4.07; P = .091). PCNL cases had longer hospital stays (SMD: 1.22; 95% CIs: 0.95-1.50; P < .001), but showed a higher stone-free rate for stones greater than 20 mm (OR: 6.38; 95% CIs: 1.83-22.22; P = .004). For stones less than 20 mm, however, no significant difference between PCNL and RIRS was found (OR: 0.92; 95% CIs: 0.33-2.55; P = .87). The quality of evidence based on the GRADE system was low.CONCLUSION: Results of our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that, for the treatment of larger kidney stones (>20 mm) in pediatric patients, PCNL is a better option due to its higher stone-free rate, although RIRS may be associated with shorter hospital stays. A large-scale clinical trial is necessary to validate our findings.",,"child; human; kidney; Kidney Calculi; meta analysis; percutaneous nephrostomy; procedures; treatment outcome; urologic surgery; Child; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Calculi; Nephrostomy, Percutaneous; Treatment Outcome; Urologic Surgical Procedures",2-s2.0-85032625365

As price processes, we consider the class of quasi-left-continuous semimartingales, i.e., semimartingales that do not jump at predictable stopping times. We focus on the condition of no unbounded profit with bounded risk (called NUPBR), also known in the literature as no arbitrage of the first kind. The first principal result describes all the pairs of quasi-left-continuous market models and random times for which the resulting stopped model fulfils NUPBR. Furthermore, for a subclass of quasi-left-continuous local martingales, we construct explicitly martingale deflators, i.e., strictly positive local martingales whose product with the price process stopped at a random time is a local martingale. The second principal result characterises the random times that preserve NUPBR under stopping for any quasi-left-continuous model.

In addition to the morbidity of the acute event, stone disease often becomes a lifelong problem that requires preventative therapy to diminish ongoing morbidity. Across the majority of stone types, increased fluid intake and targeted dietary modifications are mainstays of therapy. Specific dietary interventions associated with reduced calcium stone risk include adequate dietary calcium intake and restriction of sodium, protein, and oxalate intake, among others. Pharmaceutical therapy may be required if lifestyle changes are insufficient to minimize risk of stone recurrence, and must be targeted to the specific metabolic abnormalities portending risk for a given patient. Therapeutic options for idiopathic calcium stone disease include thiazides, citrate salts, and uric acid–lowering agents. Alkali salts are also the treatment of choice for uric acid stone disease. Management of struvite stone disease is largely surgical, but acetohydroxamic acid is a proven second line therapy. Cystinuria requires lifestyle modifications and may call for thiol-binding agents. Significant heterogeneity of the clinical population with stone disease has previously limited opportunities for large randomized controlled trials.

Risk factors have been insufficiently studied and explanatory studies date back up to 30 years. It remains unclear, whether improved treatment options also influenced risk factors for these complications. Objectives: Identifying risk factors for gallstones and kidney stones in IBD patients. Methods: Using data from the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort Study we assessed associations of diseases characteristics with gallstones and kidney stones in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Out of 2323 IBD patients, 104 (7.8%) Crohn’s disease (CD) and 38 (3.8%) ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were diagnosed with gallstones. Significant risk factors for gallstones were diagnosis of CD, age at diagnosis, disease activity and duration, NSAID intake, extra-intestinal manifestations and intestinal surgery. Kidney stones were described in 61 (4.6%) CD and 30 (3.0%) UC patients. Male gender, disease activity, intestinal surgery, NSAID usage and reduced physical activity were significant risk factors. Hospitalization was associated with gallstones and kidney stones. The presence of gallstones increased the risk for kidney stones (OR 4.87, p<0.001).

It is a corollary of that principle that quantities having no extent in any of those dimensions (“dimensionless quantities”) will not be distinguishable as different kinds through dimensional analysis alone, and the formality of quantity calculus will be of no help in preventing mistakes where different kinds of dimensionless quantities are confused. This corollary has led to controversies involving abuse of the unit hertz and elimination of radians and steradians as being equivalent to the number 1. In addition, official rejection of the use of so-called counting units in conjunction with accepted units has been repeatedly criticized and is often ignored. The proposed resolution is to extend quantity calculus to discern different kinds of dimensionless quantities as well as it currently discerns different kinds of dimensional quantities. The extended system provides a formal interpretation of commonly-used workarounds in terms that are compatible with SI.

Optical spectroscopic approaches have emerged as promising alternatives owing to their wealth of molecular information and lack of sample preparation requirements. In the present study, using multispectral fluorescence imaging, we have demonstrated that dental caries and calculus can be objectively identified on extracted tooth. Spectral differences among control, carious and calculus conditions were attributed to the porphyrin pigment content, which is a byproduct of bacterial metabolism. Spectral maps generated using different porphyrin bands offer important clues to the spread of bacterial infection. Statistically significant differences utilizing fluorescence intensity ratios were observed among three groups. In contrast to laser induced fluorescence, these methods can provide information about exact spread of the infection and may aid in long term dental monitoring. Successful adoption of this approach for routine clinical usage can assist dentists in implementing timely remedial measures. (Figure presented.). © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methods The Household Component Emergency Room Visits File was obtained from 1996 through 2014 for the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative survey of US households. Percentage of visits associated with various imaging modalities was computed annually, stratified by respondents’ self-reported primary condition during the visit. Modality characteristics were assessed for conditions most frequently imaged in 1996 or 2014. Results For most conditions, use of advanced imaging (defined by Medical Expenditure Panel Survey as CT or MRI) in the ED increased significantly (P <.001). The largest growth occurred for urinary calculus (from 0% to 48.5%) and headache (from 17.5% to 33.3%), which were the most commonly imaged conditions by CT or MRI in 2014. For ultrasound, the most commonly imaged condition was pregnancy in 1996 (32.9%) and 2014 (44.5%). No other condition was associated with ultrasound in >20% of visits. For radiography, the most commonly imaged conditions were extremity wounds and fractures in 1996 (range 84.5%-90.2%) and 2014 (range 93.4%-93.9%). Use of radiography decreased for urinary calculus from 67.4% to 24.2% (P <.001). Conclusion For many conditions, ED utilization of advanced imaging increased significantly, though growth was variable across conditions. In certain scenarios, advanced ED imaging is adding to, rather than replacing, other modalities. Ultrasound and radiography utilization was overall unchanged.

Fetuin levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Serum and urine fetuin-A levels in the two groups were compared. Results: The median (range) 24-h urine fetuin-A value in Group A was 11.9 (1.12-221) mg/day and in Group B was 37.7 (1.28-125) mg/day.

Previous results concerning this problem manage to capture fragments of intuitionistic logic, but in many essential cases structural constraints were violated during normal form construction resulting in a classical proof. The heart of the CERES method is the resolution calculus, which ignores the structural constraints of the well known intuitionistic sequent calculi. We propose, as a method of avoiding the structural violations, the generalization of resolution from the resolving of clauses to the resolving of cut-free proofs, in other words, what we call proof resolution. The result of proof resolution is a cut-free proof rather than a clause. Note that resolution on ground clauses is essentially atomic cut, thus using proof resolution to construct cut-free proofs one would need to join the two proofs together and remove the atoms which where resolved. To efficiently perform this joining (and guarantee that the resulting cut-free proof is intuitionistic) we develop the concept of proof subsumption (similar to clause subsumption) and indexed resolution, a refinement indexing atoms by their corresponding positions in the cut formula. Proof subsumption serves as a tool to prove the completeness of the new method CERES-i, and indexed resolution provides an efficient strategy for the joining of two proofs which is in general a nondeterministic search.

A total of 40 integrated urinary tract stones with a diameter of >0.8 cm were removed from the patients. All of the stones were cut in half perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis. Samples were selected from nuclear, internal and external layers of each stone. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was adopted for qualitative and quantitative analysis of all of the fragments and compositional differences among nuclear, internal and external layers of various types of stone were subsequently investigated. A total of 25 cases of calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones and 10 cases of calcium phosphate (CaP) stones were identified to be mixed stones, while 5 uric acid (UA) calculi were pure stones (purity, >95%). In addition, the contents of CaOx and carbapatite (CA.AP) crystals in various layers of the mixed stones were found to be variable. In CaOx stones, the content of CA.AP in nuclear layers was significantly higher than that of the outer layers (32.0 vs. 6.8%; P<0.05), while the content of CaOx was lower in the inner than in the outer layers (57.6 vs. 86.6%; P<0.05). In CaP stones, the content of CA.AP in the nuclear layers was higher than that in the outer layers (74.0 vs. 47.3%; P<0.05), while the content of CaOx was lower in the inner than in the outer layers (7.0 vs. 40.0%; P<0.05). The UA stones showed no significant differences in their composition among different layers. In conclusion, FT-IR analysis of various layers of human upper urinary tract stones revealed that CaOx and CaP stones showed differences in composition between their core and surface, while all of the UA calculi were pure stones. The composition showed a marked variation among different layers of the stones, indicating that metabolism has an important role in different phases of the evolution of stones. The present study provided novel insight into the pathogenesis of urinary tract stones and may contribute to their prevention and treatment. © 2017, (publisher Name).

As it is well-known RC concrete footing are designed adopting uniform contact pressures on the substrate and assuming a strut and tie model in deep members and a cantilever beam or slab model in flexible members. Deep and flexible members are distinguished in literature only based on the tangent of the angle expressed as the ratio between the depth and the shear span of the footing. In this paper, several subgrade contact pressures distribution for column footings (rigid or soft soils) were considered in developing a mechanical model able to derive the complete load displacement curves of RC deep and flexible footing in compression. The objective of the research was the more appropriate choice of the calculus model to predict the compressive response of single column footing. In particular, if the angle, expressed as the ratio between the depth and the shear span of the footing, is higher than 45° the strut and tie model was suggested for best prediction, while, if the angle is lower than 45°, the beam or the slab models with punching shear were adopted. For both cases simplified loading soil profiles corresponding to rigid, flexible or winker model were adopted. Effects of main parameters such as geometry (depth, width) and shape of footing (single or shaped), the mechanical ratio of longitudinal reinforcement and type of soil are investigated both numerically and analytically. Numerical results and available experimental results were utilized to verify the model. The comparison between analytical and numerical results allows one to validate the proposed model and to define the range of application of the strut and tie or beam model depending on the footing geometry, the mechanical ratio of longitudinal reinforcement and type of soil. Finally, the comparison between analytical and experimental results available in the literature gives a further confirmation on the reliability of the proposed model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beam model; Elastic soil; Footing; Strut and tie model; Winkler model","Calculations; Forecasting; Reinforcement; Beam model; Elastic soils; Footing; Strut-and-tie model; Winkler model; Soils; column; compression; design; displacement; footing; model test; pressure effect; reinforced concrete; reliability analysis; soil-structure interaction; structural response",2-s2.0-85028934270

Herein, we report a phase 2, randomized trial to assess efficacy of direct instillation of intraureteral lidocaine in reducing postoperative pain and ureteral stent symptoms. Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blinded trial of patients undergoing elective ureteroscopy for ureteral calculi. Patients were randomized to direct instillation of 2% lidocaine plus bicarbonate, or to normal saline as control. The primary outcome of interest was early postoperative pain scores. Patients completed10-point visual analog pain scale at one-hour, two-hour, four-hour, 24-hours, four-and seven-day time points. Other outcome measurements collected included a medication diary and voiding questionnaire. Results: A total of 41 patients were randomized in the study. Mean flank pain scores at one hour were 2.2 (±2.9) vs.1.9 (±2.4) in the intervention and placebo group, respectively (p=0.84). There was no significant difference at any time point between the intervention and placebo groups in patient-reported pain scores. Patients reported lower dysuria scores at all time points in the lidocaine group, however, none reached statistical significance. There was no difference in complication rates or adverse effects between groups.

There are many techniques describing this crucial first step in PCNL including the bull's eye technique, triangulation technique, free-hand technique, and gradual descensus technique. We describe a novel puncture guide to assist accurate percutaneous needle placement during bull's eye technique. Methods: The mini access guide (MAG) stabilizes the initial puncture needle by mounting it on an adjustable multidirectional carrier fixed to the patient's skin, which aids in achieving the 'bull's eye' puncture. It also avoids a direct fluoroscopic exposure of the urologist's hand during the puncture. Sixty consecutive patients with solitary renal calculus were randomized to traditional hand versus MAG puncture during bull's eye technique of puncture and the fluoroscopy time was assessed. Results: The median fluoroscopy screening time for traditional free-hand bull's eye and MAG-guided bull's eye puncture (fluoroscopic screening time for puncture) was 55 versus 21 s (P = 0.001) and the median time to puncture was 80 versus 55 s (P = 0.052), respectively. Novice residents also learned puncture technique faster with MAG on simulator. Conclusion: The MAG is a simple, portable, cheap, and novel assistant to achieve successful PCNL puncture. It would be of great help for novices to establish access during their learning phase of PCNL.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the parameters that may influence ESWL final results, developing a classification for better patient's selection and outcome optimization. METHODS: 270 patients with renal or ureteral stones were retrospectively reviewed after ESWL treatment, recording both clinical parameters (age, sex, location, laterality, body mass index [BMI]), and CT-Scan parameters (stone size and volume, skin-to-stone distance (SSD), mean and maximal stone density). Cutoff values were determined for each parameter based upon ROC curves, and final score (ESWL score) was calculated based on the number of parameters lower than the cutoff values. RESULTS: Of the 270 patients treated, 186 (68.8%) were considered as ESWL success, without significant differences between success and failure group. Parameters that showed significant difference after multivariate analysis were: size (cut off: 9.3 mm), volume (237.2 mm3), mean density (951 UH), SSD (133 mm) and BMI (26.9 kg/m2).

Recent technological improvements have allowed a reduction in dose with the emergence of low-dose CTKUB (LD-CTKUB) techniques. The present meta-analysis aims to determine the diagnostic accuracy of LD-CTKUB in the diagnosis of clinically significant uroliths. A systematic review was performed using nine electronic databases from their dates of inception to May 2016. Inclusion criteria included studies reporting comparative outcomes using LD-CTKUB with a dose less than 3 millisieverts compared to an imaging gold standard or clinical and surgical evaluation. The primary endpoint was detection of a urolith ≥3 mm where specified and any urolith when size was unspecified. Twelve studies were identified according to selection criteria, involving 1250 patients. LD-CTKUB demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 93.1% (95%CI 91.5–94.4), specificity of 96.6% (95%CI 95.1–97.7%), positive likelihood ratio of 19.9 (95%CI 12.7–31.2), negative likelihood ratio of 0.05 (95%CI 0.02–0.10) and AUC of 0.9877 in the detection of clinically significant uroliths. Although 86 alternative diagnoses were noted across seven studies, none assessed the accuracy of LD-CTKUB in their detection. The majority of newer studies report an average radiation dose from 1 to 1.5 millisieverts. This study demonstrates a high sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value in the detection of uroliths, however, its accuracy in the detection of alternative diagnoses is unknown. Therefore, we recommend using LD-CTKUB when the pre-test probability of stone disease is significantly higher than the pre-test probability of alternative diagnoses, such as follow-up of known calculi.

Materials and Methods All RIRS procedures between 2009 and 2015 for 10- to 20-mm renal calculi performed by the same 2 experienced urologists were eligible. All procedures were performed using a highly standardized step-by-step RIRS technique. This technique was modified by the ultralow radiation exposure RIRS protocol; herein, as much as possible of the standardized steps were performed without radiation control targeting ultralow fluoroscopy usage. Primary end points were fluoroscopy time and dose area product. Secondary end points were stone-free rate (SFR) and intraoperative complications according to Satava classification. End points were evaluated using scatter plots and linear regression model. Results Overall, 174 procedures were assessed. Over the study period, fluoroscopy time and dose area product could be reduced from 167.7 s/318.4 cGy/cm2 in 2009 to 7.4 s/6.4 cGy/cm2 in 2015 (P &lt;.001).

One idea of how to achieve these goals has been the reduction in hospital-related complications, including infection and surgical complications, among others. In the United States, policy makers recently adopted the ‘Hospital Compare’ program as a way to encourage consumers and improve hospitals. This article evaluates the effectiveness of this policy. Study design This article uses an observed cohort study of most US hospitals across four different indices. Methods Each observed hospital was evaluated at least once each year over a span of three years for rates of hospital-acquired infections and compared to what reasonably ought to have been the rate based on hospital factors. Hospitals poorly rated in the base year were compared against remaining institutions for their ability to meet national benchmarks in future years. Results Despite government attempts to show individuals the comparative quality of hospitals, there is little evidence that these informed consumer choices were substantially enough to motivate changes. Across most metrics used, poorly rated hospitals were unlikely to improve at rates that the designers of Hospital Compare would have envisioned. Conclusions Although it is possible that the effects could shift over time, it is unlikely that the Hospital Compare program properly understood and anticipated patient calculus for choosing a hospital. Technical complexity and other issues further undermined the program. Despite this, the goal of reducing complications is worthwhile, but a different strategy should be pursued. © 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health","Asymmetric information; Hospital-acquired infection; Hospitals; PPACA",,2-s2.0-85027461047

This is in contrast to other minimally invasive procedures like percutanous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), which have higher rates of success. Therefore, the present study sought to identify predictors of success after one session of ESWL. Patients and methods A prospective study including 100 children with renal stone burden <2 cm who underwent ESWL at the present institution. The success rate after the first session was analyzed, and the predictors of success were investigated. The success of ESWL monotherapy was defined by absence of any residual fragments after 3 months, on non-contrast spiral computerized tomography (NCCT) scan, without need of any additional intervention. Results Between January 2013 and October 2015, 100 children were treated with a Dornier Gemini lithotripter at the present institution. The mean patients age and stone size were 6 years (range: 1.8–14) and 13.1 mm (range: 6–20), respectively. After one session, 47% of patients showed complete clearance 3 months postoperative, those patients versus those who required an additional session or auxiliary procedures were younger in age, with smaller stone size and lower density. On multivariate analysis, only patient age was an independent predictor of success (odds ratio (OR) 0.9; P < 0.001). Conclusion Patient's age was an important predictor for response after ESWL monotherapy: not only did children respond better than adults, but age was also an independent predictor within the pediatric group. © 2017 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company","Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; Minimally invasive stone management; Pediatric urolithiasis",,2-s2.0-85018166433

Only one published report has explored its effect on the skeleton. We postulated that the KD impairs skeletal health parameters in patients on the KD. Patients commenced on the KD were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal study, with monitoring of Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived bone parameters including bone mineral content and density (BMD). Areal BMD was converted to bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) where possible. Biochemical parameters, including Vitamin D, and bone turnover markers, including osteocalcin, were assessed. Patients were stratified for level of mobility using the gross motor functional classification system (GMFCS). 29 patients were on the KD for a minimum of 6 months (range 0.5-6.5 years, mean 2.1 years). There was a trend towards a reduction in lumbar spine (LS) BMD Z score of 0.1562 (p = 0.071) per year and 20 patients (68%) had a lower BMD Z score at the end of treatment. While less mobile patients had lower baseline Z scores, the rate of bone loss on the diet was greater in the more mobile patients (0.28 SD loss per year, p = 0.026). Height adjustment of DXA data was possible for 13 patients, with a mean reduction in BMAD Z score of 0.19 SD. Only two patients sustained fractures. Mean urinary calcium-creatinine ratios were elevated (0.77), but only 1 patient developed renal calculi. Children on the KD exhibited differences in skeletal development that may be related to the diet. The changes were independent of height but appear to be exaggerated in patients who are ambulant. Clinicians should be aware of potential skeletal side effects and monitor bone health during KD treatment.

Zdzisław Augustynek devoted a number of works to this issue, and Mariusz Grygianiec offered valuable commentaries. Augustynek tried to specify this notion by means of axiomatic definitions. He presented three sets of specific axioms. They delimit sets of theses, called systems by Augustynek and marked as AS1, AS2, and AS3. Apart from the term genidentity (G), the axioms also contain the following terms: logical identity (I), quasi-simultaneity (R), quasi-collocation (L), and causality (H). They represent binary relations whose field is the set of events S. The axioms also involve symbols of the complements of these relations: genetic difference (G∗), logical difference (I∗), time separation (R∗), space separation (L∗), and the complement of H (H∗). The results obtained by Augustynek and Grygianiec can be supplemented or even corrected in some places. This fact motivated me to analyze systems AS1, AS2, and AS3 once again. The results are presented in two separate articles: Part I (this paper) and Part II (to be published in Filozofia Nauki 25(4) [100]). The first aim of Part I is to present the set-theoretic approach to the analysis of Augustynek's systems. Although the specific axioms themselves are expressed in the language of the algebra of sets, their analysis was conducted by Grygianiec in the classical predicate calculus. The set-theoretic approach facilitates the analysis of the sets of specific axioms. Accordingly, I present the specific axioms of systems AS1, AS2, and AS3 in the language of algebra of sets, illustrating them with Venn diagrams for five sets, expressing the specific axioms of the analyzed systems with the use of the theory of components, showing exemplary sets fulfilling those axioms, and formulating preliminary remarks concerning the relationships among systems AS1, AS2, and AS3. The second aim of Part I is to use the presented method to compare the three systems. The most important stages include formulating and justifying theses concerning: (i) the relationships among systems AS1, AS2, and AS3, (ii) supplementary axioms that cause a mutual equivalence of the axioms when added to systems AS1, AS2, and AS3, and (iii) selected relationships that can be identified on the basis of systems AS1, AS2, and AS3. Next, I correct certain conclusions concerning systems AS1, AS2, and AS3 from Augustynek's and Grygianiec's works, show a method of creating alternative axioms for systems AS1, AS2, and AS3, and suggest methods for further modifications of axioms of these systems. © 2017 Copyright by Filozofia Nauki and Wydawnictwo Naukowe Semper Warszawa.","Algebra of sets; Augustynek; Components; Genidentity; Grygianiec; Identity; Venn diagrams",,2-s2.0-85031004419

The first definition says that every point on the constant function is a local minimum and maximum, as well as a global minimum and maximum. This is not a rational result. On the other hand, the second definition says that the constant function cannot be minimized in an unconstrained problem. It must be treated as a constrained problem where the constant function is the lower boundary of the feasible region. This is a rational result.

Methods: The Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society prospectively collected 1 consecutive year of data from 114 centers worldwide. Patients eligible for inclusion were patients treated with ureteroscopy for ureteral stones. Patient characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes were compared with regard to stone impaction. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore predictive variables for ureteral stone impaction and to analyse the effect of impaction on outcomes. Results: Of the 8543 treated patients, 2650 (31%) had impacted and 5893 (69%) non-impacted stones. The stone-free rate was 87.1% for impacted stones, which is lower compared with 92.7% for non-impacted stones (p < 0.001). Intra-operative complication rates were higher for impacted stones (7.9 versus 3.0%, p < 0.001). Significantly higher ureteral perforation- and avulsion rates were reported in the impacted stone group compared with the non-impacted stone group. No association between stone impaction and post-operative complications could be shown. Female gender, ASA-score >1, prior stone treatment, positive pre-operative urine culture, and larger stones showed to be predictive variables for stone impaction. Conclusions: Ureteroscopic treatment for impacted stones is associated with lower stone-free rates and higher intra-operative complication rates compared with treatment for non-impacted stones. The predictive variables for the presence of stone impaction may contribute to the identification of stone impaction during the diagnostic process. Moreover, identification of stone impaction may aid the selection of the optimal treatment modality. © 2017, The Author(s).","Complications; Impacted stones; Treatment outcomes; Ureter; Ureteroscopy; Urolithiasis",,2-s2.0-85029944504

SAMPLE 30 canine uroliths with pure compositions. PROCEDURES Each urolith was composed of ≥ 70% struvite (n = 10), urate (8), cystine (5), calcium oxalate (4), or brushite (3) as determined by standard laboratory methods performed at the Canadian Veterinary Urolith Centre. Uroliths were suspended in an agar phantom, and DECT was performed at low (80 kV) and high (140 kV) energies. The ability of low- and high-energy CT numbers, DECT number, and DECT ratio to distinguish uroliths on the basis of composition was assessed with multivariate ANOVA. RESULTS No single DECT measure differentiated all urolith types. The DECT ratio differentiated urate uroliths from all other types of uroliths. The DECT and low-energy CT numbers were able to differentiate between 8 and 7 pairs of urolith types, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that DECT was unable to differentiate common types of canine uroliths in an in vitro model; therefore, it is unlikely to be clinically useful for determining urolith composition in vivo. Given that the primary reasons for determining urolith composition in vivo are to predict response to shock wave lithotripsy and develop a treatment plan, future research should focus on the correlation between DECT measurements and urolith fragility rather than urolith composition. © 2017, American Veterinary Medical Association.

We investigate the (un)decidability of subtyping for session types in asynchronously communicating systems. We first devise a core undecidable subtyping relation that is obtained by imposing limitations on the structure of types. Then, as a consequence of this initial undecidability result, we show that (differently from what stated or conjectured in the literature) the three notions of asynchronous subtyping defined so far for session types are all undecidable. Namely, we consider the asynchronous session subtyping by Mostrous and Yoshida for binary sessions, the relation by Chen et al. for binary sessions under the assumption that every message emitted is eventually consumed, and the one by Mostrous et al. for multiparty session types. Finally, by showing that two fragments of the core subtyping relation are decidable, we evince that further restrictions on the structure of types make our core subtyping relation decidable. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Queue machines; Session types; Subtyping; Undecidability","Bins; Computability and decidability; Communicating process; Distributed systems; Multiparty sessions; Session types; Subtyping relation; Subtypings; Type theory; Undecidability; Formal languages",2-s2.0-85026420735

Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify suitable studies until November 2016. We used weighted mean difference to measure operative time and hospital stay, OR to measure stone free rate (SFR), and complication rate. Subgroup analyses were assessed for heterogeneity. Results: Fourteen publications strictly met our eligibility criteria of which 7 were randomized control studies (RCTs) and 7 non-RCTs. Meta-analysis of extractable data showed that LU and PCNL had higher SFR than URS. URS led to a similar hospital stay like that of LU. However, it had a shorter operative time and lower complication rate than LU. When we compared URS with PCNL, we found a shorter hospital stay in the URS group.

Briefly put, partial m-consistency ensures that each base relation of each of the constraints of a qualitative constraint network can define a singleton relation in the corresponding partial closure of that network under weak composition, or in its corresponding partially -consistent subnetwork for short. In particular, partial m-consistency has been shown to play a crucial role in tackling the minimal labeling problem of a qualitative constraint network, which is the problem of finding the strongest implied constraints of that network. In this paper, we propose a stronger local consistency that couples m-consistency with the idea of collectively deleting certain unfeasible base relations by exploiting singleton checks. We then propose an efficient algorithm for enforcing this new consistency that, given a qualitative constraint network, performs fewer constraint checks than the respective algorithm for enforcing partial m-consistency in that network. We formally prove certain properties of our new local consistency, and motivate its usefulness through demonstrative examples and a preliminary experimental evaluation with qualitative constraint networks of Interval Algebra.","Local consistency; Minimal labeling problem; Partial singleton path-consistency; Qualitative constraint network; Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning","Local consistency; Minimal labeling; Path consistency; Qualitative constraints; Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning; Constraint theory",2-s2.0-85030663197

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of multiple access tracts and different sized endoscopic equipment on RPP in a porcine model. Materials and Methods: RPP was measured in one- vs two-tract access, rigid vs flexible nephroscopy, and suction vs no suction. Twenty trials were performed for each condition. An independent samples Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare parameters, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: With one tract, rigid nephroscopy resulted in higher mean pressures (31.35 mm Hg) than flexible nephroscopy (11.1 mm Hg; p < 0.001). The RPP was higher with rigid nephroscopy in one tract (31.35 mm Hg) than when two tracts were present (9.35 mm Hg; p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no difference in pressure during the use of a flexible nephroscope in one (11.1 mm Hg) vs two tracts (10.7 mm Hg; p = 0.63). Use of suction with the rigid nephroscope resulted in significantly lower pressures with one (-1.3 mm Hg) than with two tracts (1.8 mm Hg; p = 0.004). Conclusion: In PCNL, RPP is significantly affected by an additional tract during rigid nephroscopy and suctioning but not when using a flexible nephroscope.

The viscous and relaxation models of acoustics satisfy passivity and have restrictions on not only a few, but all derivatives of the relaxation modulus. These models are described as a system of springs and dampers with positive parameters and belong to the important class of completely monotone systems. It is shown here that the attenuation as a function of frequency for such media has to increase slower than a linear function. Likewise, the phase velocity has to increase monotonically.

An analysis, with the techniques of geometric control, is used first to reduce the set of candidates and then to construct the numerical methods. This leads to a numerical investigation based on indirect methods using the HamPath software. Multiple shooting and homotopy techniques are used to build a synthesis with respect to the bounds of the boundary sets. © 2017 EDP Sciences, SMAI.","Electric car; Geometric optimal control; Shooting and homotopy methods; State constraints","Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Geometry; Hamiltonians; Numerical methods; Electric cars; Geometric optimal control; Hamiltonian systems; Homotopy method; Minimum time control; Multiple shooting; Numerical investigations; State constraints; Electric machine control",2-s2.0-85032196356

Using the notion of no-regret control and least (or low) regret control developed by Lions, we first prove that the least regret control problem associated with the boundary fractional diffusion equation has a unique solution. Then we show that this solution converges to the no-regret control which we characterize by a singular optimality system. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Euler–Lagrange formula; Incomplete data; No-regret control; Optimality system; Time-fractional differential equation",,2-s2.0-84944691442

For any given positive integer k we construct a spike cluster consisting of k spikes which all approach the same nondegenerate local minimum point of the precursor inhomogeneity. We show that this spike cluster can be linearly stable. In particular, we show the existence of spike clusters for spikes located at the vertices of a polygon with or without centre. Further, the cluster without centre is stable for up to three spikes, whereas the cluster with centre is stable for up to six spikes. The main idea underpinning these stable spike clusters is the following: due to the small inhibitor diffusivity the interaction between spikes is repulsive, and the spikes are attracted towards the local minimum point of the precursor inhomogeneity. Combining these two effects can lead to an equilibrium of spike positions within the cluster such that the cluster is linearly stable. © 2017, The Author(s).","35B25; 35B35; 35B40; 92C15",,2-s2.0-85029934272
