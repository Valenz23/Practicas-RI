In the study, participants were asked to drive a simulated vehicle and simultaneously perform a set of secondary tasks with different cognitive complexity levels. We measured changes in eye properties, such as the pupil size, blink rate and fixation time. We also performed a measurement with a Detection Response Task (DRT) to validate the results and to prove a steady increase of cognitive load with increasing secondary task difficulty. The results showed that the ET precisely recognizes an increasing pupil diameter with increasing secondary task difficulty. In addition, the ET shows increasing blink rates, decreasing fixation time and narrowing of the attention field with increasing secondary task difficulty. The results were validated with the DRT method and the secondary task performance. We conclude that the Eye Tribe ET is a suitable device for assessing a driver's cognitive load. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive load; Driver; Driving simulator; Eye tracking; Eye Tribe; Pupillometry","Ergonomics; Physical therapy; Cognitive loads; Driver; Driving simulator; Eye Tribe; Eye-tracking; Pupillometry; Automobile simulators; adult; Article; blink rate; car driving; clinical assessment; controlled study; driver; eye tracking; female; fixation time; human; human experiment; male; mental performance; pupil; pupillometry; response time; tactile stimulation; task performance; visual attention; visual system parameters",2-s2.0-85032328854

The mechanical properties of Pyrocarbon matrix regarding the change of porosity are calculated by using Mori-Tanaka approach. Combining with the stiffness degradation scheme, the ultimate bending strengths are calculated in Abaqus though a user-defined subroutine (USDFLD). Delamination is modelled by inserting cohesive elements between two adjacent plies. A good agreement is obtained when the FEM results are compared to three-point bending experiments. The FEM results show that the bending strength decreases greatly with the increase of porosity. When the porosity reaches up to 18%, the bending strength is decreased by 57%. The major fracture behaviors are interlamination delamination and continuous crack damage in 90° plies. With the increase of porosity, more severe interlamination delamination will be slightly aggravated. In addition, the increase of porosity will also accelerate the damage in 90° plies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2D C/C composites; Flexural properties; Numerical simulation; Progressive damage","Carbon carbon composites; Computer simulation; Delamination; Failure (mechanical); Nanocomposites; Numerical models; Porosity; 2d-c/c composites; Bending properties; Flexural properties; Mori-Tanaka approaches; Progressive damage; Stiffness degradation; Three-point-bending experiments; Ultimate bending strengths; Bending strength",2-s2.0-85032294128

Traditionally, unfrozen water content is calculated using first return data from the free induction decay (FID) signal intensity (SI); however, these data may contain both ice and liquid water responses, thus overestimating unfrozen water. To address this, the authors used the normalization method for calculating unfrozen water. First, the authors refined a P-NMR testing system for greater temperature control. Next, testing using two P-NMR instruments at different facilities yielded repeatable unfrozen water measurements to within 2.6% of each other. Results from a desorption test indicated excellent agreement (with an average difference of 0.33%) between P-NMR-derived unfrozen water and physical gravimetric water content data. Finally, comparing results from the normalization method to the first return data indicated that calculated unfrozen water in a frozen soil is up to 3.3 times greater for a given temperature using the first return data versus the normalization method. Because this difference is significant, the authors recommend further investigation using an independent method to confirm the results. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Free induction decay (FID); Frozen soil; Pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (P-NMR); Unfrozen water","Instrument testing; Magnetism; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Resonance; Soils; Average difference; Desorption tests; Free induction decay; Free induction decay signals (FID); Normalization methods; Pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance; Unfrozen water; Unfrozen water contents; Frozen soils; desorption; frozen ground; nuclear magnetic resonance; soil water; temperature profile; water content",2-s2.0-85026425074

While combining all possible EEG features may improve the classification performance, it can lead to high dimensionality and worse performance due to redundancy and inefficiency. To solve the high-dimensionality problem, this paper proposes a new framework to automatically search for the optimal subset of EEG features using evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms. The proposed framework has been extensively evaluated using two public datasets (MAHNOB, DEAP) and a new dataset acquired with a mobile EEG sensor. The results confirm that EC algorithms can effectively support feature selection to identify the best EEG features and the best channels to maximize performance over a four-quadrant emotion classification problem.

Experiments This work developed a nano-orifice based DC dielectrophoretic (DEP) system for the sorting of oil-in-water emulsion droplets by size and content in a microchannel. Then, the size-dependent separation of oil droplets was conducted and verified by the prediction of theoretical simulation. In addition, by selecting the suspending solution with a specific electrical conductivity, the oil droplets with similar sizes but different contents were separated based on their opposite DEP behaviors. Findings The size-dependent separation of smaller silicone oil droplets (7.5 and 11 µm in diameter) with a high separation resolution, i.e., size difference of only 3.5 µm was achieved and showed good agreement with the simulation results. The positive and negative DEP behaviors of the droplets varying with the electrical conductivity of the suspending solution were discussed and different types of droplets of similar sizes but different contents were separated.

The enhancement of SWM module design, particularly in the geometric design of the feed spacer, can play a crucial role in the cost and the potential for wider application of these modules. The feed spacer influences the flux, pressure losses and fouling in the membrane process and consequently the product water unit cost. Despite the shift in the application of SWM modules of RO toward low salinity sources and the resulting higher sensitivity performance using these waters, the configuration and orientation of feed spacers have not significantly changed since the original design. A wider use of SWM modules, therefore, requires the adaptation of geometric parameters of the feed spacer to the water source. Improving the feed spacer's design according to the feed water type requires the knowledge of previous studies conducted in spacer-filled channels as well as further needed investigations in future.

Launchers can be designed to ease older adults' use of smartphones by addressing perceptual, cognitive, and motoric changes that might hinder their ability to operate smartphones. However, little research currently exists that analyses the characteristics and assesses the usability of launchers with an adapted user interface (UI) for older adults. Thus, we present a study in which we compared a set of commercialised smartphone launchers with an adapted UI and ATs for older adults by means of heuristic evaluation. The results showed that launchers generally integrate only basic features (i.e., calls, texting, contacts) and only one AT (i.e., an SOS service). Although considerable variation exists between them in terms of overall usability, we also report the limited adequacy of launcher UIs in meeting older adults' needs and abilities. In particular, usability problems linked to content and perception were discovered that limit the older adults’ capability for error recovery as well as visual, auditory, and haptic access to the information provided by the UI. Interestingly, launchers with a larger number of features and ATs were found to have, on average, less usability problems. This indicates that reducing the number of features is not necessarily a feasible way to increase usability. Instead, more research-based development is needed, which should better consider recommendations for the age-friendly design of UIs on smartphones. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Age-friendly design; Assistive technology; Heuristic evaluation; Launcher; Older adult; Smartphone","Smartphones; Usability engineering; User interfaces; Age-friendly; Assistive technology; Heuristic evaluation; Launcher; Older adults; Launching",2-s2.0-85032258419

It considerably deteriorates the image quality and makes the differentiation of fine details quite difficult. Most of the detection systems for the thyroid nodules are semi-automated entailing manual intervention to draw rough outline of the nodule at some level or require manual segmentation in training or testing phases that increase the inaccuracies and evaluation time.

The presence of solid particles in the working fluid medium has an adverse effect on the durability of these engines as well as performance. Typical turbine blade damages include blade coating wear, sand glazing, calcia-magnesia-alumina-silicate (CMAS) attack, oxidation, and plugged cooling holes, all of which can cause rapid performance deterioration including loss of aircraft. This research represents the complex thermochemomechanical fluid structure interaction problem of semimolten particulate impingement and infiltration onto ceramic thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) into its canonical forms. The objective of this research work is to understand the underpinning interface science of interspersed graded ceramic/metal and ceramic/ceramic composites at the grain structure level for robust coatings and bulk material components for vehicle propulsion systems. This research enhances our understanding of the fundamental relationship between interface properties and the thermomechanical behavior in dissimilar materials for materials by design systems, and creates the ability to develop and fabricate materials with targeted macroscale properties as a function of their interfacial behavior. This project creates a framework to enable the engineered design of solid-solid and liquid-solid interfaces in dissimilar functionalized materials to establish a paradigm shift toward science from the traditional empiricism in engineering TBCs and high temperature highly loaded bulk materials. An integrated approach of modeling and simulation, characterization, fabrication, and validation to solve the fundamental questions of interface mechanisms which affect the properties of novel materials will be validated to guide component material solutions to visionary 2040+ military vehicle propulsion systems.

In this paper we ask how the study of and design for experience might be better informed by attending more carefully to differences between these reports. Based on a broad and interdisciplinary literature review, we develop a conceptual framework of multiple selves, each representing a stage in the consolidation of experience accessed by self-report. We explore the use of this framework to support the interpretation of user experience, provide insight into users’ evaluations of their own experiences, and emphasise the importance of design for experience as lived and reflected upon.

Based on this oscillating property, a short electroencephalogram (EEG) segment containing an SSVEP can be used to reconstruct a series of EEG segments where the SSVEP has the same initial phase but the phase of the background EEG varies randomly. When these reconstructed EEG segments are averaged, the background EEG is weakened, whereas the SSVEP is strengthened. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SSVEP in the averaged signal is significantly improved. This reconstruction technique is first proposed in this work, and the method of extracting SSVEPs based on this technique is referred to as the reconstruction extraction (RE) method. The RE, power spectrum (PS), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods were applied to EEG segments that were 1s in length in order to detect SSVEPs. The results show that the detection accuracy of the RE method is similar to that of the CCA method, although it is higher than that of the PS method in situations where the SSVEP has low strength. However, in contrast to the CCA, the RE can be applied using only one signal electrode. This suggests that the RE method can be adopted in a real-time SSVEP-based brain–computer interface (BCI) system. © 2017","Brain-computer interface (BCI); Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); Power spectrum (PS); Reconstruction extraction (RE); Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)","Bioelectric potentials; Brain computer interface; Correlation methods; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Interface states; Interfaces (computer); Power spectrum; Signal to noise ratio; Canonical correlation analysis; Detection accuracy; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Eventrelated potential (ERPs); Reconstruction techniques; Specific properties; Steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEPs); Steady state visual evoked potentials; Biomedical signal processing",2-s2.0-85030664235

Safe operation is dependent on how technology is used, so it is important to take human factors issues into consideration. During design or modification of the control room system, its ability to support safe operation must be assessed to ensure that safety-critical discrepancies are eliminated before implementation. Methods are a necessary tool in human factors evaluation, and there are many to choose from. One prerequisite for evaluation is knowing what to evaluate, and this knowledge determines which methods are most suitable. The purpose of this paper is to identify categories of measures that can guide the choice of evaluation methods for assessing nuclear power plant control room systems. Measures targeted by human factors evaluation methods were compared with aspects that contribute to safe operation and measures proposed and used by other researchers. The conclusion of this paper is that measures targeted by human factors evaluation methods can be grouped into six categories: system performance, task performance, teamwork, use of resources, user experience, and identification of design discrepancies. These six categories can guide the choice of human factors evaluation methods to assess socio-technical systems.

Monotonic tension experiments that were carried out at different temperatures using this high strength steel showed that not only the strain induced but also the stress induced phase change plays a crucial role in the phase transformation of retained austenite to martensite. In the material model, plastic deformation was defined using the Drucker Prager yield surface through a nonassociated flow rule accompanied by nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening. The hardening was coupled with stress and strain induced phase transformations. A nonlinear elastic effect based on elastic dilation was included in the constitutive model by extending the bulk modulus with a second order term. For the finite element analysis, the material model was written as a user defined material subroutine (UMAT). The numerical simulations were done using ABAQUS and compared to monotonic tension, compression and cyclic experiments. The results showed that the strength differential effect and the volumetric change under loading are closely related to the transformation of retained austenite to martensite. At low temperatures the effect of stress induced phase transformation on yield strength was noticeable.

In addition, vulnerability is a scale- and place-dependent concept. While decision-making on adaptation is often made by local government, only a small number of local-scale assessments have been conducted. When indicators are used, global utility functions based on additive or multiplicative aggregation implicitly assume complete compensation between indicators, implying that one source of vulnerability (e.g., proximity to the sea) can always be compensated for by an advantage in another source (e.g., strong social or economic capital) when evidence shows that this is not always the case. This paper presents an indicator-based assessment of vulnerability of eight beaches in Shoalhaven, New South Wales, that are especially exposed to sea level rise. Its goal is twofold. First, it illustrates how indicator-based vulnerability assessments can be applied at a local scale – and not just sectoral, regional and national scales – with the aim of informing local government adaptation planning and resource allocation. In the process, models operationalising the concepts of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity are developed for two valued attributes identified through discussions with the local council, namely the well-being of beach residents and the well-being of users of infrastructure systems located at the beaches. Second, the paper studies, for the first time, the way outranking procedures can be applied in real-life vulnerability assessments as a form of data aggregation that better reflects the non-compensatory nature of many vulnerability indicators. The strengths and weaknesses of the outranking approach are discussed, especially the extent to which the concepts of preference, indifference and dominance thresholds can be conveyed to, and their values elicited from, stakeholders. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change vulnerability; Coastal zone management; Decision making; Multi-criteria analysis; Outranking; Sea-level rise","Beaches; Climate change; Distributed computer systems; Economics; Proximity indicators; Regional planning; Sea level; Adaptation; Coastal zone management; Multi Criteria Analysis; Outranking; Sea level rise; Decision making",2-s2.0-85032455766

In an eight days training program, patients exercised the learning and purchasing of shopping list products in a virtual supermarket using either the novel training device (n = 21) or a corresponding desktop application (n = 17). In a pre-post-design, effects of the two training conditions were compared regarding several outcome measures. Altogether, results did not prove a benefit of the more naturalistic training setting regarding different training performances (recognition, performance speed, spatial orientation), self-perceived daily cognitive impairments, a real-life shopping task as well as various neuropsychological capabilities. Findings are discussed in the context of general challenges in striving after ecological validity in neuropsychology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive impairment; Cognitive remediation; Computerized training; Depression; Ecological validity; Virtual reality","Application programs; Ecology; Virtual reality; Autonomous navigation; Cognitive impairment; Depression; Desktop applications; Ecological validity; Spatial orientations; Training conditions; Virtual-reality environment; E-learning",2-s2.0-85032007894

However, it is widely used as a supplement to Distance Education mode without exploiting its full potential. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive evaluation of existing audio learning systems which is missing in recent literature.

To find which mechanisms work significantly in organizational IT decision-making in accordance with IT diffusion and rival precedence, we empirically test the model by splitting the samples according to the proportion of rivals that have already adopted innovations. The empirical results demonstrate that among the six herding mechanisms, new platform risk and organizational learning drives herding in the earlier stage of diffusion and new platform benefits and competitive pressure drives herding in the later stage of diffusion. The results imply that organizations react conservatively to new platforms when they perceive less platform diffusion.

At first, under a centralized cost minimization framework, a GMS is formulated and set as the benchmark (cost-minimization GMS). Then, the cost-minimization is changed into a profit-maximization problem of generation companies (GENCOs) and the GMS is developed as a bi-level optimization. Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are applied to transform the bi-level into a single-level mixed-integer linear problem and subsequently, Nash equilibrium is obtained as the final solution for the GMS under a deregulated market (profit-maximization GMS). Moreover, to incorporate reliability and economic regulatory constraints, two rescheduling signals (incentive and penalty) are considered as coordination processes among GENCOs and independent system operators. These signals are based on energy-not-supplied and operation cost, and ensure that the result of profit-maximization GMS is in the given reliability and social cost limits, respectively. These limits are obtained from the cost-minimization GMS. Lastly, the model is evaluated on a test system.

Pulse application induced oxidation of the GUV phospholipids and the oxidation level depended on the duration of the pulse. Light and O2 increased the level of pulse-induced lipid peroxidation whereas the presence of antioxidants either in the membrane or in the solution completely suppressed peroxidation. Importantly, pulse application did not create additional reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GUV-free solution. Lipid peroxidation seems to result from a facilitation of the lipid peroxidation by the ROS already present in the solution before pulsing, not from a direct pulse-induced peroxidation. The pulse would facilitate the entrance of ROS in the core of the membrane, allowing the contact between ROS and lipid chains and provoking the oxidation. Our findings demonstrate that the application of electric pulses on cells could induce the oxidation of the membrane phospholipids since cell membranes contain unsaturated lipids. The chemical consequences of electropulsation will therefore have to be taken into account in future biomedical applications of electropulsation since oxidized phospholipids play a key role in many signaling pathways and diseases. © 2017","Antioxidant; Electropermeabilization; Electroporation; Electropulsation; Lipid oxidation; Membrane phospholipids; Reactive oxygen species","Antioxidants; Cytology; Lipids; Mass spectrometry; Medical applications; Membranes; Oxidative stress; Phospholipids; Electro-pulsation; Electropermeabilization; Electroporation; Lipid oxidation; Membrane phospholipids; Reactive oxygen species; Oxidation; alpha tocopherol; aluminum hydroxide; ascorbic acid; phospholipid; reactive oxygen metabolite; unsaturated fatty acid; Article; cell membrane permeability; cell survival; controlled study; electroporation; flow cytometry; giant cell; giant unilamellar vesicle; human; human cell; lamellar body; lipid peroxidation; mass spectrometry; membrane vesicle; pH; ultraviolet A radiation",2-s2.0-85029356761

Special attention is devoted to elucidating the role played by the coupling between axial and flexural degrees of freedom in the determination of the available mode hopping conditions and the associated mechanisms of deformation. Waveguides offer an ideal test bed to investigate the mechanics of nonlinear energy tunneling, due to the fact that they naturally feature, even at low frequencies, families of modes (flexural and axial) that are intrinsically characterized by extreme complementarity. Moreover, thanks to their geometric simplicity, their behavior can be explained by resorting to intuitive structural mechanics models that effectively capture the dichotomy and interplay between flexural and axial mechanisms. After having delineated the fundamental mechanics of flexural-to-axial hopping using the benchmark example of a homogeneous structure, we adapt the analysis to the case of periodic waveguides, in which the complex dispersive behavior due to periodicity results in additional richness of mode hopping mechanisms.

Study of such an area in Malawi has allowed understanding of risks posed to groundwater from the recent implementation of a typical developing-country pit-latrine sanitation policy to be gained. This has assisted the development of a risk-assessment framework approach pragmatic to regulatory-practitioner management of this issue. The framework involves water-supply and pit-latrine mapping, monitoring of key groundwater contamination indicators and surveys of possible environmental site-condition factors and culminates in an integrated statistical evaluation of these datasets to identify the significant factors controlling risks posed. Our approach usefully establishes groundwater-quality baseline conditions of a potentially emergent issue for the study area. Such baselines are foundational to future trend discernment and contaminant natural attenuation verification critical to policies globally. Attribution of borehole contamination to pit-latrine loading should involve, as illustrated, the use of the range of contamination (chemical, microbiological) tracers available recognising none are ideal and several radial and capture-zone metrics that together may provide a weight of evidence. Elevated, albeit low-concentration, nitrate correlated with some radial metrics and was tentatively suggestive of emerging latrine influences. Longer term monitoring is, however, necessary to verify that the commonly observed latrine-borehole separation distances (29–58 m), alongside statutory guidelines, do not constitute significant risk. Borehole contamination was limited and correlation with various environmental-site condition factors also limited. This was potentially ascribed to effectiveness of attenuation to date, monitoring of an emergent problem yet to manifest, or else contamination from other sources. High borehole usage and protective wall absence correlated with observed microbiological contamination incidence, but could relate to increased human/animal activity close to these poorly protected boreholes. Additional to factors assessed, a groundwater-vulnerability factor is recommended that critically relies upon improved proactive securing of underpinning data during borehole/latrine installations. On-going concerns are wide ranging, including poorly constrained pit-latrine input, difficulties in assessing in-situ plume natural attenuation and possible disposal of used motor oils to latrines. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater quality; Malawi; Millennium development goals; Pit latrine; Risk; Sanitation","Boreholes; Contamination; Developing countries; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Pollution detection; Risk assessment; Risks; Sanitation; Water quality; Water supply; Groundwater contamination; Groundwater vulnerability; Malawi; Microbiological contaminations; Millennium development goals; Pit latrine; Risk assessment framework; Statistical evaluation; Natural attenuation; chloride; ground water; nitrate; baseline survey; developing world; groundwater; Millenium Development Goal; risk assessment; rural policy; sanitation; water quality; water supply; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; developing country; environmental monitoring; environmental sanitation; geographic mapping; incidence; metric system; microbial contamination; plume; priority journal; program effectiveness; risk assessment; rural hygiene; waste disposal facility; water contamination; water quality; water supply; Malawi",2-s2.0-85029505273

The addition of ascorbic acid (AA) in the sensing cell with driving voltage (Vtot) at +2.5 V would make the PB films become Prussian white (PW) in the reporting cell, accompanied by the color change from blue to nearly transparent.

The change of color and the corresponding UV–vis absorbance at 700 nm for the PB/PW films in the reporting cell could be reversibly switched by changing the solute in the sensing cell between AA and glucose and then switching Vtot between +2.5 and −1.5 V. Based on these, a keypad lock was developed with AA, glucose and Vtot as 3 inputs, and the color change of the PB/PW films as the output.

As a result of these interactions key essential services for society emerge. Urban expansion is a direct driver of land change and cause serious shifts in socio-ecological relationships and the associated lifestyles. The framework of rural-urban gradients has proved to be a powerful tool for ecological research about urban influences on ecosystems and on sociological issues related to social welfare. However, to date there has not been an attempt to achieve a classification of municipalities in rural-urban gradients based on socio-ecological interactions. In this paper, we developed a methodological approach that allows identifying and classifying a set of socio-ecological network configurations in the Region of Madrid, a highly dynamic cultural landscape considered one of the European hotspots in urban development. According to their socio-ecological links, the integrated model detects four groups of municipalities, ordered along a rural-urban gradient, characterized by their degree of biophysical and socioeconomic coupling and different indicators of landscape structure and social welfare.

This paper focuses on the governance of domestic photovoltaic (PV) systems in the UK during the provision stage, an overlooked area in the previous energy-efficiency studies that have mainly focused on PV adoption and practices by occupants, but only after installation. The notion of translation in Actor Network Theory (ANT) is used to analyse how a network of PV provision actants decides the system design and integration into homes, and how this in turn conditions household participation in this network. Semi-structured interviews and video tours used in four participative community and two non-participative community case studies reveal the impact of non-human actants in terms of how PV scripts and practices are formed by PV professionals.

Then, we describe selected examples in which single-crystal (SC) XRD on the solid-state phase of the mesogens provided information about their supra-molecular organization in the Sm phase.

An investigation of existing literature helped us identify two main challenges that could impact the adoption of self-driving cars by such users, namely, their acceptance and multimodal in-car interaction. To mitigate such challenges, we propose in this paper a model that frames the process of universally designing the in-car interactions to increase usability for everyone, while maintaining safety.

To facilitate indi-vidualization of physical human-machine interfaces, it is essential to describe their gestalt precisely by means of quantifiable design parameters. So far, this has not been done in such a way as to support designers and engineers effectively in their task of making the transition from conceptual ideas to physical, user-centered interfaces. A holistic design parameter model of physical interfaces is elaborated within this paper. Furthermore, a methodical approach for adapting the machine’s design parameters to the skills of an older user is presented using the example of rotary control elements. This is based on a literature review and a subsequently conducted expert survey. Furthermore, corresponding compensation options by means of adjustments to the machine’s design parameters are discussed. To this end, the results of two preliminary user studies are presented which simulate a fine motor adjustment task and a forceful gross motor task. This in turn leads to an initial adaptive design for a rotary control element.

Finding this balance, in which the end user can access needed information without overly complicated displays, a timeconsuming labyrinth of clicks, and the engineer can implement the display concisely is difficult. Typically, end users desire complex displays that allow for fluid movement to the answers they need. However, accomplishing this can be time consuming for the engineer because complex displays require hard-coded GUIs. Depending on the amount of unique end – users, these issues can multiply because every user role could need a unique, complex display that will require hard coding from the engineer. However, through the usage of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) a solution may exist. This architectural style has been leveraged in developing an “adaptive presentation layer” pattern that allows for complex GUIs to be derived without the need of hard coding. This solution was developed for a domain that needed role specific information for map clients; however, other user interface clients have not been applied to this pattern. Therefore, to examine the viability of this solution, it must be applied in other domains using various UI clients. The cyber security domain provides suitable platform to research this solution because of the necessity to monitor several entities of data concurrently and ensure that those monitoring the data can quickly attain the need information. A successful implementation could provide a viable solution in the development of future cyber security interfaces. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Cyber security; Human factors; Human-computer interaction; Software architecture; User interface design","Engineers; Graphical user interfaces; Human engineering; Information services; Monitoring; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Software architecture; User interfaces; Adaptive presentations; Architectural style; Complex displays; Cyber security; Fluid movement; Specific information; User interface designs; Viable solutions; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-85021632556

However, when using prior mission data, there is a risk with using old or stale data for data that rarely changes, such as weather data. This places the onus on pilots to recognize and correct outdated information. To address this challenge, methods are needed that (1) reveal stale information so the pilot can take appropriate action to update it; and (2) enable awareness of data timesensitivity and expiration. This paper describes the design of visual methods to address this issue within a card-based user interface (UI) mission planning workspace. Specifically, this paper describes implicit and explicit methods for indicating staleness and time-sensitivity within and across card UIs. These methods will reduce error and improve efficiency in mission planning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Card UIs; Data staleness; Mission planning; User interface components","Ergonomics; Card UIs; Data staleness; Implicit and explicit methods; Mission planning; Outdated information; Time-sensitivity; User interface components; Weather data; User interfaces",2-s2.0-85022337380

However, by reviewing existing methods and formula for measuring aesthetic metrics, we found that no common consent exists to measure these metrics in a way that aligned with layout complexity of adaptive user interfaces. In this paper we propose an approach to measure aesthetic metrics based on visual complexity of adaptive user interface. We promote a metric model that structures an evaluation tool called I2Evaluator. The results of our tool are discussed in comparison with the subjective evaluation of adaptive user interfaces.

The participants’ typing gestures were then observed when using their phones in a natural manner. Finally, the participants were asked use one thumb with extended, natural and bending gestures, respectively, to slide on a specified typing screen, and the sizes of these three sliding areas, named Stretch, Natural and OW, were measured to find the suitable typing area for different hand sizes. The results of this study found that the typing gestures could be classified into four types: One-Handed (15.6%), Two-Handed (68.8%), Hold & Tap, (6.3%) and Cradle (9.4%). Moreover, the Natural and OW areas for the larger and middle hands were both bigger than the one for the small hand, while there were no significant differences between the larger and middle hands. this indicated that the length of the thumb would affect the usability of the phone.

It should be remembered that stakeholders usually have different requirements of design process, stemming from their diverse needs and expectations. That is why a systemic association of design requirements with user needs, taking into account sustainable development principles is important.

Previous studies have mainly extracted features from the signal manually, but proper features need to be selected carefully. To avoid performance degradation caused by manual feature selection, we applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the automatic feature extractor and classifier for fNIRS-based BCI.

When the relative position of two of a user’s fingertips is fixed on a touchscreen, the fingers can be considered a hand-shaped rigid object. In such situations, a reaction force can be exerted on each finger using a three degrees of freedom (3DOF) haptic interface. In this study, a prototype 3DOF haptic interface system comprising a touchscreen, a 6-axis force sensor, an X-Y stage, and a capstan drive system was developed. The developed system estimates the input force from fingers using sensor data and each finger’s position. Further, the system generates reaction forces from virtual objects to the user’s fingertips by controlling the static frictional force between each of the user’s fingertips and the screen. The system enables users to perceive the shape of two-dimensional virtual objects displayed on the screen and translate/rotate them with their fingers. Moreover, users can deform elastic virtual objects, and feel their rigidity. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Haptic interface; Multitouch; Shearing force; Virtual reality","Digital storage; Mice (computer peripherals); Virtual reality; 6-axis force sensor; Multi-touch; Reaction forces; Relative positions; Shearing force; Static frictional forces; Three degrees of freedom; Virtual objects; Haptic interfaces",2-s2.0-85026483486

When this fact is combined with the increase in life longevity due to medical and social advances it alters the demographic balance in relation to age. Hence, the number of people aged 65 and over is constantly increasing. The potential of Smart Technologies and IoT-based devices to improve health has increased rapidly in the last few years and users are now in a position to contribute to the development of the interaction process and need to be properly trained on benefits of using new technologies. IFTTT (If This Then That), Blockly, and other similar tools provide a new perspective on web-based services, and represent an innovative and inclusive instrument to manage small automated tasks between Internet-connected devices by using a simplified interaction approach. The main research question of this work is: how could senior users benefit and adopt smart devices in a proficient way and how can emerging technologies such as automation services enhance safety, health and well-being for people with different abilities? The research method is based on a participatory, Inclusive Design approach, developed through interviews and focus groups, among a restricted number of people of different age and gender, design and usability tests in the further stage. The aim of the work is to make existing technologies more accepted, usable and inclusive for as many people as possible. This goal will be achieved by analysis and by creating a set of interactive and easy to use information and tools for automating different processes, to improve the performance in Activities of Daily Living and increase the connection and socialization between citizens, their family and friends.

The ECU actual running results show that configuring the model parameters by upper software can get rid of the constraints of GUI.

In particular, we introduced three games that rely on selective attention, attentional switch and Stroop effect.While users were solving a game on their smartphones, we collected cognitive performance (in terms of accuracy and reaction times), touch features (interactions with touch screen), and sensors features (data from accelerometer and gyroscope). Results show that our cognitive-based games can be used as a two-factors authentication mechanism on smartphones.

This concept can be characterized as a multidimensional phenomenon that comprises both, the perception of different product qualities as well as emotions that arise while using a product. The interrelations of these components are described in the ‘Component Model of User Experience’ (CUE model), which serves as the theoretical basis for our experiment. UX can be investigated in different phases of usage. In our experiment, we examined product perceptions and emotions in early phases and for short-time usage. Sixty participants employed different versions of mobile digital audio players which were systematically varied with respect to visual aesthetics and usability. Essential aspects of UX, i.e., perceptions of visual attractiveness and usability, as well as emotional responses were measured at three stages: Before interacting with the device, after an exploration (2 min) and after working with the system for a short time (15 min) to solve a given set of tasks. Data was analysed using a 2 × 2 × 3 mixed MANCOVA. The results of the experiment show that influences of visual aesthetics and of usability on quality perceptions as well as emotions change during these early stages. Moreover, evidence for two different halo effects was found: On the one hand, visual aesthetics influenced perceived usability in the beginning. On the other hand, the usability of the device impacted the perceived visual attractiveness and emotional responses at later stages. To account for these findings, we suggest to distinguish a hedonic halo effect from a pragmatic one. Based on the results for both effects, we propose that two mechanisms may be responsible for the effects during short-time usage, one of them being cognitive in nature, the other emotional. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aesthetics; Emotions; Halo effect; Heuristics; Instrumental features; Non-instrumental features; Phases of usage; Temporal dynamics; Usability; User Experience","Usability engineering; Aesthetics; Emotions; Halo effect; Heuristics; Instrumental features; Non instrumentals; Phases of usage; Temporal dynamics; Usability; User experience; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85026749050

National statistical datasets collect important aggregated data regarding building construction, energy consumption and occupants, and cities are making a significant effort to update spatial referenced data of their territory. However, these data is generally not detailed enough, being available at different scales and in different formats. The integrated use of these data is critical to validate different methods to predict and model energy consumption in cities, as well in addressing its energy saving potential. Furthermore, scenario analysis for retrofit or new design is only possible at building scale, highlighting the potential of a bottom-up database.

While automated test generation has been successfully applied for code-level API testing, it has not found widespread adoption in practice for testing of graphical user interfaces. Tools for test generation do not support GUI testing out-of-the-box but require dedicated extensions. Objective This paper explores the applicability of automated test generation for testing GUIs of industry applications. We propose a test adapter approach to bridge the gap between automated test generation tools and industry applications. Method A multiple case study was conducted in which automated test generation with test adapters has been applied at the unit, integration, and system test level in three industry projects from two different companies. Results Automated test generation via test adapters could be applied at all test levels. It has led to an increase of coverage as well as the detection of new defects that were not found by preceding testing activities in the projects. While test adapters can easily be implemented at the unit test level, their complexity and the corresponding effort for providing adapter implementations rises at higher test levels. Conclusion Test adapters can be used for applying automated test generation for testing GUIs of industry applications. They bridge the gap between automated test generation tools and industry applications.

The head has been selected as the location for the interaction because it has been relatively under-researched compared to the torso or hands, and offers potential for hands-free attention direction and integration with new head and eyewear technology. Two studies have been conducted. The first examined the user's ability to discern three-parameter tactile signals presented at sites on the head. Findings highlighted that while multi-parameter cues could be interpreted with low error, challenges were faced when interpreting specific combinations of waveform and interval type, and when performing identification of interval pattern and stimulation location while visually-distracted. A second study investigated how use of the three-parameter tactile coding scheme impacted participants’ situational awareness under several exertion conditions. Significant interaction was found between the exertion conditions and subjective cognitive workload. The relationship between situational awareness phases of participant SAGAT assessment scores were consistent between conditions, with perception and prediction phases outpacing comprehension. This suggests, pending further study of the suitability of situational awareness evaluation methods for tactile perception, that quickly trained participants may struggle to understand multi-parameter coding intended to convey changing events. Interpretations of coding schemes were found to vary, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting and mapping signals for presentation.

One of the most critical factors influencing the sustainability of an agro-food supply chain is its network design. A particularly challenging aspect in this context is the broad range of influencing indicators associated with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability that need to be considered. However, many of these indicators could not be fully integrated or measured by single-step optimization problems. This paper presents a critical literature review of operational research methods for the design of sustainable supply chains. A novel two-stage hybrid solution methodology is proposed. In the first stage, a partner selection is performed using a hybrid multi criteria decision making based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation method. The result obtained in the first stage is used in the second stage to develop a multi-objective mathematical model to optimize the design of the supply chain network. This approach allows the simultaneous consideration of all three dimensions of sustainability including carbon footprint, water footprint, number of jobs created and the total cost of the supply chain design. The proposed approach generates a Pareto frontier to aid users in making decisions. Numerical experiments are completed utilizing data from an agro-food company to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution methodology. The analyzes of the numerical results provide important organizational, practical and policy insights on (1) the impact of financial and environmental sustainability on supply chain network design (2) the tradeoff analysis between environmental emission, water footprint, societal implications and associated cost for making informed decision on supply chain investment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-food supply chain design; Analytical hierarchy process; Decision-making; Multi-objective optimization; Sustainability","Analytic hierarchy process; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Design; Food supply; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Supply chains; Agro foods; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Analytical Hierarchy Process; Environmental sustainability; Hybrid solution methodology; Multi criteria decision making; Multi objective decision making; Supply chain network design; Sustainable development",2-s2.0-85010999493

The post office clerk was facing the client in one layout and seated at 45° with respect to the counter in the other. We analyzed the most frequent tasks presenting awkward postures: (1) payment of a postal order; (2) accepting a registered letter. These two tasks were further divided in their subtasks. We used an optoelectronic motion analysis system, and measured the Range of Motion (RoM) of trunk, arms and head. Using equipments placed on the employee left side the 45° workstation layout required less trunk and head torsion. A larger worktop improved the workstation, leaving more room for the equipments and allowing the worker to sit in front of screen and keyboard. However, this solution involved increased RoMs in the activities performed on both sides. The opto-electronic motion analysis system gave quantitative data still at the prototype stage. On the contrary, the most common standardized protocols, based on subjective observations, can give only qualitative evaluations. Furthermore, with the opto-electronic system, differently from simulation software that uses virtual settings, we are able to check the real interaction between the worker and the layout. From the quantitative data we can also extract useful information to help occupational doctors in managing healthcare protocols and to draw up a fuller, real assessment of biomechanical risks.

Previous design research mainly considered users’ visual perception in terms of how they perceive an object visually and how they feel about the appearance of a product. Little research was focused on the investigation of the relationship between sound and shape characteristics. This study attempts to focus on the exploration of the cognitive relationship between object shape and sound effects. 54 participants (male 25, female 29; ages 18–25 years) were invited to participatory the experiment. Two variables experiment (i.e., shapes x sounds) were conducted in this study. Six types of stimuli including human, cars, animals (i.e., natural objects), cones, cubes, and spheres (i.e., artifacts) were adopted in the experiment. Each type of stimulus was displayed in pairs (e.g., large volume and small volume) on the screen. Audio stimulus was played after visual stimulus to help participants match the audio and visual stimuli. The results showed that there are significant congruent relationships between shape and sound. Participants were able to perceive and identify the larger volume of objects and to associate them with bigger sounds; in contrast, the smaller volume of objects to associate with the smaller sounds. Moreover, a small volume of objects is congruent with high pitch and low volume of sound. In visual identification, the shape with sharp angles is in accordance with large volume and high pitch of sound, while the curved shape appears to be congruent with small volume and low pitch of sounds. However, participants are likely to have difficulty in matching circle and square shapes with the sounds assigned.

Certified third parties can inspect whether an application satisfies applicable security requirements and issue inspection reports to notify users of potential risks. However, currently there is no standard method for users to obtain inspection results. Furthermore, as the advances of hacking techniques, a inspecter may discover that an application is vulnerable to a new type of attack and wish to notify application users immediately. To address the issue, this study proposes a Smart Contract-based Investigation Report Management framework for smartphone applications security (SCIRM) to enable smartphone application users to obtain security inspection reports of interested applications with smart contracts. Benefiting from blockchain technology, users can obtain historical inspection reports of an application and verify the integrity of the reports. In addition, this study utilizes smart contract technology to implement the interfaces so that smart contracts will enforce the related actions automatically. This study can hopefully contribute to enabling users to adopt appropriate countermeasures to potential application security risks as users can obtain up-to-dated security information about applications timely. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,"Cryptography; Inspection; Multimedia signal processing; Personal computing; Signal processing; Smartphones; Application security; Design and implementations; Management frameworks; Potential risks; Security requirements; Smart-phone applications; Third parties; Vetting systems; Mobile security",2-s2.0-85026676156

To promote knowledge sharing, it is important to understand why scientists want to or hesitate to share knowledge with other research communities. We examined five determining factors (reciprocal benefit, anticipated relationship, reputation, altruism and fear of being scooped) that impact scientists' intention to share explicit and implicit knowledge and built a predictive research model. The proposed model was then evaluated using partial least squares (PLSs) method against 141 valid survey responses. The results suggested that reciprocal benefit and fear of being scooped were significant in affecting implicit and explicit knowledge sharing behavior in health and life sciences research communities. Reputation had a main effect on scientists' intention to share explicit knowledge and anticipated relationship had an effect on scientists’ intention to share implicit knowledge. However, altruism showed no main effects on knowledge sharing.

The LES with dynamic sub-grid model is used to calculate the transient turbulent flow inside the liquid pool. The enthalpy-porosity approach is used to simulate the heat transfer and solidification of steel in the caster. A criterion is developed using the user-defined functions to model the motion and entrapment of inclusion in the caster based on the Lagrangian approach. The 1/4 and 1/2 inclusion band defects located in a steel plate are found by the UT method, and the distribution of inclusions is intermittent and asymmetric. The transient and asymmetric flow pattern has been obtained in a one-third-scale vertical-bending type water model of mold. The asymmetric flow inside the liquid pool is identified a periodical behavior. The oscillating motion of asymmetric flow inside the mold is induced by the turbulence, rather than the curve shape of the caster. The maximum impact depths of the lower recirculation flow for various casters are almost around 2.8 m below the top surface of the mold. The time for inclusion removal from top surface can be divided into three periods: 3.5–6.5 s, 6.5–30 s, and 30 s after injection. The vertical length has a less effect on the removal ratio of inclusions from the top surface, but determines the entrapment positions of inclusions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetric flow; Inclusion transport; Large eddy simulation; Solidification; Vertical-bending continuous caster","Continuous casting; Flow of fluids; Flow patterns; Heat transfer; Lagrange multipliers; Large eddy simulation; Molds; Solidification; Asymmetric flows; Continuous casters; Dynamic sub-grid model; Heat transfer and solidifications; La-grangian approaches; Transient fluid flow; Transient turbulent flow; User Defined Functions; Oscillating flow; steel; steel plate; unclassified drug; accuracy; Article; asymmetric flow; chemical procedures; enthalpy; experimental design; flow kinetics; heat transfer; inclusion transport; Lagrangian approach; large eddy simulation model; mathematical computing; mathematical model; mathematical phenomena; mechanics; oscillation; porosity; prediction accuracy; solidification process; surface property; time series analysis; transient turbulent flow; transport kinetics; turbulence; vertical bending continuous caster; vertical bending type water model",2-s2.0-85032031922

Frequent overloading of the operator's visual channel may result in accidents. To reduce the occurrence of accidents and improve overall operating performance, this paper proposes the extension of the HMI to the hearing modality. The proposed HMI takes the form of a spatial auditory display for complex navigation tasks such as path following (route guidance) or trajectory tracking. The interface incorporates two novel components. The first is the application of a modified “lookahead distance” guidance strategy, as a guidance law for generating a reference. The reference is presented to the operator as a spatial auditory image of the virtual target to be followed. Before being presented to the operator, the reference information is preconditioned through “supernormal” transformations to increase azimuth and distance resolution in regions of interest and thus to improve efficiency and overcome the comparative disadvantages of the hearing channel. A series of experiments show that the proposed guidance strategy provides a comprehensible and effective auditory reference. The enhanced supernormal auditory interface improves performance by reducing the tracking error of both path following and trajectory tracking compared to a non-enhanced interface without the supernormal transformation. Experiment participants report that the novel auditory interface is intuitive and easy to use, providing very good situational awareness. While the auditory interface investigated in this paper is shown to be effective for the teleoperation of unmanned vehicles, it may have other applications such as navigation for the visually impaired. © 2017","Guidance; Human–machine interface; Spatial auditory dispaly; Supernormal transformations; Teleoperation; Unmanned vehicles","Accidents; Audition; Electronic guidance systems; Remote control; Trajectories; Vehicles; Auditory interfaces; Distance resolution; Machine interfaces; Operating performance; Regions of interest; Situational awareness; Spatial auditory dispaly; Trajectory tracking; Unmanned vehicles",2-s2.0-85030850094

The studied task is the adjustment, by a user, of candidate solutions provided by an optimization system in order to introduce a missing constraint. Two procedures are compared on this task. The first one is a manual adjustment of solutions assisted by a software that dynamically computes the cost of the current solution. The second procedure is based on reoptimization. For this procedure, the user defines some desired changes on a solution, and then a reoptimization method is applied to integrate the changes and reoptimize the rest of the solution. This process is iterated with additional desired changes until a satisfactory solution is obtained. For this interactive approach, the proposed reoptimization procedure is an iterated local search metaheuristic. The experiment, conducted with 16 subjects, provides a quantitative evaluation of the manual and reoptimization approaches. The results show that, even for small local adjustments, the manual modification of a solution has an important impact on the quality of the solution. In addition, the experiment demonstrates the efficiency of the interactive reoptimization approach and the adequacy of the iterated local search method for reoptimizing solutions.

On the other hand the provision of a safe and healthy workplace is a well respected value therefore national regulations are there on the use of tools including machinery in workplaces by workers. In both area the basic concept of safety is the management of risk, but the two approaches differ due to the differences in the quantity and diversity of machinery handled and due to the knowledge on target group and on the use. Although there several ways to link design and usage including e.g. standardization, acquisition, user-oriented design, the risk of machinery at the workplaces is not eliminated and workplace accidents with machinery still occur.

For software libraries, we study how library developers refactor their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), especially when it impacts client users by breaking an API of the library. Objective Our work aims to understand how clients that use a library API are affected by refactoring activities. We target popular libraries that potentially impact more library client users. Method We distinguish between library APIs based on their client-usage (referred to as client-used APIs) in order to understand the extent to which API breakages relate to refactorings. Our tool-based approach allows for a large-scale study across eight libraries (i.e., totaling 183 consecutive versions) with around 900 clients projects. Results We find that library maintainers are less likely to break client-used API classes. Quantitatively, we find that refactoring activities break less than 37% of all client-used APIs.

Most users of the small-scale wind power generation system come from the general population, who do not have professional technologies and concepts. A good monitoring system can provide the user with quick understanding of the operational status, efficient troubleshooting, and improvement of the whole system. The paper proposes a wireless remote monitoring system for wind systems. This system includes a host computer and a remote monitoring module. The host computer is used for command control, data collection, and analysis. It can order the remote monitoring module to operate electrical equipment, gather measured data from the remote monitoring module, and analyze these data. The operation screen of the host computer is accomplished by the Lab VIEW front panel. Via interactive man-machine interface, the user can input control commands and monitor operating conditions, so the operation is simpler and more straightforward. The remote monitoring module can measure voltage, current, generator speed, and wind speed data; in addition, it can provide an electromagnetic brake for the wind turbine. The communication of the host computer and remote monitoring module is constituted through a wireless network, so the host computer can fully understand the system status wherever placed, and remotely monitor and control the entire system. The specific functions of the remote monitoring module are performed by an AVR single chip and its surrounding instrumentation. The monitoring system of this paper is expected to effectively manage the wind turbine system, improve the efficiency of the system, and provide a reference to further improve the system. This paper monitors a practical 400 W small wind turbine as an object, which verifies the practicability of this paper in practical applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Microprocessor; Monitoring system; Wind turbine","Computer control systems; Electric power generation; Microprocessor chips; Multimedia signal processing; Remote control; Renewable energy resources; Signal processing; Wind; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Electrical equipment; Electromagnetic brakes; Man machine interface; Monitoring system; Remote monitoring system; Renewable energy systems; Small scale wind power generation systems; Wind turbine systems; Monitoring",2-s2.0-85026627964

The described system was created by reviewing related areas of research, capturing stakeholder's requirements, designing system components and then implementing within an actual EoL EEE processer. The research presented in this paper details user requirements, relevant to any EoL EEE processer, and provides information of the challenges and benefits of utilising CPSs systems within this domain. The system implemented allowed an EoL processer to attach passive Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags to cores (i.e. mobile phones and other IT assets) upon entry to the facility allowing monitoring and control of the core's refurbishment. The CPS deployed supported the processing and monitoring requirements of PAS 141:2011, a standard for the correct refurbishment of both used and waste EEE for reuse. The implemented system controls how an operator can process a core, informing them which process or processes should be followed based upon the quality of the core, the recorded results of previous testing and any repair efforts. The system provides Human-Computer Interfaces (HCIs) to aid the user in recording core and process information which is then used to make decisions on the additional processes required.

However, although some methods may be more widely applicable than others, it is impossible a priori to know which method will work best. This may be due to the particular mathematical properties of the mathematical model, i.e. the formulation. It may also be due to the representation of the variables in the model. This combination of choices of method, representation and formulation makes it difficult to predict which combination may be best. This paper presents an example from process engineering, the design of heat exchanger networks, for which two different representations for the same formulation are available. Two different heuristic optimisation procedures are considered. The results demonstrate that any given combination will not lead to the best outcome across a range of case studies.

To improve efficiency in forecasting applications, surge models often use atmospheric forcing from parametric vortex models, which represent the surface pressures and wind fields with a few storm parameters. The future of storm surge prediction could involve real-time coupling of surge and full-physics atmospheric models; thus, their accuracies must be understood in a real hurricane scenario. The authors compare predictions from a parametric vortex model (using forecast tracks from the National Hurricane Center) and a full-physics coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model during Hurricane Isaac (2012). The predictions are then applied within a tightly coupled, wave and surge modeling system describing the northern Gulf of Mexico and the floodplains of southwest Louisiana. It is shown that, in a hindcast scenario, a parametric vortex model can outperform a data-assimilated wind product, and given reasonable forecast advisories, a parametric vortex model gives reasonable surge forecasts.

In these conditions motorized traffic and vulnerable road users compete continually. Speed reduction measures may play a relevant role in these contexts, provided that such measures are also designed in compliance with the driver's capabilities and expectations. The paper describes a test procedure using driving simulation experiments, designed to evaluate the reconfiguration project of Via Pistoiese, an urban road collector located in Florence (Italy). The road improvement design consisted of several engineering treatments aimed to reduce and homogenize the driving speed, as well as to manage the co-existence of the different road users and mainly to protect pedestrians. The main focus of the research was to understand if the drivers’ behaviour was according to the design hypothesis before the safety treatments are implemented in the real world. Due to the multiple engineering treatments included in the reconfiguration project, the evaluation of the overall safety effectiveness of the project rather than the single treatment safety impact was the main concern of the research study. In addition, the study aimed to assess the usefulness of the considered testing method to understand how to integrate road design with drivers' performances, especially in heterogeneous traffic environments where drivers’ behaviour plays a decisive role in the success of the proposed design solutions. Fifty-eight participants drove through two immersive virtual environments, reproducing the existing configuration and the project reconfiguration, while data relating to different driving aspects were collected. Two analyses were performed. The first was focused on the analysis of the mean speed profiles and revealed that the considered engineering treatments are able to control the speeding behaviour without providing a too high discomfort to the drivers. The second analysis was finalized to evaluate the driver's behaviour approaching zebra crossing, evaluating the impact of countermeasures allowing the drivers to perceive in advance a critical situation (a pedestrian that suddenly crossed the street) and consequently to perform a smoother and safer manoeuvre. The experiments confirmed the validity of the considered engineering treatments, allowing expecting the improvement of the traffic safety in via Pistoiese, and support the usefulness of virtual reality experimentations to predict of the safety effectiveness of design solutions, taking into account the drivers’ behaviour. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Driving performance; Driving simulator; Road design; Traffic calming measures; Urban roads","Automobile drivers; Behavioral research; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Safety engineering; Testing; Transportation; Virtual reality; Driving performance; Driving simulator; Road design; Traffic calming measures; Urban road; Highway planning",2-s2.0-85032297004

Since its introduction, fog computing has found a lot of applications, including, for instance, connected vehicles, wireless sensors, smart cities and etc. One prominent problem in fog computing is how fine-grained access control can be imposed. Functional encryption, a new cryptographic primitive, is known to support fine-grained access control. However, when it comes to some new threats in the fog computing scenario, such as side channel attacks, functional encryption cannot maintain its security. Therefore, we need new cryptographic primitives that not only provide a way to securely share data with a fine-grained access control but also are able to resist those new threats. In this paper, we consider how to construct functional encryption schemes (FEs) adaptively secure in continual memory leakage model (CML), which is one of the strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and master secret keys. Besides providing privacy and fine-grained access control in fog computing, our scheme can also guarantee security against side channel attacks. More concretely, we propose a generic framework for constructing fully secure leakage-resilient FEs (LR-FEs) in the CML model results from leakage-resilient pair encoding, which is an extension of pair encoding presented in the recent work of Attrapadung. In this way, our framework simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and analysis of predicate encodings. Moreover, we discover new adaptively secure LR-FEs, including FE for regular languages, attribute-based encryption (ABE) for large universe and ABE with short ciphertext. Above all, leakage-resilient adaptively secure functional encryption schemes can equip fog computing with higher security and fine-grained access control. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dual system methodology; Fog computing; Functional encryption; Leakage Resilient Cryptography; Pair encoding","Cryptography; Encoding (symbols); Fog; Side channel attack; Smart city; Attribute-based encryptions; Communication cost; Cryptographic primitives; Design and analysis; Dual system; Functional encryptions; Generic frameworks; Leakage-resilient cryptographies; Access control",2-s2.0-85011802339

Besides the benefits that resulted for disabled people, this twenty-year endeavor has helped us improve our understanding of the neuroplasticity mechanisms in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and how these are triggered through the interaction with the physical world and especially through interaction with robots. In these systems, most of the state-of-the-art arrangements are based on multi-Degree of Freedom (DOF) open kinematic chains. They also employ sophisticated control hardware as well as high-profile actuators and sensors. The state-of-the-art technology that is integrated in these arrangements, increases the cost and at the same time requires the presence of trained employees that are able to maintain and operate such systems. Another option, are mechanisms that are based on four- and six-bar linkages. These are closed kinematic chain designs that can generate a variety of paths, yet they can do so with much less flexibility and adaptation possibilities. Despite the reduced flexibility over their robotic counterparts these mechanisms are attractive due to their reduced cost, simplicity and low external power requirement. This paper elaborates on the synthesis, analysis, simulation and passive control of four-bar linkages that can be used in upper limb rehabilitation and extends previous work by simulating the mechanism-impaired user interaction using a dynamic multibody system model.

A wall-mounted test stand of an actuated elbow joint was built up to evaluate the proposed sensors and control algorithms. By using a torque sensor in the elbow joint as reference it is shown that low cost force sensors in the forearm can be used to measure the human-robot interaction. A torque-based and a velocity-based impedance control approach are compared which allow the user to move freely while not handling any loads and which also allow to incorporate a human command signal for regulation of force support.

Yet, it is still a controversial issue in education and has received several criticisms. The existing literature suggests that when gamification is designed well and utilized correctly, it has potential to improve learning, but qualitative investigations are required in order to reveal how a wide range of game elements fit into different learning contexts. In order to address this gap, this qualitative study aims to explore students' overall perceptions about various game elements in a gamified instructional technology and material development course within a teacher education context. Based on the data gathered via interviews, observation, and documents (n = 118) for one academic year, the study examines possible impacts of game elements and how they should be designed and implemented from the students’ perspectives. The results yielded nine main themes: challenge, narrative, leaderboard, reward, badge, teams, win-state, points, and constraints.

This paper attempts to assist the evaluators by automating the evaluation task against a number of design heuristics. The paper presents a development of a usability evaluation tool for Android applications by inspecting source code and reporting locations in the code where violations of heuristics are found.

However, observations from different domains (e.g. healthcare, business, etc.) have suggested that collaboration sometimes involves people with differing levels of access to underlying information. This type of scenario has been referred to as Multi-Level Collaborative Information Retrieval (MLCIR). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of awareness, an existing CIR/CIS concept, on MLCIR. To address this gap in current knowledge, we conducted two separate user studies using a total of 5 different collaborative search interfaces and 3 information access scenarios. A number of Information Retrieval (IR), CIS and CIR evaluation metrics, as well as questionnaires were used to compare the interfaces. Design interviews were also conducted after evaluations to obtain qualitative feedback from participants. Results suggested that query properties such as time spent on query, query popularity and query effectiveness could allow users to obtain information about team's search performance and implicitly suggest better queries without disclosing sensitive data. Besides, having access to a history of intersecting viewed, relevant and bookmarked documents could provide similar positive effect as query properties. Also, it was found that being able to easily identify different team members and their actions is important for users in MLCIR. Based on our findings, we provide important design recommendations to help develop new CIR and MLCIR interfaces. © 2017","Awareness; Collaborative search; Information access; Multi-level collaboration; Non-uniform access","Surveys; Awareness; Collaborative searches; Information access; Multilevels; Non-uniform access; Information retrieval",2-s2.0-85030251624

Some CI users can communicate over the phone and even understand speech with some background noise, whereas some other CI users do not obtain the same benefit from the device. Due to differences in the interface between the electrodes and the auditory nerves, the best settings of the CI may be different for each user. In order to improve the fitting of CIs and to understand the electrode-nerve interface, a user-specific model of the auditory nerve activity has been developed. The model is based on a combination of existing models found in the literature. This chapter presents the basic components of the model: A three-dimensional finite element method to estimate the voltage distribution in the cochlea; and an auditory nerve model based on multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-type equations fitted to known electrophysiological measurements. Using the above described model, intracochlear voltage distributions are reproduced. Additionally, amplitude growth functions of the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) were simulated using an artifact rejection forward masking paradigm. The model has been parameterized such that it can be personalized to each CI user by fitting its parameters to predict the individual voltage distributions and amplitude growth functions. The modeling results show that different amounts of nerve density and nerve degeneration lead to different shapes in the amplitude growth function. The future goal of the model is to create a tool to predict the most comfortable level of each CI user and to fit CI parameters in a personalized clinical situation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,"Acoustics; Audition; Cochlear implants; Digital signal processors; Electrodes; Electrophysiology; Voltage distribution measurement; Voltage dividers; Artifact rejections; Clinical situations; Cochlear implant (CIs); Evoked compound action potential; Nerve degeneration; Parametric modeling; Three-dimensional finite element method; Voltage distribution; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85028914134

The customers of these closed software service platforms are locked-in. Potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, are hesitant to adopt a closed software service platform, slowing down the wide deployment of the software service platform. This paper applies an economic perspective to investigate the value creation for providers and users at different levels of interoperability. For the analysis, a value creation model for software service platforms within a software service ecosystem has been developed. Simulations of the value creation model show that, even if investments in interoperability and portability are aimed at addressing user requirements, their impact also drives the providers’ profitability. Furthermore, emerging providers require investing more than market leading providers, as they have less power to set de facto standards. The simulation results also show that there is an optimal level of investments, with respect to profit and return on investments. Overall, from these results, platform providers cannot only obtain an understanding on how investments in interoperability and portability impact cost, enable cost-effective service integration, and create value, but also design new strategies for optimizing investments. © 2017 The Authors","Cloud computing; Computational economics; Interoperability; Investment assessment; Net present value; Portability; Return on investments; Simulation; Software service platform; Value analysis; Value creation model","Cloud computing; Computer software; Computer software portability; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Digital storage; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Investments; Locks (fasteners); Profitability; Value engineering; Computational economics; Investment assessment; Net present value; Re-turn-on; Simulation; Software services; Value creation; Interoperability",2-s2.0-85020398369

This allows users to choose any service provided by the SOA without knowing implementation details, thus making coding easier and more flexible. Web services are basic units of SOA. However, the functionality of a single Web service is limited, and usually cannot completely satisfy the actual demand. Hence, it is necessary to coordinate multiple independent Web services to achieve complex business processes. Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (WS-BPEL) makes the coordination possible, by helping the integration of multiple Web services and providing an interface for users to invoke. When coordinating these services, however, illegal or faulty operations may be encountered, but current tools are not yet powerful enough to support the localisation and removal of these problems. In this paper, we propose a fault localisation technique for WS-BPEL programs based on predicate switching and program slicing, allowing developers to more precisely locate the suspicious faulty code. Case studies were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, which was compared with predicate switching only, slicing only, and one existing fault localisation technique, namely Tarantula.

For this, we again design an appropriate experimental setup and record the responses of several users to piecewise constant haptic signals. In order to predict the labels of the responses, we have used the Weber, level crossing, and conic section-based classifiers. It has been found that similar to 1-D haptic signal, the level crossing classifier performs better than the Weber classifier for all users. Thus, the level crossing classifier-based sampler turns out to be a good candidate for perceptually adaptive sampling mechanism for 2-D haptic data also. Further, we study the possible structures of the perceptual deadzone for 2-D haptic data and examine whether the deadzone depends on the direction of the kinesthetic force stimulus. The level crossing classifier defines the best fit deadzone around a reference vector to be circular, while the Weber classifier makes the radius a function of its current magnitude. A competing conic section-based classifier makes the kinesthetic deadzone directionally sensitive. It is demonstrated that the kinesthetic perception is circularly symmetric and is independent of the direction of the force stimulus. Hence, a user does not have any directional preference while perceiving any change in the kinesthetic stimulus. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-85032587843

If the assumption is not correct, the perceptual limitations of a human being are not fully exploited by the fixed Weber fraction. For example, if the signal changes very slowly, it is difficult for a user to react to the change, and when the change is too quick, the user may not be able to respond because of nonzero human response time (minimum time required for reacting to a change). Thus, a fixed Weber fraction will contribute inessential data packets for such kind of signals. This leads us to examine how the perceptual deadzone is affected by the rate of change in the kinesthetic force stimulus. In this chapter, we take up this particular study. For this purpose, we design an experiment where a user is exposed to either a linearly increasing (positive slope) or decreasing (negative slope) haptic force stimulus with a varying slope S, and is asked to react to the change. We intend to find a decision boundary as a function of the rate of change of stimulus (slope) to compute the Weber fraction. We apply both parametric and nonparametric classifiers on the recorded data to estimate the best-fit decision boundary. We demonstrate that the Weber fraction decreases monotonically with an increase in the slope for both positive and negative regions. It means that as the slope is increased, the change in the signal is more easily perceivable. We also demonstrate that there is an asymmetric behavior of perception between the increasing and the decreasing force stimuli. Hence, it has been shown that the assumption of a fixed Weber fraction for a user is not correct and it is a monotonic function of the temporal variation of the stimulus. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-85032581584

Hence, there is no need to transmit the second force sample to the operator. Thus, for haptic transmission in a teleoperation, the temporal resolution Tr needs also to be considered while effecting perceptually adaptive sampling. In this chapter, we estimate the temporal resolution Tr for the kinesthetic stimulus. For that purpose, we define an experimental setup where a user is subjected to a specific type of kinesthetic force stimulus. The force stimulus has two perceptually significant consecutive jumps separated by a variable time spacing. The user is asked to respond whenever she can perceive the discontinuity between the jumps by pressing a button of the stylus. If for a particular time spacing, the jump discontinuity is perceived, the user response is labeled as 1, and −1 otherwise. In this way, we record the labeled haptic responses for several users. In order to estimate the temporal resolution Tr, we use a classical psychometric approach. It is observed that Tr lies between 17 and 37 ms for different users. Further, we also study how the physical fatigue (possibly including the effect of boredom) of muscles affects the temporal resolvability of a human operator in perceiving the jump discontinuity. It is observed that the resolvability in perceiving the jump discontinuity decreases by about 30 % due to the fatigue. Hence, the fatigue does affect the temporal resolvability significantly. In order to alleviate this problem during teleoperation, it is recommended that the robot should be slowed down accordingly if a task is to be carried out over a longer period. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-85032585262

Ecosystem science is advanced as a collective umbrella to capture a body of work and approaches rooted in social-ecological systems thinking, spawning a distinctive ecosystem terminology: ecosystem approach, ecosystem services, ecosystem services framework and natural capital. The interface between spatial planning and ecosystem science is explored as a theoretical opportunity space to improve mainstreaming processes adapting Rogers’ (2003) diffusion model. We introduce the twin concepts of hooks (linking ecosystem science to a key policy or legislative term, duty or priority that relate to a particular user group) and ‘bridges’ (linking ecosystem science to a term, concept or policy priority that is used and readily understood across multiple groups and publics) as translational mechanisms in transdisciplinary mainstreaming settings. We argue that ecosystem science can be embedded into the existing work priorities and vocabularies of spatial planning practice using these hooks and bridges. The resultant framework for mainstreaming is then tested, drawing on research funded as part of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment Follow-On programme (2012–2014), within 4 case studies; each reflecting different capacities, capabilities, opportunities and barriers. The results reveal the importance of leadership, political buy in, willingness to experiment outside established comfort zones and social learning as core drivers supporting mainstreaming processes. Whilst there are still significant challenges in mainstreaming in spatial planning settings, the identification and use of hooks and bridges collectively, enables traction to be gained for further advances; moving beyond the status quo to generate additionality and potential behaviour change within different modes of mainstreaming practice. This pragmatic approach has global application to help improve the way nature is respected and taken account of in planning systems nationally and globally. © 2017","Ecosystem approach; Ecosystem science; Ecosystem services; Environmental governance; Mainstreaming; Nature; Spatial planning",,2-s2.0-85032301645

New method This study aimed to develop and validate an open-source software for TMS coil navigation. StimTrack uses an optical tracker and an intuitive user interface to facilitate the maintenance of position and orientation of any type of coil within and between sessions. Additionally, online access to navigation data is provided, hereby adding e.g. the ability to start or stop the magnetic stimulator depending on the distance to target or the variation of the orientation angles. Results StimTrack allows repeatable repositioning of the coil within 0.7 mm for translation and <1° for rotation. Stimulus-response (SR) curves obtained from 19 healthy volunteers were used to demonstrate that StimTrack can be effectively used in a typical experiment. An excellent intra and inter-session reliability (ICC > 0.9) was obtained on all parameters computed on SR curves acquired using StimTrack. Comparison with existing method StimTrack showed a target accuracy similar to that of a commercial neuronavigation system (BrainSight, Rogue Research Inc.). Indeed, small differences both in position (∼0.2 mm) and orientation (<1°) were found between the systems. These differences are negligible given the human error involved in landmarks registration. Conclusions StimTrack, available as supplementary material, is found to be a good alternative for commercial neuronavigation systems facilitating assessment changes in corticospinal excitability using TMS. StimTrack allows researchers to tailor its functionality to their specific needs, providing added value that benefits experimental procedures and improves data quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Accuracy; Coil positioning; Intra and inter-session reliability; Motor cortex; Motor evoked potential; Neuronavigation; Repeatability; Transcranial magnetic stimulation","adult; anatomic landmark; Article; controlled study; eye tracking; female; human; human experiment; male; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; nervous system parameters; neuronavigation; position; priority journal; software; stimulus response; transcranial magnetic stimulation",2-s2.0-85029809196

The second method is a questionnaire survey, a questionnaire was administrated to 100 participants aged 45 and over to comprehend their inclination of smart phone functions. The research discovered that some specific smart phone functions were thought to be more imperative for older people. The eleven functions most frequently used by the respondents are calling, display date and time, emergency button, address book, camera, calculator, alarm, contact pictures, wi-fi Internet, calendar and torch. The outcomes of this research can facilitate the design of smart phones for the older populace. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Focus group; Older people; Questionnaire; Smart phone","Ergonomics; Smartphones; Surveys; Development and utilizations; Elderly people; Focus groups; Older People; Questionnaire; Questionnaire surveys; Usage patterns; Utilization patterns; Telephone sets",2-s2.0-85022323582

In many of these heterogeneous scenarios, IoT systems will need to guarantee required levels of reliability and latency in order to provide high-quality services to end users. Quality of service support in IoT system will demand for explicit support at different levels. At the network level, on the one hand, specific technical communication standards will be necessary to ensure timed and reliable data delivery. At the application level, instead, dedicated support from application protocols and design of novel resource allocation algorithms will be mandatory to cope with concurrent access and implement proper management of resources. In this chapter, an overview of the current solutions for ensuring QoS in IoT systems is provided. Specifically, we first survey the current approaches at the network level through a summary of all the mechanisms included in the main communication standards for IoT.

However, there is no empirical evidence on how global landmarks differ from local landmarks when processed and stored in working memory during navigation, and how cognitive demands from concurrent tasks might interfere with learning.

CMPSF membrane was aminated, and a surface-initiating system of –NH2/S2O8 2− was constituted at the interfaces between the amination membrane and aqueous solution containing MAA and ammonium persulfate. By the initiating of the free radicals produced on amination membrane, MAA produces graft-polymerization, forming the grafted membrane PSF-g-PMAA.

A membrane electrode with atrazine-imprinted membrane as sensitive membrane was constituted, and then a galvanic cell was assembled, namely, a potentiometric sensor for atrazine was fabricated. The experimental results show that the atrazine-imprinted membrane has specific recognition ability and excellent binding affinity for atrazine, and the selectivity coefficient of this imprinted membrane for atrazine relative to ametryn is 5.463 and the binding capacity gets up to 243 μg/cm2.

These changes significantly affect the generic activities of the MCR operators, in relation to diagnostic activities. The aim of this paper is to suggest a framework to estimate the probabilities of diagnosis errors in the advanced MCR by updating a time reliability correlation (TRC) model. Using Bayesian inference, the TRC model was updated with the probabilities of diagnosis errors. Here, the diagnosis error data were collected from a full-scope simulator of the advanced MCR. To do this, diagnosis errors were determined based on an information processing model and their probabilities were calculated. However, these calculated probabilities of diagnosis errors were largely affected by context factors such as procedures, HSI, training, and others, known as PSFs (Performance Shaping Factors). In order to obtain the nominal diagnosis error probabilities, the weightings of PSFs were also evaluated. Then, with the nominal diagnosis error probabilities, the TRC model was updated.

However, failure to adhere to procedures has resulted in major incidents. While there have been multiple studies investigating procedures in the aviation and nuclear industries, a comprehensive study of the high-risk industries’ use of written procedures is largely absent. This paper documents one part of a large-scale project that addresses this gap by investigating the issues with procedure forms, usage, adoption, and challenges in a wide range of high-risk industries. A grounded theory approach in qualitative data analysis was used to examine 72 interviews with operators of varying roles and experiences across 6 countries and an offshore drilling vessel. Findings reaffirm previous research, suggesting an explanation for the lack of use of procedures due to the abundance of outdated procedures and procedures plagued by information overload. New findings suggest that frequency of the task and the experience level of the worker would impact workers’ procedure use. Other unintended consequences associated with written procedural systems included reactive organizational behavior surrounding procedures and a general disconnect between the users and the writers of these documents. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Grounded theory; Interview analysis; Operating procedure; Petrochemical; Process industries; Process safety management","Accident prevention; Data handling; Information analysis; Nuclear industry; Offshore drilling; Petrochemicals; Safety engineering; Grounded theory; Interview analysis; Operating procedure; Process industries; Process safety management; Risk assessment",2-s2.0-85030712371

Social media and smartphones are frequently used by this demographic and could serve as an engaging medium for nutrition promotion. Five focus groups were conducted to capture participants' perceptions of a theory-based gamified self-monitoring app for improving vegetable intake of young adults. Ranking activities were used to gather feedback on preferences for social media posts. Data arising from group discussion were analysed using NVivo software using a deductive approach to group common ideas into themes. Thirty two participants (14 males) attended (mean age 23.1 (SD 2.7) years). Qualitative analyses of open discussion revealed two major themes regarding preferred features for a smartphone app; (1) the use of visual guides for estimating quantities of vegetables and tracking progress, and (2) a simple interface. Gamification strategies such as earning badges were viewed more positively than the use of a self-reward framework. Social media posts which presented food pictures and recipes were ranked most motivating, while awareness-raising posts received lower scores. Participants indicated a preference for viewing but reluctance to post information onto social media. “Just in time” situational cues were ranked highly and the use of an “authoritative” tone was preferred and associated with credibility. Young adults also ranked messages containing “Gen Y” language highly, with a preference for those which were personally relevant. The proposed use of social media and mobile-gaming was seen as an acceptable approach for improving vegetable intake.

From an information retrieval perspective, FAQ retrieval is a challenging task, mainly because of the lexical gap that exists between a query and an FAQ pair, both of which are typically very short. In this work, we explore the use of supervised learning to rank to improve the performance of domain-specific FAQ retrieval. While supervised learning-to-rank models have been shown to yield effective retrieval performance, they require costly human-labeled training data in the form of document relevance judgments or question paraphrases. We investigate how this labeling effort can be reduced using a labeling strategy geared toward the manual creation of query paraphrases rather than the more time-consuming relevance judgments. In particular, we investigate two such strategies, and test them by applying supervised ranking models to two domain-specific FAQ retrieval data sets, showcasing typical FAQ retrieval scenarios. Our experiments show that supervised ranking models can yield significant improvements in the precision-at-rank-5 measure compared to unsupervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that a supervised model trained using data labeled via a low-effort paraphrase-focused strategy has the same performance as that of the same model trained using fully labeled data, indicating that the strategy is effective at reducing the labeling effort while retaining the performance gains of the supervised approach.

To efficiently handle this collective intelligence, several processes have naturally emerged. Crowdsourcing is one of them. By using crowdsourcing, the undertaking of a task can be proposed by a person or organization to the crowd that composes Internet. Although these proposed tasks could vary in their requirements for successful accomplishment, any crowdsourcing initiative always includes different benefits for the promoters of the initiatives and one or more rewards for each person of the crowd. These rewards play a key role because their evaluation by the crowd will condition the number, the interest and the implication of participants in the initiative. To design and model the interaction between the crowd and the initiative promoter, game theory appears as a suitable tool. In this chapter, the close relationship between crowdsourcing and co-utility, a type of collaborative interaction defined in terms of game theory, will be studied.

This model, which is referred to as FFC-QUAL, was modified from the existing ILLUDAS model and added for use during the water-quality analysis process for dry and rainy periods. For the dry period, the specifications of the coefficients for the discharge and water quality were used. During rainfall, we used the Clark and time–area methods for the runoff analyses of pervious and impervious areas to consider the effects of the subbasin shape; moreover, four pollutant accumulation methods and the washoff equation for computing the water quality each time were used. According to the verification results, FFC-QUAL provides generally similar output as the measured data for the peak flow, total runoff volume, total loadings, peak concentration, and time of peak concentration for three rainfall events in the Gunja subbasin. In comparison with the ILLUDAS, SWMM, and MOUSE models, there is little difference between these models and the model developed in this study. The proposed model should be useful in urban watersheds because of its simplicity and its capacity to model common pollutants (e.g., biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, Escherichia coli, suspended solids, and total nitrogen and phosphorous) in runoff.

In this sense, the inhibition of certain PDPKs is considered a promising strategy to elaborate therapies against AD. The structures of the most important PDPKs are available as high-resolution X-ray crystals; many of them are co-complexed with inhibitors. This information is very valuable because it constitutes a source for creating additional structural information with the aid of molecular modeling methods. Molecular modeling includes methodologies such as docking, molecular dynamics (MD), free energy calculations, etc. that allow accessing to other properties such as the effects of water media, conformational sampling, and binding energy estimations. More importantly, these methods allow to use the available structural information for generating the structures of novel complexes, which can contribute to the rational design of novel inhibitors.

Central to this dynamic HRA approach is a representation of the human operator comprised of actions and the time course over which those actions are performed. The success or failure of tasks is time dependent, and therefore modeling different times at which the operator completes actions helps predict how timing differences affect the human error potential for a given task. To model the operators’ timing variability, Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules (GOMS) task level primitives were developed based on simulator logs of operators completing multiple scenarios. The logs have sufficient detail to determine the timing information for procedure steps and to map the procedure steps into the task level primitives. The task level primitives can then be applied to other procedures that were not evaluated, since they represent generic task level actions applicable to all procedure steps.

Why is this? Automation is often brittle, requiring constant human oversight to assure it operates as intended. This oversight has become harder as automation has become more complicated. To resolve this problem, Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) has been proposed. HAT is based on advances in providing automation transparency, a method for giving insight into the reasoning behind automated recommendations and actions, along with advances in human automation communications (e.g., voice). These, in turn, permit more trust in the automation when appropriate, and less when not, allowing a more targeted supervision of automated functions. This paper proposes a framework for HAT, incorporating three key tenets: transparency, bi-directional communication, and operator directed authority. These tenets, along with more capable automation, represent a shift in human-automation relations. © Springer International Publishing AG (outside the USA) 2018.","Automation; Human factors; Human-autonomy teaming","Human engineering; Transparency; Automated functions; Bi-directional communication; Human oversight; Human-autonomy teaming; Automation",2-s2.0-85021811386

Studies have identified glance patterns related to such interactions, and manual radio tuning has been used as a reference task to set an upper bound on the acceptable demand of interactions. Consequently, some view the risk associated with radio tuning as defining the upper limit of glance measures associated with visual-manual in-vehicle activities. However, we have little knowledge about the actual degree of crash risk that radio tuning poses and, by extension, the risk of tasks that have similar glance patterns as the radio tuning task. In the current study, we use counterfactual simulation to take the glance patterns for manual radio tuning tasks from an on-road experiment and apply these patterns to lead-vehicle events observed in naturalistic driving studies. We then quantify how often the glance patterns from radio tuning are associated with rear-end crashes, compared to driving only situations. We used the pre-crash kinematics from 34 crash events from the SHRP2 naturalistic driving study to investigate the effect of radio tuning in crash-imminent situations, and we also investigated the effect of radio tuning on 2,475 routine braking events from the Safety Pilot project. The counterfactual simulation showed that off-road glances transform some near-crashes that could have been avoided into crashes, and glance patterns observed in on-road radio tuning experiment produced 2.85–5.00 times more crashes than baseline driving. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crash risk; Driver distraction; Naturalistic driving data; Radio tuning","Automobile television equipment; Off road vehicles; Risk assessment; Roads and streets; Transportation; Crash risk; Driver distractions; Entertainment systems; Naturalistic driving data; Naturalistic driving studies; Pilot projects; Rear-end crashes; Vehicle activity; Tuning",2-s2.0-85032291305

Post-test fractographic analyses indicate the crack growth in the laminate characterized by four distinct stages. The crack initially propagates in the first layer as a semi-elliptical surface crack (Stage I). After the surface crack penetrates the first layer, the crack becomes a through crack, which continues propagating in the first layer (Stage II). When the through crack arrives at the boundary of the first unbonded zone, it evolves into a part-through crack, during which crack growth rate keeps decreasing (Stage III). After that, the crack propagates as a part-through crack until the laminate fractures (Stage IV). It also indicates that the crack-growth-deceleration effect of the first unbonded zone is of more significance compared with the other unbonded zones. With the marker bands on the fractography, FCG data was obtained. Then we used the finite element method to calculate stress intensity factors for the laminates and obtained the relationship between FCG rate (da/dN) and stress intensity factor range (ΔK). The analysis on the da/dN-ΔK curve shows that the decrease in ΔK is an important factor, although not the sole factor, contributing to the crack growth deceleration near the boundary of the unbonded zone. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Diffusion bonding; Fatigue crack growth; Laminate; Ti-6Al-4V; Unbonded zone","Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Diffusion; Diffusion bonding; Fatigue crack propagation; Finite element method; Fracture mechanics; Laminates; Stress intensity factors; Surface defects; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Bonded laminates; Fractographic analysis; Initial cracks; Part-through cracks; Semi-elliptical surface cracks; Stress intensity factor range; Through cracks; Ti-6 Al-4 V; Cracks",2-s2.0-85029702322

Lubricated squeeze flow (LSF) tests were conducted on a model saturated ballotini paste prepared with a viscous Newtonian binder, at plate speeds spanning two decades. The tests were simulated using a two-dimensional (2-D) axisymmetric finite element model with adaptive remeshing to circumvent mesh distortion. The paste was modelled as a viscoplastic soil (Drucker-Prager) to capture both rate-dependent effects at high shear rates and LPM at low shear rates. Capillary pressure was applied at the evolving free surface and the plate surfaces were modelled as frictionless for simplicity. Reasonable agreement was obtained between the measured and predicted squeezing pressure profiles at the highest solids volume fraction tested (ϕs = 60%). Agreement was poor at the lowest ϕs (52.5%), which was due to this paste formulation behaving as a suspension/slurry without a distinct yield stress. For the first time, the predicted squeezing pressure was resolved into components using an energy analysis. The squeezing pressure was dominated by the work required to deform the paste in the gap. This result is specific to highly viscoplastic pastes and persisted to small plate separations when most of the sample lay outside the plates. Characterisation of the yield stress from the ‘shoulder’ in the squeezing pressure profile was reasonably accurate at h/h0 ≥ 96% (9% estimated error). LPM was neither observed nor predicted at the plate speeds tested, despite the favourable pore pressure driving force, due to the high binder viscosity and the zero dilation angle in the simulations. The flow field was characterised using a novel flow mode parameter derived from the shear rate tensor. The paste was predicted to undergo pure biaxial extension between the smooth plates, and for the first time was predicted to undergo pure uniaxial extension external to the plates and (briefly) pure shear at the boundary. © 2017 The Author(s)","Drucker-Prager (DP); Finite element modelling (FEM); Liquid phase migration (LPM); Lubricated squeeze flow (LSF); Soil mechanics; Viscoplasticity","Binders; Bins; Lubrication; Pressure; Shear deformation; Shear flow; Soil mechanics; Soils; Suspensions (fluids); Viscoplasticity; Yield stress; Axisymmetric finite elements; Drucker-Prager; Finite element modelling; Liquid Phase; Rate-dependent effects; Rheological behaviour; Solids volume fraction; Squeeze flow; Finite element method; capillary pressure; shear rate; simulation; soil; stress; suspension; velocity",2-s2.0-85031722862

The transparent and comprehensive nature of FCMs provides several advantages that are appreciated for decision-maker. In spite of this fact, FCMs also have some features that are hard to match with time series prediction, resulting in a prediction power that is probably not as extensive as other techniques can boast. By introducing some ideas from ARIMA models, this paper aims at overcoming some of these concerns. The proposed model is evaluated on a real-world case study, captured in a dataset of crime registrations in the Belgian province of Antwerp. The results have shown that our proposal is capable of predicting multiple steps ahead in an entire system of fluctuating time series. However, these enhancements come at the cost of a lower prediction accuracy and less transparency than standard FCM models can achieve.

Thus, many efficient techniques are widely adopted to estimate the future states of a system at every point in time to get the desired performance levels. Kalman filter is a popular and an efficient method for online estimations for linear measurements. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), on the other hand, is more suited for nonlinear measurements. However, EKF algorithm is well known to be computationally intensive, and may not achieve the strict requirements of real time applications. This issue has motivated researchers to consider the use of parallel processing platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) to meet the real time requirements. This paper provides an optimized parallel architecture for EKF using FPGA. Our approach exploits many optimization and parallel techniques such as pipelining, loop unrolling, dataflow, and inlining; and utilizes the inherently parallel architecture nature of FPGAs to accelerate the estimation process. Our experimental analyses show that our optimized implementation of EKF can achieve better results when compared to other implementations using GPU and multicore platforms. Moreover, higher performance levels can be achieved when operating on larger data sizes. This is due to our proposed optimization techniques that we have applied, and the exploited inherent parallelism among EKF operations. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","data modeling; data prediction; extended Kalman filter; field-programmable gate array (FPGA); high level synthesis tools (HLS Tools); optimization techniques; parallel architecture; time series analysis; Tracking algorithms","Bandpass filters; Data structures; Extended Kalman filters; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Graphics processing unit; High level synthesis; Logic gates; Optimization; Parallel architectures; Program processors; Signal receivers; Time series analysis; Tracking (position); Data prediction; Graphic processing units (GPUs); Optimization techniques; Optimized implementation; Parallel implementations; Real time requirement; Real-time application; Tracking algorithm; Kalman filters",2-s2.0-85020210332

We perform experiments using monotonic and cyclic indentation tests with a ball indenter (i.e., cyclic spherical indentation). During the tests, the acoustic emission (AE) method is utilized to detect micro-scale damage in contact fractures. For monotonic contact loading, we determine the critical contact load when the radial crack initiates. It is found that radial cracks occur outside the contact zone (outside of the impression crater). Next, cyclic contact loading is performed, and it is found that the crack propagates with the increasing number of cycles. This fatigue crack growth can be captured by the AE method. In addition, a finite element method (FEM) is used to elucidate the stress distribution of crack initiation and crack propagation during both indentation loadings. FEM computation with a damage-based cohesive zone model (CZM) is carried out to simulate crack growth during cyclic indentation tests. The cohesive model follows a linear damage-dependent traction–separation relationship coupled with a damage evolution equation. It is found that our computation successfully simulates fatigue crack growth. By using the comprehensive experimental/computational framework, the nucleation process (mechanism) of such a complicated crack system is clarified. This methodology may be useful for examining crack propagation of other brittle materials under both monotonic and cyclic contact loadings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Concrete mortar; Contact fracture; Cyclic loading; Damage-based cohesive zone model; Fatigue crack growth; Finite element method; Indentation","Concretes; Crack propagation; Cracks; Cyclic loads; Fatigue crack propagation; Fatigue damage; Finite element method; Fracture; Indentation; Mortar; Cohesive zone model; Computational model; Contact fracture; Cyclic indentation; Damage evolution equation; Monotonic-and-cyclic contact loading; Nucleation process; Spherical indentations; Acoustic emission testing",2-s2.0-85031754726

Recently, enamel and dentinal surface remineralization using hydroxyapatite nano- and microparticles has been proposed; however, commercial remineralizing toothpastes are quite expensive, mostly due to the high costs of hydroxyapatite. Hence, we propose a thermoresponsive hybrid nanocomposite material as filler for tooth defects. The use of thermoresponsive composite particles aims at filling exposed dentinal tubules in response to a change of temperature in the oral cavity. In addition, the presence of the organic matrix contributes to the occlusion of the dentinal tubules, therefore reducing the needed amount of hydroxyapatite. Experiments Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide microgels containing different amounts of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were prepared via radical polymerization in the presence of N-N′-methylenebisacrylamide as cross-linker followed by mechanical grinding. The nano- and microstructure of the hydrogels and their thermal behavior were studied via small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Defected teeth were treated with a dispersion of nanocomposite microparticles to simulate toothpaste action. Findings The hydrogels maintain their structure and thermal responsiveness when loaded with an amount of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles up to 2.3% w/w. In addition, the lower critical solution temperature is not affected by the presence of the mineral particles. Exposed dentinal tubules on the surface of test tooth samples were successfully occluded after 15 cycles of treatment with a dispersion of nanocomposite microparticles alternated with washing steps. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Composite material; Enamel restoration; Hydrogel; Hydroxyapatite; Microgel; PNIPAm; Thermoresponsive","Acrylic monomers; Amides; Beverages; Composite materials; Differential scanning calorimetry; Dispersions; Enamels; Gels; Hydroxyapatite; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray scattering; Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles; Lower critical solution temperature; Methylene bisacrylamide; Microgel; Nanocomposite microparticles; PNIPAm; Poly n-isopropylacrylamide; Thermo-responsive; Hydrogels; hydroxyapatite; n,n' methylenebisacrylamide; nanocomposite; poly(n isopropylacrylamide); Article; freeze drying; hydrogel; mouth cavity; nonhuman; physical chemistry; porosity; priority journal; structure analysis; surface charge; synthesis; temperature sensitivity; tooth filling; viscosity",2-s2.0-85028969350

In this paper, we propose an ‘Intelligent Cry Detection Robotic System’ (ICDRS) for real-monitoring of child-beating in classrooms, in order to facilitate prevention of child-abuse prevalent in this form. The proposed system has two major modules: the ‘Cry-Detection System’ (CDS) and a ‘Smart Robotic System’ (SRS) equipped with audio-visual sensors. The CDS unit present in the classroom, consist of three parts. First, the cry-recording unit (CRU) records the audio signals and sends to ‘Signal Processing Unit’ (SPU). Then SPU applies signal processing techniques, and intelligently detects the cry events using the features extracted from the acoustic signal. If the system detects a cry, then it further sends the control commands to the ‘Signal Transmission Unit’ (STU), which sends an automatic SMS to the Vice-Principal or Supervisor-Teacher, i.e., the person-in-charge, thereby alerting him/her about the child cry in a particular classroom. The controlling person can give control-commands to the SRS from a web-application and can get the live-stream of the video from the classroom. A Wi-Fi module acts to facilitate the communication between this controller and the Robot (SRS). The initial performance evaluation results are very much encouraging. The proposed system can have potential applications in the schools, hospitals and child care centers etc. Hopefully, this prototype can be a useful step towards preventing child-abuse, prevalent in different forms in our society. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Cry analysis; Cry detection robot; Cry signal; Energy; Remote control operation; WiFi controlled","Education; Intelligent robots; Remote control; Robotics; Robots; Signal detection; Signal processing; Speech communication; Speech processing; Teaching; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Cry analysis; Detection robots; Energy; Real-time application; Real-time communication; Remote control operations; Signal processing technique; Signal processing unit; Audio signal processing",2-s2.0-85030170970

The effect of different operating parameters/strategies such as addition of surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), at different concentrations, quantity of oil phase, applied power, sonication time and duty cycle on the droplet size have been investigated. The stability of emulsion was analyzed in terms of the fraction of the emulsion that remains stable for a period of 28 days. Optimized set of major emulsification process variables has been used at higher emulsion volumes. The effectiveness of treatment approach was analyzed based on oil droplet size, energy density and the time required for the formation of stable emulsion. It was observed that the stable emulsion at 50 mL capacity with mean droplet diameter of about 235.4 nm was obtained with the surfactant concentration of 5 mg/mL, 11% of rated power (power density: 0.31 W/mL) and irradiation time of 5 min. The emulsion stability was higher in the case of ultrasound assisted approach as compared to the stirring. For the preparation of stable emulsion at 300 mL capacity, it was observed that the sequential approach, i.e., stirring followed by ultrasound, gave lower mean droplet diameter (232.6 nm) than the simultaneous approach, i.e., ultrasound and stirring together (257.9 nm). However, the study also revealed that the simultaneous approach required very less time (15 min) to synthesize stable emulsion as compared to the sequential approach (30 min stirring and 60 min ultrasound).

Local Search (LS) is an essential component for some metaheuristics and, very often, represents the dominant computational effort accomplished by an algorithm. Several metaheuristic approaches try to adapt traditional LS models to parallel platforms without considering the intrinsic features of the available architectures. In this work, we present a novel local search strategy, so-called Distributed Variable Neighborhood Descent (DVND), specially designed for CPU and multi-GPU environment. Furthermore, a new neighborhood search strategy, so-called Multi Improvement, is introduced, taking advantage of GPU massive parallelism in order to boost up LS procedures.

For tackling this problem, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm is considered, which combines good quality initial solutions, generated by a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures, with a flexible and powerful refinement procedure, inside the scope of an Iterated Local Search. The DVND was compared to the classic local search procedures, producing results that outperformed the best known sequential algorithm found in the literature.

We performed the LPO with the data of the benchmarks IAEA-3D and BIBLIS-2D. The Reactor Physics code RECNOD, which was used in previous works for the optimization of Angra 1 NPP in Brazil, was also used for further comparison. Four Optimization Metaheuristics (OMHs) were applied to those problems: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Cross-Entropy algorithm (CE), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL). For IAEA-3D, the best algorithm was the ABC. For BIBLIS-2D, PBIL was the best OMH. For Angra 1 / RECNOD optimization problem, PBIL, ABC and CE were the best OMHs. © 2017","Loading Pattern Optimization; Nuclear fuel; Nuclear Power Plant; Optimization Metaheuristics; Pressurized water reactor","Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pressurized water reactors; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Energy productions; In-Core fuel Management optimizations; Loading patterns; Meta heuristics; Optimization problems; Population based incremental learning; Reproducibilities; Optimization",2-s2.0-85029600054

During curing, the thermoplastic film partially penetrates in the first layer of the thermosetting composite, leading to macro-mechanical interlocking as the main connection mechanism between the thermoplastic film and the underlying composite. After curing, the thermosetting composite joints with the thermoplastic modified surface can be assembled by welding. Welding of the TSC-TSC joints is performed by ultrasonic and induction welding. The weld strength is investigated by morphological characterization of cross sections and failure surfaces and by mechanical testing. The effect of the thermoplastic film thickness on the welding process and on its outcome is also analyzed. Both induction and ultrasonic welding mostly result in good-quality welded joints. The welding process used as well as the initial thickness of the thermoplastic film are found to have a significant effect on the final thickness of the weld line and on the location of failure.

In this study, an innovative chamfer external trigger was introduced which is different from the traditional chamfer-flat crush-cap to guide the 2D braided tube. To make the material fully destroyed in the impact process, the innovative trigger restricts the space of tube under compression by a semi-circle cavity. A 3D-FE model for impacting processes of thin-walled braided tubes was built to study the effects of geometrical parameters on external trigger guiding tubes. Simulation and analysis of the influence laws of geometrical parameters on the cavity were then carried out. The results show that braided tubes worked with cavity effect can increase the energy absorption efficiency by 53% than traditional crush-cap, and the result and failure mechanism is significantly affected by the ratio of cavity radius of tube thickness(R/t). It is found that as the R/t ratio increases, the amount specimen energy absorption increases sharply then decreases and tend to be stable, while the ratio of peak load to mean load decreases and then increases. These two trends are very instructive for designing effective energy absorption structures using braided tubes with this innovative external trigger © 2018","Braided composites; Cavity effection; Crashworthiness; Specific energy absorption","Composite materials; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Geometry; Thin walled structures; Braided composites; Braided composites tubes; Cavity effection; Crash energy absorption; Energy absorption efficiency; Impacting process; Simulation and analysis; Specific energy absorption; Tubes (components)",2-s2.0-85027698467

For cardiac disease patients’ investigation, nonlinear modeling and analysis can keep track in real time and foresee possible changes in circadian heart rate. The current work presents a novel created software system for HRV analysis based on 24-h Holter ECG signals of group of healthy and unhealthy subjects. The nonlinear analysis of heart intervals was performed with the implementation of original high performance algorithms and software to quantify the heart rate irregularity. The proposed software system achieved the short time ability for parametric estimation of patients’ cardiac status. It is based on long-term (24-h) Holter ECG signals with implementation of mathematical nonlinear methods.

The current study demonstrates the development of an autonomous character (AC) in karate kumite, which performs attacks against a freely moving, real athlete. The development of the AC consists of four steps: selection of relevant karate techniques, development of a decision system, creation of an animated model of the AC, and the evaluation. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and a Head Mounted Display (HMD) were chosen for the VE. The evaluation of the AC in the VEs was conducted by expert interviews (n = 6). The results reveal a feeling of comfort for all athletes in VR which underpins a high degree of realism in the VEs. Moreover, the HMDs are seen as more suitable than CAVEs for presenting a karate specific environment. Based on these results the developed AC seems applicable for anticipation research and training in karate kumite. The discussion includes further possible improvements for the AC as well as future directions for further investigations and training programs using the AC.

The printing process is optimized into several directions using as an example binary mixtures of Zn2+ and Fe3+ salts as precursors. Firstly, temporary barrier layers from eicosane are printed to confine the spots to a particular region and to allow larger drop sizes without merging of neighboring droplets. Secondly, a glycerol droplet is printed before the application of metal salts to serve as a carrier liquid that is non-volatile at room temperature. The metal salt solutions are printed from ethylene glycol solutions into the carrier droplets. With these precautions, the drop remained as liquid phase on the substrate with their lateral position locked by the eicosane grid. This avoids problems with the early crystallization of metal salts between successive printing and ensured complete mixing of the precursor solution. The liquid drops are then thermally processed by temperature-programmed heating up to 600 °C allowing the sequential drying of the spots, evaporation of the grid structures and formation of ferrites. The same procedure is used to cover macroscopic electrodes with a large number of spots of identical composition to verify hits in laboratory photoelectrochemical cells and to use photocurrent transient and chopped light voltammetry for their further characterization. Structural characterization of the composition (Zn0.17Fe0.83Ox) with highest activity is performed by Raman and photoelectron spectroscopy. The opportunity to use the same printing protocols to form compositional libraries as well as extended single component electrodes allows screening of medium-sized arrays and the fast transition to more in depth single component experimentation using exclusively standard laboratory instrumentation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Combinatorial chemistry; Material printing; Oxygen evolution; Raman spectroscopy; Scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy; Solar water splitting; Transition metal oxides; XPS","Binary mixtures; Bioassay; Biochips; C (programming language); Characterization; Drops; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Iron compounds; Liquids; Metals; Microarrays; Paraffins; Photoelectrochemical cells; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Printing; Printing presses; Raman spectroscopy; Salts; Throughput; Transition metals; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc compounds; Combinatorial chemistry; Oxygen evolution; Scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy; Solar water splitting; Transition-metal oxides; Transition metal compounds",2-s2.0-85032684586

Therefore, proposed criteria also concern parameterized triangular norms, discretization points and weights of importance from the rule base.

Therefore, it constitutes an essential research area for the introduction of automated vehicles to road traffic. In this study, we investigated the influence of trust promoting (Trust promoted group) and trust lowering (Trust lowered group) introductory information on reported trust, reliance behavior and take-over performance. Forty participants encountered three situations in a 17-min highway drive in a conditionally automated vehicle (SAE Level 3). Situation 1 and Situation 3 were non-critical situations where a take-over was optional. Situation 2 represented a critical situation where a take-over was necessary to avoid a collision. A non-driving-related task (NDRT) was presented between the situations to record the allocation of visual attention. Participants reporting a higher trust level spent less time looking at the road or instrument cluster and more time looking at the NDRT. The manipulation of introductory information resulted in medium differences in reported trust and influenced participants’ reliance behavior. Participants of the Trust promoted group looked less at the road or instrument cluster and more at the NDRT. The odds of participants of the Trust promoted group to overrule the automated driving system in the non-critical situations were 3.65 times (Situation 1) to 5 times (Situation 3) higher. In Situation 2, the Trust promoted group's mean take-over time was extended by 1154 ms and the mean minimum time-to-collision was 933 ms shorter. Six participants from the Trust promoted group compared to no participant of the Trust lowered group collided with the obstacle. The results demonstrate that the individual trust level influences how much drivers monitor the environment while performing an NDRT. Introductory information influences this trust level, reliance on an automated driving system, and if a critical take-over situation can be successfully solved. © 2017","Automated driving; Reliance; Trust in automation","Behavioral research; Roads and streets; Transportation; Automated driving; Automated driving systems; Automated systems; Automated vehicles; Instrument clusters; Key determinants; Reliance; Visual Attention; Automation; adult; automation; clinical article; controlled study; driver; female; highway; human; male; trust; visual attention",2-s2.0-85029816073

A coupled formulation for thermo-hydraulic (TH) processes is presented that implicitly accounts for the mechanical deformation of the poroelastic matrix. The TH model is coupled to a separate mechanical contact model (M) that solves for the fracture contact stresses due to thermoporoelastic compression. Fractures are modelled as surface discontinuities within a three-dimensional matrix. A robust contact model is utilised to resolve the contact tractions between opposing fracture surfaces. Results show that due to the very low thermal diffusivity of the rock matrix, the thermally-induced pore pressure partially dissipates even in the very low-permeability rocks that are found in EGS projects. Therefore, using the undrained thermal expansion coefficient for the matrix may overestimate the volumetric strain of the rock in low-permeability enhanced geothermal systems, whereas using a drained thermal expansion coefficient for the matrix may underestimate the volumetric strain of the rock. An “effective” thermal expansion coefficient can be computed from the drained and undrained values to improve the prediction for the partially-drained matrix. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coupled formulation; Enhanced geothermal systems; Low-permeability rock; Undrained thermal expansion coefficient","End effectors; Expansion; Extraction; Fracture; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Geothermal wells; Injection (oil wells); Petroleum reservoir engineering; Rocks; Thermal expansion; Coupled formulation; Enhanced geothermal systems; Low permeability rock; Mechanical deformation; Surface discontinuities; Thermal expansion coefficients; Thermoporoelastic effect; Three dimensional matrices; Low permeability reservoirs; deformation; diffusivity; extraction method; fluid injection; geothermal system; heating; permeability; pore pressure; thermal expansion; three-dimensional modeling",2-s2.0-85031930937

In this paper, an efficient modal projection-based reduction method, which accounts for transient dynamic responses of structural system with multiple damping models, is proposed in the framework of a modified precise integration method. Two robust modal reduction bases, namely multi-model method (MM) and modal strain energy by first-order correction method (MSEC), are introduced to reduce the order of the original system. Based on the reduced system and a general damping model (GDM), a reduced state-space formalism for the structural system with multiple damping models is developed. Finally, the transient dynamic responses are derived using a modified precise integration method on the reduced stage. The numerical stability, accuracy and complexity are discussed. Two numerical examples are illustrated to assess the performances of the computational accuracy and efficiency.

The results of X-ray single crystal analysis demonstrate that both complexes crystallize in the monoclinic system with P21/n space group and have slightly distorted octahedral geometries. In the complexes, the sq ligand behaves as bis(monodentate) via the oxygen atoms in trans-(μ-O1,O3) mode and the vim ligand coordinates to the metal ions via the ring nitrogen atom as monodentate. The complexes have one-dimensional (1D) polymeric chains constructed from the connecting of metal ions to each other by the sq ligands. The linking of 1D polymeric chains with the hydrogen bonds leads to the formation of two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular structures.

In this way different renewable systems such as photovoltaic, wind, hydrogen and so on, can work together to configure hybrid renewable systems. However, to make them work properly in a holistic way by creating synergies among them is not an easy task. Recently hydrogen technology has appeared as a promising technology to hybridize renewable energy systems, since it allows the generation (by electrolyzers) and storage of hydrogen when there is a surplus of energy in the system, and at a later time (e.g. when there are insufficient renewable resources available) using the stored hydrogen to generate electrical energy by fuel cells. The choice of a correct energy management strategy should guarantee an optimum performance of the whole hybrid renewable system; therefore, it is necessary to know the most important criteria in order to define a management strategy that ensures the best solution from a technical and economic point of view. This paper presents a critical review and analysis of different energy management strategies for hybrid renewable systems based on hydrogen backup.

Researchers have proposed four factors that affect the partitioning decision: device (hardware), application (software), developer and user. However, most existing research efforts focus on the first three factors and pay little attention to the influence of user preferences on the partitioning decision. Among these factors, user preference usually affects user experience most. Moreover, previous work which took into account the other factors cannot generate adaptive partitioning results. In this work, we propose a user-aware partitioning algorithm to offer a personalized and precise partitioning plan for better user experience.

The use of MPTCP in offloading (i.e., multipath offloading) provides the potential to both maintain service connectivity and maximize the usage of the cellular resource. However, current Long Term Evolution (LTE) Policy and Charging Control (PCC) system lacks the ability to realize the coexistence of a cellular path (i.e., primary path) and an alternative path (i.e., secondary path) belonging to the same application session.

With newer and farther reaching applications being developed in built environments, such as smart grids and intelligent transportation systems, users expect high quality of service and thus fairness is an important issue to be addressed. Channel assignment (CA) is the mechanism for allocating radio resources to the nodes and therefore plays a key role in managing fairness in WMNs. Fairness in WMNs depends on how wireless resources are allocated among the nodes. We examine interference models used in existing CA algorithms and find that CA algorithms using these models yield poor fairness because they only reflect local interference between a link and its interfering links. However, flow starvation is due to network wide interference (i.e. global) involving border links and middle links. We propose a novel anti-starvation channel assignment algorithm (ASCA) for planning single radio WMNs. Such ASCA algorithm leverages a new interference model that takes into account both local and global interference. Simulation results show the ASCA algorithm effectively alleviates flow starvation and improves fairness up to 62% compared with the best result from clique-based CA benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ASCA is the first one to optimise CA algorithms with consideration of both local and global interference. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Channel assignment; Fairness; Flow starvation; Integer linear programming; Optimisation; Wireless mesh networks","Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Mesh generation; Optimization; Quality of service; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Channel Assignment; Fairness; Flow starvation; Integer Linear Programming; Optimisations; MESH networking",2-s2.0-85030699071

The stability (such as homoaggregation and heteroaggregation) of Cu NPs in aqueous phase may affect their toxicity. Turbiscan, including three kinds of data processing methods (transmitted intensity (T), variation of average transmitted intensity (ΔT) and Turbiscan stability index (TSI), were used to investigate the homoaggregation and heteroaggregation of Cu NPs with humic acid (HA) and kaolin in aqueous phase. T and TSI were used to analyze Cu NPs-kaolin and Cu NPs-HA-kaolin systems, respectively, whereas T and ΔT were used to analyze Cu NPs and Cu NPs-HA systems. Results showed that the stability of the system is influenced by the dissolution and sedimentation of Cu NPs, and the aggregation and sedimentation of Cu NPs, HA and kaolin. When pH is 4, the dissolution of Cu NPs is the main factor affecting the system stability. Kaolin may reduce the stability of system by sedimentation or impeding the dissolution of Cu NPs. When pH is 8, the aggregation and sedimentation of Cu NPs mainly affect the system stability. Kaolin renders the system unstable by promoting the aggregation of Cu NPs. In addition, HA improves the stability of the system by inhibiting the aggregation of Cu NPs and kaolin when pH = 4 and 8. Ionic strength reduces the stability of system by condensing electric double layer. Therefore, Turbiscan can be used to study both homoaggregation and heteroaggregation in a relatively long period (12 h), and three kinds of data processing methods can be applied based on the properties of the samples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Copper nanoparticles; Heteroaggregation; Homoaggregation; Kaolin; Turbiscan","Accident prevention; Agglomeration; Copper; Data handling; Dissolution; Ionic strength; Kaolin; Metal nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Sedimentation; Aquatic environments; Copper nanoparticles; Data processing methods; Electric double layer; Heteroaggregation; Homoaggregation; Transmitted intensities; Turbiscan; System stability; copper nanoparticle; humic acid; kaolin; Article; data processing; dissolution; heteroaggregation; homoaggregation; ionic strength; pH; physical phenomena; priority journal; sediment; sedimentation; Turbiscan; zeta potential",2-s2.0-85029684686

Hence rigorous kinetics and accurate equilibrium models are required. In this work, the experimental investigations pertaining to adsorption of acid orange 10 dye (AO10) on activated carbon were carried out using Central Composite Design (CCD) strategy. The significant factors that affected adsorption were identified to be solution temperature, solution pH, adsorbent dosage and initial solution concentration. Thermodynamic analysis showed the endothermic nature of the dye adsorption process. The kinetics of adsorption has been rigorously modeled using the Homogeneous Surface Diffusion Model (HSDM) after incorporating the non-linear Freundlich adsorption isotherm.

Deciding which pointcuts have broken due to base-code changes is a daunting venture, especially in large and complex systems. We present an automated approach that recommends pointcuts that are likely to require modification due to a particular base-code change, as well as ones that do not. Our hypothesis is that join points selected by a pointcut exhibit common structural characteristics. Patterns describing such commonality are used to recommend pointcuts that have potentially broken with a degree of confidence as the developer is typing. The approach is implemented as an extension to the popular Mylyn Eclipse IDE plug-in, which maintains focused contexts of entities relevant to the task at hand using a Degree of Interest (DOI) model. We show that it is accurate in revealing broken pointcuts by applying it to multiple versions of several open source projects and evaluating the quality of the recommendations produced against actual modifications.

The social cataloging services allow users to consume items and share their opinions, which influences in not only oneself but other users to choose new items. The recommendation system reduces the problem of the choice by recommending the items considering the behavior of the people and the characteristics of the items. In this study, we propose a tag-based recommendation method considering the emotions reflected in the user's tags. Since the user's estimation of the item is made after consuming the item, the feelings of the user obtained during consuming are directly reflected in ratings and tags. The rating has overall valence on the item, and the tag represents the detailed feelings. Therefore, we assume that the user's rating for an item is the basic emotion of the tag attached to the item, and the emotion of tag is adjusted by the unique emotion value of the tag. We represent the relationships between users, items, and tags as a three-order tensor and apply tensor factorization.

In our new approach the nonconforming element interfaces are not defined by the user, but they are automatically detected by the algorithm if the tangential velocity difference across an element interface is sufficiently large. The grid nodes that are sufficiently far away from a shear wave are moved with a standard node solver, while at the interface we insert a new set of nodes that can slide along the interface in a nonconforming manner. In this way, the elements on both sides of the shear wave can move with a different velocity, without producing highly distorted elements. The core of the proposed method is the use of a space-time conservation formulation in the construction of the final finite volume scheme, which completely avoids the need of an additional remapping stage, hence the new method is a so-called direct ALE scheme. For this purpose, the governing PDE system is rewritten at the aid of the space-time divergence operator and then a fully discrete one-step discretization is obtained by integrating over a set of closed space-time control volumes. The nonconforming sliding of nodes along an edge requires the insertion or the deletion of nodes and edges, and in particular the space-time faces of an element can be shared between more than two cells. Due to the space-time conservation formulation, the geometric conservation law (GCL) is automatically satisfied by construction, even on moving nonconforming meshes. Moreover, the mesh quality remains high and, as a direct consequence, also the time step remains almost constant in time, even for highly sheared vortex flows. In this paper we focus mainly on logically straight slip-line interfaces, but we show also first results for general slide lines that are not logically straight. Second order of accuracy in space and time is obtained by using a MUSCL-Hancock strategy, together with a Barth and Jespersen slope limiter. The accuracy of the new scheme has been further improved by incorporating a special well balancing technique that is able to maintain particular stationary solutions of the governing PDE system up to machine precision. In particular, we consider steady vortex solutions of the shallow water equations, where the pressure gradient is in equilibrium with the centrifugal forces. A large set of different numerical tests has been carried out in order to check the accuracy and the robustness of the new method for both smooth and discontinuous problems. In particular we have compared the results for a steady vortex in equilibrium solved with a standard conforming ALE method (without any rezoning technique) and with our new nonconforming ALE scheme, to show that the new nonconforming scheme is able to avoid mesh distortion in vortex flows even after very long simulation times. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cell-centered Godunov-type finite volume methods; Hyperbolic conservation laws; Moving nonconforming unstructured meshes; Shallow water equations in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates; Slide lines in direct Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods for shear flows; Well balanced methods","Discrete time control systems; Equations of motion; Finite volume method; Lagrange multipliers; Mesh generation; Numerical methods; Physical properties; Shear waves; Vortex flow; Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method; Cartesians; Hyperbolic conservation laws; Unstructured meshes; Well balanced; Shear flow",2-s2.0-85031111022

The cross section (HSC, HSC with steel liners, UHP-FRC) is varied parametrically to study its effect on mass, principal stresses, damage distribution, and plastic deformation. The current investigation considers the worst load case scenario by simulating accidental drops of the containers from a full stack height of 5.00 m. Two different accidental drop scenarios are considered (flat on-base and corner drop). The detailed 3D-FE models have been built considering nonlinear material properties and the simulations are performed using ABAQUS/Explicit. The material constitutive models have been calibrated based experimental tests. Based on the results of numerical comparative study, the UHP-FRC container suffered the least damage level and distribution among the three designs under considered loading cases.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and 1,4-dioxane (DIO) were applied as solvents (Ss), and water was applied as a nonsolvent in the precipitation bath. The polymer solution viscosities, PLA–S–water miscibility regions, and precipitation onsets were measured and related to the Hansen solubility and Flory–Huggins interaction parameters. We observed a morphological transition from fingerlike to spongelike pores when DIO was applied as the S instead NMP or DMSO. The water permeabilities of these membranes were not detectable at a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar, and higher pressures caused them mechanical damage. However, the addition of 5 wt % poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) induced a higher porosity and water permeabilties from 3.14 to 9.38 L m−2 h−1 bar−1. These membranes were characterized by dialysis, and after 6 h, feed concentration reductions of 2% and 17% for bovine serum albumin and lysozyme, respectively, were observed. In vitro degradation tests showed that a 30% mass loss took place after 90 days of incubation, and a faster initial degradation of spongelike membranes occurred. The spongelike membranes presented a higher maximum stress (12.80 MPa) than the fingerlike membranes (∼6 MPa).

Scale-up of transfection processes is key to ensure the necessary quantities for pre-clinical and clinical testing. One of the major operational challenges of large-scale transient transfection is the medium replacement step that is often required before transfection. In this work, CAP-T cells were cultured in 1 L bioreactor with addition of sodium bicarbonate and surface aeration, which were observed to improve cell state for transfection. Remarkably, the medium replacement step was avoided by culturing the cells in a combination of media (FreeStyleF17 + 1% of PEM) compatible with cell growth and PEI-mediated transient transfection.

This enables us to avoid a direct comparison of the sketch query and the projected images of the 3D objects and to use the learned robust sparse features of the trained sketch images in the sketch database, compensating for the difference between the user-drawn sketch image and synthesized images of the 3D mesh model.

In a series of previous works, this analytical reagent was shown to be applicable for selective, reliable, express and relatively inexpensive determination of heavy metals in different objects through the spectrophotometric technique. Although the action of 1-(2-thiazolylazo)-2-naphthol (TAN) dyes as tridentate ligands has been suggested in the literature long time ago, due to the lack of experimental data, it was necessary to investigate the mechanism of formation and the structure of BnTAN complexes with the such transition metals as Cu(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II). Furthermore, the reactivity and properties of different acidity forms and conformers of BnTAN and related TAN dyes were not fully defined, so the determination of these properties by analysis of wavefunction was also necessary. Two standard spectrophotometric methods and voltammetric technique were used to determine the composition of complex of BnTAN with metals ions. All three experimental methods indicate that coordination ratio of metal:dye is equal to 1:2. Moreover, this study reports the stability and geometry of conformers of different forms (anionic/neutral/cationic) of BnTAN, along with a detailed analysis of electronic properties, reactivity and aromaticity of the most stable conformers of BnTAN forms. Each of the above forms has some difference in position of benzyl ring against the thiazole moiety, which is explained in terms of attraction and repulsion of these two fragments induced by partial atomic charges. The crucial influence of hydrogen bond and weak non-covalent interactions between naphthyl, aza- and thiazolyl fragments has been established. The quantum chemical calculations have shown that partial atomic charges of anionic, neutral and cationic forms can explain the reactivity of each BnTAN form, and have also clarified the mechanism of formation of metal complex through the connection of metal with phenol oxygen, thiazolyl nitrogen and one nitrogen of aza group – thus giving two five-membered metal-containing cycles and confirming that BnTAN acts as a tridentate ligand. The obtained results introduce novel and crucial information which can assist in understanding the mechanism of complex formation of BnTAN and display the strength and level of detail of applying quantum chemical methods to reveal the reactivity, energy properties, and electronic properties of this new dye. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","1-[(5-Benzyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)diazenyl]naphthalene-2-ol; Reactivity; Structure; Transition metals complexes","Azo dyes; Cadmium; Electronic properties; Heavy metals; Hydrogen bonds; Ligands; Metal complexes; Metals; Naphthalene; Nitrogen; Quantum chemistry; Reactivity (nuclear); Spectrophotometers; Spectrophotometry; Structure (composition); Synthesis (chemical); Transition metals; Zinc compounds; 1-(2-thiazolylazo)-2-naphthol; 1-[(5-Benzyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)diazenyl]naphthalene-2-ol; Non-covalent interaction; Quantum chemical calculations; Quantum-chemical methods; Spectro-photometric method; Transition metals complexes; Voltammetric techniques; Copper",2-s2.0-85027587410

Using an online structured questionnaire on an e-service telecom website, 13,346 valid responses (73.1% male; all aged 19 or above) were analysed. More than 75% of the respondents did not answer any of the open-ended questions.

The data were then used for training and the proposed model. The results showed that the prediction of the developed BP-ANN model is more accurate and stable than that of linear regression (LR) model.

In this study, we present a novel approach to uncovering urban functions by aggregating human activities inferred from mobile phone positioning and social media data. First, the homes and workplaces (of travelers) are estimated from mobile phone positioning data to annotate the activities conducted at these locations. The remaining activities (such as shopping, schooling, transportation, recreation and entertainment) are labeled using a hidden Markov model with social knowledge learned from social media check-in data over a lengthy period. By aggregating identified human activities, hourly urban functions are inferred, and the diurnal dynamics of those functions are revealed. An empirical analysis was conducted for the case of Shenzhen, China. The results indicate that the proposed approach can capture citywide dynamics of both human activities and urban functions. It also suggests that although many urban areas have been officially labeled with a single land-use type, they may provide different functions over time depending on the types and range of human activities.

Objective This paper describes and evaluates a novel design of a graphical user interface to recommend commands within an IDE. The interface contains a description of the suggested command, an explanation of why the command is recommended, and a command usage example. Method The proposed design is based on the analysis of guidelines identified in the literature. Its acceptance and usability were evaluated through a user study with 36 software developers and semi-structured interviews with 11 software developers. Results The results indicate that the suggested interface is well accepted, but it can be further improved. Through the interviews and the implementation of the interface, we identified a series of requirements important for the development of future IDE command recommender systems. Conclusions This paper shows that a convenient graphical user interface is critical to achieve high acceptance of IDE command recommendations.

Users’ design feedback is gathered for a number of distinct purposes: to support budget approaches to usability testing, to expand on interaction data from usability testing, to provide insight into usability problems in users’ everyday context, and to benefit from users’ knowledge and creativity. Evaluation findings based on users’ design feedback can be qualitatively different from, and hence complement, findings based on other types of evaluation data.

However, making informed design decisions for such DSMLs involves a large number of non-trivial and inter-related options. These options concern the language-model specification, UML extension techniques, concrete-syntax language design, and modeling-tool support. Objective: In order to make the corresponding knowledge on design decisions reusable, proven design rationale from existing DSML projects must be collected, systematized, and documented using an agreed upon documentation format. Method: We applied a sequential multi-method approach to identify and to document reusable design decisions for UML-based DSMLs. The approach included a Web-based survey with 80 participants. Moreover, 80 DSML projects1 which have been identified through a prior systematic literature review, were analyzed in detail in order to identify reusable design decisions for such DSMLs. Results: We present insights on the current state of practice in documenting UML-based DSMLs (e.g., perceived barriers, documentation techniques, reuse potential) and a publicly available collection of reusable design decisions, including 35 decision options on different DSML development concerns (especially concerning the language model, concrete-syntax language design, and modeling tools). The reusable design decisions are documented using a structured documentation format (decision record). Conclusion: Our results are both, scientifically relevant (e.g. for design-space analyses or for creating classification schemas for further research on UML-based DSML development) and important for actual software engineering projects (e.g. by providing best-practice guidelines and pointers to common pitfalls). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Design decision; Design rationale; Domain-specific language; Model-driven software development; Survey; Unified modeling language","Computational linguistics; Computer programming languages; Concretes; Graphical user interfaces; Modeling languages; Problem oriented languages; Software engineering; Surveying; Surveys; Syntactics; Unified Modeling Language; Visual languages; Best practice guidelines; Design decisions; Design rationale; Domain specific languages; Domain specific modeling languages; Model-Driven Software Development; Software engineering projects; Systematic literature review; Software design",2-s2.0-85027512992

Online app markets, such as the Google Play Store, use a star-rating mechanism to quantify the user-perceived quality of mobile apps. Users may rate apps on a five point (star) scale where a five star-rating is the highest rating. Having considered the importance of a high star-rating to the success of an app, recent studies continue to explore the relationship between the app attributes, such as User Interface (UI) complexity, and the user-perceived quality. However, the user-perceived quality reflects the users’ experience using an app on a particular mobile device. Hence, the user-perceived quality of an app is not solely determined by app attributes. In this paper, we study the relation of both device attributes and app attributes with the user-perceived quality of Android apps from the Google Play Store. We study 20 device attributes, such as the CPU and the display size, and 13 app attributes, such as code size and UI complexity. Our study is based on data from 30 types of Android mobile devices and 280 Android apps. We use linear mixed effect models to identify the device attributes and app attributes with the strongest relationship with the user-perceived quality. We find that the code size has the strongest relationship with the user-perceived quality. However, some device attributes, such as the CPU, have stronger relationships with the user-perceived quality than some app attributes, such as the number of UI inputs and outputs of an app. Our work helps both device manufacturers and app developers. Manufacturers can focus on the attributes that have significant relationships with the user-perceived quality. Moreover, app developers should be careful about the devices for which they make their apps available because the device attributes have a strong relationship with the ratings that users give to apps. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Device attributes; Mobile applications; Software attributes; User-perceived quality","Application programs; Display devices; Manufacture; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Rating; Stars; User interfaces; Android apps; Device attributes; Display size; Google plays; Mixed-effect models; Mobile applications; Perceived quality; Star ratings; Android (operating system)",2-s2.0-85014955102

Prior work, predominantly from the psychology literature, suggests that the order of these moments can affect people's retrospective evaluation of experiences. Several kinds of sequencing effects have been examined, including primacy, recency, and peak-end effects. We review previous research on sequencing effects and their potential application in Human-Computer Interaction, of which prior work has found mixed results regarding the influence of interaction sequence on preference – possibly because the magnitude of experiential changes caused by interactive tasks are weaker than those studied in psychological experiments. However, sequencing effects are still of great importance to interface design, because when they occur, they have the potential to substantially change user preferences for common interactions. To explore the subtlety of sequencing effects in HCI, we describe two experiments that examined user preferences for series of interactions with different orderings that created positive and negative recency and primacy effects. Positive and negative experiences were created with simulated system assistance that either worked well (aiding the user in drag-and-drop tasks) or worked poorly (hindering the user). In both experiments, the series differed only in the order of positive and negative momentary experiences. Results of Experiment 1 were mixed: the study provided some support for recency effects, but without strong evidence. Experiment 2 modified the experimental method to better accentuate the positive and negative experiences, and produced results showing strong effects of recency, but not of primacy. We discuss reasons for these results, consider overall explanations for the subtle nature of sequencing effects on HCI tasks, and provide an agenda for further research and design lessons regarding recency effects. Overall, we contribute new understanding of a phenomenon that can have a substantial impact on user experience, but that is currently underexplored in HCI. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Interface preferences; Peak-end rule; Primacy; Recency; Subjective experience","User interfaces; Interactive computing; Negative experiences; Peak-end rule; Primacy; Psychological experiment; Recency; Retrospective evaluations; Subjective experiences; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-85025842489

In general, musculoskeletal modeling applications have been facilitated by the development of dedicated software tools; however, subject-specific studies have been limited also by time-consuming modeling workflows and high skilled expertise required. In addition, no reference tools exist to standardize the process of musculoskeletal model creation and make it more efficient. Here we present a freely available software application, NMSBUILDER 2.0, to create musculoskeletal models in the file format of OpenSim, a widely-used open-source platform for musculoskeletal modeling and simulation. NMSBUILDER 2.0 is the result of a major refactoring of a previous implementation that moved a first step toward an efficient workflow for subject-specific model creation. Methods NMSBUILDER includes a graphical user interface that provides access to all functionalities, based on a framework for computer-aided medicine written in C++. The operations implemented can be used in a workflow to create OpenSim musculoskeletal models from 3D surfaces. A first step includes data processing to create supporting objects necessary to create models, e.g. surfaces, anatomical landmarks, reference systems; and a second step includes the creation of OpenSim objects, e.g. bodies, joints, muscles, and the corresponding model. Results We present a case study using NMSBUILDER 2.0: the creation of an MRI-based musculoskeletal model of the lower limb. The model included four rigid bodies, five degrees of freedom and 43 musculotendon actuators, and was created from 3D surfaces of the segmented images of a healthy subject through the modeling workflow implemented in the software application. Conclusions We have presented NMSBUILDER 2.0 for the creation of musculoskeletal OpenSim models from image-based data, and made it freely available via nmsbuilder.org. This application provides an efficient workflow for model creation and helps standardize the process.

With next-generation smartphones and tablets, the number of sensors and communication tools will increase and more and more communication interfaces and protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS, UMTS, and LTE will be incorporated. Consequently, the fraction of energy consumed by these components will be larger. Nevertheless, the use of the large amount of data from the different sensors can be beneficial to detect the changing user context, to understand habits, and to detect running application needs. All these information, when used properly, may lead to an efficient energy consumption control. This paper proposes a tool to analyze user/application interaction to understand how the different hardware components are used at run-time and optimize them. The idea here is to use machine learning methods to identify and classify user behaviors and habit information. Using this tool, a software has been developed to control at run-time system component activities that have high impacts on the energy consumption. The tool allows also to predict future applications usages. By this way, screen brightness, CPU frequency, Wi-Fi connectivity, and playback sound level can be optimized while meeting the applications and the user requirements. Our experimental results show that the proposed solution can lower the energy consumption by up to 30 % versus the out-of-the-box power governor, while maintaining a negligible system overhead. © 2016, Chaib Draa et al.","Applications sequences prediction; Device’s context; Energy consumption; Run-time user and application analysis","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Energy utilization; Learning systems; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Application analysis; Communication interface; Communication tools; Future applications; Hardware components; Machine learning methods; Mobile handheld devices; Running applications; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-84978708913

This study examines how users engage with interactive visual rotation and tactile simulation features while browsing fashion clothing products on touch screen devices and thus contributes to retail touch screen research that previously focused on in-store kiosks and window displays. Findings show that three dimensions of user engagement (endurability, novelty and felt involvement) are positively influenced by both forms of manipulation. In order to examine the extent to which touch screen user engagement varies with individual preferences for an in-store experience, the paper also examines whether user engagement outcomes are mediated by an individual's need for physical touch.

A classification (finite number of classes) and a regression (continuous mapping) based projection of EMG into external commands were applied while artificially introducing non-stationarities in the EMG signals. When tested on ten able-bodied individuals and one transradial amputee, the two methods were similarly influenced by non-stationarities when tested offline. However, in online tests, where the user could adapt his muscle activation patterns to the changed conditions, the regression-based approach was significantly less influenced by the changes in signal features than the classification approach. This observation demonstrates, on the one hand, the importance of online tests with users in the loop for assessing the performance of myocontrol approaches. On the other hand, it also demonstrates that regression allows for a better user correction of control commands than classification. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"amputee; bionics; classification; clinical article; human; machine learning; male; muscle contraction",2-s2.0-85021637978

Meanwhile, the emergence of high-capacity air interfaces and dense deployment of small cells result in increasingly high backhaul cost in cellular wireless networks. Purchasing on leased lines can guarantee the service provision during busy hours, however, purchased capacity goes to waste in off-peak time. Hybrid mode is the most promising one among all femtocell access modes which allows macro users to associate with adjacent femtocells with idle bandwidth resources. Femto holder (FH) is egoistic and unwilling to share bandwidth with transferred users from macrocells without any compensation, thus the successful implementation of hybrid access becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an economic refunding framework to motivate hybrid access in femtocells. Macro users can opportunistically associate with adjacent femtocells with excess backhaul capacity. FH can receive certain refunding from wireless service provider (WSP) in exchange for traffic offloading. FH employs congestion pricing policy so as to control the cell load in the femtocell. Within this framework, we design a general utility maximization problem for user association that enables macro users to associate with femtocells based on traffic status, cell load, and access price. Dual decomposition is used to obtain an approximate solution. The impact of congestion pricing on the aggregate throughput and load balancing is also analyzed. Extensive simulations show the proposed scheme achieves a remarkable throughput gain compared with that with no compensation and compensation with usage-based pricing policy. Load balancing is substantially improved as well. © 2017, The Author(s).","Backhaul; Congestion pricing; Heterogeneous network; User association; Utility maximization","Bandwidth; Costs; Femtocell; Heterogeneous networks; Internet service providers; Mobile telecommunication systems; Waterworks; Backhaul; Cellular wireless networks; Congestion pricing; Extensive simulations; Refunding frameworks; User associations; Utility maximizations; Wireless service providers; Traffic congestion",2-s2.0-85009726818

Designing the products consistent with customer needs requires the engagement of customers in the product design process. One way to achieve this goal is the use of interactive evolutionary algorithms. During the running of such algorithms, the customer acts as a fitness function and imparts his/her opinion directly to the design process. Since these algorithms are usually iterated frequently, the user fatigue problem during interaction with them is a major challenge. The present study develops a method to tackle the user fatigue problem in the interactive genetic algorithm using the candidate elimination algorithm. In this method, customer preferences are gradually learned by applying the candidate elimination algorithm on the designs evaluated by the user in the early stages of algorithm. Using the learned preferences, designs which may not meet the customer preferences are discovered and automatically receive a predefined low score from the algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated on the customer-centric design of book covers and its results have been compared with those of the two simple interactive genetic algorithm and multi-stage interactive genetic algorithm. The results are indicative of a considerable reduction of the number of algorithm generations, the number of chromosomes being evaluated by user, and the evaluating time in comparison with the two aforementioned methods. Reduction of these criteria leads to decrease of user fatigue. In addition, the proposed method has increased the user satisfaction. © 2017, The Author(s).","Candidate elimination algorithm; Customer-centric product design; Interactive design; Interactive genetic algorithm; User fatigue",,2-s2.0-85031413002

A very important task in this WQIs’ integration process is the extraction, modeling and understanding of WQIs’ semantic content. However, this task is challenging because of the great heterogeneity in the design of WQIs. This paper presents a novel tree-based approach for the modeling and understanding of WQIs. A tree schema called the Visual Reduced Tree (VR-Tree) is built from the tree produced by a web browser’s render engine, applying a set of well- defined functions and guided by a set of heuristic rules to identify the WQI’s main components and their relationships. The proposed strategy was evaluated by running a collection of experiments over the Tel-8 and ICQ datasets from the UIUC repository. The results show that the automatic modeling of WQIs is possible with a high degree of precision if compared against previous approaches, simplifying the modeling task by only considering visual and spatial properties of WQI components using the VR-Tree schema proposed in this work. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Heuristic rules; Modeling; Render tree; Schema tree; Web Query Interfaces","Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Models; Automatic modeling; Degree of precision; Heuristic rules; Integration process; Query interfaces; Render tree; Schema tree; Tree-based approach; Semantics",2-s2.0-85014021554

The considered waveform contenders, namely filter-bank multi-carrier (FBMC), universal-filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), generalized frequency-division multiplexing (GFDM) and resource-block filtered orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (RB-F-OFDM) are compared to OFDM used in 4G in terms of spectral efficiency, numerical complexity, robustness towards multi-user interference (MUI) and resilience to power amplifier non-linearity. FBMC shows the best spectral containment and reveals to be almost insensitive to multi-user interference. It however suffers from its bad spectral efficiency for short bursts and from its poor multiple input multiple output (MIMO) compatibility. GFDM reveals to be the most promising contender, with the best spectral efficiency and the smallest complexity overhead compared to OFDM. It is also the most resilient to multi-user interference after FBMC and is MIMO compatible as soon as the interference can be managed. UFMC and RB-F-OFDM are finally the closest to OFDM and benefit therefore from a better compatibility with existing systems, even if their performance is generally lower than FBMC and GFDM. © 2017, The Author(s).","5G air interface; Multi-user interference; Non-linear communications; Performance/complexity analysis","Communication channels (information theory); Efficiency; Frequency division multiplexing; MIMO systems; Multiplexing; Power amplifiers; Radio communication; Air interface; Asynchronous communication; Generalized frequencies; Multi-user interference; Non linear; Performance/complexity analysis; Spectral containment; Spectral efficiencies; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing",2-s2.0-85011891272

The technique’s applicability, e.g. defect-finding ability, and feasibility, e.g. time to positive return on investment, have been shown through empirical studies in industrial practice. However, there is a lack of studies that evaluate the usefulness and challenges associated with VGT when used long-term (years) in industrial practice. This paper evaluates how VGT was adopted, applied and why it was abandoned at the music streaming application development company, Spotify, after several years of use. A qualitative study with two workshops and five well chosen employees is performed at the company, supported by a survey, which is analyzed with a grounded theory approach to answer the study’s three research questions. The interviews provide insights into the challenges, problems and limitations, but also benefits, that Spotify experienced during the adoption and use of VGT. However, due to the technique’s drawbacks, VGT has been abandoned for a new technique/framework, simply called the Test interface. The Test interface is considered more robust and flexible for Spotify’s needs but has several drawbacks, including that it does not test the actual GUI as shown to the user like VGT does. From the study’s results it is concluded that VGT can be used long-term in industrial practice but it requires organizational change as well as engineering best practices to be beneficial. Through synthesis of the study’s results, and results from previous work, a set of guidelines are presented that aim to aid practitioners to adopt and use VGT in industrial practice. However, due to the abandonment of the technique, future research is required to analyze in what types of projects the technique is, and is not, long-term viable. To this end, we also present Spotify’s Test interface solution for automated GUI-based testing and conclude that it has its own benefits and drawbacks. © 2017, The Author(s).","Automated testing; Case study; Guidelines; Industrial; Visual GUI testing","Automation; Image recognition; Industrial management; Automated testing; Engineering best practice; Grounded theory approach; Guidelines; Industrial; Industrial practices; Organizational change; Visual gui testing; Graphical user interfaces",2-s2.0-85010807231

However, the contact interfaces in CNT-TFTs have contact resistances that are difficult to reduce; this contact resistance can eventually limit the overall performance of CNT-TFTs. The contact interface between the source/drain electrodes and CNTs, especially for those CNT-TFTs in which the channel comprises randomly networked CNTs, plays a particularly dominant role in determining the performance and degree of variability in CNT-TFTs. However, no studies have reported a determination method that individually extracts each contact resistance at the source/drain electrodes. The present work presents an efficient method for directly determining the contact interfaces in CNT-TFTs by extracting each contact resistance produced at the source (R S ) and drain (R D ) electrodes. Moreover, we comprehensively simulated the randomly networked CNTs using an in-depth Monte-Carlo method, which provides an efficient method for visualizing the uniformity of a CNT network with various controllable CNT parameters.

We conducted a 5-year research-through-design study, which combined ethnography, participatory design and real-life evaluation, to explore the design and use of technologies aimed to enhance the social life of older people. The paper explores widespread assumptions about the social category of older people and the meaning of technologies for them. This paper argues that assuming that (i) older people have unique needs and interests that set them apart from other user groups and (ii) the meaning of technologies remains unaltered on completion of co-design activities are both problematic, because they do not consider carefully enough the sociocultural contexts in which older people interact and engage in their daily lives. The paper posits that the meaning of technologies for older people and their own identities as individuals of a certain age are shaped within situated communities. Thus, technologies designed ‘for older people’ should be designed to meet situated and dynamic needs/interests of the communities (and not only of care) to which they belong. We draw upon our findings and other situated epistemological discourses in HCI to introduce a different perspective, a turn to community, in the design of technologies for an ever-increasing ageing population. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Appropriation; Communities; Ethnography; Older people; Practices; Research-through-design; Situated epistemology","Ecosystems; Hardware; Appropriation; Ethnography; Older People; Practices; Situated epistemology; Engineering",2-s2.0-85022327459

We propose bio-inspired electronics which adopt the fractal geometry of the neurons they interface with. Our focus is on retinal implants, although performance improvements will be generic to many neuronal types. The key component is a multifunctional electrode; light passes through this electrode into a photodiode which charges the electrode. Its electric field then stimulates the neurons. A fractal electrode might increase both light transmission and neuron proximity compared to conventional Euclidean electrodes. These advantages are negated if the fractal's field is less effective at stimulating neurons. We present simulations demonstrating how an interplay of fractal properties generates enhanced stimulation; the electrode voltage necessary to stimulate all neighboring neurons is over 50% less for fractal than Euclidean electrodes. This smaller voltage can be achieved by a single diode compared to three diodes required for the Euclidean electrode's higher voltage.

The goal of the first BCI was to differentiate between 10s of mental repetitions of the word ""no"" and an equivalent duration of unconstrained rest. The second BCI was designed to discern between 10s each of covert repetition of the words ""yes"" and ""no"". Twelve participants used these two BCIs to answer yes or no questions. Each participant completed four sessions, comprising two offline training sessions and two online sessions, one for testing each of the BCIs.

In this work, we focused on developing a new framework for classification of EEG signals for MI-BCI. Method We propose a single band CSP framework for MI-BCI that utilizes the concept of tangent space mapping (TSM) in the manifold of covariance matrices. The proposed method is named CSP-TSM. Spatial filtering is performed on the bandpass filtered MI EEG signal. Riemannian tangent space is utilized for extracting features from the spatial filtered signal. The TSM features are then fused with the CSP variance based features and feature selection is performed using Lasso. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then applied to the selected features and finally classification is done using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results The proposed framework gives improved performance for MI EEG signal classification in comparison with several competing methods. Experiments conducted shows that the proposed framework reduces the overall classification error rate for MI-BCI by 3.16%, 5.10% and 1.70% (for BCI Competition III dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV Dataset I and BCI Competition IV Dataset IIb, respectively) compared to the conventional CSP method under the same experimental settings. Conclusion The proposed CSP-TSM method produces promising results when compared with several competing methods in this paper. In addition, the computational complexity is less compared to that of TSM method. Our proposed CSP-TSM framework can be potentially used for developing improved MI-BCI systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Brain computer interface (BCI); Common spatial pattern (CSP); Electroencephalography (EEG); Motor imagery (MI); Riemannian distance; Tangent space mapping (TSM)","Beamforming; Biomedical signal processing; Brain mapping; Classification (of information); Covariance matrix; Discriminant analysis; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Image retrieval; Interfaces (computer); Mapping; Network function virtualization; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Classification error rate; Common spatial patterns; EEG signal classification; Extracting features; Linear discriminant analysis; Motor imagery; Riemannian distance; Tangent space; Brain computer interface",2-s2.0-85032479244

Using this strategy, reference impedance models are realized for the trilateral teleoperation system represented by a three-port network to facilitate cooperation of two human operators in order to perform a remote physical task. For this purpose, an impedance model defines the desired haptic interaction between the two human operators, while another impedance model specifies the desired behavior of the slave robot in terms of tracking the mater robots' trajectories during interaction with the remote environment. It is shown that different performance goals such as position synchronization and force reflection can be achieved via different adjustments to the impedance parameters. The sufficient conditions for the trilateral haptic system's absolute stability are investigated in terms of the impedance models' parameters. Accordingly, guidelines for modification of the impedance parameters are obtained to guarantee the absolute stability of the trilateral haptic system in the presence of communication time delays. A trilateral nonlinear version of the model reference adaptive impedance control (MRAIC) scheme is developed for implementing the proposed reference impedance models on the masters and the slave. The convergence of robots' trajectories to desired responses and the robustness against modeling uncertainties are ensured using the proposed controller as proven by the Lyapunov stability theorem.

Examples of such interfaces are voice controlled navigation devices, Apple’s personal assistant Siri, Google Voice Search, and translation services. However, such interfaces are extremely difficult to build, to maintain, and to port to new domains. We present an approach for building and porting such interfaces quickly. NLCI is a natural language command interpreter that accepts action commands in English and translates them into executable code. The core component is an ontology that models an API. Once the API is “ontologized”, NLCI translates input sentences into sequences of API calls that implement the intended actions. Two radically different APIs were ontologized: openHAB for home automation and Alice for building 3D animations. Construction of the ontology can be automated if the API uses descriptive names for its components. In that case, the language interface can be generated completely automatically. Recall and precision of NLCI on a benchmark of 50 input scripts are 67 and 78 %, resp. Though not yet acceptable for practical use, the results indicate that the approach is feasible.

Whenever the CAD system exceeds its limit of operation, designers of the system need to ensure a safe and timely enough transition from automated to manual mode. An existing visual Human-Machine Interface (HMI) was supplemented by different auditory outputs. The present work compares the effects of different auditory outputs in form of (1) a generic warning tone and (2) additional semantic speech output on driver behavior for the announcement of an upcoming take-over request (TOR). We expect the information carried by means of speech output to lead to faster reactions and better subjective evaluations by the drivers compared to generic auditory output. To test this assumption, N = 17 drivers completed two simulator drives, once with a generic warning tone (‘Generic’) and once with additional speech output (‘Speech + generic’), while they were working on a non-driving related task (NDRT; i.e., reading a magazine). Each drive incorporated one transition from automated to manual mode when yellow secondary lanes emerged. Different reaction time measures, relevant for the take-over process, were assessed. Furthermore, drivers evaluated the complete HMI regarding usefulness, ease of use and perceived visual workload just after experiencing the take-over.

The reward values are calculated along a dynamically defined policy path connecting start topic or event node to a goal topic or event or issue nodes for incrementally defined time windows for a given network congestion situation. A hierarchy of agents of trusted roles is used to accomplish the sub-goals associated with sub-story or subtopic in the provenance structure where an agent role may assume the semantic role of the associated sub-topic. The twitted news story thread or plan of events is defined in this work from the starting topic or event node to the goal topic or event node for incrementally defined intervals of time. The graphs are clustered into subtopic and these sub-goals or sub topic nodes of a topic node at every level of granularity are associated with cluster of news reports which describe activities associated with sub-goal or sub-topic events. Such cluster of nodes may also represent drilled down sequence of sub-events describing a sub-topic or sub-goal node. The policy path in a topic or story graph model is defined by applying reinforcement learning principles on dynamically defined event models associated with evolution of topic definition observed from incrementally acquired samples of input training data spanning multiple time windows. We provide a methodology for unifying similar provenance graph models for adapting and averaging the policy path classifiers associated with individual models to produce a reduced set of unified models derived during training. A minimum set cover of classifiers is identified for the models and a clustering procedure of the models is suggested based on these classifiers. Other database clustering methods have also been suggested as alternatives for clustering these models. A collection of unified models are identified from the models identified within a cluster and the policy path classifiers associated with these models provide the story or topic descriptions destined to goal topic or event nodes characterizing these models within a cluster. © 2017, The Author(s).","Bayesian model; Computational trust; Database roles; Materialized views; Network congestion; Policy path; Provenance; Q Learning; Reinforcement learning; Reward",,2-s2.0-85032582624

Technological advances mean acoustic recording of nature can now be done at a relatively low cost, with minimal disturbance, and over long periods of time. Vast amounts of data are gathered yielding environmental soundscapes which requires new forms of visualization and interpretation of the data. Recently a novel visualization technique has been designed that represents soundscapes using dense visual summaries of acoustic patterns. However, little is known about how this visualization tool can be employed to make sense of soundscapes. Understanding how the technique can be best used and developed requires collaboration between interface, algorithm designers and ecologists. We empirically investigated the practices and needs of ecologists using acoustic monitoring technologies. In particular, we investigated the use of the soundscape visualization tool by teams of ecologists researching endangered species detection, species behaviour, and monitoring of ecological areas using long duration audio recordings. Our findings highlight the opportunities and challenges that ecologists face in making sense of large acoustic datasets through patterns of acoustic events. We reveal the characteristic processes for collaboratively generating situated accounts of natural places from soundscapes using visualization. We also discuss the biases inherent in the approach.

Four different loading conditions were considered in this paper to evaluate the performance of GRS-IBS abutment due to dead loading, tandem axle truck loading, service loading, and abnormal loading. The two-dimensional FE computer program PLAXIS 2D 2016 was selected to model the GRS-IBS abutment. The hardening soil model proposed by Schanz et al., (1999) that was initially introduced by Duncan and Chang (1970) was used to simulate the granular backfill materials; a linear-elastic model with Mohr-Coulomb frictional criterion was used to simulate the interface between the geosynthetic and backfill material. Both the geosynthetic and the facing block were modeled using linear elastic model. The Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model was used to simulate the foundation soil. The FE numerical results were compared with the field measurements of monitoring program, in which a good agreement was obtained between the FE numerical results and the field measurements. The range of maximum reinforcement strain was between 0.4% and 1.5%, depending on the location of the reinforcement layer and the loading condition. The maximum lateral deformation at the face was between 2 and 9 mm (0.08%–0.4% lateral strain), depending on the loading condition. The maximum settlement of the GRS-IBS under service loading was 10 mm (0.3% vertical strain), which is about two times the field measurements (∼5 mm). This is most probably due to the behavior of over consolidated soil caused by the old bridge. The axial reinforcement force predicted by FHWA (Adams et al., 2011b) design methods were 1.5–2.5 times higher than those predicted by the FE analysis and the field measurements, depending on the loading condition and reinforcement location. However, the interface shear strength between the reinforcement and the backfill materials predicted by Mohr-Coulomb method was very close to those predicted by the FE. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bridge abutment; Finite element analysis; Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS); Geosynthetics; Integrated Bridge System (IBS); Reinforced soil","Abutments (bridge); Aluminum alloys; Electric measuring bridges; Finite element method; Geosynthetic materials; Granular materials; Integration; Interfaces (materials); Loads (forces); Reinforcement; Soils; Geosynthetic reinforced soils; Geosynthetics; Hardening soil models; Integrated bridge systems; Interface shear strength; Reinforced soil; Reinforcement layers; Reinforcement strains; Loading; backfill; bridge; finite element method; geosynthetics; loading; shear strength; soil reinforcement; Louisiana; United States",2-s2.0-85021921722

The first UKF is developed for the recalibration of device attitude estimation. We mathematically derive the measurement equation connecting observed user heading from landmarks with the quaternion vector representing device attitude. To decrease the nonlinearity of the measurement equation and make the filter more robust, we deploy the difference between user heading derived from the landmark and estimation result of PCA-based approach as the observation variable. The second UKF is developed for user heading estimation fusing estimation results of PCA-based approach and observed user headings from landmarks. Besides, we develop a robust landmark identification method by exploiting the acceleration and device pitch patterns, while noisy barometers are no longer required as previous methods.

That said, it has become attractive for HCI researchers and designers to harness touch, taste, and smell in interactive tasks and experience design. In this paper, we present research and design insights gained throughout an interdisciplinary collaboration on a six-week multisensory display – Tate Sensorium – exhibited at the Tate Britain art gallery in London, UK. This is a unique and first time case study on how to design art experiences whilst considering all the senses (i.e., vision, sound, touch, smell, and taste), in particular touch, which we exploited by capitalizing on a novel haptic technology, namely, mid-air haptics. We first describe the overall set up of Tate Sensorium and then move on to describing in detail the design process of the mid-air haptic feedback and its integration with sound for the Full Stop painting by John Latham (1961). This was the first time that mid-air haptic technology was used in a museum context over a prolonged period of time and integrated with sound to enhance the experience of visual art. As part of an interdisciplinary team of curators, sensory designers, sound artists, we selected a total of three variations of the mid-air haptic experience (i.e., haptic patterns), which were alternated at dedicated times throughout the six-week exhibition. We collected questionnaire-based feedback from 2500 visitors and conducted 50 interviews to gain quantitative and qualitative insights on visitors’ experiences and emotional reactions. Whilst the questionnaire results are generally very positive with only a small variation of the visitors’ arousal ratings across the three tactile experiences designed for the Full Stop painting, the interview data shed light on the differences in the visitors’ subjective experiences. Our findings suggest multisensory designers and art curators can ensure a balance between surprising experiences versus the possibility of free exploration for visitors. In addition, participants expressed that experiencing art with the combination of mid-air haptic and sound was immersive and provided an up-lifting experience of touching without touch. We are convinced that the insights gained from this large-scale and real-world field exploration of multisensory experience design exploiting a new and emerging technology provide a solid starting point for the HCI community, creative industries, and art curators to think beyond conventional art experiences. Specifically, our work demonstrates how novel mid-air technology can make art more emotionally engaging and stimulating, especially abstract art that is often open to interpretation. © 2017 The Authors","Art exhibition; Art gallery; Emotion; Mid-air haptic feedback; Multisensory experience; Museum; Smell; Sound; Taste; User experience","Acoustic waves; Human computer interaction; Museums; Surveys; Art gallery; Emotion; Haptic feedbacks; Multisensory; Smell; Taste; User experience; Exhibitions",2-s2.0-85021442943

There is a need to recognise and characterise features and changing patterns of Earth observables within such large datasets. It is also necessary to identify significant subsets of the data for more detailed analysis. We present an innovative, interactive software tool and workflow to visualise, characterise, sample and tag large geoscientific datasets from both local and cloud-based repositories. It uses an animated interface and human-computer interaction to utilise the capacity of human expert observers to identify features via enhanced visual analytics. ‘Tagger’ enables users to analyze datasets that are too large in volume to be drawn legibly on a reasonable number of single static plots. Users interact with the moving graphical display, tagging data ranges of interest for subsequent attention. The tool provides a rapid pre-pass process using fast GPU-based OpenGL graphics and data-handling and is coded in the Quartz Composer visual programing language (VPL) on Mac OSX. It makes use of interoperable data formats, and cloud-based (or local) data storage and compute. In a case study, Tagger was used to characterise a decade (2000–2009) of data recorded by the Cape Sorell Waverider Buoy, located approximately 10 km off the west coast of Tasmania, Australia. These data serve as a proxy for the understanding of Southern Ocean storminess, which has both local and global implications. This example shows use of the tool to identify and characterise 4 different types of storm and non-storm events during this time. Events characterised in this way are compared with conventional analysis, noting advantages and limitations of data analysis using animation and human interaction.

In the revised version, the software architecture is completely redesigned. New basis (intermediate representation or singular value decomposition representation) for the single-particle and two-particle Green's functions is introduced. A lot of useful physical observables are added, such as the charge susceptibility, fidelity susceptibility, Binder cumulant, and autocorrelation time. Especially, we optimize measurement for the two-particle Green's functions. Both the particle–hole and particle–particle channels are supported. In addition, the block structure of the two-particle Green's functions is exploited to accelerate the calculation. Finally, we fix some known bugs and limitations. The computational efficiency of the code is greatly enhanced. New version program summary Program Title:iQIST Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/mvz87z5w3t.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90, Python, Bash shell Journal reference of previous version: Computer Physics Communications 195, 140 (2015) Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Reasons for the new version: Since the release of iQIST v0.5 in 2015 [1], we keep improving this code. The new version incorporates many new features, optimizations, and bug-fixes, which will be detailed below. Summary of revisions: • In the revised version, only the narcissus component and the hibiscus component are retained. The former implements a hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver for density–density type interaction. The latter includes many auxiliary tools and useful scripts. The two components are carefully benchmarked and verified.• New representation (intermediate representation or singular value decomposition representation) for the single-particle and two-particle Green's functions is implemented [2]. It is better than the Legendre orthogonal polynomial representation.• Now many physical observables can be measured, including the spin susceptibility, charge susceptibility, fidelity susceptibility, kinetic energy fluctuation, kurtosis and skewness of perturbation expansion order, and Binder cumulant [3]. The fidelity susceptibility can be used to detect the quantum phase transition efficiently.• The measurement of two-particle Green's functions is reimplemented. Both the particle–hole and particle–particle channels are supported on the same footing. The block structure and symmetry of the two-particle Green's functions are also utilized to reduce the CPU burden and memory requirement. The iQIST software package usually acts as a computational engine (i.e, quantum impurity solver) in the calculations of the dynamical mean-field theory and its diagrammatic extensions, such as the dual fermions, dual bosons, and dynamical vertex approximation [4]. The essential inputs for these diagrammatic extensions are the two-particle Green's functions. We design the data structure and file format for the two-particle Green's functions carefully, so that they can be easily accessed by the open source dual fermions code opendf [5].• Now the code can output the standard deviations (error bars) for all of the physical observables.• Now the code can measure the autocorrelation function/time for the total occupation number, and then use it to adjust automatically the interval between two successive measurements.• Usually we have to perform analytical continuations for the single-particle Green's function, spin susceptibility, and self-energy function, and convert them from imaginary time or Matsubara frequency space to real-frequency space. These tasks are extremely non-trivial. Some scripts are provided to deal with the output data.

Nature of problem: In the dynamical mean-field theory and its diagrammatic extensions, the bottleneck is to solve a quantum impurity model self-consistently [4,9]. The quantum impurity model is a Hamiltonian that is used to describe quantum impurities embedded in bath environment or metallic hosts. The goal of the iQIST software package is to provide highly effective quantum impurity solvers. Solution method: In the iQIST software package, we only implement the hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm [10]. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features: In the revised version, the manjushaka component which implements a hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver for general Coulomb interaction is removed temporally due to numerical unstable problem. The application programming interfaces for Python and Fortran languages are also disabled. They will be released in the next version.

Multi-rate methods can enhance efficiency of simulation by decreasing the scale of systems in small time-steps. However, the existing traditional methods for multi-rate simulation suffer the problems of instability and simulation errors. These have hindered the application of multi-rate simulation in power industry. Therefore theoretical evaluation on different multi-rate simulation methods is crucial to understand the feasibility and limitation of the methods, and to contribute to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional methods. In this paper, the multi-rate simulation performance based on two traditional technologies and a Modified Thevenin Interface are evaluated to provide an overall feasibility of multi-rate algorithms in the power simulation. The Modified Thevenin Interface is proposed to overcome the drawbacks in synchronization. Three theorems are proposed and proved for theoretically analyzing the stability of the simulation methods. Error analyses of the multi-rate methods are performed to identify the relationships between errors and simulation conditions. Besides, the accuracy and efficiency performance in a practical project of VSC-MTDC shows the feasibility and necessity by using multi-rate simulation. Through the theoretical analysis, the issues of stability and accuracy of multi-rate simulation for the DC grids have been better understood, based on which an improved simulation algorithm has been proposed to overcome these issues. Long-term system dynamics of large-scale systems containing DC grids and fast transients of HVDC converters can be investigated simultaneously with high speed and sufficient accuracy. © 2017","Different rates; Electromagnetic transient analysis; Multi-rate interface; Multi-terminal VSC-HVDC; Parallel algorithm; Power system simulation","DC power transmission; Efficiency; Electric power systems; Electromechanical devices; Errors; HVDC power transmission; Large scale systems; Parallel algorithms; Transients; Efficiency of simulations; Electromagnetic transient analysis; Multi rate; Power electronic devices; Power system simulations; Systematic evaluation; Theoretical evaluation; VSC-HVDC; Transient analysis",2-s2.0-85019997066

The area of face slab vulnerable to cracking was identified.

The application of semantic differentials to the case of the rolling sound of office chairs is dealt with in this study. After a preliminary selection of the semantic differentials by fifty-two participants, another ninety participants took part in a listening test and described the acoustic stimuli of two office chairs, of high and low quality, respectively, rolling over polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic and wood floorings, under context and laboratory test conditions. Under laboratory condition, recorded real stimuli were presented to the listeners via headphones, or under SounBe condition. SounBe is a new tool that has recently been conceived to explore sound at an early design stage. With this method, interactions between a chair and the floor are simplified, a mechanical sound is produced of a wheel moving across a flooring tile, and the recorded stimuli are then presented to the listeners through headphones. Four 7-point Likert scale semantic differentials, related to calmness, roughness, pleasantness and annoyance, were used to collect subjective data. Objective data were instead obtained from psychoacoustic indexes. Factors such as gender and weight were found to have no effect on the subjective and objective data. The flooring factor instead resulted to have much more influence than the chair factor. No statistically significant difference was observed between the test conditions on the semantic differential scales, thus proving the compatibility between SounBe and real sounds. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Context condition; Laboratory condition; Listening test; Rolling sound; Semantic differentials; Sound design","Acoustics; Building materials; Floors; Gears; Headphones; Laboratories; Loudspeakers; Office equipment; Polyvinyl chlorides; Testing; Context condition; Laboratory conditions; Listening tests; Semantic differential; Sound designs; Semantics",2-s2.0-85021414818

They are often considered key building blocks for scaling applications to very large process counts. Yet, using non-blocking collective operations in real-world applications is non-trivial. Application codes often have to be restructured significantly in order to maximize the communication–computation overlap. This paper presents an approach to maximize the communication–computation overlap for hybrid OpenMP/MPI applications. The work leverages automatic parallelization by extending the ability of an existing tool to utilize non-blocking collective operations. It further integrates run-time auto-tuning techniques of non-blocking collective operations, optimizing both, the algorithms used for the non-blocking collective operations as well as location and frequency of accompanying progress function calls. Four application benchmarks were used to demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of the approach on two different platforms.

The main feature of our approach is its applicability in situations where either of the two shapes may have moderate to significant portions of its data missing. Let the two shapes be A and B. Without loss of generality, we characterize A by learning a sparse dictionary from its local descriptors. The similarity between A and B is defined by the error incurred when reconstructing B’s descriptor set using the basis signals from A’s dictionary. Benefits of using sparse dictionary learning and reconstruction are twofold. First, sparse dictionary learning reduces data redundancy and facilitates similarity computations. More importantly, the reconstruction error is expected to be small as long as B is similar to A, regardless of whether the similarity is full or partial. Our proposed approach achieves significant improvements over previous works when retrieving non-rigid shapes with missing data, and it is also comparable to state-of-the-art methods on the retrieval of complete non-rigid shapes. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Full and partial shape similarity; Incomplete shapes; Shape retrieval; Sparse dictionary learning; Sparse reconstruction","Software engineering; Incomplete shapes; Partial shape similarity; Shape retrieval; Sparse dictionaries; Sparse reconstruction; Interfaces (computer)",2-s2.0-84979598034

Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM) using 3D Printers can change how geoscientists, students, and stakeholders interact with 3D data, with the potential to improve geoscience communication and environmental literacy. No other manufacturing technology can convert digital data into tangible objects quickly at relatively low cost; however, the expertise necessary to produce a 3D-printed terrain model can be a substantial burden: knowledge of geographical information systems, computer aided design (CAD) software, and 3D printers may all be required. Furthermore, printing models larger than the build volume of a 3D printer can pose further technical hurdles. The TouchTerrain web-application simplifies DDM for elevation data by generating digital 3D models customized for a specific 3D printer's capabilities. The only required user input is the selection of a region-of-interest using the provided web-application with a Google Maps-style interface. Publically available digital elevation data is processed via the Google Earth Engine API.

The BEMS ‘intelligence’ is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions’ which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions.

Against these prevalent views we present an ethnomethodological study of digital privacy practices in 20 homes in the UK and France, concentrating in particular upon people’s use of passwords, their management of digital content, and the controls they exercise over the extent to which the online world at large can penetrate their everyday lives. In explicating digital privacy practices in the home we find an abiding methodological concern amongst members to manage the potential ‘attack surface’ of the digital on everyday life occasioned by interaction in and with the networked world. We also find, as a feature of this methodological preoccupation, that privacy dissolves into a heterogeneous array of relationship management practices. Accordingly we propose that ‘privacy’ has little utility as a focus for design, and suggest instead that a more productive way forward would be to concentrate on supporting people’s evident interest in managing their relationships in and with the networked world. © 2017, The Author(s).","Crisis in trust; Digital economy; Domestic digital privacy practices; Ethnomethodology; Privacy","Computer supported cooperative work; Data privacy; Social aspects; Crisis in trust; Design challenges; Digital contents; Digital economy; Ethnomethodology; Heterogeneous array; Privacy practices; Relationship management; Ubiquitous computing",2-s2.0-85019672886

Design/methodology/approach By integrating technology acceptance model, health belief model, snob effect and conformity and reference group theory, hypotheses and research model are proposed. The empirical investigation (N = 436) collects research data through questionnaire. Findings Results show that the adoption intention of healthcare wearable technology is influenced by technical attributes, health attribute and consumer attributes simultaneously. For technical attributes, perceived convenience and perceived credibility both positively affect perceived usefulness, and perceived usefulness influences adoption intention. The relation between perceived irreplaceability and perceived usefulness is only supported by males. For health attribute, health belief affects perceived usefulness for females. For consumer attributes, conspicuous consumption and informational reference group influence can significantly moderate the relation between perceived usefulness and adoption intention and the relation between consumer innovativeness and adoption intention respectively.

The undrained capacity of surface circular foundations on soil with varying strength profiles and under fully three-dimensional loading is investigated and presented in the form of failure envelopes that obtained from finite element analyses. The combined ultimate limit state of circular foundations is defined as the two-dimensional failure envelopes in resultant H-M loading space accounting for the vertical load and torsion mobilisation. The effects of vertical load and torsion mobilisation, soil shear strength heterogeneity and loading angle from moment to horizontal load on the shape of normalised H-M failure envelopes are explored. A series of expressions are proposed to describe the shape of failure envelopes obtained numerically, enabling essentially instantaneous generation of failure envelopes and optimisation of a circular foundation design based on constraint of any input variable through implementation in an automated calculation tool.

The beta particle penetration depth and the shape of the energy deposition varied significantly for different transport approaches. A penetration depth of 2.25±0.25 µm with a peak in energy deposition was found when using a monoenergetic beta particle average energy and a depth of 14.25±0.25 µm with an exponential decrease in energy deposition was found when using a full beta energy spectrum and a 0° angular variation. For a 90° angular variation, i.e. an isotropic source, the penetration depth was decreased to 12.75±0.25 µm and the backscattering coefficient increased to 0.46 with 30.55% of the beta energy escaping when using a full beta energy spectrum. Similarly, for a 0° angular variation and an isotropic source, an overprediction in the short circuit current and open circuit voltage solved by a simplified drift-diffusion model was observed when compared to experimental results from the literature. A good agreement in the results was found when self-absorption and isotope dilution in the source was considered. The self-absorption effect was 15% for a Ni-63 source with an activity of 0.25 mCi. This effect increased to about 28.5% for a higher source activity of 1 mCi due to an increase in thickness of the Ni-63 source. Source thicknesses of approximately 0.1 µm and 0.4 µm for these Ni-63 activities predicted about 15% and 28.5% self-absorption in the source, respectively, using MCNP simulations with an isotropic source.

Game industry discourse is concerned with continuous redesign of gameplay to enhance players’ experience and boost game's appeal. However, accounts of gameplay requirements practices are rare. In responding to calls for more research into gameplay requirements engineering, we performed an exploratory study in the context of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), from the perspective of practitioners involved in the field. Sixteen practitioners from three leading MMORPG-producing companies were interviewed and their gameplay requirements documents were reviewed. Interviewing and qualitative data analysis occurred in a cyclical process with results at each stage of the study informing decisions about data collection and analysis in the next. The analysis revealed a process of striving to reach a balance among three perspectives of gameplay requirements: a process perspective, an artifact perspective and a player-designer relationship perspective. This balance-driven process is co-created by game developers and players, is endless within the MMORPG, and is happening both in-game and off-game. It heavily relies on ‘paper-prototyping’ and play-testing for the purpose of gameplay requirements validation.

Steering and navigation tasks through an environment constitute an essential activity in our daily lives. They have a high degree of practical value in a variety of domains, such as public area design, architectural Wayfinding, geo-positioning and navigation, as well as urban planning and environmental design. At times, people with a visual impairment may also have problems in navigating autonomously and without personal assistance, especially in unknown environments (outdoor and indoor) using a smartphone. There could also be emergency situations in which the receiving of information in real time could be crucial. People with motor disabilities usually need information to avoid environments with obstacles, to arrive at a target or to manage touchscreens in daily activities and different environments. The use of landmarks is therefore vitally important in human navigation. Wayfinding systems must change, given that according to the United Nations (UN) Development Program, people with a disability represent around 10% of the world's population, which is approximately 650 million people. Additionally, according to the World Health Organization, the world's population of people 60 years of age and older has doubled since 1980 and is predicted to reach 2 billion by 2050. Most Wayfinding applications in the Smartphone market suffer from at least one of the following problems: the information is not dynamic, the design is not universal or the interface is not adapted to different users and preferences. Accordingly, apps do not currently have a universal design. The GAWA platform provides a universal and accessible solution to manage Wayfinding applications that focuses on people with a disability in outdoor and indoor environments in Smartcities.

In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal (2-months) field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection.

For this reason, it is so important to accurately determine the water needs of the crop in order to optimize the use of scarce water resources. This paper presents the design and operation validation of an agroclimatic data acquisition system composed of a set of wireless nodes with different functionalities to ascertain irrigation requirements based on weather and lysimetric data. These nodes were based on a common single-board computer to which, depending on the required features, additional hardware components were added. A comparative study of the different single-board computers available in the market was conducted and the Raspberry Pi device was selected due its high performance to cost ratio. With this philosophy, the design of two types of nodes was proposed: climate nodes and lysimetric nodes. Software drivers were developed for both to perform data acquisition and to send the measurements through a mobile network to an application hosted in the cloud. This application managed the storage of the data in a structured-relational database. The required interfaces were programmed to allow the user to view historical and real-time data, as well as configure additional parameters of the nodes related to the crop, geographical location and so on. This cloud application is accessible from any computer or mobile device with an internet connection. All the software tools and hardware platforms were low-cost and open source.

Existing CIs have an external, visible unit, and an internal, surgically-placed unit. There are significant challenges associated with the external unit, as it has limited utility and CI users often report a social stigma associated with prosthesis visibility. A fully-implantable CI (FICI) would address these issues. However, the volume constraint imposed on the FICI requires less power consumption compared to today's CI. Because neural stimulation by CI electrodes accounts for up to 90% of power consumption, reduction in stimulation power will result directly in CI power savings. To determine an energy-efficient waveform for cochlear nerve stimulation, we used a genetic algorithm approach, incorporating a computational model of a single mammalian myelinated cochlear nerve fiber coupled to a stimulator-electrode-tissue interface. The algorithm's prediction was tested in vivo in human CI subjects. We find that implementation of a non-rectangular biphasic neural stimulation waveform may result in up to 25% charge savings and energy savings within the comfortable range of hearing for CI users.

IPIN uses the technique of hybrid images to blend two keypads with different digit orderings in such a way, that the user who is close to the device is seeing one keypad to enter her PIN, while the attacker who is looking at the device from a bigger distance is seeing only the other keypad. The user's keypad is shuffled in every authentication attempt, since the attacker may memorize the spatial arrangement of the pressed digits. To reason about the security of IPIN, we developed an algorithm which is based on human visual perception and estimates the minimum distance from which an observer is unable to interpret the keypad of the user. We tested our estimations with 84 simulated shoulder-surfing attacks from 21 different people. None of the attacks was successful against our estimations. In addition, we estimated the minimum distance from which a camera is unable to capture the visual information from the keypad of the user.

To address this issue, also considering physical constraints imposed by human users, the CARR is designed with reconfigurability to make a trade-off between workspace and torque capacity for meeting different training requirements.

Different methods, amongst others co-simulation approaches benefitting from the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard, were investigated to realize the implementation. The majority of OB models were coupled successfully with the BPS; however, some were not. The reason for the failed coupling is rather based on the restriction of OB models for BPS use than the coupling methods. Generally, OB models are based on stochastic modeling, while BPS requires a clear decision, a trigger for further interaction. Some OB models do not provide an output in such a binary form. Therefore, it is difficult to use these models in BPS without any assumption from the modeler. Furthermore, the majority of OB models lead to a state change depending on a comparison between its computed probability and a random number, which conflicts with the reproducibility of BPS results. In addition, some OB models result in an improper behavior without a reversal function or hysteresis. Based on the case study, these issues and requirements for OB models for the use in BPS as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various coupling approaches with BPS are discussed. © 2017, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","building performance simulation; co-simulation; functional mock-up unit; occupant behavior models","Behavioral research; Mockups; Stochastic systems; Behavior model; Building performance simulations; Cosimulation; Coupling methods; functional mock-up unit; Mathematical descriptions; Occupant behavior; Reproducibilities; Stochastic models",2-s2.0-85030840109

Therefore, we developed a low-cost electronic system to standardise the mechanical stimulation of a rat's hindpaw.

Various control algorithms are presented for assistive exoskeletons, seeking to facilitate wearer's motions. This paper complements a newly proposed output feedback assistive control (OFAC) algorithm for compliantly actuated exoskeletons. H∞ analysis is used to define robust stability and robust performance constraints for the OFAC method. The robust OFAC method is then implemented on a custom made knee exoskeleton. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through some simulations and experiments. Robustness of the OFAC method is further verified by successful reduction of the required knee torques in the non-linear model of the human–exoskeleton system as well as decreasing the muscles activities in a healthy subject wearing the FUM-KneeExo. The OFAC method is independent from user intent, has a simple model free structure, requires a very low number of sensors and simplifies the assistive control objective into position control of the compliant actuator. Moreover, the OFAC method has a very low number of adjustable control parameters which simplifies the adaptation of the OFAC method to different users in real-world applications.

However, there are many more users who do not have any functional residual acoustic hearing at low frequencies. Because tactile sensation also operates in the same low frequencies (<500 Hz) as the acoustic hearing in EAS, we propose electro-tactile stimulation (ETS) to improve cochlear implant performance. In ten cochlear implant users, a tactile aid was applied to the index finger that converted voice fundamental frequency into tactile vibrations. Speech recognition in noise was compared for cochlear implants alone and for the bimodal ETS condition. On average, ETS improved speech reception thresholds by 2.2 dB over cochlear implants alone. Nine of the ten subjects showed a positive ETS effect ranging from 0.3 to 7.0 dB, which was similar to the amount of the previously-reported EAS benefit. The comparable results indicate similar neural mechanisms that underlie both the ETS and EAS effects. The positive results suggest that the complementary auditory and tactile modes also be used to enhance performance for normal hearing listeners and automatic speech recognition for machines. © The Author(s) 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85019844857

A host of literature has been published in the academic realm about how cooperation could be cultivated. However, true cooperation often forms organically without external enforcement. Recently, there has been one special example of a context where cooperation seemed to have effortlessly sprung up between people who might not even have had previous connections. The context is video/online games; games such as Ingress, Pokémon Go, and World of Warcraft bind people together to work against insurmountable odds and to overcome jointly held challenges. Organizations of many types have recently begun to gamify their structures and services in order to cultivate such seamless cooperation. However, before this potential of games can be successfully wielded outside video games, we need to understand better how games are able to cultivate such cooperation. Therefore, in this study we investigate how games can induce and cultivate we-intention of working as a group. Specifically, we investigate how cooperative game features affect different forms of group dynamics and how they further translate into we-intentions. We employ data from users of the augmented reality game Ingress (N = 206). The results show that cooperative game features induce we-intentions via positively increasing group norms, social identity, joint commitment, attitudes toward cooperation, and anticipated positive emotions. The findings imply that practitioners who are looking to increase cooperation should find that gamification inspired by cooperative game design is beneficial and preferable over individual-based gamification efforts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Augmented reality; Cooperation; Gamification; Location-based games; Online games; We-intention","Augmented reality; Game theory; Cooperation; Gamification; Location based games; On-line games; We-intention; Human computer interaction; group dynamics; human; joint; major clinical study; organization; physician; social status; video game",2-s2.0-85028695881

Methods: In this study, a novel approach is proposed that is based upon the integration of conventional usability testing and heuristic evaluation with data-mining knowledge discovery process. An experiment is conducted to evaluate ISO 9241-151 guidelines under 16-different categories by hundred participants who are frequent users of academic websites. After evaluation, the qualitative usability data is collected and different data-mining techniques i.e. association rule and decision tree are applied to recognize fully functional and problematic usability attributes. Identified problematic attributes represent common usability problems patterns related to academic websites from the qualitative viewpoint only. This study further prioritizes these problematic attributes by using the ranking algorithm that represents the order in which usability issues must be resolved. Results: In this study, 16-different categories are considered for usability evaluation of academic websites. The results show that no issues are identified in two-categories i.e. {Headings_Titles_Labels and The Home_Page}. In Scrolling and Paging category, horizontal scrolling is identified as a major issue whereas, in Internationalization category, the users do not identify supported languages on most of the academic websites. Users do not find websites to be highly secured under Security category. Our findings investigate that most of the issues are found in Search and Social Media categories. Furthermore, users easily locate 50.53% guidelines on websites as fully functional whereas, 49.46% of characteristics are considered as problematic usability features that are not functional on the academic website as a whole. Conclusions: Identification of common usability problems at an early stage can lower substantially the development efforts in cost and time. Software developers can restrain from these potential usability problems during the development of novel systems under the same context. Providing appropriate solutions for these problems can become valuable in software development. The proposed approach concludes that conventional usability evaluation methods can go beyond just than testing of systems. The study is a milestone towards identification and prioritizing problematic usability features for academic websites and helps in providing the wholistic approach of usability problematic patterns for web-domain. © 2017, The Author(s).","Association rule; Attribute selection; Data-mining knowledge discovering in databases; Decision tree; Heuristic evaluation; Qualitative usability testing; Usability; Usability engineering",,2-s2.0-85032203112

This study began by conducting a card sorting experiment to determine the importance of color in the perception of commercial icons, as opposed to the simpler icons typically used in a laboratory setting. The study also sought to ascertain the importance of color when considered alongside other visual attributes in the general perception of icons. Participants were then asked to answer preset questions as a means of determining the relationship between the known color properties (e.g., hue, saturation, and brightness) of icons and their functional meaning, effectiveness in conveying meaning, and visual attractiveness. Finally, the speed and accuracy was assessed by which participants recognized well-known icons rendered using familiar and unfamiliar colors. The empirical results identified color as an important attribute in the process of sorting icons, far exceeding other visual attributes including shape, complexity, pictorial style, and orientation. Nonetheless, it appears that color is not necessarily dominant in the initial stages of sorting. The results also revealed that color is closely related to visual attractiveness but largely irrelevant to effectiveness in the conveyance of meaning. The study also confirmed that correct color information is crucial to naming accuracy and the speed at which icons are recognized. Finally, the results indicate that icons lacking a unique symbol as a cue to recognition rely heavily on their signature color for identification. This study opens up several avenues of research by which to enhance our understanding of the functional role of color in icon perception. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","color-diagnostic; icon; perception; recognition","Conveying; Sensory perception; Ubiquitous computing; Card-sorting; Color information; Color properties; Icon; Recognition; Visual attributes; Color; Color; Images",2-s2.0-85019874021

Studies consistently show gap-acceptance difficulties, especially in complex traffic situations such as two-way streets and when vehicles approached rapidly. In this context, the present research was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a vibrotactile device and study older pedestrian's behavior when wearing the wristband designed to help them make safer street-crossing decisions. Method Twenty younger-old participants (age 60–69), 20 older-old participants (age 70–80) and 17 younger adults (age 20–45) carried out a street-crossing task in a simulated two-way traffic environment with and without a vibrotactile wristband delivering warning messages. Results The percentage of decisions that led to collisions with approaching cars decreased significantly when participants wore the wristband. Benefits tended to be greater particularly among very old women, with fewer collisions in the far lane and when vehicles approached rapidly when they wore the wristband. But collisions did not fall to zero, and responses that were in accordance with the wristband advice went up to only 51.6% on average, for all participants. The wristband was nevertheless considered useful and easy to use by all participants. Moreover, behavioral intentions to buy and use such a device in the future were greater in both groups of older participants, but not among the younger adults. Practical applications This haptic device was able to partly compensate for some age-related gap-acceptance difficulties and reduce street-crossing risks for all users. These findings could be fruitfully applied to the design of devices allowing communication between vehicles, infrastructures, and pedestrians. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aging; Haptics; Pedestrians; Safety; Street crossing; Vibrotactile; Virtual environment","Accident prevention; Aging of materials; Pedestrian safety; Vehicles; Virtual reality; Behavioral intention; Haptics; Pedestrians; Street crossing; Traffic environment; Traffic situations; Vibrotactile; Vibrotactile device; Vehicle to vehicle communications",2-s2.0-85030461653

However, these information technologies can present usability problems that affect the performance of radiologists and physicians, especially considering the complexity of the tasks involved. Objectives The purpose of this study was to extract, classify and analyze qualitatively the usability problems in PACS, RIS and other software for radiology. Method A systematic review was performed to extract usability problems reported in empirical usability studies in the literature. The usability problems were categorized as violations of Nielsen and Molich's usability heuristics. Results The qualitative analysis indicated the causes and the effects of the identified usability problems. From the 431 papers initially identified, 10 met the study criteria. The analysis of the papers identified 90 instances of usability problems, classified into categories corresponding to established usability heuristics. The five heuristics with the highest number of instances of usability problems were “Flexibility and efficiency of use”, “Consistency and standards”, “Match between system and the real world”, “Recognition rather than recall” and “Help and documentation”, respectively. Conclusion These problems can make the interaction time consuming, causing delays in tasks, dissatisfaction, frustration, preventing users from enjoying all the benefits and functionalities of the system, as well as leading to more errors and difficulties in carrying out clinical analyses. Furthermore, the present paper showed a lack of studies performed on systems for radiology, especially usability evaluations using formal methods of evaluation involving the final users. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Nielsen heuristics; PACS; Qualitative analysis; Radiology; RIS; Systematic review; Usability problems",,2-s2.0-85032575839

For the example of ball-and-stick diamond cubic unit cell structures for nanoporous gold, it is shown that incorporation of surface excess elasticity and surface tension allows prediction of the size effect associated with the change of the surface area-to-volume ratio by capturing, e.g., the increase in the effective Young's modulus and decrease in the effective Poisson's ratio with decreasing ligament diameter, a phenomenon that is not accessible to classical continuum elasticity approaches. © ASCE.",,"Elastic moduli; Gold; Surface tension; Continuum elasticity; Effective elastic property; Effective poisson's ratio; Effective young's modulus; Energetic properties; Large-scale engineering; Surface elasticities; Theoretical framework; Elasticity",2-s2.0-85021653419

Instead of modeling 3D objects as surface models, we use a volumetric subdivision representation. Volumetric modeling operations allow designing 3D objects in similar ways as with surface-based modeling tools, while automatic checks and modifications of inner control points ensure consistency during the design process. Encoding the volumetric information already in the design mesh drastically simplifies and speeds up the mesh generation process for simulation. The transition between design, simulation and back to design is consistent and computationally cheap. Since the subdivision and mesh generation can be expressed as a precomputable matrix-vector multiplication, iteration times can be greatly reduced compared to common modeling and simulation setups. Therefore, this approach is especially well suited for early-stage modeling or optimization use cases, where many geometric changes are made in a short time and their physical effect on the model has to be evaluated frequently. To test our approach, we created, simulated and adapted several 3D models. We measured and evaluated the timings for generating and applying the matrices for different subdivision levels. Additionally, we computed several characteristic factors for mesh quality and mesh consistency. For comparison, we analyzed the tetrahedral meshing functionality offered by CGAL for similar numbers of elements. For changing topology, our implicit meshing approach proves to be up to 70 times faster than creating the tetrahedral mesh only based on the outer surface. Without changing the topology and by precomputing the matrices, we achieve a speed-up of up to 2800, as all the required information is already available. © 2017 The Authors","Finite element method; Mesh generation; Physically-based simulation; Tetrahedral meshing; Volumetric modeling; Volumetric subdivision","Content based retrieval; Finite element method; Iterative methods; Multiprocessing systems; Topology; Characteristic factors; Generation process; Matrix vector multiplication; Physically-based simulation; Tetrahedral meshes; Tetrahedral meshing; Volumetric modeling; Volumetric subdivision; Mesh generation",2-s2.0-85032450304

The influence of interface adhesion properties and weld metal yield strength on the variation of strain intensity is also evaluated.

Using these sensations as feedback during bidirectional prosthesis control, the patients were able to perform several functional tasks that would not be possible otherwise, such as applying one of three levels of force on an external sensor.

The results from a survey of 243 actual users of social commerce websites suggest that cognitive and affective appraisals are the main predictors of purchase intention, with cognitive appraisal having a higher predictive power than affective appraisal. In addition, learning from forums and communities and learning from ratings and reviews have significant influences on both cognitive and affective appraisals, while learning from forums and communities plays a more important role in formulating affective appraisal and learning from ratings and reviews plays a more important role in determining cognitive appraisal.

The framework is a synthesis of theories from building physics and social psychology including social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the drivers-needs-actions-systems ontology for energy-related behaviors. The goal of the research framework is to investigate the effects of various behavioral adaptations and building controls (i.e., adjusting thermostats, operating windows, blinds and shades, and switching on/off artificial lights) to determine impacts on occupant comfort and energy-related operational costs in the office environment. This study attempts to expand state-of-the-art understanding of: (1) the environmental, personal, and behavioral drivers motivating occupants to interact with building control systems across four seasons, (2) how occupants’ intention to share controls is influenced by social-psychological variables such as attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in group negotiation dynamic, (3) the perceived ease of usage and knowledge of building technologies, and (4) perceived satisfaction and productivity.

The fair scheduling for D2D communication in the orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based cellular network is studied in this paper. Based on the proportional fairness criteria, the optimization objective is formulated to maximize the sum of the relative achievable rate of both cellular users (CUs) and D2D pairs. It is a hybrid optimization problem since it involves in both the resource reuse and the transmit power control. A practical proportional fairness scheduling (PFS) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the admissible area is decided according to the transmit power limitation of terminals and the quality of service (QoS) requirement. Next, we seek the optimal transmit power combination for the CU and D2D pair in the admissible area and it is demonstrated that the optimal value can be selected from several points on the border of the admissible area. Lastly, when multiple subchannels can be employed for scheduling, based on the generated bipartite graph, Hungarian algorithm is adopted to realize maximum matching, i.e., select reusable CUs and D2D pairs to maximize the sum of the relative achievable rates.

It receives high velocity coolant flow from the fuel subassembly which travels through annular gap inside Control Safety Rod Driving Mechanism (CSRDM) assembly leading to swelling of free surface and gas entrainment inside the coolant pool. Entrained gas bubbles travel through different submerged components of the reactor and induces numerous complications including reactor power fluctuation, cavitation in inlet pumps and heat transfer inhibition in heat exchangers. Study of hydrodynamics around the shroud tube is crucial to examine cover gas entrainment inside the pool. The present study reports an experimental study on a 1:9 scale down model of CSRDM shroud tube assembly based on Froude number similarity. Eccentricity of the control rod inside the shroud tube is also an important parameter as temperature gradient along the CSRDM assembly leads to longitudinal thermal stress causing displacement of control rod from its center position in the shroud tube. Flow behavior around shroud tube, hump formation at the axial exit of shroud tube, air entrainment inside coolant pool have been reported for various parameters viz. inlet flow rate (qi), free surface height (hf) and eccentricity of central rod (e). Dye visualization, Schlieren visualization, Bulk visualization have been carried out and digital image processing techniques have been adopted for quantification of hump parameters and entrained air fraction inside the coolant pool. The axial flow from the exit of the shroud tube impinges on the free surface like a wall jet. At low Froude number, the impinging jet flow travels radially outward on the interface like a wall jet boundary layer. The shear of the free surface flow drags the jet like flow from the pores upward leading to mixing between the vortices inside the shear layer and the free vortices from the pores of the shroud tube. At high Froude number, the impinging jet like flow penetrates through the interface leading to hump formation. The downward motion of the hump reduces the radial free surface flow and blankets the radial flow from the pores of the shroud tube. The eccentricity of the central rod leads to asymmetric axial flow from the shroud tube and thus the resulting hump becomes asymmetric due to impingement of asymmetric jet. Therefore, the impingement angle of the downward hump motion becomes different at both sides of the shroud tube with asymmetric flow field and bubble formation process inside the liquid pool. However, the synchronization between the hump unsteadiness and the surface wave motion leads to mixing of air bubbles inside the liquid pool. Average entrained air fraction increases with increase in inlet flow rate and decreases with increase in free surface height. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Air entrainment; Argon; Axial flow; Boats; Boundary layers; Breeder reactors; Control rods; Coolants; Fast reactors; Flow fields; Fluid dynamics; Froude number; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Hydrodynamics; Image processing; Inlet flow; Jets; Liquid metals; Liquids; Mixing; Radial flow; Shear flow; Sodium; Surface waves; Tubes (components); Visualization; Vortex flow; Digital image processing technique; Dye visualization; Fast breeder reactors; Impinging jet flow; Liquid sodium cooled fast breeder reactor; Reactor power fluctuations; Schlieren visualization; Surface wave motion; Fighter aircraft",2-s2.0-85029601046

In this respect, the fashion of Circular Economy is in the fact that it aims at overcoming the dominant linear take, make, disposal economy model, i.e. “a traditional open-ended economy model developed with no built-in tendency to recycle, which is reflected by treating the environment as a waste reservoir” (Su et al., 2013). Circular Economy, indeed, bases on the establishment of closed production systems, where resources are reused and kept in a loop of production and usage, allowing generating more value and for a longer period. Despite the interest for Circular Economy by politicians and practitioners, scholars, particularly in the strategic management field, are still struggling with a lack of a framework explaining how companies willing to become circular adapt their existing business model or create a new one. By extensively reviewing, through the lens of business model literature, the extant contributions on Circular Economy, we propose a taxonomy of Circular Economy Business Models based on the degree of adoption of circularity along two major dimensions: (i) the customer value proposition & interface, i.e. the implementation of the circularity concept in proposing value to customers; (ii) the value network, i.e. the ways through which interacting with suppliers and reorganizing the own internal activities. The taxonomy is then initially tested through some explorative case studies, showing in practice the ability of the framework to properly distinguish different modes of adoption of Circular Economy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Circular economy business models; Closed-loop economy","Taxonomies; Waste disposal; Business modeling; Business models; Circular economy; Closed loops; Industrial paradigm; Internal activity; Production system; Strategic management; Economics",2-s2.0-85030719724

Subsequent determination and analysis of Rv2887 crystal structures in apo form, and in complex with SA, PAS and DNA showed that SA and PAS bind to Rv2887 at similar sites, and that Rv2887 interacts with DNA mainly by insertion of helix α4 into the major groove. Ligand binding triggers rotation of the wHTH domain of Rv2887 toward the dimerization domain, causing changes in protein conformation such that it can no longer bind to a 27 bp recognition sequence in the upstream region of gene Rv0560c. The structures provided here lay a foundation for the design of small molecules that target Rv2887, a potential new approach for the development of anti-mycobacterials. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85026199785

Small peptides, in particular ultrashort peptides containing up to seven amino acids, for which our laboratory has found many biomedical applications, exhibit immense potential in this regard. For next-generation applications, more intricate control is required over the self-assembly processes. We seek to find out how subtle moiety variation of peptides can affect self-assembly and nanostructure formation. To this end, we have selected a library of 54 tripeptides, derived from systematic moiety variations from seven tripeptides. Our study reveals that subtle structural changes in the tripeptides can exert profound effects on self-assembly, nanostructure formation, hydrogelation, and even phase transition of peptide nanostructures. By comparing the X-ray crystal structures of two tripeptides, acetylated leucine-leucine-glutamic acid (Ac-LLE) and acetylated tyrosine-leucine-aspartic acid (Ac-YLD), we obtained valuable insights into the structural factors that can influence the formation of supramolecular peptide structures. We believe that our results have major implications on the understanding of the factors that affect peptide self-assembly. In addition, our findings can potentially assist current computational efforts to predict and design self-assembling peptide systems for diverse biomedical applications. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85031008171

The unidirectional rotation is observed for soft vesicles, and the rotational angular velocity of vesicles depends mainly on the area fraction (ρ) and angular velocity (ω) of chiral active particles. There exists an optimal parameter for ω at which the rotational angular velocity of vesicle takes its maximal value. Meanwhile, at low concentration the continuity of curvature is destroyed seriously by chiral active particles, especially for large ω, and at high concentration the chiral active particles cover the vesicle almost uniformly. In addition, the center-of-mass mean square displacement for vesicles is accompanied by oscillations at short timescales, and the oscillation period of diffusion for vesicles is consistent with the rotation period of chiral active particles. The diffusion coefficient of vesicle decreases monotonously with increasing the angular velocity ω of chiral active particles.

The analysis and design of Social Machines has already started attracting considerable attention both within the industry and academia.

The mathematical model of the entire plant is presented and implemented to study the effect of the process parameters on the performances. This paper brings a step forward by determining the possible configuration and the performance of a whole industrial plant, able to realize the DME synthesis from CO2-rich streams in membrane reactor with recirculation. The whole process includes the utilization of a pure CO2 external feed, the steam production and all the necessary separation units. By fixing the set point of the process control variables, the recirculation streams are calculated though a mathematical algorithm founded on previous literature results.

The focusing of the electric field and the guiding effect of the jet trajectory due to the additional sharp-pin electrode are studied and demonstrated.

Chitosan has been extensively studied as a gene delivery carrier due to its good biocompatibility and biodegradability. Understanding the atomic interaction mechanism between chitosan and DNA is important in the design and application of chitosan-based drug and gene delivery systems. In this work, the interactions between single-stranded polynucleotides and different types of chitosan were systematically investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our results demonstrate that the functional groups of chitosan, the types of base and length of polynucleotides regulate the interaction behavior between chitosan and polynucleotides. The encapsulation capacity of polynucleotide by chitosan is mainly balanced by two factors: the strength of polynucleotide binding to chitosan and the tendency of self-aggregation of polynucleotide in the solution. For -NH3 + chitosan, due to the strong electrostatic interaction, especially the H-bond between -NH3 + groups in chitosan and phosphate groups in polynucleotide, the aggregation effect could be partially eliminated. The good dispersal capacity of polynucleotides may improve the encapsulation of polynucleotides by chitosan, and hence increase the delivery and transfection efficiency of chitosan-based gene carrier. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85023203200

Despite sharing an overall sequence identity of ~66% (similarity ~80%), these RND transporters feature distinct substrate specificity patterns whose underlying basis remains elusive. We performed exhaustive comparative analyses of the putative substrate binding pockets considering crystal structures, homology models and conformations extracted from multi-copy μs-long molecular dynamics simulations of both AcrB and AcrD. The impact of physicochemical and topographical properties (volume, shape, lipophilicity, electrostatic potential, hydration and distribution of multi-functional sites) within the pockets on their substrate specificities was quantitatively assessed. Differences in the lipophilic and electrostatic potentials among the pockets were identified. In particular, the deep pocket of AcrB showed the largest lipophilicity convincingly pointing out its possible role as a lipophilicity-based selectivity filter. Furthermore, we identified dynamic features (not inferable from sequence analysis or static structures) such as different flexibilities of specific protein loops that could potentially influence the substrate recognition and transport profile. Our findings can be valuable for drawing structure (dynamics)-activity relationship to be employed in drug design. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85027516263

Additionally, emotional response theory argues that enthusiastic verbal and nonverbal cues of an instructor will induce positive emotional states in learners, which in turn, enact learners’ approach behaviours in the learning process. Therefore, should a pedagogical agent convey enthusiastic behaviours in a multimedia learning environment? Literature and theoretical reviews offer two competing views. The first view, based on emotional response theory, predicts that enthusiastic verbal and nonverbal cues of a pedagogical agent can induce higher positive emotions in learners, which in turn, enhance affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and cognitive outcome. However, the second view, based on cognitive load theory, suggests that pedagogical agent enthusiasm may increase extraneous cognitive load (additional processing in the mind), which negatively impact emotion, affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and cognitive outcome. To investigate the effects of agent enthusiasm, seventy-two university freshmen interacted with either an enthusiastic agent or a neutral agent (operationalized through vocal tones, facial expression, gestures, and remarks) that simulates the instructional role of a virtual tutor that delivers narrative demonstrations on how to predict the outputs of C-Programming algorithms. The results of our study showed that pedagogical agent enthusiasm significantly enhanced emotion, intrinsic motivation, affective perceptions, and cognitive outcome. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that the facilitating effects of agent enthusiasm on intrinsic motivation, affective perceptions of the learning environment, and affective perceptions of the pedagogical agent were fully mediated by a learner’s positive emotion, thus demonstrating that the framework of emotional response theory can be applied to learner-agent interaction in a multimedia learning environment.

The problems are modeled as a wall where the flat side is isothermal and the other side, which has extended surfaces/fins, is subjected to convection with a uniform heat transfer coefficient. Hence, our analysis differs from the classical approach because (i) we consider multidimensional heat conduction and (ii) the wall on which the fins are attached is included in the analysis. The latter results in a nonisothermal temperature distribution along the base of the fin. The Biot number (Bi 1/4 ht=k) characterizing the heat transfer process is defined with respect to the thickness/diameter of the fins (t). Numerical results demonstrate that the fins would enhance the heat transfer rate only if the Biot number is less than a critical value, which, in general, depends on the geometrical parameters, i.e., the thickness of the wall, the length of the fins, and the period. For pin fins, similar to rectangular fins, the critical Biot number is independent of the geometry and is approximately equal to 3.1. The physical argument is that, under strong convection, a thick fin introduces an additional resistance to heat conduction. © 2017 by ASME.","Axisymmetric and pin fins; Critical Biot number; Fin effectiveness; Heat conduction; Longitudinal; Triangular; Uniform heat transfer coefficient","Fins (heat exchange); Geometry; Heat conduction; Heat convection; Heat resistance; Heat transfer coefficients; Biot number; Fin effectiveness; Longitudinal; Pin-fins; Triangular; Heat transfer",2-s2.0-85018513944

However, the two leading erroneous behavior taxonomies are based on incompatible phenomenological and genotypical perspectives. Further, neither of these are formulated in terms of task analytic methods, analysis and modeling techniques human factors engineers use for documenting how humans normatively achieve goals when interacting with a system. In this work, we introduce a new erroneous human behavior taxonomy based on where and how human behavior diverges from task analytic models of human behavior. By describing where a human diverges from a normative task, and by identifying what information the human failed to properly attend to that produced the divergence, this taxonomy seeks to unify the phenomenological and genotypical perspectives. We describe the theory behind this taxonomy and the different erroneous behavior classifications that result from it.

Leaders engage in important community activities such as encouraging members and building social structure. These potential benefits, however, have rarely been empirically tested. We were presented with an opportunity to explore this issue while studying an online board-and-card-game community. During our study, the community experienced a major change in leadership when the founder – and formal leader – decided to substantially reduce his involvement in the site. This provided us with the rare opportunity to carry out a case study of leadership reduction in a real-world community. To look at the effects of leadership on community behaviour, we analysed 16 months of activity logs, supported by interviews, to compare the community before, during, and after the founder’s withdrawal. We observed strong variability in the effects of a leadership reduction – some results were in line with the “leadership hypothesis,” but others were unexpected. In some cases, we found evidence that reducing formal leadership can have negative effects on the success of the community; but in other cases, we found surprising sources of resilience to the reduction in leadership activities. Our study is the first to look at the details of how leadership (and a reduction in this role) affects several types of sub-community within a board-and-card game site, and the first to consider some of the factors that lead to differences in the effects of leadership reduction. Overall, we found that negative effects on sub-communities were closely tied to the specific activities that the leader provided, and the degree to which he was the only person able to provide those roles. The broad strokes of this finding agree with the leadership hypothesis, but there are several unexpected elements within the main story: the negative effects were less drastic than we anticipated, and all of the sub-communities (even the most dependent) survived the transition. The strong resilience of some of the sub-communities seems to be connected to their ability to “fall back” to a foundation of shared activity (i.e., game play) – an idea that has been introduced in earlier work but never studied empirically. This research helps designers to understand the complexities of leadership in online communities, providing an important foundation for developing and supporting online groups. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Board and card games; Case study; Leadership change; Online games; Online leadership; Virtual community","Virtual reality; Card games; Leadership change; On-line games; Online leadership; Virtual community; Social networking (online)",2-s2.0-85019711514

Several studies tried to model the SRK behaviours from a Human Factor perspective. Despite such studies, there are no evidences in which such behaviours have been evaluated from a neurophysiological point of view, for example, by considering brain activity variations across the different SRK levels. Therefore, the proposed study aimed to investigate the use of neurophysiological signals to assess the cognitive control behaviours accordingly to the SRK taxonomy. The results of the study, performed on 37 professional Air Traffic Controllers, demonstrated that specific brain features could characterize and discriminate the different SRK levels, therefore enabling an objective assessment of the degree of cognitive control behaviours in realistic settings. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"aviation; behavior assessment; brain function; electroencephalogram; executive function; human; model; problem solving; safety; skill; taxonomy",2-s2.0-85017137790

Notably, these tests required movements along 3 degrees of freedom. Seven of 8 subjects preferred pattern recognition control over direct control. This study was the first home trial large enough to establish clinical and statistical significance in comparing pattern recognition with direct control. Results demonstrate that pattern recognition is a viable option and has functional advantages over direct control. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85032191550

The thickness and uniformity of the coatings were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The obtained coatings were conformal, 84 ALD cycles gave rise to approximately 20-nm-thick coatings and 168 ALD cycles to approximately 40-nm-thick coatings. It was found, that a uniform coating can be obtained at a purge time of 40 seconds. Reducing purge times below 20 seconds gives rise to increased particle growth and thus the coating becomes inhomogeneous. Initially, the samples that were coated had a size of 2×10 cm (thickness 0.3 mm). The size of the fabric was subsequently increased up to 8×20 cm and a uniform coating of the same quality was obtained. By oxidizing the coated fabrics, fabrics composed of interwoven alumina microtubes were obtained. Infiltration of the microtubes with solutions of two distinguishable fluorescent dyes showed that interchange of the dyes between warp and weft microtubes occurs, but is absent at approximately 20% of the crossovers. Taking all our findings into account, we conclude that the majority of the fibers were separated from each other by the coating prior to the oxidation. This work demonstrates that ALD is a suitable method to produce thin, conformal coatings on the surface of carbon fiber fabrics. © 2017 The American Ceramic Society","alumina; carbon fibers; ceramic matrix composites; chemical vapor deposition; coatings","Alumina; Carbon fibers; Ceramic matrix composites; Chemical vapor deposition; Coatings; Deposition; Fibers; Protective coatings; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Vapor deposition; Carbon fiber fabrics; Coated fabrics; Conformal coatings; Fluorescent dyes; Micro-tubes; Particle growth; Single fiber; Uniform coating; Atomic layer deposition",2-s2.0-85026674932

FBG sensors were fixed at center of each sensing component for pressure measurement. Performance of the sensing system was calibrated by applying step by step load on FBG pressure sensors. After calibration, this sensing platform was used to monitor plantar pressure distribution arise from weight gaining and losing processes of a female subject. It is found that plantar pressure of heel is almost twice the pressure magnitudes of both the first and second metatarsus (fore-foot), while there is limited pressure at the mid-foot position during weight gaining process. Pressures of the two metatarsus areas are around 50% (pressure ratio) of heel position and decrease continuously as the increase of subject weight, but weight losing process has very limited influence on this pressure ratio. Center of gravity of this female subject was also found to shift backward substantially during weighting gaining process. Therefore, protection of the heel position is highly important during both weight gaining and losing processes due to the presence of significant pressure concentration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","FBG; Foot planar pressure; Fused deposition modeling; Monitoring","3D printers; Bragg gratings; Calibration; Deposition; Fabrication; Layered manufacturing; Monitoring; Pressure measurement; Center of gravity; Fused deposition modeling; Plantar pressure distributions; Plantar pressure measurement; Plantar pressures; Pressure concentration; Sensing components; Sensing platforms; Fiber Bragg gratings",2-s2.0-85027877143

The damaged–plasticity model proposed by Lubliner and collaborators was employed for the plain concrete, and elastic–perfectly plastic models were employed for the steel reinforcement. A perfect bond was assumed between the steel rebars and concrete, whereby the bond–slip behaviour, as well as damage along crack patterns, were modelled through concrete damage. The influence of the shape of the tension–softening law on the numerical load–deflection response was studied by considering bi–linear, exponential and linear post–failure stress–displacement and stress–strain relationships. The effect of modelling steel rebars with truss or beam elements was also investigated. Structured meshes of linear hexahedral elements either with incompatible modes or with reduced integration, and unstructured meshes of either linear or ‘modified’ quadratic tetrahedral elements were considered. In terms of load–deflection curves, both the structured and the unstructured meshes gave results in very good agreement with test results. In terms of crack patterns, results predicted by the structured meshes exhibited some mesh bias, which was less pronounced with the unstructured meshes. In the post–yield phase, if a geometrically nonlinear model is used, discrepancies were found when truss elements were used for steel rebars, whereas good agreement was found if the bending stiffness of the rebars is included using beam elements. This is a non–obvious result that may be important to consider when studying the progressive collapse of RC structures. © 2017","ABAQUS/explicit; Damage–plasticity coupling; Embedded reinforcement; Nonlinear FEA; Reinforced–concrete beams","ABAQUS; Beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Cracks; Mesh generation; Plasticity; Reinforcement; Structural dynamics; Trusses; Unloading; Abaqus/explicit; Computational challenges; Concrete beam; Displacement and stress; Embedded reinforcements; Experimental validations; Geometrically nonlinear; Non-linear FEA; Concretes",2-s2.0-85028964300

These constants are provably optimal for the inequality of interest. As their calculation is based on the solution of a generalised eigenvalue problem involving the volumetric and face stiffness matrices, the method is applicable to any element type for which these matrices can be calculated, including standard finite elements and the non-uniform rational B-splines of isogeometric analysis. In particular, the presented method does not require the Jacobian of the element to be constant, and so can be applied to a much wider variety of element shapes than are currently available in the literature. Numerical results are presented for a variety of finite element and isogeometric cases. When the Jacobian is constant, it is demonstrated that the new method produces lower penalty parameters than existing methods in the literature in all cases, which translates directly into savings in the solution time of the resulting linear system. When the Jacobian is not constant, it is shown that the naive application of existing approaches can result in penalty parameters that do not guarantee coercivity of the bilinear form, and by extension, the stability of the solution. The method of manufactured solutions is applied to a model reaction-diffusion equation with a range of parameters, and it is found that using penalty parameters based on the new trace inequality constants result in better conditioned linear systems, which can be solved approximately 11% faster than those produced by the methods from the literature. © 2017 The Authors","Diffusion synthetic acceleration; Discontinuous Galerkin; Finite element analysis; Interior penalty; Isogeometric analysis; Trace inverse inequality",,2-s2.0-85029489442

However, recent research also shows that some adolescents are reporting physical discomfort from using ICT such as sore eyes and pain in neck and shoulders. This paper explores how primary school students perceive the negative consequences of using ICT (i.e., discomfort and distraction) in relation to the use of ICT for school and leisure purposes, their self-beliefs, and the perceived usefulness of ICT. Using the data obtained from a large sample of Norwegian seventh-graders (N = 1,640, between 12 and 13 years old), we performed structural equation modelling to test our assumptions on the role of students' discomfort from using ICT. We hypothesized an indirect effects model, in which the use of ICT and students' beliefs are indirectly associated via perceived discomfort. Our findings are two-fold: First, discomfort from using ICT was negatively related to students’ use of ICT for leisure; yet neither to self-efficacy in using ICT nor perceived usefulness. In contrast, perceived distraction by ICT was negatively related to perceived usefulness, yet positively associated with ICT use in lessons. Second, the direct and positive relations among the use of ICT, perceived usefulness, and self-efficacy were statistically significant. These findings uncover that the potentially negative consequences of distraction relate to the extent to which students perceive ICT as useful. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Discomfort from using ICT; Distraction; ICT self-efficacy; ICT use; Perceived usefulness","Ophthalmology; Students; Discomfort from using ICT; Distraction; ICT use; Perceived usefulness; Self efficacy; Education",2-s2.0-85028541417

While work-conserving policies are optimal for macrolevel measures, scheduling policies with strategic idleness (SI) might be helpful for microlevel measures. Using the empirical data obtained from the service provider, we provide statistical evidence that SI is used by its schedulers to manage the macro- and microlevel measures. However, the company has no specific rules on implementing SI and the schedulers make decisions based on their own experience. Our primary goal is to develop a systematic framework for the joint usage of SI with dynamic scheduling policies (DSPs). We suggest to use threshold-based policies to intelligently combine SI and DSPs and show that the resulting policies provide an efficient way to simultaneously address both macro- and microlevel measures. We build two simulation models: one based on empirical data and one based on a randomly generated open-shop network.

Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed method offer significant gain in terms of the energy efficiency. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Energy efficient; Flexible coverage; Integer programming; On-off control; Trade-off","Base stations; Dynamic programming; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network layers; Numerical methods; Optimization; Wireless networks; Analysis and simulation; Departure process; Energy efficient; Flexible coverage; Multi-base station; On-off control; Reduce energy consumption; Trade off; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-85018354631

This results in a mismatch between the application needs from storage and what storage can deliver. The full potential of storage devices cannot be harnessed till all layers of I/O hierarchy function efficiently. Despite advanced optimizations applied across various layers along the odyssey of data access, the I/O stack still remains volatile. The problems associated due to the inefficiencies in data management get amplified in Big Data shared resource environments. The Linux OS (host) block layer is the most critical part of the I/O hierarchy, as it orchestrates the I/O requests from different applications to the underlying storage. Unfortunately, despite it’s significance, the block layer, essentially the block I/O scheduler, hasn’t evolved to meet the needs of Big Data. We have designed and developed two contention avoidance storage solutions, collectively known as “BID: Bulk I/O Dispatch” in the Linux block layer specifically to suit multi-tenant, multi-tasking shared Big Data environments. Hard disk drives (HDDs) form the backbone of data center storage. The data access time in HDDs is majorly governed by disk arm movements, which usually occurs when data is not accessed sequentially. Big Data applications exhibit evident sequentiality but due to the contentions amongst other I/O submitting applications, the I/O accesses get multiplexed which leads to higher disk arm movements. BID schemes aim to exploit the inherent I/O sequentiality of Big Data applications to improve the overall I/O completion time by reducing the avoidable disk arm movements. In the first part, we propose a dynamically adaptable block I/O scheduling scheme BID-HDD for disk based storage. BID-HDD tries to recreate the sequentiality in I/O access in order to provide performance isolation to each I/O submitting process. Through trace driven simulation based experiments with cloud emulating MapReduce benchmarks, we show the effectiveness of BID-HDD which results in 28–52% lesser time for all I/O requests than the best performing Linux disk schedulers. In the second part, we propose a hybrid scheme BID-Hybrid to exploit SCM’s (SSDs) superior random performance to further avoid contentions at disk based storage. BID-Hybrid is able to efficiently offload non-bulky interruptions from HDD request queue to SSD queue using BID-HDD for disk request processing and multi-q FIFO architecture for SSD. This results in performance gain of 6–23% for MapReduce workloads when compared to BID-HDD and 33–54% over best performing Linux scheduling scheme. BID schemes as a whole is aimed to avoid contentions for disk based storage I/Os following system constraints without compromising SLAs. © 2017, The Author(s).","Big Data; Block I/O layer; Contention avoidance; Hadoop; Hard disk drives; Hdfs; I/O scheduler; MapReduce; Multi-tier; Solid state drives; Storage",,2-s2.0-85021067968

In the building energy analysis domain, several tools have been created in the past to facilitate such analyses. However, the existing coupling frameworks such as Building Control Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB), MLE+, High-Level Architecture (HLA), and Functional Mockup Unit are characterized by their inherent complexity, making it a challenge for the building practitioners to widely deploy them in everyday decision-making. In addition, several of these frameworks embody tight coupling, which means they lack the flexibility to incorporate models and components of decision-makers’ choice. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a Lightweight and Adaptive Building Simulation (LABS) framework that capitalizes on Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM), an inter-process communication framework widely used by the robotics community. As a case study demonstrating this new framework, a building energy simulation model is coupled with an agent-based occupant behavior model to understand the energy effects of occupants’ thermal comfort related actions (e.g., adjusting the thermostat set point). These behavioral patterns are also influenced by various interventions (e.g., peer pressure, energy-based education) that may occur in the building. Measuring these effects in a real building for a lengthy period is impractical and resource-intensive and the LABS framework can be used for understanding this system better. The results also highlight opportunities for achieving energy savings by influencing the occupants’ comfort related behavior. © 2017, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","distributed simulation; energy simulation; lightweight and adaptive building simulation; occupant behavior model; thermal comfort","Computer software; Decision making; Energy conservation; Network function virtualization; Thermal comfort; Virtual reality; Building energy analysis; Building energy simulations; Building simulation; Distributed simulations; Energy simulation; Interprocess communication; Occupant behavior; Thermal comfort analysis; Buildings",2-s2.0-85030837465

Here, a vertex is considered as covered if it lies within a given distance of at least a vertex of a route. This article introduces a generalized variant of the m-CTP that we called the multi-vehicle multi-covering Tour Problem (mm-CTP). In the mm-CTP, a vertex must be covered at least not only once but several times. Three variants of the problem are considered. The binary mm-CTP where a vertex is visited at most once, the mm-CTP without overnight where revisiting a vertex is allowed only after passing through another vertex and the mm-CTP with overnight where revisiting a vertex is permitted without any restrictions. We first propose graph transformations to convert the last two variants into the binary one and focus mostly on solving this variant. A special case of the problem is then formulated as an integer linear program and a branch-and-cut algorithm is developed. We also develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that provides high-quality solutions for the problem. Extensive computational results on the new problem mm-CTP as well as its other special cases show the performance of our methods. In particular, our GA outperforms the current best metaheuristics proposed for a wide class of CTP problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-cut; Covering tour problem; Genetic algorithm; Metaheuristic; Multi-covering; Vehicle routing problem","Bins; Integer programming; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch and cut; Covering tour problem; Metaheuristic; Multi-covering; Vehicle Routing Problems; Genetic algorithms",2-s2.0-85026486214

To date only Mn addition is known to transform the β-Al9Fe2Si2 phase in the Al-Si-Fe system. However, for the first time, as reported here, it is shown that β-phase transforms to the ω-Al7Cu2Fe phase in the presence of Cu, after solutionization at 793 K. The ω-phase decomposes below 673 K resulting into the formation of θ-Al2Cu phase. However, the present thermodynamic description of the Al-Si-Fe-Cu system needs finer tuning to accurately predict the stability of the ω-phase in these alloys. In the present study, an attempt was made to enhance the strength of Al-6wt%Si-2wt%Fe model recycled cast alloy with different amount of Cu addition.

The combination of such methods in an operational system is a technical challenge that requires efficient architectural solutions. In a robotic engineering context, where productivity is important, it is also important to minimize the effort for the development of new systems. As a response to these needs, this paper presents Aerostack, an open-source software framework for the development of aerial robotic systems. This framework facilitates the creation of UAS by providing a set of reusable components specialized in functional tasks of aerial robotics (trajectory planning, self localization, etc.) together with an integration method in a multi-layered cognitive architecture based on five layers: reactive, executive, deliberative, reflective and social. Compared to other software frameworks for UAS, Aerostack can provide higher degrees of autonomy and it is more versatile to be applied to different types of hardware (aerial platforms and sensors) and different types of missions (e.g. multi robot swarm systems). Aerostack has been validated during four years (since February 2013) by its successful use on many research projects, international competitions and public exhibitions.

Mutations in the DSG2-gene are regarded to cause arrhythmogenic (right ventricular) cardiomyopathy (ARVC) which is a rare but severe heart muscle disease. The molecular pathomechanisms of the vast majority of DSG2 mutations, however, are unknown. Here, we investigated the homophilic binding of wildtype Dsg2 and two mutations which are associated with ARVC. Using single molecule force spectroscopy and applying Jarzynski's equality we determined the kinetics and thermodynamics of Dsg2 homophilic binding. Notably, the free energy landscape of Dsg2 dimerization exposes a high activation barrier which is in line with the proposed strand-swapping binding motif. Although the binding motif is not directly affected by the mutations the binding kinetics differ significantly from the wildtype. Furthermore, we applied a dispase based cell dissociation assay using HT1080 cell lines over expressing Dsg2 wildtype and mutants, respectively. Our molecular and cellular results consistently demonstrate that Dsg2 mutations can heavily affect homophilic Dsg2 interactions.

These act as cofactors of a plethora of flavoproteins in all organisms. Therefore, regulation of their production maintains the cellular flavoproteome homeostasis.

Three picosecond laser generated surface topographies (Ti1, Ti2, Ti3) on titanium were produced, treated with fluoroalkylsilane (FAS), then characterised using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Raman Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, contact angle measurements and white light interference microscopy. The surfaces had a range of different macro/micro/nano topographies. Ti2 had a unique, surface topography with large blunt conical peaks and was predominantly a rutile surface with closely packed, self-assembled FAS; this was the most hydrophobic sample (water contact angle 160°; ΔGiwi was −135.29 mJ m−2). Bacterial attachment, adhesion and retention to the surfaces demonstrated that all the laser generated surfaces retained less bacteria than the control surface. This also occurred following the adhesion and retention assays when the bacteria were either not rinsed from the surfaces or were retained in static conditions for one hour. This work demonstrated that picosecond laser generated surfaces may be used to produce antiadhesive surfaces that significantly reduced surface fouling. It was determined that a tri-modally dimensioned surface roughness, with a blunt conical macro-topography, combined with a close-packed fluoroalkyl monolayer was required for an optimised superhydrophobic surface. These surfaces were effective even following surface immersion and static conditions for one hour, and thus may have applications in a number of food or medical industries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-adhesive; Antifouling; Bacteria; Laser surface texture; Retention; Superhydrophobic","Adhesion; Bacteria; Contact angle; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrophobicity; Oxide minerals; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface roughness; Topography; X ray spectroscopy; Anti-adhesive; Antifouling; Laser surface; Retention; Superhydrophobic; Surface topography",2-s2.0-85031720330

Previous studies have shown that physically demanding work may affect mental performance and may be accompanied by impaired mental processing and decreased performance. In this study, 14 participants were recruited to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) procedures in a virtual simulator. Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals of the bilateral trapezius, bicipital, brachioradialis and flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscles and eye-tracking signals were acquired during the experiment. The results showed that the least square means of muscle activity during the LC phases of surgery in an all-participants mixed effects model were 0.79, 0.81, and 0.98, respectively. The observed muscle activities in the different phases exhibited some similarity, while marked differences were found between the forearm bilateral muscles. Regarding mental workload, significant differences were observed in pupil dilation between the three phases of laparoscopic surgery. The mental and physical workloads of laparoscopic surgeons do not appear to be generally correlated, although a few significant negative correlations were found.

ECML extended the basic formalism, DEV&DESS, with uses in modeling and simulation, whereas algorithmic verification on the ECML models continues to be an on-going research task. Objective This paper proposes a verification technique to verify ECML models with SpaceEx, a verification platform for hybrid systems. It includes translation rules from ECML into the SpaceEx model. Method As SpaceEx reads linear hybrid automata, we developed translation rules from ECML models to linear hybrid automata and implemented an automatic translator ECMLtoSpaceEx. We also developed a rule checker ECML Checker to check whether an ECML model complies with assumptions and restrictions to overcome the semantic gap between the two formal languages. We performed a case study with an extension of the widely used example ‘barrel-filler system’ to demonstrate the effectiveness of our verification technique. Results The verification result shows that our verification technique can translate ECML models into SpaceEx models, and we also perform formal verification on ECML models with SpaceEx. Conclusions The proposed technique can verify ECML with support fromSpaceEx. We expect that the proposed translation rules can be used with minor modifications to translate ECML models into different notations, and thus allow for the use of verification tools other than SpaceEx. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic translation; ECML; Formal verification; Linear hybrid automata; Spaceex","Automata theory; Formal languages; Hybrid systems; Modeling languages; Semantics; Translation (languages); Algorithmic verification; Automatic translation; Automatic translators; ECML; Linear hybrid automata; Spaceex; Verification platforms; Verification techniques; Formal verification",2-s2.0-85027125804

We derive a new spectral representation for the optimal steady-state production rate and the corresponding optimal steady-state ribosomal density in the RFMR. This representation has several important advantages. First, it provides a simple and numerically stable algorithm for determining the optimal values even in very long rings. Second, it enables efficient computation of the sensitivity of the optimal production rate to small changes in the transition rates along the mRNA. Third, it implies that the optimal steady-state production rate is a strictly concave function of the transition rates. Maximizing the optimal steady-state production rate with respect to the rates under an affine constraint on the rates thus becomes a convex optimization problem that admits a unique solution. This solution can be determined numerically using highly efficient algorithms. This optimization problem is important, for example, when re-engineering heterologous genes in a host organism.

The TMD of the SNARE protein synaptobrevin2/VAMP2 contains two highly conserved small amino acids, G100 and C103, in its central portion. Substituting G100 and/or C103 with the ß-branched amino acid valine impairs the structural flexibility of the TMD in terms of a-helix/ß-sheet transitions in model membranes (measured by infrared reflection-absorption or evanescent wave spectroscopy) during increase in protein/lipid ratios, a parameter expected to be altered by recruitment of SNAREs at fusion sites. This structural change is accompanied by reduced membrane fluidity (measured by infrared ellipsometry). The G100V/C103V mutation nearly abolishes depolarization-evoked exocytosis (measured by membrane capacitance) and hormone secretion (measured biochemically). Single-vesicle optical (by TIRF microscopy) and biophysical measurements of ATP release indicate that G100V/C103V retards initial fusion-pore opening, hinders its expansion and leads to premature closure in most instances. We conclude that the TMD of VAMP2 plays a critical role in membrane fusion and that the structural mobility provided by the central small amino acids is crucial for exocytosis by influencing the molecular re-arrangements of the lipid membrane that are necessary for fusion pore opening and expansion. © The Author(s) 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85020376769

The framework developed in this paper enables us to analyse the assumptions made by the initial promoters of the SE on its impact on markets, governments, workers, consumers, and the environment and set a research agenda that can help academics and governments engage in a more nuanced discussion on the disruption created by the SE. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Conceptual paper; Critical studies; Neoliberalism; Platform capitalism; Sharing economy","Lipids; Organic compounds; Critical studies; Economic modeling; Financial Times; Neoliberalism; Platform capitalism; Regulatory bodies; Sharing economy; Social progress; Economics",2-s2.0-85020080061

C1C2, a functional chimeric protein of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ChR1 and ChR2, is the only ChR whose crystal structure has been solved, and thus uniquely suitable for structure-based analysis. We report C1C2 photoreaction dynamics with ultrafast transient absorption and multi-pulse spectroscopy combined with target analysis and structure-based hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. Two relaxation pathways exist on the excited (S1) state through two conical intersections CI1 and CI2, that are reached via clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations: (i) the C13=C14 isomerization path with 450 fs via CI1 and (ii) a relaxation path to the initial ground state with 2.0 ps and 11 ps via CI2, depending on the hydrogen-bonding network, hence indicating active-site structural heterogeneity. The presence of the additional conical intersection CI2 rationalizes the relatively low quantum yield of photoisomerization (30 ± 3%), reported here. Furthermore, we show the photoreaction dynamics from picoseconds to seconds, characterizing the complete photocycle of C1C2. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85026797844

Of these isoform enzymes, class IIa (containing HDAC4, 5, 7 and 9) target unique substrates, some of which are client proteins associated with epigenetic control. Class IIa HDACs are reportedly associated with some neuronal disorders, making HDACs therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, some reported HDAC inhibitors contain hydroxamate moiety that chelates with zinc ion to become the cofactor of HDAC enzymes. However, the hydroxamate functional group is shown to cause undesirable effects and has poor pharmacokinetic profile. This study used in silico virtual screening methodology to identify several nonhydroxamate compounds, obtained from National Cancer Institute database, which potentially inhibited HDAC4. Comparisons of the enzyme inhibitory activity against a panel of HDAC isoforms revealed these compounds had strong inhibitory activity against class IIa HDACs, but weak inhibitory activity against class I HDACs. Further analysis revealed that a single residue affects the cavity size between class I and class IIa HDACs, thus contributing to the selectivity of HDAC inhibitors discovered in this study.

Consequently there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying different recovery scenarios. Recent work has demonstrated that reef structural complexity can facilitate coral recovery, but the mechanism remains unclear. Similarly, experiments suggest that coral larvae can distinguish between the water from healthy and degraded reefs, however, whether or not they can use these cues to navigate to healthy reefs is an open question. Here, we use a meta-analytic approach to document that coral larval swimming speeds are orders of magnitude lower than measurements of water flow both on and off reefs. Therefore, the ability of coral larvae to navigate to reefs while in the open-ocean, or to settlement sites while on reefs is extremely limited. We then show experimentally that turbulence generated by fine scale structure is required to deliver larvae to the substratum even in conditions mimicking calm back-reef flow environments.

The results indicate that although product complexity has a negative impact on product interest, customers' beliefs about the degree of malleability of their intelligence can interact with product complexity, thereby impacting their reactions to complex, technological products. In particular, the results indicate that for a technological product perceived as complex, incremental theorists have more favorable reactions than entity theorists, while for a technological product perceived as simple, incremental and entity theorists have similar reactions. Further, this research finds that individuals low in negative effort beliefs react more favorably to complex products, compared to those high in negative effort beliefs.

We have recently investigated a detector geometry composed of a monolithic scintillator readout on two sides by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays, and we have proposed two parameters for the DOI determination: the difference in the number of triggered SiPMs on the two sides of the detector and the difference in the maximum collected signal on a single SiPM on each side. This work is focused on the DOI calibration and on the determination of the capability of our detector. For the DOI calibration, we studied a method which can be implemented also in detectors mounted in a full PET scanner. We used a PET detector module composed of a monolithic 20 × 20 × 10 mm3 LYSO scintillator crystal coupled on two opposite faces to two arrays of SiPMs. On each side, the scintillator was coupled to 6 × 6 SiPMs. In this paper, the two parameters previously proposed for the DOI determination were calibrated with two different methods. The first used a lateral scan of the detector with a collimated 511 keV pencil beam at steps of 0.5 mm to study the detector DOI capability, while the second used the background radiation of the 176Lu in the scintillator. The DOI determination capability was tested on different regions of the detector using each parameter and the combination of the two. Results: With both parameters for the DOI determination, in the lateral scan, the bias between the mean reconstructed DOI and the real beam position was lower than 0.3 mm, and the DOI distribution had a standard deviation of about 1.5 mm. When using the calibration with the radioactivity of the LYSO, the mean bias increased of about 0.2 mm but with no degradation of the standard deviation of the DOI distribution. Conclusions: The two parameters allow to achieve a DOI resolution comparable with the state of the art, giving a continuous information about the three-dimensional interaction position of the scintillation. These results were obtained by using simple estimators and a detector scalable to a whole PET system. The DOI calibration obtained using lutetium natural radioactivity gives results comparable to the other standard method but appears more readily applicable to detectors mounted in a full PET scanner. © 2017, The Author(s).","Depth of interaction; Monolithic scintillator; Positron emission tomography; Silicon photomultiplier","lutetium; lutetium 176; unclassified drug; Article; calibration; controlled study; depth of interaction; frontal irradiation; general device; irradiation; lateral irradiation; monolithic scintillator; PET scanner; process development; radiation beam; radiation detector; radiation measurement; radioactivity; signal detection; silicon photomultiplier; statistical analysis",2-s2.0-85013276135

Fluorescent proteins fused to the stator of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor (BFM) have previously been used to unveil the motor subunit dynamics. Here we report the effects on single motors of three fluorescent proteins fused to the stators, all of which altered BFM behavior. The torque generated by individual stators was reduced while their stoichiometry remained unaffected. MotB fusions decreased the switching frequency and induced a novel bias-dependent asymmetry in the speed in the two directions. These effects could be mitigated by inserting a linker at the fusion point. These findings provide a quantitative account of the effects of fluorescent fusions to the stator on BFM dynamics and their alleviation-new insights that advance the use of fluorescent fusions to probe the dynamics of protein complexes. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85030572155

Respective computational models must be validated by experimental data from in vivo characterization of the mastication system's mechanical response. The present pilot-study demonstrates the feasibility of a combined experimental and numerical procedure to validate a computer model of the masseter muscle. An experimental setup is proposed that provides a simultaneous bite force measurement and ultrasound-based visualization of muscle deformation. The direct comparison of the experimentally observed and numerically predicted muscle response demonstrates the predictive capabilities of such anatomically accurate biting models. Differences between molar and incisor biting are investigated; muscle deformation is recorded for three different bite forces in order to capture the effect of increasing muscle fiber recruitment. The three-dimensional (3D) muscle deformation at each bite position and force-level is approximatively reconstructed from ultrasound measurements in five distinct cross-sectional areas (four horizontal and one vertical cross section). The experimental work is accompanied by numerical simulations to validate the predictive capabilities of a constitutive muscle model previously formulated. An anatomy-based, fully 3D model of the masseter muscle is created from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the same subject. The direct comparison of experimental and numerical results revealed good agreement for maximum bite forces and masseter deformations in both biting positions. The present work therefore presents a feasible in vivo measurement system to validate numerically predicted masseter muscle contractions during mastication. © 2017 by ASME.",,"Deformation; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mastication; Ultrasonics; Cranio-maxillofacial surgery; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Numerical characterization; Predictive capabilities; Predictive simulations; Temporomandibular joint disorders; Threedimensional (3-d); Ultrasound measurement; Muscle",2-s2.0-85030552136

A major causative mechanism of AMR is mediated through the multidrug efflux pump (MEP). The resistance-nodulation-division superfamily (RND family) of Gram-negative bacteria is usually the major cause of MDR in clinical studies. In Salmonella enterica, the RND pump is translated from the arcAB gene, which is regulated by the activator RamA. Many MEP-caused AMR strains have high ramA gene expression due to mutations in RamR, which has a homodimeric structure comprising the dimerization domain and DNA-binding domain (DBD). Three mutations on the dimerization domain, namely Y59H, M84I, and E160D, are far from the DBD; the molecular mechanism through which they influence RamR's binding affinity to the ramA gene promoter and consequently disrupt RamA remains unclear. The present study conducted molecular dynamics simulations, binding free energy calculations, and normal mode analysis to investigate the mechanism through which Y59H, M84I, and E160D mutations on the dimerization domain influence the binding affinity of RamR to the ramA promoter. The present results suggest that the three mutations alter the RamR structure, resulting in decreased DNA-binding affinity. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85031813783

The incorporation of collagen III in I caused the fibrils to be thinner with a shorter D-banding than pure collagen I. Hertzian contact model was used to obtain the elastic moduli from atomic force microscope indentation testing using a force volume analysis. The results indicated that an increase in the percentage of tropocollagen III reduced the mechanical stiffness of the obtained fibrils.

Physiological TDP-43 oligomerization is mediated by its N-terminal domain, which can adopt dynamic, solenoid-like structures, as revealed by a 2.1 Å crystal structure in combination with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron microscopy. These head-to-tail TDP-43 oligomers are unique among known RNA-binding proteins and represent the functional form of the protein in vivo, since their destabilization results in loss of alternative splicing regulation of known neuronal RNA targets.

Dendrochronological data and linear mixed-effects models show similar effects of precipitation for April–May (positive) for both seedling- and coppice-origin trees. Previous autumn and current June temperature show significant negative correlations to growth in coppice forests. Nonetheless, trees from high forest stands showed increasing drought sensitivity and tended to show a stronger response to the previous autumn's temperature during the 20th century. The positive effect of warmer autumns, only found on high stands, might be related to the extended growing season, suggesting improved adaptive capacity to cope with impending warmer conditions.

First, by using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we demonstrated a physical AT1R-A2AR interaction in cultured cells. Interestingly, by protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we described that a stable heterotetrameric interaction may exist between AT1R and A2AR bound to antagonists (i.e. losartan and istradefylline, respectively). Accordingly, we subsequently ascertained the existence of AT1R/A2AR heteromers in the striatum by proximity ligation in situ assay.

Thus, reserpinized mice were co-treated with sub-effective losartan and istradefylline doses, which prompted a synergistic reduction in VCM.

The Hsp40 co-chaperone converts this fully closed conformation to an open conformation to initiate productive substrate binding. Taken together, this study provided a mechanistic understanding of the dynamic nature of the polypeptide-binding pocket in the Hsp70 chaperone cycle. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85032583287

However, there are three major challenges regarding the optical system in the AR system, which are registration, vision correction, and readability under strong ambient light. Here, we solve three challenges simultaneously for the first time using two liquid crystal (LC) lenses and polarizer-free attenuator integrated in optical-see-through AR system. One of the LC lens is used to electrically adjust the position of the projected virtual image which is so-called registration. The other LC lens with larger aperture and polarization independent characteristic is in charge of vision correction, such as myopia and presbyopia. The linearity of lens powers of two LC lenses is also discussed. The readability of virtual images under strong ambient light is solved by electrically switchable transmittance of the LC attenuator originating from light scattering and light absorption. The concept demonstrated in this paper could be further extended to other electro-optical devices as long as the devices exhibit the capability of phase modulations and amplitude modulations. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85017152893

Interventions aimed at optimizing transition into outpatient care may be effective in preventing symptom deterioration and readmission. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of care transition interventions for patients with depression after psychiatric hospitalization. Methods Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of controlled trials. Primary outcomes were readmissions and symptoms of depression. The control condition was treatment as usual. Results We included 16 publications reporting the results of 13 different studies. Studies were heterogeneous concerning patient selection and interventional approach. Effects on readmissions and depression symptoms were non-significant in meta-analysis of 8 studies/710 patients and 7 studies/592 patients, respectively. Overall risk ratio for readmission during follow-up was 0.65 (95% CI [0.42;1.01], p=0.06), standardized mean difference for depression symptoms was −0.09 (95% CI [−0.37;0.19], p=0.53). Subgroup analyses indicated no preference for a specific interventional strategy. Data point to considerable risk for selection and publication bias. Limitations Included studies are heterogeneous; subgroups are often small and may not attain the power to detect effects. Reasonable classification of interventions into groups of comparable approaches was a challenge and may be arbitrary in some cases. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis could not identify any convincingly effective interventional transition approach for patients with depression after psychiatric hospitalization. Current evidence regarding discharge management for depression is limited, heterogeneous and potentially prone to bias. Interventions might be more appropriate for patients with other diagnoses than depression. Further high-quality randomized studies are required. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Depression; Discharge management; Meta-analysis; Systematic review; Transitional care","depression; follow up; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; human; mental health; mental hospital; meta analysis (topic); outcome assessment; outpatient care; patient satisfaction; patient selection; priority journal; publication; quality of life; recurrence risk; recurrent disease; Review; systematic review; transitional care",2-s2.0-85024844626

This study reports a series of toxicity experiments on a representative coastal marine diatom species Chaetoceros curvisetus using the reference AgNP, NM-300K. Exposure to AgNPs resulted in photosynthetic impairment and loss of diatom biomass in proportion to the supplied AgNP dose. The underlying mechanism of toxicity was explored via comparing biological responses in parallel experiments. Diatom responses to AgNP, free Ag(I) species, and dialysis bag-retained AgNP treatments showed marked similarity, pointing towards a dominant role of Ag(I) species uptake, rather than NPs themselves, in inducing the toxic response. In marked contrast to previous studies, addition of the organic complexing agent cysteine (Cys) alongside Ag only marginally moderated toxicity, implying AgCys- complexes were bioavailable to this diatom species. A preliminary field experiment with a natural phytoplankton community in the southeast Atlantic Ocean showed no significant toxic response at a NM-300 K concentration that resulted in ∼40% biomass loss in the culture studies, suggesting a modulating effect of natural seawaters on Ag toxicity. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85028944157

A three-step detection strategy is introduced for inverse analysis, whereas extended finite element method (XFEM) is adopted for forward analysis. The use of XFEM is to avoid re-meshing during the change of flaw geometries. The three-step detection strategy involves: firstly, an optimization method that couples an improved discrete artificial bee colony algorithm and hierarchical clustering analysis (IDABC-HCA) is used to capture subdomains containing flaws with limited measure points in the global domain; secondly, additional measure points are introduced locally within each captured subdomain, where the number of flaws and the rough geometry of each flaw are quickly determined with the IDABC-HCA; finally, true geometries of flaws are obtained on the basis of the rough geometries by the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method. To save computational time, “Queue and Kill” method is proposed to actively identify and eliminate the improper candidate flaws and/or flaw clusters. Three numerical examples of multiple flaw detection that include simple and complex flaw geometries are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively detect multiple complex flaw clusters without prior information of the flaw number. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","BFGS; Discrete artificial bee colony algorithm; Flaw clusters; Hierarchical clustering analysis; Inverse problem; XFEM","Computational methods; Evolutionary algorithms; Finite element method; Geometry; Inverse problems; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Signal detection; Artificial bee colony algorithms; BFGS; Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno; Computational approach; Extended finite element method; Hierarchical clustering analysis; Optimization method; XFEM; Clustering algorithms",2-s2.0-85028589925

Model-driven techniques have proven useful not only as regards developing new software applications but also the reengineering of legacy systems. Models and metamodels provide a high-level formalism with which to represent artefacts commonly manipulated in the different stages of a software evolution process (e.g., a software migration) while model transformation allows the automation of the evolution tasks to be performed. Some approaches and experiences of model-driven software reengineering have recently been presented but they have been focused on the code while data reengineering aspects have been overlooked. The objective of this work is to assess to what extent data reengineering processes could also take advantage of MDE techniques. The article starts by characterising data-reengineering in terms of the tasks involved. It then goes on to state that MDE is particularly amenable as regards addressing the tasks previously identified. We present an MDE-based approach for the reengineering of data whose purpose is to improve the quality of the logical schema in a relational data migration scenario. As a proof of concept, the approach is illustrated for two common problems in data re-engineering: undeclared foreign keys and disabled constraints. This approach is organised following the three stages of a software reengineering process: reverse engineering, restructuring and forward engineering. We show how each stage is implemented by means of model transformation chains. A running example is used to illustrate each stage of the process throughout the article. The approach is validated with a real widely-used database. An assessment of the application of MDE in each stage is then presented, and we conclude by identifying the main benefits and drawbacks of using MDE in data reengineering. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Data modernisation; Data reengineering; Model-driven engineering","Application programs; Computer software selection and evaluation; Interoperability; Legacy systems; Reverse engineering; Software engineering; Data reengineering; Model transformation chains; Model-driven Engineering; Model-driven techniques; Models and metamodels; Software evolution process; Software productivity; Software reengineering; Reengineering",2-s2.0-85032345301

The paper discusses the protocol and its basic issues and presents in-depth examples of its use in- and outside the health promotion field: Empowerment, return to work, safety interventions, implementation, energy conservation, and academic performance. IM is characterized by three perspectives: a social ecological approach, participation of all stakeholders, and the use of theories and evidence. Through a series of six iterative steps - from needs assessment to implementation and evaluation - which are each broken down into specific tasks, correct application of the protocol is meant to produce behavior change interventions that fit into the local context and that have the best chances of effectiveness.

In addition, the study examined the moderating roles of daily task significance, daily family interference with work, and commuting means efficacy in this mediation model. Results from 45 bus commuters’ daily diary data over a period of 15 workdays indicated that the amount of morning commuting stressors experienced by the bus commuters was positively related to their morning commuting strain, which, in turn, had a negative impact on self-regulation at work. At the within-person level, daily task significance buffered the negative indirect relationship between morning commuting stressors and self-regulation at work via morning commuting strain, whereas daily family interference with work in the morning exacerbated this negative indirect relationship. Further, at the between-person level, commuting means efficacy buffered this negative indirect relationship such that the negative indirect effect was weaker for workers with higher (vs. lower) commuting means efficacy.

The aim of this study was to develop and quantify organic farming indicators to determine the relative importance of each. The desired indicators were collected during a literature review of scientific resources about the principles of organic farming. These indices were classified into four categories and their weights were determined through interviews with experts on organic agriculture, including university professors, agroecology students, Ministry of Agriculture experts, organic farming inspectors and organic farmers. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used for this purpose. The results showed that pest and disease management, yield, soil nutrient management, water consumption rate, chemical fertilizer consumption rate and the use of transgenic materials having weights of 0.16, 0.098, 0.096, 0.08, 0.071 and 0.059, respectively, and are the most important indicators for development and assessment of organic farming. In this as well as similar studies, the weight of indicators associated with consumption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides were relatively high. This indicates the importance of rules related to the use of chemicals in organic farming; however, each index has a certain weight and none can be overlooked. All indicators should be considered as an inseparable set and all should be used in the development of organic farming.

Many such chronic, inflammatory diseases are accompanied (and may be exacerbated, and possibly even largely caused) by amyloid fibril formation. Recognising that there are few strong genetic associations underpinning T2D, but that amyloidogenesis of amylin is closely involved, we have been seeking to understand what might trigger the disease. Serum levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide are raised in T2D, and we recently showed that fibrin(ogen) polymerisation during blood clotting can be affected strongly by LPS. The selectivity was indicated by the regularisation of clotting by lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). Since coagulopathies are a hallmark of T2D, we wondered whether they might too be caused by LPS (and reversed by LBP). We show here, using SEM and confocal microscopy, that platelet-poor-plasma from subjects with T2D had a much greater propensity for hypercoagulability and for amyloidogenesis, and that these could both be reversed by LBP. These data imply that coagulopathies are an important feature of T2D, and may be driven by 'hidden' LPS. Given the prevalence of amyloid formation in the sequelae of diabetes, this opens up novel strategies for both the prevention and treatment of T2D. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85028461533

In connection with goal-directed movement, tactile suppression is evident as a decrease in behavioural performance measured shortly prior to, and during, movement execution. It is also reflected in a consistent response bias highlighting the (perceptual) uncertainty of the movement. Goal-directed movement supports the forward model and establishes contextual influences as the defining influences on tactile suppression. Depending on the task at hand, people prioritize a certain percept during movement.

In order to test the reliability of the data, we chose to examine statistically the crystallographic datasets of nine metal-organics with Zn2+, Ag+ and Cu2+ ions. There are several premises to the argument for this choice: (i) the different nature of M–L interactions, (ii) various geometries of the chromophores and (iii) distinguishable chemical behavior of the dentate atoms in the inner coordination sphere (L = O, N, Cl). New insights about the nature of the M–L interactions are gained for the following bonding fashions: (a) bonded AgI–X(Y) fragments (X, Y = O and/or N) in tetrahedral (Td) and square planar AgX2Y2 symmetries, (b) bonded ZnII–X(Y) cores (X, Y = O and/or N; or Cl) in Td ZnIIX2Y2 or ZnIIX2 chromophores, (c) ZnII–OH2 interactions in the discrete octahedral {[ZnII(H2O)]2+} charged complex and (d) bonded CuII–X(Y) systems (X, Y = O and/or N) in square planar AgX2Y2 chromophores as comparative examples of complexes with the d9 configurations of the metal ion. The methods of ‘atoms in molecules’ (AIM), ‘natural bond orbital analyses’ (NBO) and electrostatic potentials were employed. The analyses include employment of the bond valence (BV) methodology and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis. Quantum chemical prediction of multi-pole moments, orbital population and charge transfer effects (CT), bond covalence, iconicity, different bond order methodologies (BOs); electron density distribution and Laplacian of the total electron density (ED) were carried out. The energetics of the M–L bonds were treated using topological charge density analysis at the bond critical points (bcps). The foci of the presented theoretical and experimental designs allow us to answer our main research questions: Is the nature of the M–L bond with ions having an identical electronic configuration, d10, interacting with one and the same type dentate-ligands the same? and is there a quantitative statistically significant correlation between the theoretically predicted dissociation energetic of the complexes and their experimental topological crystallographic M–L bond energies? The presented comprehensive analyses of this problematic provide crucial new information of both fundamental and applied importance to the field of structural chemistry and the properties of metal–organic molecules. Such results seek to shed light on whether the theoretical models extracting information about the molecular electronic properties of the species in the crystalline state on the base on crystallographic measurements and the corresponding topological, electron density and orbital based methods of computational quantum chemistry are able to enable a common conceptualization about the relationship between ‘crystal structure’–‘molecular structure’–‘electronic structure’–‘M–L bonding type’.

A qualitative study based on in-depth interviews, preceded by a questionnaire session, was carried out with patients from the Rehabilitation Center and Hospital in Malaysia. Twelve out-patient and in-patient amputees with lower limb amputations, specifically below-knee amputations, were chosen randomly. The analysis of patients’ narratives aimed to identify the functional and esthetic characteristics of currently used prosthetic leg sockets and any problems related to them. The obtained results indicated that out of the 12 participants, 41.7% and 25% were satisfied and somewhat satisfied with their current prosthetic sockets. Durability and comfort were rated by the participants as the most important characteristics of prosthetic sockets, with 83.3%. As regards the esthetic appearance of the socket, 66.7% of the respondents considered that the most important feature was the material from which the socket was fabricated. Thus, we conclude that current satisfaction levels with the quality of prosthetic sockets among amputees in Malaysia are suitable, prosthesis being preferred by many amputees. The results can be used to direct future research on cosmesis and functionality of prosthetic socket design.Implications for Rehabilitation Case study will help participants to get cost effective prosthetic leg socket.

Thus, a single modular ship has flexibility and stakeholders have the option to delay investment decisions until more information and technology become available. However, previous design methods for modular ships have not considered the economic benefits of such operational flexibility. We therefore present an optimization model that involves both design and operation decisions related to modules. In creating design alternatives, we use component swapping modularity, in which designs are created by configuring modules to a main body through non-identical interfaces. In evaluation, we represent an operating context based on a set of contracts. We implemented the model in a case study in which both modular and non-modular ships were designed, evaluated, and compared. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed for different contract scenarios. The case study shows that reconfiguration options are influential factors on the value robustness of ships under high uncertainty. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","component swapping modularity; Modularity; operational flexibility; ship design","Design; Economics; Investments; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Shipbuilding; component swapping modularity; Design and operations; Information and technologies; Modularity; Module configurations; Operational flexibility; Optimization modeling; Ship designs; Ships",2-s2.0-85018857244

This makes locoregional heating using phased array systems technically challenging. Online application of hyperthermia treatment planning could help to improve the heating quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of online treatment planning during treatment of pelvic tumors heated with the AMC-8 locoregional hyperthermia system. Methods For online adaptive hyperthermia treatment planning, a graphical user interface was developed. Electric fields were calculated in a preprocessing step using our in-house–developed finite-difference–based treatment planning system. This allows instant calculation of the temperature distribution for user-selected phase-amplitude settings during treatment and projection onto the patient's computed tomographic scan for online visualization. Online treatment planning was used for 14 treatment sessions in 8 patients to reduce the patients' reports of hot spots while maintaining the same level of tumor heating. The predicted decrease in hot spot temperature should be at least 0.5°C, and the tumor temperature should decrease less than 0.2°C. These predictions were compared with clinical data: patient feedback about the hot spot and temperature measurements in the tumor region. Results In total, 17 hot spot reports occurred during the 14 sessions, and the alternative settings predicted the hot spot temperature to decrease by at least 0.5°C, which was confirmed by the disappearance of all 17 hot spot reports. At the same time, the average tumor temperature was predicted to change on average −0.01°C (range, −0.19°C to 0.34°C). The measured tumor temperature change was on average only −0.02°C (range, −0.26°C to 0.31°C). In only 2 cases the temperature decrease was slightly larger than 0.2°C, but at most it was 0.26°C.

First, a novel design schema is developed for representing yacht hulls in 3D, which is parametric based and includes several geometric parameters quantifying the hull models. Three surveys are then conducted to learn the relationship between hulls and hull adjectives. In the first survey, yacht models with different geometries are shown to participants to form the hull adjective dictionary. Next, geometric parameters having no impact on the hull adjectives are eliminated via the second survey. Hull adjectives are then matched with yacht hull models via the third survey. The models shown in the third survey are obtained by performing sampling using the Taguchi experimental method. Finally, GMDH-type neural network (GMDH) is applied to the data sets obtained from the third survey to determine the relationships between the hull adjectives and the geometric parameters. GMDH provides mathematical models for each adjective consisting of geometric parameters with coefficients.

The results show that standby energy use accounts for about 30% of the total lighting energy use, but it can raise up to 55% in extreme cases.

It was found that, while cyclic contact loading diminishes the fretting fatigue life significantly, shot-peening can enhance it remarkably. Depending on stress level, introducing residual compressive stresses led to an improvement of about 16–110% and 44–162% in crack propagation and crack initiation lives, respectively. Optical microscopy examination of fretting scar revealed that shot-peened specimens have wider slip area in contact interface due to the higher reaction surface and subsequently higher oxidation rate, particularly for cyclic contact loading in which the contact load is released in each cycle and the fretted interface is exposed to air for longer duration.

We investigate, for the first time, the effect of replacing the simple statement of energy use an IHD gives, with a detailed array of information specifically designed to improve consumer energy literacy and suggest behaviour change through personalised actionable messages set against a series of psychological value systems for context, and which can identify potential profligacy.

However, non-wearable mechanisms such as depth-based tracking could also make use of machine learning techniques and classifiers for the automatic detection of animals’ behavior. These systems also offer the advantage of working in set-ups in which wearable devices would be difficult to use. This paper presents a depth-based tracking system for the automatic detection of animals’ postures and body parts, as well as an exhaustive evaluation on the performance of several classification algorithms based on both a supervised and a knowledge-based approach.

An efficient finite element method on unstructured meshes is introduced to cope with the complex geometry of the solid surfaces. We extend the GNBC to surfaces with complex geometry by including its weak form along different normal and tangential directions in the finite element formulation. The semi-implicit time discretization scheme results in a decoupled system for the phase function, the velocity, and the pressure. In addition, a mass compensation algorithm is introduced to preserve the mass of the droplet. To efficiently solve the decoupled systems, we present a highly parallel solution strategy based on domain decomposition techniques. We validate the newly developed solution method through extensive numerical experiments, particularly for those phenomena that can not be achieved by two-dimensional simulations. On a surface with circular posts, we study how wettability of the rough surface depends on the geometry of the posts. The contact line motion for a droplet spreading over some periodic rough surfaces are also efficiently computed. Moreover, we study the spreading process of an impacting droplet on a microstructured surface, a qualitative agreement is achieved between the numerical and experimental results. The parallel performance suggests that the proposed solution algorithm is scalable with over 4,000 processors cores with tens of millions of unknowns. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Mass compensation; Parallel computing; Phase-field model; Topologically rough surface; Unstructured finite element method; Wetting phenomenon",,2-s2.0-85027962562

The headed bars overlapped by 100 mm within a 200 mm wide in situ concrete joint in which transverse bars and vertical shear studs were installed to provide confinement. This type of joint facilitates the construction of continuously reinforced slabs from precast elements thereby enabling significant reductions in overall construction time and improvements in construction quality due to off-site fabrication. The tests investigated the influence on joint strength, ductility and crack width of concrete strength, out-of-plane offset of precast planks and confining shear studs. Ductile failure with yield of 25 mm diameter high strength headed bars was achieved with joint concrete having a cylinder compressive strength of 39 MPa.

This study uses a new centrifugation-based low-melting-point metal intrusion technique to characterize and analyze the shape of pores in cementitious materials. Low energy electrons with ultra-long beam dwell time are used to obtain nano meter level resolution of the pore shape. Three descriptors, namely circularity, solidity, and aspect ratio, are proposed to represent the area-perimeter relationship, hydration and packing and 3D shape of the pores, respectively. Circularity is found to hold a consistent power correlation with pore size. Based on this correlation, the Washburn's equation is modified to correct the biased prediction of pore size using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). Solidity, is found to decrease with increased pore size, denser packing of cement particles and more hydration products.

However, such structures have also failed frequently due to the formation of premature failures such as peeling and debonding. The further investigations conducted in literature indicated that such undesirable failures can be effected by a large number of geometrical and material parameters. Although, the characterisation and relative influence of such parameters on modes of failures remain unknown; as the past studies have been largely case sensitive or focussing on a small set of parameters. Therefore, to address these issues, a simple but focussed numerical model has been validated through literature for multiple modes of failures over wide range of possible parameters. Further, targeting the response of beam and its critical locations, the authors of this study suggest that the understanding of relative impact of effective parameters, in terms of beam capacity and brittleness of modes of failure, can be broadly utilised to re-evaluate the cause(s) of failure(s) through case studies, or to predict the future of retrofitted structures/beams. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Fracture mechanics; Critical location; Effective parameters; Material parameter; Modes of failure; Multiple modes of failures; Premature failures; Relative impact; Steel plates; Concrete beams and girders",2-s2.0-85026818592

Within this investigation, AISI M3 steel substrates were primarily coated with three different WC-12Co feedstock powders by means of HVOF spraying. The agglomerate size of all powders was constant (− 45 + 15 μm), the WC grain size was varied from conventional (carbide size 2.5 μm) over fine (carbide size 1 μm) to nanosized (carbide size 0.1 μm) carbides. Subsequently, the samples were polished prior to the deposition of a CrAlN PVD coating by means of magnetron sputtering. The aim is to evaluate the influence of the WC grain size on the CrAlN/WC-12Co duplex coating properties. It was shown that a smaller carbide grain size influences the microstructure of the CrAlN coating and causes a finer crystalline structure. Furthermore, higher compressive residual stresses occur in the duplex interlayer and the top layer when using nanosized carbides. Moreover, nanosized carbides in the HVOF coating are favorable in terms of layer adhesion, which was analyzed by means of HRC indent test and scratch test. Further enhancements are the increase in hardness and the reduction in roughness which was directly influenced by the WC grain size.

Briefly, 0.25% TH-loaded HS 15 micelles (TH-HNMs) were developed using a simple co-solvent method. Characterization of the TH-HNMs by Zetasizer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the spherical and discrete micellar droplets with a small size (13.22 ± 0.73 nm) and an electrically neutral surface (− 2.15 ± 0.39 mV) were achieved. The drug entrapment efficiency of TH-HNMs was almost 100%. The release of TH from the micelles was pH dependent. 93.2 ± 3.4% of encapsulated TH was released from the micelles in the PBS at pH 5.0 within 6 h, but only 0.122 ± 0.020% of encapsulated TH was released in the PBS at pH 7.4 within the same release time. TH-HNMs possessed good physical stability in the pH neutral medium (pH 7.0).No obvious irritations were observed in rabbit eyes after ocular instillation of TH-HNMs. The in vivo corneal permeation study revealed that the TH-HNMs can penetrate into the corneal epithelium quickly and efficiently in mouse eyes. Good permeability was also noted in the stroma of mouse corneas with de-epithelialization. Compared with the TH oily solution, TH-HNMs delivered considerably increased levels of TH into rabbit corneas with or without de-epithelialization. In conclusion, the easily prepared, small, physically stable and biocompatible TH-HNMs with good ocular bioavailability hold great promise as an efficient carrier for topical ocular delivery of TH. © 2017 The Authors","Corneal permeability; Fungal keratitis; Macrogol 15 hydroxystearate; Non-ionic surfactant micelles; Terbinafine hydrochloride",,2-s2.0-85028064078

However, renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, have an intrinsic variability that can seriously affect the stability of the energy system if they account for a high percentage of the total generation. The Energy Flexibility of buildings is commonly suggested as part of the solution to alleviate some of the upcoming challenges in the future demand-respond energy systems (electrical, district heating and gas grids). Buildings can supply flexibility services in different ways, e.g. utilization of thermal mass, adjustability of HVAC system use (e.g. heating/cooling/ventilation), charging of electric vehicles, and shifting of plug-loads. However, there is currently no overview or insight into how much Energy Flexibility different building may be able to offer to the future energy systems in the sense of avoiding excess energy production, increase the stability of the energy networks, minimize congestion problems, enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the future energy networks. Therefore, there is a need for increasing knowledge on and demonstration of the Energy Flexibility buildings can provide to energy networks. At the same time, there is a need for identifying critical aspects and possible solutions to manage this Energy Flexibility, while maintaining the comfort of the occupants and minimizing the use of non-renewable energy.

For common beans, across South America, a decrease in climatic suitability has been projected, with heat and drought stresses being the key drivers for such suitability reductions. Breeding programs will play an important role in the adaptation of common beans to the changing climates. However, breeding targets may vary as climate changes during the 21st century. Here, we assess historical and future (2030) probabilities of occurrence, intensity and impact of seasonal variations of drought stress, which is the most important stress for common beans in the Goiás state. We focus on two rainfed (wet and dry) target population environments (TPEs), which encompass ca. 62% of the bean cropped area in the state for 2016, and address potential breeding implications of future projected changes. The analysis revealed two environment groups for both TPEs (highly favorable environment and favorable environment), and four drought stress profiles within these environmental groups (drought stress free, reproductive stress, terminal stress, and joint reproductive-terminal stress) across all climate and management (cultivars and sowing dates) scenarios. Results suggest that, with respect to the historical (1980–2005) period, climate change will make drought more frequent, but less severe, across the region. For the dry TPE, the probability of occurrence of drought stress situations (reproductive and/or terminal) changes from 29.6% (baseline) to ca. 70% (2030, RCP [Representative Concentrations Pathway] 8.5), whereas for the wet TPE, it increases from 16% (baseline) to ca. 43% (2030, RCP 8.5). Results are consistent across RCPs, although benefits from stringent (RCP 2.6) mitigation are evident.

The new software tool is available for evaluation of the detectors’ performance, response, and efficiency parameters that may be used in various applications including the ultra low background experiments such as the searches for Dark Matter and rare decays, underground neutrino studies, optimizing operations of the Cherenkov light detectors, help in the detector selection procedures, and in the experiment simulations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Photoelectron; Photomultiplier; Photon detection efficiency; Photon detector; Signal amplitude spectra","Application programs; Computer aided software engineering; Efficiency; Particle beams; Photodetectors; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoelectrons; Photomultipliers; Efficiency parameters; Photon detection efficiency; Photon detector; Selection procedures; Signal amplitude; Single photoelectrons; Statistical behavior; Ultra low backgrounds; Photons",2-s2.0-85027514670

Such design approach demands end-of-pipe treatment, which is neither profitable due to the hefty costs of the installation and operation of large scale waste treatment facilities, nor environmentally conscious due to the potential impacts of the generated wastes within the process on the environment. The recent approach to sustainable process design has surmounted this challenge. This paper presents a new application of an already introduced composite sustainability index (CSI) that requires minimum amount of data to monitor the sustainability performance of a chemical process and troubleshoot, if necessary. Then, the CSI is applied to an existing process for the purpose of Cradle-to-Cradle design by significant reduction of the environmental impacts of the process, and the escalation of the plant profitability due to sustainable retrofitting of the plant. The CSI methodology can be applied to chemical, refinery, petrochemical, oil & energy, fuel and biofuel processes. The three main advocates have been considered in the CSI, which are the impacts of “energy” and “material” on the environment as well as “risk assessment”. The CSI is technically imperative at all engineering stages of above process plants with the aim of source reduction and environmental protection. The CSI gives process and safety engineers a competitive edge, making their designed process stand out amongst other design array. The current study proves that the CSI methodology is a powerful tool for process and safety designers, and that the process sustainability and profitability are strongly linked. So, it is specifically decisive at managerial level pursuant to strategic planning towards company's sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Auto industry economy; Cradle-to-Cradle design; Energy impacts index; Inherently safer design; Material impacts index (WAR algorithm); Sustainability indicators","Automotive industry; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Industrial economics; Paint; Process design; Profitability; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Auto industry; Cradle to cradles; Energy impact; Inherently safer design; Sustainability indicators; WAR algorithms; Design",2-s2.0-85029148894

In this paper, in order to study the influences of oil structures on the non-polar oil assisted dodecylamine (DDA) flotation of quartz, the research focuses on the interaction of DDA (collector) and non-polar oil (collector extender) in aqueous phase. In this work, saturated hydrocarbon dodecane and cyclohexane, unsaturated hydrocarbon dodecene, aromatic hydrocarbon dimethylbenzene and 1-methylnaphthalene were chosen as researched subjects, and the influences of oil structures on interfacial activity of oil–DDA–water ternary models were investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. The flotation results demonstrated that the collecting capability of the oil and DDA combination follows the order of 1-methylnaphthalene > dimethylbenzene > dodecene > cyclohexane > dodecane. Moreover, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is performed to investigate the interfacial property of these five non-polar oil-DDA-water systems, and five parameters, radial distribution functions, interaction energy, density distribution, interfacial thickness and self-diffusion coefficient are proposed to reveal the influence mechanism of molecular structure on interfacial activity of the ternary oil-DDA-water systems. The same trends are obtained from the parameters described above, aromatic hydrocarbon dimethylbenzene and 1-methylnaphthalene performance better than saturate hydrocarbon and unsaturated hydrocarbon. The researched results indicate the interaction between non-polar oil and DDA hydrophobic alkyl tail would enhance the mobility of oil component, which induce significant change of interfacial thickness and diffusivity. Additionally, the interaction between DDA hydrophilic head group and water molecules via strong hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and weak electrostatic attraction would lead to water molecules penetrate through DDA monolayer and adsorb on oil surface.

LTE Wi-Fi radio level integration with IPSec tunnel (LWIP) corresponds to realizing this binding at IP layer. A collocated deployment of LWIP enables greater flexibility in utilizing the channel efficiently. With the advent of bandwidth-hungry smartphone Apps and IoT applications, the cellular uplink resources become highly demanding. This enforces Wi-Fi to support efficient uplink transmissions since the uplink transmissions through Wi-Fi suffers high contention because of distributed nature of Wi-Fi MAC. In order to improve Wi-Fi channel utilization by leveraging the potential of LWIP in controlling and coordinating the transmissions through LTE and Wi-Fi links, we introduce Network Coordination Function (NCF) in LWIP. The proposed NCF focuses on coordinating the uplink transmissions through Wi-Fi in a network with high load. NCF enhances the channel utilization of Wi-Fi network by regulating the packet arrival rate to the Wi-Fi link and also by revamping medium access techniques at the Wi-Fi interface of users associated with LWIP node. NCF is composed of four different uplink traffic steering algorithms with diverse objectives which improve Wi-Fi channel utilization by (i) minimizing collisions among LWIP users, (ii) increasing transmission opportunities for Wi-Fi users that are connected to legacy Wi-Fi APs operating on the same channel, and (iii) ensuring fairness for both LWIP and Wi-Fi users. Interestingly, NCF has not only improved the throughput of LWIP users but also the throughput of Wi-Fi users. Simulation experiments reveal that NCF has reduced collisions in the Wi-Fi uplink by 13–53% and improved throughput by 10–37% as compared to Wi-Fi offloading and Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Interworking; Link aggregation; LTE-Wi-Fi aggregation; LWIP; Traffic steering","Bins; Mobile telecommunication systems; Throughput; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Distributed coordination functions; Interworking; Link aggregation; LWIP; Network coordinations; Steering algorithms; Transmission opportunities; Up-link transmissions; Wi-Fi",2-s2.0-85028869634

These fibers display rich dynamic behavior without losing their architectural integrity. The complexity of the ECM taking care of many essential properties has inspired synthetic chemists to mimic these properties in artificial one-dimensional fibrous structures with the aim to arrive at multi-component biomaterials. Due to the dynamic character required for interaction with natural tissue, supramolecular biomaterials are promising candidates for regenerative medicine. Depending on the application area, and thereby the design criteria of these multi-component fibrous biomaterials, they are used as elastomeric materials or hydrogel systems.

In this review, we document research progress on the molecular and mesoscopic self-assembly of amyloid-beta, alpha synuclein, human islet amyloid polypeptide and prions, the peptides and proteins associated with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type 2 diabetes and prion diseases. In addition, we discuss the toxicities of these amyloid proteins based on their self-assembly as well as their interactions with membranes, metal ions, small molecules and engineered nanoparticles.

However, there has been limited investigation of their helpful and less helpful aspects for people with TBI. We aimed to investigate patterns of smartphone use amongst individuals with TBI, identify potential barriers to use, and examine the relationships between smartphone use and daily functioning. Method: Twenty-nine participants with TBI and 33 non-injured participants completed the Smartphone Survey, and measures of subjective and objective cognitive functioning, mood, and community integration. Results: Smartphone use was equally common in both groups, and patterns of app use were similar. More participants with TBI than the comparison group listed using their smartphone as a memory aid as its main benefit. Difficulty in learning how to use the smartphone was identified by participants with TBI, however only 10% had been shown how to use it by a clinician. Those with poorer subjective cognitive function used memory/organisational apps more frequently; and higher communication app use with better social integration, in participants with TBI. Conclusions: These findings suggest that smartphones have potential in improving independence following TBI, but receiving support in using them is vital.Implications for Rehabilitation Smartphones are accessible, acceptable, convenient devices for most individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), and are perceived as a useful memory and organizational aid as well as having multiple other helpful functions. Use of communication apps such as text messages and social media is associated with better social and community integration in people with TBI.

In this paper our main objective is to share the lessons learned from the innovative methodology used throughout the project. To achieve the proposed objectives, the multidisciplinary scientific knowledge in the project team was combined and integrated with the knowledge and views of local stakeholders of four selected European coastal lagoons, using a three step participatory approach. With this innovative approach, which included the usage of eco-hydrological and water quality-modelling tools, the team developed and analyzed integrated scenarios of possible economic development and environmental impacts in four European lagoons and their catchments. These scenarios were presented and discussed with stakeholders, giving rise to management recommendations for each case study lagoon. Results show that some management options might be transferrable to other European lagoons having similar climatic, geophysical and socio-economic settings.

The high conversion parameters and cost effective preparation makes them a valuable alternative to monoliths and noble metal catalysts. In this study, the cobalt catalyst was prepared by non-equilibrium plasma deposition of organic precursor on calcined kanthal steel. Thus prepared, cobalt oxide based microstructural short-channel reactors were tested for n-nonane combustion and the catalyst surfaces were examined by in situ μ-Raman spectroscopy and in situ infrared spectroscopy.

The polarity of aqueous solvent is essential and qualitatively captured by continuum electrostatics methods like Generalized Born (GB). However, GB does not account for the solvent-induced interactions between exposed hydrophobic sidechains or solute-solvent dispersion interactions. These “nonpolar” effects are often modeled through surface area (SA) energy terms, which lack realism, create mathematical singularities, and have a many-body character. We have explored an alternate, Lazaridis–Karplus (LK) gaussian energy density for nonpolar effects and a dispersion (DI) energy term proposed earlier, associated with GB electrostatics. We parameterized several combinations of GB, SA, LK, and DI energy terms, to reproduce 62 small molecule solvation free energies, 387 protein stability changes due to point mutations, and the structures of 8 protein loops. With optimized parameters, the models all gave similar results, with GBLK and GBDILK giving no performance loss compared to GBSA, and mean errors of 1.7 kcal/mol for the stability changes and 2 Å deviations for the loop conformations. The optimized GBLK model gave poor results in MD of the Trpcage mini-protein, but parameters optimized specifically for MD performed well for Trpcage and three other small proteins.

Methods: Four design iterations were performed, building on a domain study, workshops, expert evaluation and controlled and realistic usability tests. The user-centred design process involved purposefully selected participants with different Housing Enabler knowledge and housing adaptation experience. Results: The design iterations resulted in the development of a Housing Enabler prototype app. The prototype app has several features and options that are new compared with the original paper-based Housing Enabler assessment form. These new features include a user friendly overview of the assessment form; easy navigation by swiping back and forth between items; onsite data analysis; and ranking of the accessibility score, photo documentation and a data export facility. Conclusion: Based on the presented stepwise approach, a high-fidelity Housing Enabler prototype app was successfully developed.

The PUI is an interface generating a finite element representation of the pavement within PANDA. The application of realistic tire loading is necessary to calculate accurate pavement responses. The PUI incorporates a database of tire contact areas and stresses obtained from tire finite element simulations. The database includes tire interface characteristics with pavements for various applied loads, tire inflation pressures, vehicle speeds and scenarios of different rolling simulations. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of simulations of tire contact stresses that match field measurements on viscoelastic and viscoplastic pavement responses. Pavement responses are greatly affected using realistic tire loading contact stresses and contact geometry as compared to simplified contact models.

We contribute a novel color map design for visualizing probabilities and uncertainties from flood simulation ensembles. A user study encompassing 83 participants was carried out to evaluate the effects of this new color map on user’s decisions in a spatial planning task. We found that the type of visualization makes a difference when it comes to identification of non-hazardous sites in the flood risk map and when accepting risks in more uncertain areas.

Developing more effective and accessible psychological interventions for paranoia is a clinical priority. Our research team has approached this challenge in two main ways: firstly, by adopting an interventionist causal approach to increase effectiveness and secondly, by incorporating user-centred inclusive design methods to enhance accessibility and usability. Our resultant new digital intervention, SlowMo, intensively targets a reasoning style associated with paranoia, fast thinking, characterised by jumping to conclusions and belief inflexibility. It consists of an easy-to-use, enjoyable and memorable digital interface. An interactive web-based app facilitates delivery of face-to-face meetings which is then synchronised with an innovative mobile app for use in daily life. Methods/Design: We aim to test the clinical efficacy of SlowMo over 24 weeks to determine the mechanisms through which it reduces paranoia, and to identify participant characteristics that moderate its effectiveness. In a parallel-group randomised controlled trial, with 1:1 allocation, 360 participants with distressing persecutory beliefs will be independently randomised to receive either the SlowMo intervention added to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU, using randomly varying permuted blocks, stratified by paranoia severity and site. Research workers will be blind to therapy allocation. The primary outcome is paranoia severity over 24 weeks; our hypothesised mechanism of change is reasoning; moderators include negative symptoms and working memory; and secondary outcomes include wellbeing, quality of life, and service use. The accessibility, usability and acceptability of the digital platform will be assessed. Discussion: SlowMo has been developed as the first blended digital therapy to target fears of harm from others through an inclusive design approach. In addition to testing its efficacy, this trial will add to our understanding of psychological mechanisms in paranoia. The study will examine the usability and adherence of a novel digital therapy, including an app for self-management, in a large sample of people affected by severe mental health difficulties.

This inquest observed how Pakistan universities used their homepages to demonstrate culture through a content analysis of 1064 pictures from 100 top universities. The researcher tried to take a stance on visual presentation of cultural aspects by using Hofstede’s cultural dimension theory, and evaluated the impact of cultural elements in choosing pictures as part of web design and marketing strategy. Results indicated that faculty in groups doing academic and official activities were the predominant visual element, and websites mostly marketed faculty. Choice of pictures was positively correlated with Hofstede’s scores on power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance and indulgence, but a different trend was observed for masculinity and pragmatism. Findings suggest that institutions should ameliorate their web marketing according to cultural needs of local as well as international students, and further research is needed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cultural Communication; gender; higher education marketing; Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions; individualism/collectivism; power distance; user-centered design",,2-s2.0-84961208551

Since reliability of qualitative data has little been investigated, it requires much time and effort for researchers to define meanings and values from the qualitative data. Therefore, this article proposes a novel approach to measuring the stability of textual data by adopting semantic network analysis, as shown by our analysis on in-depth interview transcripts and online customer review data. Among the semantic networks generated from text, subnetworks were sampled from the original networks until the representativeness of each sample size was determined. Then, similarities between the subnetworks and the original network were calculated by applying a correlation analysis to determine whether stability occurs. The results indicated that variables of word frequency and network-level statistics affect stability of the network. The suggested method will be able to assist in identifying UX issues. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Semantics; Correlation analysis; In-depth interviews; Online customer reviews; Qualitative data; Semantic network; Semantic network analysis; User experiences (ux); Word frequencies; Character recognition",2-s2.0-85015960658

People now have increasingly rich, digital records of highly personal data about what they said, did, and felt in the past. But social science research shows that people have difficulty in tracking and regulating their emotions. New reflective technologies that promote constructive analysis of rich personal data potentially offer transformative ways that individuals might better understand themselves and improve well-being. However, there are important system design challenges in supporting effective reflection about personal data. We explore fidelity in recording and representing past personal mood data, and forecasting future actions, feelings, and thoughts. Much prior personal informatics work has been dedicated to past-centric tools for recording and capture. In contrast, forecasting examines how we might use such past data to inform and motivate our future selves, providing recommendations about remedial actions to improve future well-being. Fidelity addresses both how and what reflective systems should show people about their pasts, in particular whether we should filter negative past experiences. To inform reflective system design, we examine forecasting and fidelity in controlled field trial interventions that explore two novel system designs for presenting and reflecting on mood data. We detail findings from 165 participants, 4,693 participant logfiles, 65 surveys, and 15 user interviews. Our novel forecasting system, EmotiCal, uses past mood data to model and visualize future user moods with the goal of encouraging participants to adopt remedial new behaviors to regulate negative moods before they occur. Such forecasting both improved mood and subsequent emotional self-awareness compared with controls who simply monitored their past. Consistent with system goals, interview responses also indicated that participants generated important insights into behaviors that affect their moods. Our second intervention examined filtering; it assessed the impact on well-being of recording and revisiting past experiences containing negative emotions. We compared participants who were encouraged to record and reflect on positive versus negative experiences. Long-term measures of happiness and ruminative behaviors improved by recording and reflecting on positive but not negative experiences, although this depended on the intensity of the negative experience. We discuss general design and theory implications for future systems that support monitoring, reflection, and forecasting to facilitate productive examination of our emotional lives.

Optimizing the yarn properties after steaming process is important for the industrial and user’s viewpoint, because it affects the quality of the yarn and the garment’s characteristics as the appearance and the mechanical properties. Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) are applied to optimize the strength at break of elastic denim yarns before and after steaming. Indeed, some influential input parameters such as the linear density of elastane filament type Spandex©, the steaming process, the relaxation durations and the temperature during steaming were investigated to analyze their contributions on the mechanical property, breaking strength or kilometric resistance (RKM). To study the input parameter contributions and to evaluate objectively the RKM behavior, an experimental design type Taguchi analysis was used.

Methods: The study consisted on a cochlear model and temporal bone insertion studies. Twenty insertions were studied, under four different surgical insertion conditions in vitro, the intracochlear disposition of the electrode array and presence of tip fold over were recorded. Also, eight fresh human temporal bones were studied after insertion in two conditions: correct alignment of the electrode array during the insertion and misaligned. These surgical situations were investigated within this study using a video recording of the dynamics of insertion techniques and X-ray, including fluoroscopy, Cone Beam CT, and digital imaging analysis. Results: For electrodes inserted with a correct surgical technique, the placement was perfect, within the scala tympani. The wrapping factor was 0.53, and the perimodiolar distance was below 0.3 mm, with a mean insertion depth of 405°. Conclusions: A perimodiolar position can be achieved with the new CI532 electrode array.

The long-term success of collective self-governance is dependent on both its internal organization and its embeddedness in external state and non-state regulations. This paper presents the marine community concept, consisting of a policy and a user community, as a framework for investigating the internal and external dynamics of collective self-governance and its ability to steer toward sustainable cruise tourism. As methodology, a case study design was chosen which was primarily studied by means of interviews with a spectrum of relevant actors concerning expedition cruise tourism at Svalbard. By applying the marine community to Svalbard expedition cruise tourism governance, we draw the following conclusions: (1) collective self-governance complements governmental regulation through access to knowledge, conflict resolution and rule-compliance based on disclosure, traceability and trust; (2) collective self-governance's increasing role in the policy community alienates the expedition crew from the user community; and (3) informational overflow by co-existence of collective self-governance and state-governance challenges sustainable cruise tourism. Collective self-governance would, therefore, benefit from reflection, especially regarding the role of the user community that functions as an intermediary between state and self-governance regulations. © 2017 The Author(s).

As activities grow in complexity or fade from memory, they become increasingly difficult to cognitively resume. Motivated by the efficiency of images for cueing autobiographical memory, we conducted 2 studies of how visual histories of computer-mediated activity might aid users in restoring the mental context of suspended activities. In the first exploratory study we demonstrate that users provided a visual history consisting of small thumbnail images of their desktop can reconstruct detailed mental contexts of earlier computer work. In the second observational study we examine methods and cues that web developers, scientific writers, and graphic designers currently use to restore mental context. We find that participants from all three professions engage in situated sensemaking, reconstructing context by generating stories to explain cues in their documents with implicit meaning, such as sudden changes in writing quality or the shape of blocks of code. We identify characteristics of each activity that influence the information, artifacts, and strategies participants used to reconstruct context. We conclude that visual histories can help users reconstruct mental context but that challenges remain in designing lightweight image-based cues that help users reconstruct context for a range of activities.

However, the effect of such interactive 3D geo-browsers on spatial knowledge acquisition and decision-making is not well known. This study aims to explore the potential benefits of using interactive 3D geo-browsers in three processes of pedestrian navigation (self-localization, spatial knowledge acquisition, and decision-making) in digital environments. We employed eye tracking to show differences of visual attention in pedestrian navigation between a 2D map (Google Map) and a 3D geo-browser (Google Earth). The results indicated that benefits and drawbacks of 3D representations are task dependent. Participants using the 3D geo-browser had an extensively visual search resulting in significantly longer response time than the 2D participants for spatial knowledge acquisition, whereas 3D users performed a more efficient visual search and resulted in a better navigation performance at complex decision points. We speculate that the inefficient knowledge acquisition when using the 3D geo-browser was most probably due to information overload and obstructed views. Landmarks in photorealistic 3D models assisted recall of spatial knowledge from mental maps, which contributed to efficient decision-making at a complex turning point. These empirical results can be helpful to improve the usability of pedestrian navigation systems. © 2016 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.","3D geo-browser; decision-making; eye movement; self-localization; Spatial orientation; wayfinding","Decision making; Eye movements; Knowledge acquisition; Mergers and acquisitions; NASA; Navigation systems; 3D geo-browser; Navigation performance; Pedestrian navigation systems; Self localization; Spatial knowledge acquisitions; Spatial orientations; Threedimensional (3-d); Way-finding; Behavioral research; decision making; eye; navigation; pedestrian; software; spatial analysis; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional flow",2-s2.0-84966702412

An exploratory study with a questionnaire was conducted primarily in the Hong Kong construction industry with 113 valid responses to examine if person-culture fit and person-task fit are contributory to an individual’s intention to adopt ICT, how person-task fit relates to organizational and personal variables, and which ICT type has the best person-task fit. It was found that person-task fit predicts an individual’s ICT adoption but person-culture fit does not. Person-task fit is related to the person’s age, employment level and the ICT adoption period (especially within the first five years) in the company. Person-task fit does not differ significantly amongst the different construction participant groups (contractors, consultants, and owners). The person-task fit of building information modeling ranks the lowest and is significantly lower than the procurement information packages with the highest person-task fit.

Design: Prospective cross-sectional evaluation. Setting: Sub-acute rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Fifteen non-ambulatory participants with complete or incomplete traumatic and non-traumatic SCI, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), Classification A-D. Outcome Measures: Isometric trunk strength using a hand held dynamometer, the ability to reach using the multidirectional reach test and offloading times of the ischial tuberosities using a customized pressure mat. Results: Participants who were able to engage in the multidirectional reach test were defined as “Reachers”, whereas individuals who were unable to engage in the multidirectional reach test were defined as “Non-Reachers”. Trunk strength was significantly higher in Reachers compared with Non-Reachers (P < 0.05). Offloading times over the left and right ischial tuberosities were lower in Non-Reachers when compared with Reachers, however the results were statistically significant only for offloading over the right ischial tuberosity (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between trunk strength and pressure offloading times for both groups. Conclusions: Regardless of an individual's ability to engage in a reaching task, participants with spinal cord injury spent more time offloading the left ischial tuberosity compared with the right ischial tuberosity. The study highlights the need to identify factors that may contribute to offloading behavior in individuals with spinal cord injury who lack sufficient trunk strength. © 2017, © The Academy of Spinal Cord Injury Professionals, Inc. 2017.","Ischium; Pressure ulcer; Rehabilitation; Spinal cord injuries; Wheelchairs","adolescent; adult; aged; American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale; Article; clinical article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; cross-sectional study; feasibility study; female; human; ischial pressure offloading; ischial tuberosity; male; middle aged; multidirectional reach test; muscle isometric contraction; muscle strength; musculoskeletal system examination; musculoskeletal system parameters; pilot study; pressure and tension; prospective study; sitting; spinal cord injury; trunk; young adult",2-s2.0-85020696105

Based on a theoretical analysis of driving proposed by Gibson and Crooks [(1938). A theoretical field-analysis of automobile-driving. The American Journal of Psychology, 51, 453–471. doi:10.2307/1416145], the developed field of safe travel (FoST) framework suggests that at any moment the driver constructs a “field” by integrating two perceptual entities: (i) the possible available spatial fields for locomotion and (ii) the driver’s mental image of ego-vehicle outer-line and motion dynamics. This framework is used to reinterpret in a unified way a number of disparate research findings reported in the literature concerning specific driving sub-tasks (e.g. lane keeping and car following). It is argued that the FoST framework may be used to predict drivers’ behaviour in various traffic/situation environments based on their prioritisation between the above two perceptual entities. Implications of the proposed framework at a theoretical and practical level, in view of the future of driving with multiple levels of automation, are also discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","car following; Driver behaviour; lane keeping; overtaking; visual–spatial perception","automation; automobile; holistic approach; locomotion; performance assessment; spatial cognition; theoretical study",2-s2.0-85013168332

To successfully attract online consumers and benefit from doing so, e-tail product providers should learn about consumers’ purchase intention, its antecedents, and moderators. This study proposes a research model of purchase intention using perceived performance risk and perceived privacy risk as moderators based on a perspective of task-technology fit. In the proposed model, purchase intention is positively influenced by three antecedents: task-technology fit, perceived navigation, and perceived reputation. Each model path is moderated by perceived performance risk and perceived privacy risk, respectively. Empirically testing using a survey of 749 registered members (consumers) from the database of Taiwan’s largest e-learning commercial website confirms that task-technology fit, perceived navigation, and perceived reputation positively influence purchase intention. The relationship between task-technology fit, perceived navigation and purchase intention are significantly moderated by the perceived performance risk and perceived privacy risk.

The complementary aims are: (a) to identify the research lines developed and to propose a criterion for classifying the literature, and (b) to discuss the empirical evidence that identifies existing interrelationships. The analysis has enabled three main lines of research to be identified. The first research line, basic principles of intermodal transport, groups together works related to the definition of intermodal transport and the results obtained using this transportation system. The second, improvements to the way that intermodal transport systems work, frames elements and variables that impact intermodal transport systems’ logistics efficiency, such as quality of service, information and communication systems, and freight planning and linkages among system operators to provide an adequate service. Finally, the third line, intermodal transport system modelling, identifies the main variables used to optimise these transport systems, the different focuses and approaches used in modelling, and the advantages and disadvantages of each focus.

The Cu2+ ion is connecting with two L1 through monodentate mode of coordination and two nitrogen atoms from EDA. I is associated through cooperative non-covalent interactions, which are also responsible for the strengthening of the molecular assembly and organize it into a supramolecular 2D motif. Hirshfeld surface analysis was also applied to investigate the cooperative non-covalent supramolecular interactions and the results were compared with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. To get clear insights into the both species, electronic properties such as HOMO-LUMO, electronic chemical potential and other derived parameters were also highlighted using DFT calculations at M06-2X/ 6-31G** level of theory. The observed photoluminescence of complex I arises mainly from an excited LLCT state with small MLCT contributions (from Cu2+ to the unoccupied p orbital of L1).

Their synthesis and functionalization methodology strongly affect their performance in vivo. The methodology most used in the literature for the synthesis of Fe3O4 NPs is thermal decomposition, which has proven to be time-consuming, expensive, and laborious, as it requires further ligand exchange strategies to transfer the as-synthesized nanoparticles from organic to aqueous solvents. This work describes a rapid and facile sonochemical methodology to synthesize and functionalize Fe3O4 NPs with excellent physicochemical properties for MRI. This sonochemistry approach was used to produce, in 12 min, Fe3O4 NPs functionalized with polysodium acrylate (PAANa), trisodium citrate (CIT), branched polyethylenimine (BPEI), and sodium oleate. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the NPs were composed of a single inverse spinel phase with an average diameter of 9-11 nm and a narrow size distribution. Mössbauer spectroscopy and magnetic measurements confirmed that the obtained NPs were transitioning to the superparamagnetic regime and possessed excellent magnetization saturation values (59-77 emu/g). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy proved that the sonochemistry approach provided conditions that induced a strong interaction between Fe3O4 and the coating agents. Furthermore, dynamic light-scattering experiments evidenced that samples coated with PAANa, CIT, and BPEI possess colloidal stability in aqueous solvents. Emphasis must be placed on PAANa-coated NPs, which also presented remarkable colloidal stability under simulated physiological conditions. Finally, the obtained NPs exhibited great potential to be applied as an MRI contrast agent. The transverse relaxivity values of the NPs synthesized in this work (277-439 mM-1 s-1) were greater than those of commercial NPs and those prepared using other methodologies. Therefore, this work represents significant progress in the preparation of Fe3O4 NPs, providing a method to prepare high-quality materials in a rapid, cost-effective, and facile manner. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Chelation; Cost effectiveness; Decomposition; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Inverse problems; Light scattering; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetism; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Saturation magnetization; Sodium compounds; Sonochemistry; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Fe3O4 nanoparticles; High-quality materials; Magnetization-saturation; Narrow size distributions; Physicochemical property; Physiological condition; Ssbauer spectroscopies; Tri-sodium citrates; Iron compounds",2-s2.0-85032792062

The aim of this paper is to explore user experiences (UX) of living with an automated heating system regarding experiences of control, understanding of the system, emerging thermal behaviours, and interactions with the system as this area is not sufficiently researched in the existing homes setting through extended deployment. We present a longitudinal deployment of a quasi-autonomous spatiotemporal home heating system in three homes. Users were provided with a smartphone control application linked to a self-learning heating algorithm. Rich qualitative and quantitative data presented here enabled a holistic exploration of UX. The paper's contribution focuses on highlighting key aspects of UX living with an automated heating systems including (i) adoption of the control interface into the social context, (ii) how users’ vigilance in maintaining preferred conditions prevailed as a better indicator of system over-ride than gross deviation from thermal comfort, (iii) limited but motivated proactivity in system-initiated communications as best strategy for soliciting user feedback when inference fails, and (iv) two main motivations for interacting with the interface – managing irregularities when absent from the house and maintaining immediate comfort, latter compromising of a checking behaviour that can transit to a system state alteration behaviour depending on mismatches.

Product personality affected by materials is an increasingly high-priority element of design to be considered. Product personality, which designers actively seek to create, can be achieved by ascertaining the material perceptions of users. As the user-interaction aspects of materials are circumstance-related and differ from person to person, it is impractical to define them accurately using a model. Therefore, in this study, the material perceptions of users have been evaluated by analysing the relative frequencies by which survey participants attributed certain adjectives to certain materials. This was conducted using a digital-logic approach featuring bipolar-adjective pairs. Additionally, intended product personalities can be differentiated semantically by designers by using the same bipolar-adjective pairs as those used to ascertain material perceptions using an 11-point scale. The interface of user-designer reaction is determined not sharply but diffusely. The degree of matching between the material perceptions of users and product personalities created by a designer can be evaluated through the concept of standard error in the diffuse interface. The most suitable material can be selected by ascertaining the average value of the widths of the diffuse interfaces for all of the designer’s intended product personalities. The objective of this research is to support designer’s selection of materials by associating product personalities with material perceptions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag France.","Diffuse interface; Digital logic; Material perception; Product personality; Semantic differentiation; Standard error","Computer circuits; Product design; Semantics; Surveys; Degree of matching; Diffuse interface; Digital logic; Innovative product design; Product personality; Relative frequencies; Selection of materials; Standard errors; Interfaces (materials)",2-s2.0-85032729662

Although substantial efforts have been made to implement BIM, previous research highlighted that implementation of BIM tools has not always resulted in satisfaction by users. Grounded in the literature on information systems and enterprise resource planning user satisfaction, this study tries to evaluate the success of BIM in terms of user satisfaction while controlling for the mediating effect of top-management support. The effects of four factors (i.e., system quality, information quality, external service, and top-management support) on BIM user satisfaction in AEC industries were examined through a survey of BIM users from China. Survey responses were analyzed with the partial least-squares method. The major contribution of this work lies in the findings that information quality, external service, and top-management support have a significant influence on BIM user satisfaction, and system quality did not have a significant influence on BIM user satisfaction.

The nested breadth first search traversal is used in the first algorithm to extract the loops without subdividing the graphical network. The initialization of pipes in loops is performed by satisfying the continuity equation at nodes in the second algorithm. The initialization, in the loop, is done in such a way that the adjacent loop will carry the residual discharge. Friction in the pipes is calculated iteratively for all flow types. Updating of discharge in pipes is according to the simultaneous loop flow adjustment method in the third algorithm. Initial discharges in the pipes of the loop in network are updated by corrective discharge in the loop according to the direction. The algorithm of nodal pressure calculation is done in the fourth algorithm, which is based on the energy equation in terms of pressure on the reference node.

Heat pipes with sodium as a working fluid has been proposed to be used in Compact High Temperature Reactor (CHTR), 233U-Thorium fuelled reactor being designed to operate at 1000 °C. High temperature heat pipes can also be used for decay heat removal from dump tanks of molten salt breeder reactor and heat removal from first wall of fusion reactors. High temperature heat pipes of special construction can also be used for heat removal from core without use of coolant. Thus, reliable and long term operation of heat pipes is essential for the safe working of the reactor. In this respect, computer codes have been developed for design and simulation of high temperature heat pipes. To assist in the design stages, codes have been developed, which incorporate performance limits based on correlations and having a user friendly GUI. For system level studies, simplified heat transfer model is developed using a FEM model. For a detailed study of the heat pipe, the vapour flow behavior and interface evaporation condensation phenomena using a full CFD analysis is essential. This has been done by using a commercial CFD code by incorporating user defined functions (UDFs) which address the saturated nature of the vapour phase and the vapour wick interface conditions. A three dimensional transient numerical model has been developed to predict the vapour core, wall temperatures, vapour pressure, and vapour velocity in the screen mesh wick of sodium heat pipe. The results have been compared using a sodium heat pipe developed in-house.

We built and designed an online, secure, electronic custom interface termed the Genomic Prescribing System (GPS). Methods Actionable pharmacogenomic (PGx) information was reviewed, collected, and stored in the back-end of GPS to enable creation of customized drug- and variant-specific clinical decision support (CDS) summaries. The database architecture utilized the star schema to store information. Patient raw genomic data underwent transformation via custom-designed algorithms to enable gene and phenotype-level associations. Multiple external data sets (PubMed, The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), National Drug File – Reference Terminology (ND-FRT), and a publically-available PGx knowledgebase) were integrated to facilitate the delivery of patient, drug, disease, and genomic information. Institutional security infrastructure was leveraged to securely store patient genomic and clinical data on a HIPAA-compliant server farm. Results As of May 17, 2016, the GPS back-end housed 257 CDS encompassing 112 genetic variants, 42 genes, and 46 PGx-actionable drugs. The GPS user interface presented patient-specific CDS alongside a recognizable traffic light symbol (green/yellow/red), denoting PGx risk for each genomic result. The number of traffic lights per visit increased with the corresponding increase in the number of available PGx-annotated drugs over time. An integrated drug and disease search functionality, links to primary literature sources, and potential alternative PGx drugs were indicated. The system, which was initially used as stand-alone CDS software within our clinical environment, was then integrated with the institutional electronic medical record for enhanced usability. There have been nearly 2000 logins in 43 months since inception, with usage exceeding 56 logins per month and system up-times of 99.99%. For all patient-provider visits encompassing >3 years of implementation, unique alert click-through rates corresponded to genomic risk: red lights clicked 100%, yellow lights 79%, green lights 43%. Conclusions Successful deployment of GPS by combining complex data and recognizable iconography led to a tool that enabled point-of-care genomic delivery with high usability. Continued scalability and incorporation of additional clinical elements to be considered alongside PGx information could expand future impact. © 2017","Clinical decision support; Informatics; Pharmacogenetics; Precision medicine; Systematized nomenclature of medicine","Decision support systems; Medical computing; Medicine; Metadata; Terminology; User interfaces; Clinical decision support; Clinical environments; Database architecture; Electronic medical record; Informatics; Pharmacogenetics; Security infrastructure; User friendly interface; Genes; Article; clinical decision support system; clinical practice; electronic medical record; gene; genetic variability; genomic prescribing system; genomics; health care planning; human; pharmacogenomics; prescription; priority journal; systematic review",2-s2.0-85031732963

First, an inversion formula is applied to derive the probability distribution of the completion time of a product development. Second, to address the implications of a due date, a novel measure of schedule risk is introduced to give a view of both loss and probability. Third, an elasticity analysis is used to identify the network parameters that facilitate the control of schedule risk.

Classical indicators of users' mobility profiles (daily travel distances) were only weakly related to lower range satisfaction (not significant), after controlling for practical experience and preferred coverage of mobility needs. The regularity/predictability of users' mobility patterns, the percentage of journeys not coverable because of range issues, and users’ individual comfortable range accounted for variance in range satisfaction.

Embedded in tools, they will provide designers and end-users interested in customization with a road-mapped perceptual and cognitive design space. We previously compiled five haptic facets based on how people describe vibrations: physical, sensory, emotional, metaphoric, and usage examples. Here, we report a study in which we deployed these facets to identify underlying dimensions and cross-linkages in participants' perception of a 120-item vibration library.

In this study, a virtual reality simulation of a domestic robot control scenario was developed. The performance of fifty novice users was evaluated, and their subjective experiences recorded through questionnaires. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, it was found that untrained operators frequently perform poorly at navigation-based robot control tasks. The study found that passing through doorways accounted for the largest number of collisions, and was consistently identified as a very difficult operation to perform.

However, empirical studies investigating the impact of technologies' design on customers' shopping experience remain limited. In response to this gap, this research analyzes the impact of gamification mechanics, a widely used tool to design smart technologies, on customers' experience, emotions and the resulting behavioral intentions. Therefore, we first examine the impact of two gamification mechanics, challenge and fantasy, on customer experience and patronage intentions. Then, we specifically study the case of the Smartstore, a smart innovative technology used to personalize items in retailing contexts and combining these two gamification mechanics in comparison with a classical interface without any gamification mechanics. Based on those two experimental studies, our findings confirm that personalizing a product through a gamified interface might have a positive impact in terms of experience during the process but also on patronage intentions. Hence this research also shows that solely adding gamification mechanics such as challenge and fantasy in a smart interface is not enough to significantly enhance the quality of the perceived experience. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Experience; Gamification; Smart technology","Sales; Behavioral intention; Customer experience; Empirical studies; Experience; Gamification; Innovative technology; Smart interface; Smart technology; Mechanics; consumption behavior; electronic commerce; experimental study; information and communication technology; innovation; retailing; shopping activity; technological development",2-s2.0-85017179708

Some EEG-based BCI systems have adopted combined methodologies, such as a hybrid of MI/SSVEP or MI/P300. However, these previous solutions have a few practical hurdles, such as making users feel tired due to the use of external stimuli (e.g., flashing lights for SSVEP or P300). This paper presents a combined BCI solution by using MI and EC and then a front-wheel drive (FWD) toy car was used to verify our proposed method. The car was controlled by EEG in order to complete a multidimensional task: going forward, stopping, changing direction. An EC signal was used to switch the car between the three different states, and an MI signal was used to turn the car left or right by 90° by imagining hand grasp motions when the system was in the “changing direction” state. The experimental results show that the participants in the study could control the car to switch between different states and turn left/right with an overall efficiency of 0.8268. The proposed system realizes multidimensional control in a suitable and natural way without the need for external stimuli. Thus, the developed hybrid BCI system has the potential to extend current BCI capabilities in practical utility and self-paced control applications.

As expected, the optimal geometries have the shape of an extension of the high conductivity material into the low conductivity material. For the case of corrugations and inserts, the optimum shapes are triangular for small perimeters; for large perimeters and thick slabs they are elliptical and tend to cover the whole width/period of the domain.

With exoskeleton robots, an assistive strategy is a key ingredient. Since interactions between users and exoskeleton robots are bidirectional, the assistive strategy design problem is complex and challenging. In this paper, we explore a data-driven learning approach for designing assistive strategies for exoskeletons from user-robot physical interaction. We formulate the learning problem of assistive strategies as a policy search problem and exploit a data-efficient model-based reinforcement learning framework. Instead of explicitly providing the desired trajectories in the cost function, our cost function only considers the user's muscular effort measured by electromyography signals (EMGs) to learn the assistive strategies. The key underlying assumption is that the user is instructed to perform the task by his/her own intended movements. Since the EMGs are observed when the intended movements are achieved by the user's own muscle efforts rather than the robot's assistance, EMGs can be interpreted as the “cost” of the current assistance. We applied our method to a 1-DoF exoskeleton robot and conducted a series of experiments with human subjects. Our experimental results demonstrated that our method learned proper assistive strategies that explicitly considered the bidirectional interactions between a user and a robot with only 60 seconds of interaction. We also showed that our proposed method can cope with changes in both the robot dynamics and movement trajectories. © 2017 The Authors","Exoskeleton robot; Human-in-the- loop; Human-robot physical interaction; Reinforcement learning","Cost functions; Costs; Electromyography; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Machine design; Reinforcement learning; Robots; Bi-directional interaction; Desired trajectories; Electromyography signals; Exoskeleton robots; Human-in-the-loop; Model-based reinforcement learning; Movement trajectories; Physical interactions; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85017537132

For design spaces with implicit constraints, sampling methods are usually used. These methods typically bound the design space; that is, limit the range of design variables. But bounds that are too small will fail to cover all possible designs, while bounds that are too large will waste sampling budget. This paper tries to solve the problem of efficiently discovering (possibly disconnected) feasible domains in an unbounded design space. We propose a data-driven adaptive sampling technique-e-margin sampling, which learns the domain boundary of feasible designs and also expands our knowledge on the design space as available budget increases. This technique is data-efficient, in that it makes principled probabilistic trade-offs between refining existing domain boundaries versus expanding the design space. We demonstrate that this method can better identify feasible domains on standard test functions compared to both random and active sampling (via uncertainty sampling). However, a fundamental problem when applying adaptive sampling to real world designs is that designs often have high dimensionality and thus require (in the worst case) exponentially more samples per dimension. We show how coupling design manifolds with e-margin sampling allows us to actively expand highdimensional design spaces without incurring this exponential penalty. We demonstrate this on real-world examples of glassware and bottle design, where our method discovers designs that have different appearance and functionality from its initial design set. © 2017 by ASME.",,"Bottles; Budget control; Economic and social effects; Adaptive sampling; Coupling designs; Design variables; High dimensionality; Implicit constraints; Real-world designs; Standard test functions; Uncertainty samplings; Problem solving",2-s2.0-85030455281

It uses passive safety methods for heat removal and reactivity control to protect the integrity of the fuel, reactor vessel, and containment. The plant also incorporates a below-grade, passively cooled spent fuel storage facility with capacity for 60 years of full-power operation. EM2 employs a direct closed-cycle gas turbine power conversion unit (PCU) with an organic Rankine bottoming cycle for 53% net power conversion efficiency assuming evaporative cooling. The high-power conversion efficiency and long-burn fuel cycle reduce the electricity cost by 35% when compared with the conventional light water reactor.

We demonstrated that spheroids directly respond to a tunable surface and the bulk properties (electric, dielectric and thermal) of plain and nanocomposite PLLA films by triggering a mechanotransduction axis. This stepwise process starts from tethering of the cells' focal adhesion proteins to the surface, together with the adherens junctions between cells.

This pattern applied in all three age groups in all tasks, except for multi-directional pointing with a larger target width among the older group. Overall, older adults took longer to complete the tasks and made more errors than young or middle-aged adults. Larger target widths yielded shorter movement times and lower error rates in pointing tasks, but larger targets yielded higher rates of error in dragging-and-dropping tasks.

In spite of the variety of persuasive strategies employed, deceit has been neglected justified by the negative connotation it benefits from public opinion and media reports. Still, established developers have been stalwart towards the inclusion of deceit as a gameplay mechanic by creating storylines capable of tricking players or giving them the power to deceive in the virtual world. This paper presents a characterization of deceit in videogames. Our aim consisted in identifying the characterizing traits which allow a game to sport deceitful mechanics. We created an online survey, asking players to characterize one of their latest play experiences taking into account characteristics of videogames present in known theories and models as well as some deceitful ones stemming from relevant research. Results suggest that current design trends potentiate the emergence of deceit as a play mechanic and that its prevalence in modern videogames is noteworthy. Our contribution for this domain is reinforced with the provision of a set of relations between game mechanics and how deceit is manifested in light of that characterization, validated through the appropriate statistical instruments. © 2017","Characterization; Deceit; Survey; Videogames","Characterization; Mechanics; Social aspects; Surveying; Surveys; Virtual reality; Deceit; Design trends; Online surveys; Persuasive technology; Public opinions; User engagement; Video game; Virtual worlds; Interactive computer graphics",2-s2.0-85029163960

However, previous works mainly focused on predicting ratings using collaborative filtering or quantifying personalized ranking quality in simulations. As a consequence, the effect of social information in user's information search and information-selection behavior remains elusive. The objective of our research is to investigate the effects of social information on users’ interactive search and information-selection behavior. We present a computational method and a system implementation combining different graph overlays: social, personal and search-time user input that are visualized for the user to support interactive information search. We report on a controlled laboratory experiment, in which 24 users performed search tasks using three system variants with different graphs as overlays composed from the largest publicly available social content and review data from Yelp: personal preferences, tags combined with personal preferences, and tags and social ratings combined with personal preferences. Data comprising search logs, questionnaires, simulations, and eye-tracking recordings show that: 1) the search effectiveness is improved by using and visualizing the social rating information and the personal preference information as compared to content-based ranking. 2) The need to consult external information before selecting information is reduced by the presentation of the effects of different overlays on the search results. Search effectiveness improvements can be attributed to the use of social rating and personal preference overlays, which was also confirmed in a follow-up simulation study. With the proposed method we demonstrate that social information can be incorporated to the interactive search process by overlaying graphs representing different information sources. We show that the combination of social rating information and personal preference information improves search effectiveness and reduce the need to consult external information.

An abstract modelling process often supports evidence-based decision making. Nonetheless, there are inherent difficulties for stakeholders in understanding complex scenario modelling. It is important to develop communication systems that support understanding of complex spatial decision models. This research used a Land Use Allocation (LUA) process, in the context of future agricultural land use under climate change scenarios, as a study in complex environmental modelling. The primary objective was to identify interactive options that can reduce the difficulty stakeholders have in understanding such an environmental model. A Spatial Model Steering (SMS) exploratory framework enabled users to explore the effects of climate change on land suitability, as a key aspect of LUA, and thus increase their perception of the influence of key factors. Within this framework, a user can visually steer the key climate, and climate response, related factors (rainfall, market price, and carbon price) of the LUA model, explore and compare “what if” future land use opportunities by adjusting these factors and visualize the spatial distribution of land suitability outcomes. The research compared the SMS approach with traditional methods of model output presentation and established that, with this approach, users develop both increased understanding of the key factors governing the underlying models and greater awareness of the uncertainty in the outcomes.

However, existing coherence mechanisms are difficult to scale beyond tens of cores, which require either excessive area or energy, complex hierarchical protocols, or inexact representations of sharer sets. In this paper, we present a hardware-software synergistic design of a cache coherence mechanism by considering OS-level application allocation and hardware-level coherence operations. The proposed application-oriented sparse directory (AoSD) cooperates with a contiguous allocation algorithm to isolate cache coherence traffic and thereby reduce interferences among applications. The proposed micro-architecture of sharer set representations is area-efficient; moreover, it can also be configured dynamically to track a flexible and exact sharer set. We verify our design by analyzing memory requirements of different cache organizations and implementing our design on a popular simulator Graphite to evaluate cache coherence traffic improvement. The results show that our design is both area-efficient and efficient with improvements in memory network performance by 11.74%–28.72%.

Various theoretical approaches have been offered for solving configuration type problems, but few studies have examined the approach that humans naturally use to solve such problems. This work applies data-mining techniques to quantitatively study the processes that designers use to solve configuration design problems. The guiding goal is to extract beneficial design process heuristics that are generalizable to the entire class of problems. The extraction of these human problem-solving heuristics is automated through the application of hidden Markov models to the data from two behavioral studies. Results show that designers proceed through four procedural states in solving configuration design problems, roughly transitioning from topology design to shape and parameter design. High-performing designers are distinguished by their opportunistic tuning of parameters early in the process, enabling a more effective and nuanced search for solutions.

However, the usefulness of these technologies is limited by the ability to translate lifecycle data into actionable insights for human decision-makers. This is especially true in the case of sustainable lifecycle design (SLD), as the assessment of environmental impacts, and the feasibility of making corresponding design changes, often relies on human expertise and intuition. Supporting human sensemaking in SLD requires the use of both data-driven and userdriven methods while exploring lifecycle data. A promising approach for combining the two is through the use of visual analytics (VA) tools. Such tools can leverage the ability of computer-based tools to gather, process, and summarize data along with the ability of human experts to guide analyses through domain knowledge or data-driven insight. In this paper, we review previous research that has created VA tools in SLD. We also highlight existing challenges and future opportunities for such tools in different lifecycle stages design, manufacturing, distribution and supply chain, use-phase, end-of-life (EoL), as well as life cycle assessment (LCA). Our review shows that while the number of VA tools in SLD is relatively small, researchers are increasingly focusing on the subject matter. Our review also suggests that VA tools can address existing challenges in SLD and that significant future opportunities exist.

Simultaneously, the dual material gate structure decreases ambipolar current by increasing the tunneling barrier width at the drain/channel interface. The performance of the device is analyzed based on the energy band diagram at on, off, and ambipolar states. Numerical simulations demonstrate improvements in ION, IOFF, ION/IOFF, subthreshold slope (SS), transconductance and cut-off frequency and suppressed ambipolar behavior.

However, recommending recipes and menus, which not only meet the user's preferences, but are also compliant with best food habits, is still an open issue. This paper presents the PREFer food recommender system, apt to provide users with personalized and healthy menus, taking into account both user's short/long-term preferences and medical prescriptions. Prescriptions classify the ideal user's nutrition behaviour from the health point of view, with constraints imposed by the specific user's phenotype. In fact, major novel contribution of the proposed system is the use of prescription types associated with users' profiles to improve users' behaviour in selecting food. The recommended menus are generated through three steps. First, according to user's request, recipes are selected by content-based filtering, based on comparisons among features used to annotate both users' profiles and recipes. Second, candidate menus are generated using the selected recipes. Third, menus are refined and ranked taking into account also prescriptions. The PREFer system has been developed within a regional project, related to the main topics “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life” of the 2015 World Exposition (EXPO2015, Milan, Italy), where the University of Brescia aimed at promoting healthy behavioural habits in nutrition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Food prescriptions; Food recommender system; Menu generation; Recipe recommendation; Semantic annotation","Nutrition; Semantics; Co-occurrence; Content based filtering; Medical prescription; Menu generation; Recipe recommendation; Regional projects; Semantic annotations; User's preferences; Recommender systems",2-s2.0-85005978287

In particular, by adopting a retail customer experience perspective on value creation, analysing the content of MAR shopping apps currently available, and conducting large-scale surveys on United States smartphone users representing early technology adopters, we assess level of use, experiential benefits offered, and retail consequences. Our findings suggest that take-up is set to go mainstream as user satisfaction is relatively high and their use provides systematic experiential benefits along with advantages to retailers.

One key pre-requirement of applying such systems is to gain decent knowledge about each individual consumer through user profiling. However, most existing profiling approaches on mobile suffer problems such as non-real-time, intrusive, cold-start, and non-scalable, which prevents them from being adopted in reality. To tackle the problems, this work developed real-time machine-learning models to predict user profiles of smartphone users from openly accessible data, i.e. app installation logs.

This composite structure enables load transfer between structurally and functionally dissimilar tissues and is critical for ligament homeostasis and joint stability. Presently, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of the matrix composition and organization across this junction, especially after the onset of skeletal maturity. The objective of this study is to characterize the adult bovine ACL-to-bone interface using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI), testing the hypothesis that regional changes in collagen, proteoglycan, and mineral distribution, as well as matrix organization, persist at the mature insertion. It was observed that while collagen content increases continuously across the adult interface, collagen alignment decreases between ligament and bone. Proteoglycans were primarily localized to the fibrocartilage region and an exponential increase in mineral content was observed between the non-mineralized and mineralized regions. These observations reveal significant changes in collagen distribution and alignment with maturity, and these trends underscore the role of physiologic loading in postnatal matrix remodeling.

In this study, an attention diversion task with two different levels was administered while participants had to complete a cue-based motor task consisting of foot dorsiflexion. An auditory oddball task with two levels of complexity was implemented to divert the user's attention. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made from nine single channels. Event-related potentials (ERPs) confirmed that the oddball task of counting a sequence of two tones decreased the auditory P300 amplitude more than the oddball task of counting one target tone among three different tones. Pre-movement features quantified from the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) were changed significantly between single and dual-task conditions in motor and fronto-central channels. There was a significant delay in movement detection for the case of single tone counting in two motor channels only (237.1–247.4 ms). For the task of sequence counting, motor cortex and frontal channels showed a significant delay in MRCP detection (232.1–250.5 ms). This study investigated the effect of attention diversion in dual-task conditions by analysing both ERPs and MRCPs in single channels. The higher attention diversion lead to a significant reduction in specific MRCP features of the motor task. These results suggest that attention division in dual-tasking situations plays an important role in movement execution and detection. This has important implications in designing real-time brain-computer interface systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Attention; Auditory oddball; Brain-computer interface; Dual-tasking; Movement-related cortical potential",,2-s2.0-85027845842

This task involves placing a short suture through two marks in a penrose drain and then tying a double-throw knot followed by two single-throw knots using two needle graspers operated by both hands. A virtual basic laparoscopic skill trainer (VBLaST©) is being developed to represent the virtual versions of the FLS tasks, including automated, real time performance measurement and feedback. In this paper, we present the development of a VBLaST suturing simulator (VBLaST-SS©). Developing such a simulator involves solving multiple challenges associated with fast collision detection, response and force feedback. Methods In this paper, we present a novel projection-intersection based knot detection method, which can identify the validity of different types of knots at haptic update rates. A simple and robust edge-edge based collision detection algorithm is introduced to support interactive knot tying and needle insertion operations. A bimanual hardware interface integrates actual surgical instruments with haptic devices enabling not only interactive rendering of force feedback but also realistic sensation of needle grasping, which realizes an immersive surgical suturing environment. Results Experiments on performing the FLS intracorporeal suturing task show that the simulator is able to run on a standard personal computer at interactive rates.

The motivating factors are device and user mobiliy, i.e., to let the user determine where application components should execute at all times. In order to organize and locate roaming devices, a decentralized peer-to-peer overlay is developed. To provide location transparency for application developers and enable efficient data sharing among application components, an API is provided that hides whether shared memory or latency optimized network distribution is used to share data. The problem of open TCP connections to third-party applications is solved with a proxy-based approach. Multimedia applications are especially sensitive to service interruptions that can be caused by migration, and a new approach for check-pointing, state transfer, and resuming an application with minimal freeze time is therefore introduced. The evaluation of TRAMP shows that this optimization for low freeze time has significant effect. For example, migrating the Skype video-conferencing application with TRAMP reduces the average freeze time from 41.1 seconds with legacy approaches to 213 milliseconds. Further results from the empirical evaluation of TRAMP demonstrate that it has no negative impact on the Quality of Experience. © 2017 IEEE.","middleware; Mobile applications; mobile computing; multimedia communication; ubiquitous computing","Distributed computer systems; Fault tolerant computer systems; Middleware; Mobile computing; Multimedia systems; Quality control; Quality of service; Ubiquitous computing; Video conferencing; Application components; Application developers; Mobile and ubiquitous computing; Mobile applications; Multi-media communications; Multimedia applications; Quality of experience (QoE); Third party application (Apps); Application programming interfaces (API)",2-s2.0-85032267892

To deal with this problem, a mobile device (node) with low service quality can offload its data traffic to nearby nodes with better service quality through Device-to-Device interfaces, such as WiFi direct, to save energy and reduce delay. To achieve this goal, we propose a Quality-Aware Traffic Offloading (QATO) framework to offload network tasks to neighboring nodes with better service quality. QATO can identify neighbors with better service quality and motivate nodes to help each other using incentive schemes. To validate our design, we have implemented QATO on Android platform and have developed a web browser and a photo uploader on top of it.

Three new devices were recently introduced that share in common inexpensive optical cameras. The design, and thus potential clinical applicability, of these systems differ substantially leading us to critically evaluate their accuracy and precision. SUBJECTS/METHODS: 113 adult subjects completed evaluations by the three optical devices (KX-16 (16 stationary cameras), Proscanner (1 vertically oscillating camera), and Styku scanner (1 stationary camera)), air displacement plethysmography (ADP), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and a flexible tape measure. Optical measurements were compared to reference method estimates that included results acquired by flexible tape, DXA and ADP. RESULTS: Optical devices provided respective circumference and regional volume estimates that overall were well-correlated with those obtained from flexible tape measurements (for example, hip circumference: R2, 0.91, 0.90, 0.96 for the KX-16, Proscanner, and Styku scanner, respectively) and DXA (for example, trunk volume: R2, 0.97, 0.97, and 0.98). Total body volumes measured by the optical devices were highly correlated with those from the ADP system (all R2s, 0.99). Coefficient of variations obtained from duplicate measurements (n, 55) were larger in optical than in reference measurements and significant (Po0.05) bias was present for some optical measurements relative to reference method estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evaluated optical imaging systems differing in design provided body surface measurements that compared favorably with corresponding reference methods. However, our evaluations uncovered system measurement limitations, such as discrepancies in landmarking, that with correction have the potential to improve future developed devices. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"adult; air displacement plethysmography; anthropometry; Article; body build; body mass; body size; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; hip circumference; human; image analysis; image processing; informed consent; limit of quantitation; male; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; plethysmography; questionnaire",2-s2.0-85032630414

The gripping arms of the trap are the addition to the BM. Catch and release operation of the trap are accomplished by snap-through behaviors of the BM. Two stable equilibrium positions of the BM are correspondent to the baiting and gripping configurations of the trap. The proposed mechanism has no movable joints and gains its mobility from the deflection of compliant members. Device complexity is reduced by integration of jaws and gripping arms with the BM. Utilizing the snap-through behavior of the BM, self-closing function for catching mouse is attained without additional locking parts or latches. Therefore, the catch action is autonomous and does not require additional energy input to hold the trapped mouse. Analytical models are developed for design of the device. Prototypes of the mechanism are fabricated by a simple three dimensional printing process. The characteristics of the mechanism are verified by experiments. A “mouse” is caught and released though the linear motion of the BM. The mouse strap can also be used for assembly and disassembly of industrial parts. © 2017","Bistable mechanism; Mouse trap; Self-closing","3D printers; Beams and girders; Locks (fasteners); Mammals; Mechanisms; Bistable mechanisms; Catch and release; Device complexity; Industrial parts; Linear motion; Mouse trap; Self-closing; Stable equilibrium; Compliant mechanisms",2-s2.0-85032873756

However, it is a difficult job for the guardians to continuously monitor the patients' state, especially when direct communication is not possible. In the present study, we developed an emergency call system for such patients using a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)–based brain switch. Although there have been previous studies to implement SSVEP-based brain switch system, they have not been applied to patients in LIS, and thus their clinical value has not been validated. In this study, we verified whether the SSVEP-based brain switch system can be practically used as an emergency call system for patients in LIS. The brain switch used for our system adopted a chromatic visual stimulus, which proved to be visually less stimulating than conventional checkerboard-type stimuli but could generate SSVEP responses strong enough to be used for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. To verify the feasibility of our emergency call system, 14 healthy participants and 3 patients with severe ALS took part in online experiments. All three ALS patients successfully called their guardians to their bedsides in about 6.56 seconds. Furthermore, additional experiments with one of these patients demonstrated that our emergency call system maintains fairly good performance even up to 4 weeks after the first experiment without renewing initial calibration data.

The traditional input devices such as a mouse and keyboard can basically input 2D information without feedback. In recent years, the continuous development of haptic device not only can achieve six degrees-of-freedom input, but also can calculate the force in virtual scenes and feedback to the user to make a better virtual experience. How to use haptic device in different kinds of virtual fluid scenarios to provide better experience is an important issue in the field of virtual reality. On the other hand, the researches on multiple-fluid interaction especially based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method are very lacking. Therefore, we study the key techniques of haptic interaction with SPH multiple-fluid to compensate this defect in computer graphics community. Different from the single-phase flow, interaction with multiple-fluid flow has difficulties in the realization of properties of different phases. After adding the multiple-fluid simulation, it is also important to keep haptic interaction real time. Our research is based on the mixture model. We guarantee the authenticity of multiple-fluid mixing effect while changing the drift velocity solver to improve efficiency. We employ a unified particle model to achieve rigid body–liquid coupling, and use FIR filter to smooth feedback force to the haptic device.

Nevertheless, even as a growing number of researchers have expanded their scope to the urban realm, there remain many problems resulting from the complexity of the urban microclimate, such as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This study is initiated with the intention to account for uncertainty in developing more coherent and integrated strategies concerning the energy and environmental issues in an urban system. The analysis builds upon the previously reported and updated Urban Weather Generator (UWG) to present a deep look into an existing urban microclimate system in Abu Dhabi (UAE). The case-specific baseline information is generated for the UWG and a global regression-based sensitivity analysis using the Monte Carlo technique is performed. Based on 30 candidate inputs covering the meteorological factors, urban characteristics, vegetation variables, and building systems, the uncertainty analysis indicates that the UWG is a fairly robust simulator to approximate the urban thermal behavior in downtown Abu Dhabi for different seasons.

With the increase of complexity, the interaction among accelerators and processors could be deadfall if a race condition happens. However, the existing tools for such task are either too slow or hard to extend the race condition detection mechanism. Therefore, tools for application profiling with approximate timing model are important to the design of such heterogeneous systems in a timing manner. In this paper, we proposed a pluggable GPU interface on an existing timing approximate CPU simulator based on QEMU for analyzing the memory behavior of heterogeneous systems. Monitoring the memory behavior, the pluggable interface could be extended to any kinds of accelerators, such as GPU, DSP and FPGA, for race condition detection. Taking the GPU as an example, we integrated the detailed GPU simulator from Multi2Sim with the existing timing approximate CPU simulator, VPA, to showcase the efficiency of the proposed work. The experimental results showed that the emulation speed of the proposed framework could even reach 9 × faster than Multi2Sim in some cases.

Thus, the need for an easy to use tool to produce landscape patterns similar to real landscapes in this area is imminent. In this article, we aimed at introducing SG4GISCAME as a tool to meet this purpose by exploring it capabilities to generate landscapes similar to real agricultural landscapes of the Vea catchment area in Ghana in three steps. We used Voronoi tessellation polygons to develop the image patterns. The resulting artificial patterns were subsequently evaluated through a visual and landscape structural metric comparison between the simulated and real landscapes. Finally, we used a modified Turing Test to test the credibility of SG4GISCAME model output through expert pattern identification cues. The results show that SG4GISCAME can successfully generate agricultural landscape mosaics similar to real landscape under different parameters and user specifications. We attribute this to the tools’ intuitive and interactive user interface. Statistical test outcomes of the modified Turing Test suggested that geographic information systems and remote sensing map experts found marked pattern similarities between real and synthesis maps, resulting in challenges in identifying real maps from synthetic ones.

MaMiCo: Software design for parallel molecular-continuum flow simulations, Computer Physics Communications 200: 324–335, 2016 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. The functionality of the previous version is completely retained in the new version. Nature of problem: Coupled molecular-continuum simulation for multi-resolution fluid dynamics: parts of the domain are resolved by molecular dynamics or another particle-based solver whereas large parts are covered by a mesh-based CFD solver, e.g. a lattice Boltzmann automaton. Solution method: We couple existing MD and CFD solvers via MaMiCo (macro–micro coupling tool). Data exchange and coupling algorithmics are abstracted and incorporated in MaMiCo. Once an algorithm is set up in MaMiCo, it can be used and extended, even if other solvers are used (as soon as the respective interfaces are implemented/available). Reasons for the new version: We have incorporated a new algorithm to simulate transient molecular-continuum systems and to automatically sample data over multiple MD runs that can be executed simultaneously (on, e.g., a compute cluster). MaMiCo has further been extended by an interface to incorporate boundary forcing to account for open molecular dynamics boundaries. Besides support for coupling with various MD and CFD frameworks, the new version contains a test case that allows to run molecular-continuum Couette flow simulations out-of-the-box. No external tools or simulation codes are required anymore. However, the user is free to switch from the included MD simulation package to LAMMPS.

A complete validation of this MIS e-learning platform has been performed to determine whether it complies with the three web quality dimensions: usability, content and functionality. Methods 21 Surgeons participated in the validation trials. They performed a set of tasks in the TELMA platform, where an e-MIS validity approach was followed. Subjective (questionnaires and checklists) and objective (web analytics) metrics were analysed to achieve the complete validation of usability, content and functionality. Results The TELMA platform allowed access to didactic content with easy and intuitive navigation. Surgeons performed all tasks with a close-to-ideal number of clicks and amount of time. They considered the design of the website to be consistent (95.24%), organised (90.48%) and attractive (85.71%). Moreover, they gave the content a high score (4.06 out of 5) and considered it adequate for teaching purposes. The surgeons scored the professional language and content (4.35), logo (4.24) and recommendations (4.20) the highest. Regarding functionality, the TELMA platform received an acceptance of 95.24% for navigation and 90.48% for interactivity. Conclusions According to the study, it seems that TELMA had an attractive design, innovative content and interactive navigation, which are three key features of an e-learning platform. TELMA successfully met the three criteria necessary for consideration as a website of quality by achieving more than 70% of agreements regarding all usability, content and functionality items validated; this constitutes a preliminary requirement for an effective e-learning platform. However, the content completeness, authoring tool and registration process required improvement. Finally, the e-MIS validity methodology used to measure the three dimensions of web quality in this work can be applied to other clinical areas or training fields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Content; E-learning; Functionality; Minimally invasive surgery; Usability; Validation; Web quality","Navigation; Surgery; Surveys; Usability engineering; Web Design; Websites; Content; Functionality; Minimally invasive surgery; Usability; Validation; Web quality; E-learning; adult; Article; checklist; e learning; female; human; Internet; male; minimally invasive surgery; priority journal; quantitative study; questionnaire; surgeon; validation study",2-s2.0-85028759943

Today, progress in Big data proposals attempt to solve this problem, but there are certain limitations to information search and retrieval due basically to the large volumes handled, the heterogeneity of the information, and its dispersion among a multitude of sources. In this article, a formal framework is defined to facilitate the design and development of an environmental management information system, which works with a heterogeneous and large amount of data. Nevertheless, this framework can be applied to other information systems that work with Big data, because it does not depend on the type of data and can be utilized in other domains. The framework is based on an ontological web-trading model (OntoTrader), which follows model-driven engineering and ontology-driven engineering guidelines to separate the system architecture from its implementation.

Such three-dimensional collaborative virtual environments can mirror the collaboration among usability test participants and facilitators when they are physically collocated, potentially enabling moderated usability tests to be conducted effectively when the facilitator and participant are located in different places. We developed a virtual collaborative three-dimensional remote moderated usability testing laboratory and employed it in a controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of moderated usability testing in a collaborative virtual reality-based environment with two other moderated usability testing methods: the traditional lab approach and Cisco WebEx, a web-based conferencing and screen sharing approach. Using a mixed methods experimental design, 36 test participants and 12 test facilitators were asked to complete representative tasks on a simulated online shopping website. The dependent variables included the time taken to complete the tasks; the usability defects identified and their severity; and the subjective ratings on the workload index, presence and satisfaction questionnaires. Remote moderated usability testing methodology using a collaborative virtual reality system performed similarly in terms of the total number of defects identified, the number of high severity defects identified and the time taken to complete the tasks with the other two methodologies. The overall workload experienced by the test participants and facilitators was the least with the traditional lab condition. No significant differences were identified for the workload experienced with the virtual reality and the WebEx conditions. However, test participants experienced greater involvement and a more immersive experience in the virtual environment than in the WebEx condition. The ratings for the virtual environment condition were not significantly different from those for the traditional lab condition. The results of this study suggest that participants were productive and enjoyed the virtual lab condition, indicating the potential of a virtual world based approach as an alternative to conventional approaches for synchronous usability testing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative virtual reality systems; Moderated usability testing; Remote testing","Audio systems; Defects; Electronic commerce; Laboratories; Surveys; Testing; Usability engineering; Virtual reality; Websites; Collaborative virtual environment; Collaborative virtual reality; Conventional approach; Environment conditions; Remote testing; Remote usability testing; Usability testing; Usability testing methods; Optical testing; clinical article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; dependent variable; experimental design; human; questionnaire; satisfaction; shopping; simulation; virtual reality; workload",2-s2.0-85013869418

As the usefulness of BIM has been widely recognized in the building and construction industry, there is an urgent need to establish an up-to-date synthesis on the nexus between BIM and green buildings. After an in-depth review of hundreds of journal articles published from 1999 to 2016 and 12 widely used types of BIM software, this study provides a holistic understanding and critical reflection on the nexus between BIM and green buildings, which is systematically illustrated by a “Green BIM Triangle” taxonomy. The proposed taxonomy indicates that the nexus between BIM and green buildings needs to be understood based on three dimensions, namely project phases, green attributes and BIM attributes. Following the proposed taxonomy, this paper systematically illustrated 1) the applications of BIM in supporting the design, construction, operation, and retrofitting processes of green buildings; 2) the various functions of BIM for green building analyses such as energy, emissions, and ventilation analysis; 3) the applications of BIM in supporting green building assessments (GBA); and 4) research gaps and future research directions in this area. Through critical review and synthesis of BIM and green buildings based on evidence from both academic research and industrial practices, this paper provides important guidance for building researchers and practitioners to better align BIM development with green building development in the future. © 2017","BIM software; Building Information Modeling (BIM); Green buildings; Life cycle; Review; Sustainability","Buildings; Construction; Construction industry; Industrial research; Information theory; Life cycle; Reviews; Sustainable development; Taxonomies; Academic research; Building and construction; Building Information Model - BIM; Critical reflections; Future research directions; Green buildings; Industrial practices; Natural environments; Architectural design",2-s2.0-85027406680

In particular, serious games can be used as informative tools and can be embedded in formal education. Although there are some studies related to the application of serious games for the software development process, there is no serious game that teaches the fundamentals of the ISO/IEC 12207:1995 Systems and software engineering – Software life cycle processes, which is an international standard for software lifecycle processes that aims to be ‘the’ standard that defines all the tasks required for developing and maintaining software. “Floors” is a serious game that proposes an interactive learning experience to introduce ISO/IEC 12207:1995 by creating different floors of a virtual environment where various processes of the standard are discussed and implemented. Inherently, it follows an iterative process based on interactive technical dialogues in a 3D computer simulated office. The tool is designed to assess the novice engineering practitioners knowledge and provide preliminary training for ISO/IEC 12207:1995 processes. By playing such a game, participants are able to learn about the details of this standard. The present study provides a framework for the exploration of research data obtained from computer engineering students. Results suggest that there is a significant difference between the knowledge gained among the students who have played Floors and those who have only participated in paper-based learning sessions. Our findings indicate that participants who played Floors tend to have greater knowledge of the ISO/IEC 12207:1995 standard, and as a result, we recommend the use of serious games that seem to be superior to traditional paper based approach. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","ISO/IEC 12207; Serious games; Teaching standards","Application programs; Computer software; Floors; Iterative methods; Life cycle; Software engineering; Virtual reality; Engineering practitioners; Engineering software; Interactive learning; International standards; ISO/IEC; Serious games; Software development process; Teaching standard; Software design",2-s2.0-85008197521

Redundant computing has been proposed as an alternative at extreme scale. Triple redundancy has an advantage over C/R in that it can also detect silent data corruption (SDC) and then correct results via voting. However, current redundant computing approaches do not repair failed or corrupted replicas. Consequently, SDCs can no longer be detected after a replica failure since the system has been degraded to dual redundancy without voting capability. Hence, a job may have to be aborted if voting uncovers mismatching results between the remaining two replicas. And while replicas are logically equivalent, they may have divergent runtime states during job execution, which presents a challenge to simply creating new replicas dynamically. This problem is addressed by, DIvergent NOde cloning (DINO), a redundant execution environment that quickly recovers from hard failures. DINO consists of a novel node cloning service integrated into the MPI runtime system that solves the problem of consolidating divergent states among replicas on-the-fly. With DINO, after degradation to dual redundancy, a good replica can be quickly cloned so that triple redundancy is restored. We present experimental results over 9 NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), Sweep3D and LULESH. Results confirm the applicability of the approach and the correctness of the recovery process and indicate that DINO can recover from failures nearly instantly. The cloning overhead depends on the process image size that needs to be transferred between source and destination of the clone operation and varies between 5.60 to 90.48 s. Simulation results with our model show that dual redundancy with DINO recovery always outperforms 2x and surpasses 3x redundancy on up to 1 million nodes. To the best of our knowledge, the design and implementation for repairing failed replicas in redundant MPI computing is unprecedented. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Fault tolerance; High performance computing; Node cloning; Redundant computing","Fault tolerance; Genetic engineering; Recovery; Redundancy; Repair; Checkpoint/restart; Design and implementations; Dual redundancies; Execution environments; High performance computing; NAS parallel benchmarks; Redundant computing; Silent data corruption (SDC); Cloning",2-s2.0-85026196979

New inhibitors block the active site of the target protein and the disease is cured. Computer-aided molecular modeling can considerably increase effectiveness of new inhibitors development. Reliable predictions of the target protein inhibition by a small molecule, ligand, is defined by the accuracy of docking programs. Such programs position a ligand in the target protein and estimate the protein-ligand binding energy. Positioning accuracy of modern docking programs is satisfactory. However, the accuracy of binding energy calculations is too low to predict good inhibitors. For effective application of docking programs to new inhibitors development the accuracy of binding energy calculations should be higher than 1 kcal/mol. Reasons of limited accuracy of modern docking programs are discussed. One of the most important aspects limiting this accuracy is imperfection of protein-ligand energy calculations. Results of supercomputer validation of several force fields and quantum-chemical methods for docking are presented. The validation was performed by quasi-docking as follows. First, the low energy minima spectra of 16 protein-ligand complexes were found by exhaustive minima search in the MMFF94 force field. Second, energies of the lowest 8192 minima are recalculated with CHARMM force field and PM6-D3H4X and PM7 quantum-chemical methods for each complex. The analysis of minima energies reveals the docking positioning accuracies of the PM7 and PM6-D3H4X quantum-chemical methods and the CHARMM force field are close to one another and they are better than the positioning accuracy of the MMFF94 force field. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","CHARMM; Docking; Force field; MMFF94; PM6; PM7; Quantum chemistry; Supercomputer","Application programs; Bins; Chemical analysis; Complexation; Docking; Ligands; Molecular graphics; Molecular modeling; Proteins; Quantum chemistry; Supercomputers; CHARMM; Docking programs; Energy calculation; Force fields; MMFF94; Positioning accuracy; Protein-ligand complexes; Quantum-chemical methods; Binding energy; ligand; protein; ab initio calculation; accuracy; Article; complex formation; computer aided design; controlled study; energy; force; molecular docking; molecular model; priority journal; protein binding; protein structure; protein targeting; quantum chemistry; validation process",2-s2.0-85031780204

OSS influences the way organizations develop, acquire, use and commercialize software. SECOs have emerged as a paradigm to understand dynamics and heterogeneity in collaborative software development. For this reason, SECOs appear as a valid instrument to analyze OSS systems. However, there are few studies that blend both topics together. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of the art in OSS ecosystems (OSSECOs) research, specifically: (a) what the most relevant definitions related to OSSECOs are; (b) what the particularities of this type of SECO are; and (c) how the knowledge about OSSECO is represented. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping following recommended practices. We applied automatic and manual searches on different sources and used a rigorous method to elicit the keywords from the research questions and selection criteria to retrieve the final papers. As a result, 82 papers were selected and evaluated. Threats to validity were identified and mitigated whenever possible. Results: The analysis allowed us to answer the research questions. Most notably, we did the following: (a) identified 64 terms related to the OSSECO and arranged them into a taxonomy; (b) built a genealogical tree to understand the genesis of the OSSECO term from related definitions; (c) analyzed the available definitions of SECO in the context of OSS; and (d) classified the existing modelling and analysis techniques of OSSECOs. Conclusion: As a summary of the systematic mapping, we conclude that existing research on several topics related to OSSECOs is still scarce (e.g., modelling and analysis techniques, quality models, standard definitions, etc.). This situation calls for further investigation efforts on how organizations and OSS communities actually understand OSSECOs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Literature review; Open source software; OSS; OSSECO; SECO; Software ecosystem; Systematic mapping","Computer software; Ecology; Ecosystems; Groupware; Mapping; Open source software; Quality control; Software design; Software engineering; Literature reviews; OSSECO; SECO; Software ecosystems; Systematic mapping; Open systems",2-s2.0-85025476436

Methods: Seven readers new to HIMRISS (3 radiologists, 4 rheumatologists) scored coronal short-tau inversion recovery MRI from a hip OA observational study obtained pre- and 8-week poststeroid injection (n = 40 × 2 scans × 2 hips = 160 hips). By crossover design, Group B (4 readers) scored 20 patients (40 hips) using conventional spreadsheet-based methods and then another 20 using a Web-based interface and an online real-time iterative calibration (RETIC) training module. Group A (3 readers) reversed the order, scoring the first 20 subjects by the new method and the final 20 conventionally. Outcomes included ICC and reader survey. Results: Interobserver reliability for BML status was high by both spreadsheet and Web-based methods (0.84-0.90), regardless of the order in which scoring was performed. Reliability of change scores was moderate and improved with training. Improvement was greater in readers who began with the spreadsheet method and then used the Web-based method than in those who began with the Web-based method, especially at the acetabulum.

Nonetheless, the final plant productivity and the overall equipment efficiency does not solely depend on an optimized engineering design/installation practice, but also on human operators supervision. In parallel, along with the classic demand to minimize costs and time-to-market during the design phases, issues concerning human safety and failure prevention play a crucial role, one of the highest target being the avoidance of dangerous process states. Within this context, Simulation-Based-Training (SBT) allows plant operators to learn how to command complex automated machineries within a secure virtual environment. Similar to its usage in medical, aerospace, naval and military fields, SBT for manufacturing systems can be employed in order to involve the user within a realistic scenario, thus providing an effective, lifelike, interactive training experience under the supervision of experienced personnel. In addition, also according to previous literature, industry-driven SBT may be effectively envisaged as a natural extension of the plant life-cycle simulation practice, comprising Design Simulation & Optimization, Virtual Commissioning, Operator Training, up to Plant Maintenance. In this context, since the overall system behavior depends both on manufacturing process dynamics and Control Logics, the main challenge for an effective SBT is related with the development of a real-time environment where control system responsiveness is fully reproduced. Owing to this consideration, this paper reports a successful industrial case study, concerning a novel SBT workbench used for steel plants operator training, discussing both the virtual prototyping phase and the development of a real-time simulation architecture. In particular, a hybrid process simulation is employed, where a virtual process model is coupled with physical PLC and Human–Machine Interface, thus achieving an accurate reproduction of the real plant/operator interaction. © 2016, Springer-Verlag France.","Hybrid virtual/physical simulation; Industrial case study; Simulation-based-training; Virtual commissioning; Virtual prototyping","Industrial plants; Life cycle; Machinery; Maintenance; Manufacture; Personnel training; Plant life extension; Process control; Steelmaking; Virtual prototyping; Hybrid process simulation; Hybrid virtual/physical simulation; Industrial case study; Interactive simulations; Manufacturing process; Overall equipment efficiency; Simulation-based training; Virtual commissioning; Virtual reality",2-s2.0-85009279513

They can be used for constraining template parameters, which enables checking requirements on template parameters sooner in the compilation process, and thus providing more intelligible error messages to the user. They can also be used in the specialization of templates, thus leading to a better control over the selection of the most appropriate version of a template for a given instantiation. This latter aspect offers new possibilities in the design of template libraries, as it enhances the specialization mechanism of templates, and set it up as a solid alternative to inheritance when static binding can replace dynamic binding. This article addresses the design of expression templates (i.e., templates that represent expressions and are usually built through operator overloading) that are useful to develop an embedded domain specific language (EDSL), and can speed up the evaluation of an expression by delaying the evaluation of intermediate operations to avoid unnecessary temporary objects. We propose to use concept-based template specialization to parse expression templates in order to ease the design of an EDSL. This approach is a static variant of the well-known visitor design pattern that replaces the overridden methods in the double dispatch of the original design pattern by template specializations based on concepts. An example of EDSL for linear programming developed with our solution demonstrates that a concept-based design helps producing concise and reliable code. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The structural analysis of this PTM is challenging because of the diverse monosaccharides which are not conserved among organisms, the branched nature of glycans, their isomeric structures, and heterogeneity in the glycan distribution at a given site. Glycoproteomics experiments have adopted the traditional high-throughput LC-MSn proteomics workflow to analyze site-specific glycosylation. However, comprehensive computational platforms for data analyses are scarce. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive, open-source, modular software for glycoproteomics data analysis called GlycoPAT (GlycoProteomics Analysis Toolbox; freely available from www.VirtualGlycome.org/glycopat). The program includes three major advances: (1) ""Small-GlyPep,"" a minimal linear representation of glycopeptides for MSn data analysis. This format allows facile serial fragmentation of both the peptide backbone and PTM at one or more locations. (2) A novel scoring scheme based on calculation of the ""Ensemble Score (ES),"" a measure that scores and rank-orders MS/MS spectrum for N- and O-linked glycopeptides using cross-correlation and probability based analyses. (3) A false discovery rate (FDR) calculation scheme where decoy glycopeptides are created by simultaneously scrambling the amino acid sequence and by introducing artificial monosaccharides by perturbing the original sugar mass. Parallel computing facilities and user-friendly GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) are also provided. GlycoPAT is used to catalogue site-specific glycosylation on simple glycoproteins, standard protein mixtures and human plasma cryoprecipitate samples in three common MS/MS fragmentation modes: CID, HCD and ETD. It is also used to identify 960 unique glycopeptides in cell lysates from prostate cancer cells. The results show that the simultaneous consideration of peptide and glycan fragmentation is necessary for high quality MSn spectrum annotation in CID and HCD fragmentation modes. Additionally, they confirm the suitability of GlycoPAT to analyze shotgun glycoproteomics data. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"glycan; glycopeptide; glycoprotein; monosaccharide; amino acid sequence; Article; calculation; cell lysate; cryoprecipitate; data analysis; fragmentation reaction; glycoproteomics; glycosylation; mass spectrometry; priority journal; probability; prostate cancer cell line; proteomics; software; tandem mass spectrometry",2-s2.0-85032646562

Electronic health record–based clinical decision support (EHR CDS) represents a promising strategy to implement ASPs in the ED. We aimed to determine the cultural beliefs and structural barriers and facilitators to implementation of antimicrobial stewardship in the pediatric ED using EHR CDS. Methods Interviews and focus groups were conducted with hospital and ED leadership, attending ED physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and residents at a single health system in Colorado. We reviewed and coded the data using constant comparative analysis and framework analysis until a final set of themes emerged. Results Two dominant perceptions shaped providers’ perspectives on ASPs in the ED and EHR CDS: (1) maintaining workflow efficiency and (2) constrained decision-making autonomy. Clinicians identified structural barriers to ASPs, such as pace of the ED, and various beliefs that shaped patterns of practice, including accommodating the prescribing decisions of other providers and managing parental expectations. Recommendations to enhance uptake focused on designing a simple yet flexible user interface, providing clinicians with performance data, and on-boarding clinicians to enhance buy-in.

Here, a combined lattice Boltzmann–immersed boundary model is presented for predicting the near-wall dynamics of circulating particles. A moving least squares algorithm is used to reconstruct the forcing term accounting for the immersed particle, whereas ligand-receptor binding at the particle–wall interface is described via forward and reverse probability distributions. First, it is demonstrated that the model predicts with good accuracy the rolling velocity of tumor cells over an endothelial layer in a microfluidic channel. Then, particle–wall interactions are systematically analyzed in terms of particle geometries (circular, elliptical with aspect ratios 2 and 3), surface ligand densities (0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9), ligand-receptor bond strengths (1 and 2) and Reynolds numbers (Re = 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0). Depending on these conditions, four different particle–wall interaction regimens are identified, namely not adhering, rolling, sliding and firmly adhering particles.

To cover this, mega datacentres need scalable connectivity to provide rich connectivity to handle the heavy traffic across them. Therefore, hardware infrastructures must be able to play different roles according to service and traffic requirements. In this context, software defined networking (SDN) decouples the network control and forwarding functions enabling the network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted for applications and network services. In addition, elastic optical networking (EON) technologies enable efficient spectrum utilization by allocating variable bandwidth to each user according to their actual needs.

METHODS: A convenience sample of 39,088 SCPs completed for cancer survivors with an Internet-based SCP tool was examined; it included 5847 CC survivors (15%; CC was defined as chronic leukemia and/or recurrent/metastatic cancer of another nature). Patient-reported treatment effects and follow-up care patterns were compared between CC survivors and survivors treated with curative intent (CI). Responses from a follow-up survey regarding SCP satisfaction and use were reviewed. RESULTS: CC survivors had greater odds of experiencing multiple treatment-related effects than survivors treated with CI; these effects included fatigue, cognitive changes, dyspnea, peripheral neuropathy, lymphedema, and erectile dysfunction. Nearly half of CC survivors were managed by an oncologist alone, and they were less likely than CI patients to be comanaged by a primary care provider and an oncologist. Fewer SCPs were generated by health care providers (HCPs) for CC survivors versus CI survivors. A smaller proportion of CC users versus CI users rated their experience and satisfaction with the SCP tool as very good or excellent, and CC users were less likely to share the HCP summary with their health care team. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of CC survivors, often considered incurable but treatable, seek survivorship support. Tools to facilitate participation, communication, and coordination of care are valuable for these patients, and future iterations of SCPs should be designed to address the particular circumstances of living with CC.

The integerness of the user ambiguities gets recovered and resolved, obtaining high-precision position solutions with the aid of the precise carrier-phase observables. Most of current PPP-RTK methods focus on processing dual-frequency or multifrequency GNSS network observations. The new developing Indian regional navigation satellite system (IRNSS), however, provides only a single-frequency signal in L-band, and shares the L5 frequency with the American global positioning system (GPS), the European Galileo, and the Japanese quasi-zenith satellite system (QZSS). This contribution proposes a new array-aided state-space RTK (SS-RTK) method following the concept of PPP-RTK, which is applicable to the single-frequency network data processing. A small array of multi-GNSS stations, separated by a few meters, takes the role of reference station to provide a batch of single-frequency RTK corrections. Similar to PPP-RTK, the single-frequency stand-alone user ambiguities are a double-differenced (DD) form after applying the SS-RTK corrections. Based on the proposed array-aided SS-RTK concept, the authors analyze the capability of the single-receiver positioning with IAR using L5/E5a frequency observations from IRNSS, as well as GPS, Galileo, and QZSS. Results from real-data experiments demonstrate that even though stand-alone RTK using current IRNSS satellites is not yet possible, they effectively contribute to the tightly integrated multisystem RTK. By increasing the number of antennas in the array used for SS-RTK corrections, the user would achieve more precise and reliable positions. After increasing the dimension of the array to four antennas, a 4-10% improvement in the IAR success rate is experienced. Moreover, the convergence time of the float solutions, reaching a subdecimeter precision level, reduces from 30 to 40 min (single-antenna array) to about 20 min (four-antenna array). © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Integer ambiguity resolution (IAR); L5 frequency; Multi-global navigation satellite system (GNSS); State-space RTK (SS-RTK)","Antenna arrays; Antennas; Communication satellites; Data handling; Global positioning system; Internet protocols; Navigation; Navigation systems; Position control; Satellites; Telemedicine; Tracking (position); Global Navigation Satellite Systems; High-precision position; Integer ambiguity resolution; L5 frequency; Navigation-satellite systems; Network observation; Quasi zenith satellite system; Single frequency networks; Satellite antennas; data processing; Galileo (spacecraft); GNSS; GPS; kinematics; precision; real time; resolution; satellite data",2-s2.0-85018942884

The work is principally focused on the estimation of leakage flow in the clearance disk between pump case and gears. Two main contributions are presented for the performance of the numerical simulation. On one hand, a contact point viscosity model is used for the simulation of solid-solid contact between gears in order to avoid the teeth tip leakage. On the other hand, a new boundary condition has been implemented for the gear mesh points motion in order to keep the mesh quality while moving gears with relative velocity. Arbitrary coupled mesh interface (ACMI) has been used both in the interface between clearance disk in inlet/outlet ports and between clearance disk and interteeth fluid domain. Although the main goal of the work is the development of the numerical method rather than the study of the physical analysis of the pump, results have been compared with experimental measurement and a good agreement in volumetric efficiency and pressure fluctuations has been found. Finally, the leakage flow in the clearance disk has been analyzed.

The approach is motivated by the fact that the more accurate description of the physics in the cDFT model is required only near the charged surfaces, while away from these regions the PNP equations provide an acceptable representation of the ionic system. We formulate the hybrid approach in two stages. The first stage defines a coupled hybrid model in which the PNP and cDFT equations act independently on two overlapping domains, subject to suitable interface coupling conditions. At the second stage we apply the principles of the alternating Schwarz method to the hybrid model by using the interface conditions to define the appropriate boundary conditions and volume constraints exchanged between the PNP and the cDFT subdomains. Numerical examples with two representative examples of ionic systems demonstrate the numerical properties of the method and its potential to reduce the computational cost of a full cDFT calculation, while retaining the accuracy of the latter near the charged surfaces. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Alternating Schwarz method; Charged fluids; Classical density functional theory; Hard sphere model; PNP",,2-s2.0-85026662101

In the sequel, two power control schemes are proposed to check the resultant interference level and increase the transmit power of the admitted D2D pairs group-by-group to further improve the system throughput. IF algorithm is based on the ordering statistics of the interference amounts from D2D transmitters to CUs, thus neither grid searching nor iteration is needed.

Such environments, for example domestic and multi-room offices, present challenging acoustic scenes to state-of-the-art speech recognizers, especially under always-listening operation, due to low signal-to-noise ratios, frequent overlaps of target speech, acoustic events, and background noise, as well as inter-room interference and reverberation. In addition, recognition of target commands often needs to be accompanied by their spatial localization, at least at the room level, to account for users in different rooms, providing command disambiguation and room-localized feedback. To address the above requirements, the use of parallel recognition pipelines is proposed, one per room of interest. The approach is enabled by a room-dependent speech activity detection module that employs appropriate multichannel features to determine speech segments and their room of origin, feeding them to the corresponding room-dependent pipelines for further processing. These consist of the traditional cascade of far-field spoken command detection and recognition, the former based on the detection of “activating” key-phrases. Robustness to the challenging environments is pursued by a number of multichannel combination and acoustic modeling techniques, thoroughly investigated in the paper. In particular, channel selection, beamforming, and decision fusion of single-channel results are considered, with the latter performing best. Additional gains are observed, when the employed acoustic models are trained on appropriately simulated reverberant and noisy speech data, and are channel-adapted to the target environments. Further issues investigated concern the inter-dependencies of the various system components, demonstrating the superiority of joint optimization of the component tunable parameters over their separate or sequential optimization. The proposed approach is developed for the Greek language, exhibiting promising performance in real recordings in a four-room apartment, as well as a two-room office. For example, in the latter, a 76.6% command recognition accuracy is achieved on a speaker-independent test, employing a 180-sentence decoding grammar.

Alterations in tear fluid rheology, differences in lipid composition, or downregulation of specific tear proteins are found in most types of ocular surface disease, including dry eye disease (DED). Artificial tears have long been a first line of treatment in DED and aim to replace or supplement tears. More recently, lipid-containing eye drops have been developed to more closely mimic the combination of aqueous and lipid layers of the TFLL.

While much research in IR has considered the effectiveness of IR systems, there is still a significant gap in the understanding of how users contribute to the effectiveness of these systems. The paper aims to contribute to this by studying how clinicians search for information. Multiple representations of an information need—from verbose patient case descriptions to ad-hoc queries—were considered in order to understand their effect on retrieval. Four clinicians provided queries and performed relevance assessment to form a test collection used in this study. The different query formulation strategies of each clinician, and their effectiveness, were investigated. The results show that query formulation had more impact on retrieval effectiveness than the particular retrieval systems used. The most effective queries were short, ad-hoc keyword queries. Different clinicians were observed to consistently adopt specific query formulation strategies. The most effective queriers were those who, given their information need, inferred novel keywords most likely to appear in relevant documents. This study reveals aspects of how people search within the clinical domain.

Therefore, adjusting the indoor temperature is not setting a value according to other value. There are many more factors to take into consideration, hence the traditional logic based in binary states cannot be used.

In IWSN, unlike other sensor networks, late arrival of packets or delay or disruption to an on-going communication are considered as critical failure. Also, because IWSN is deployed in the overcrowded industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band it is difficult to meet this unique QoS requirements due to stiff competition for bandwidth from other technologies operating in ISM band resulting in scarcity of spectrum for reliable communication and/or disruption of ongoing communication. However, cognitive radio (CR) provides more spectral opportunities through opportunistic-use of unused licensed spectrum while ensuring minimal interference to licensed users. Similarly, spectrum handoff, which is a new type of handoff in cognitive radio, has the potential to offer increase bandwidth, reliable, smooth and interference-free communication for IWSNs through opportunistic-use of spectrum, minimal switching-delays, and efficient target channel selection strategies as well as effective link recovery maintenance. As a result, a new paradigm known as cognitive radio industrial wireless sensor network (CR-IWSN) has become the interest of recent research efforts.

However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed. © 2017","Humanitarian logistics; Humanitarian supply chain management; Information technology; Supply chain management; Technology adoption; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology","Data mining; Information technology; Personnel training; Societies and institutions; Supply chain management; Behavioural intentions; Facilitating conditions; Humanitarian logistics; Personal innovativeness; Structural equation modelling; Technology adoption; Trust in technologies; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Engineering education",2-s2.0-85020840838

Existing pattern recognition and machine learning using EMG signals has several innate problems in gait subphase detection. With respect to time domain features, their feature values may be analogous because two different gait steps may have similar muscle activation. In addition, the current gait subphase might not be recognized until the next gait subphase passes because the window size needed for feature extraction is larger than the period of the gait subphase. The ESGM algorithm is a new approach that compares reference EMG signals and input EMG signals according to time variance to solve these problems and considers variations of physiological muscle activity. We also determined all the elements of the ESGM algorithm using kinematic gait analysis and optimized the algorithm using experiments. Therefore, the ESGM algorithm reflects better timing characteristics of EMG signals than the time domain feature extraction algorithm. In addition, it can provide real-time and user-adaptive recognition of the gait subphase by using only EMG signals. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed method is 13% better than existing methods and the average detection latency of the proposed method was 5.5 times lower than existing methods. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","EMG signal; EMG signal graph matching; Gait assistant robot; Gait subphase detection; Rehabilitation","Electromyography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Muscle; Patient rehabilitation; Pattern matching; Pattern recognition; Time domain analysis; Assistant robot; EMG signal; Kinematic gait analysis; Recognition methods; Sub-phase; Time domain feature extraction; Time domain features; Timing characteristics; Biomedical signal processing",2-s2.0-85019592914

TMW has commercial success in Europe, but it is in the early stages of market adoption in the United States. The main goal of this research was to identify the challenges and opportunities for TMW in the U.S. by investigating professional adopters' perceptions of various decking materials, including thermally modified wood. In-person and online surveys were conducted for this purpose. Participants perceived that the most favorable attributes of TMW are Durability, Environmental Performance, and Aesthetics. Professional users of decking materials also considered the Cost of TMW to be relatively high, but competitive with that of tropical hardwoods and wood-plastic composites.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose and develop an effective inertial-sensor-based system, worn by the user, along with a microprocessor and wireless module for communication with the robot at distances of up to 250 m. Possible features describing hand-gesture dynamics are introduced and their feasibility is demonstrated in an off-line scenario by using several classification methods (e.g., random forests and artificial neural networks). Refined motion features are then used in K-means unsupervised clustering for motion primitive extraction, which forms the motion strings used for real-time classification. The system demonstrated an F1 score of 90.05% with the possibility of gesture spotting and null class classification (e.g., undefined gestures were discarded from the analysis).

They can be used at home, or – if installed on a mobile device – in retail outlets or on the move. In all cases, augmented reality (AR) can support these purposes by placing virtual content (e.g. new furniture) in a real environment (the consumer's home). The overall perception and acceptance toward such interactive technologies are discussed in this paper. Users' perceptions and experiences are measured by applying a modified technology acceptance model (TAM). Four experiments, two with marker-based and two with markerless AR apps are presented to support the generalization of the results, the measurement models and the measurement approach. The results are satisfactory with regard to the robustness of the TAM model. However, the relative importance of hedonic (enjoyment, pleasure, fun) and utilitarian (information) aspects varies for different kinds of AR apps and has to be considered for improvement to occur.

The process of SA in emergency response systems is of utmost importance once the information acquired and inferred from human reports is used to support the deployment of tactics and resources to attend incidents. However, operators of such systems may face informational barriers leading to an erroneous SAW and consequently jeopardize the assessment process if they are not handled. One of such barriers in this context is the presence of low-quality data or information. Hence, a challenging issue in this field is to determine how to generate, score, update and represent data and information quality cues to support operators to reason under uncertainties and improve their understanding about an ongoing situation. The state of the art in this area presents a research gap regarding methodologies for the information quality assessment which can be used in the emergency management domain. Also, there is a lack of approaches that interface with different levels of situational information during an assessment routine. Hence, in order to enhance operators situational awareness, a new methodology is presented to improve the capabilities of SA systems by enriching knowledge about situations with reliable metadata. Such methodology, named Information Quality Assessment Methodology in the Context of Emergency situational awareness, is composed by: elicitation of data and information quality requirements; definition of functions and metrics to quantify quality dimensions, such as completeness, timeliness, consistency, relevance and uncertainty; and the representation of situational information by the instantiation of a situation model, which can be consumed by an ontology. Finally, a case study is addressed to verify the applicability of the methodology using data and information from a robbery event. The results obtained show situational models with qualified information that feed SA systems, enabling them to be aware of information quality. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Emergency management methodology; Information quality assessment; Information quality management; Situation assessment; Situational awareness","Civil defense; Decision making; Disasters; Quality management; Risk management; Emergency management; Information quality; Information quality assessment; Situation assessment; Situational awareness; Information analysis",2-s2.0-85032285822

The questionnaire included sixteen survey items based on attitude, social norms, trust, compatibility, and system effectiveness. 482 Participants from the United States (273 males and 209 females, age range: 18–71 years) responded to an online survey. A principal component analysis determined three subscales describing pedestrians’ receptivity toward FAVs: safety, interaction, and compatibility. This factor structure was verified by a confirmatory factor analysis and reliability of each subscale was confirmed (0.7 < Cronbach's alpha < 0.9). Regression analyses investigated associations with scenario-based responses to the three PRQF subscale scores. Pedestrians’ intention to cross the road in front of FAVs was significantly predicted by both safety and interaction scores, but not by the compatibility score. Accepting FAVs in the existing traffic system was predicted by all three subscale scores. Demographic influence on the receptivity revealed that males and younger respondents were more receptive toward FAVs. Similarly, those from urban areas and people with higher personal innovativeness showed higher receptivity. Finally, a significant effect of pedestrian behavior (as measured by the pedestrian behavior questionnaire) on receptivity is explored. People who show positive behavior believed that the addition of FAVs will improve overall traffic safety. Those who show higher violation, lapse and aggression scores, were found to feel more confident about crossing the road in front of a FAV.

Stop signs have been suggested as a low-cost option to improve safety at passive RLXs, as requiring drivers to stop should encourage safe behaviour. However, field observations have noted high rates of non-compliance at stop-controlled RLXs. To explore this further, we conducted an on-road study to identify factors that influence compliance at stop-controlled RLXs. Twenty-two drivers drove a 30.5 km route in rural Australia, encompassing three stop-controlled RLXs. In over half of all cases (59%) drivers stopped completely at the RLX; on 27% of crossings drivers executed a rolling stop, and on 14% of crossings drivers violated the stop controls. Rolling stops were defined as a continuous deceleration to <10 km/h, but remaining above 0 km/h, before accelerating to >10 km/h. Behavioural patterns, including visual checks and decision-making, were similar when comparing drivers who made complete versus rolling stops. Non-compliant drivers did not differ from compliant drivers in approach speeds, but spent less time visually checking for trains. Post-drive interviews revealed some drivers wilfully disregarded the stop sign, whereas others did not notice the stop sign. Those who intentionally violated noted trains were infrequent and suggested sight distance was good enough (even though all crossings had been formally assessed as having inadequate sight distance). Overall the results suggest most drivers exhibit safe behaviour at passive RLXs, but a notable minority disregard or fail to notice signs. Potential avenues for redesigning passive RLXs to improve safety are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Passive warnings; Rail level crossings; Rail road crossing; Stop signs","Decision making; Railroad crossings; Roads and streets; Transportation; Driver behaviour; Field observations; Level crossing; Non-compliance; On-road studies; Passive protection; Passive warnings; Sight distance; Traffic signs",2-s2.0-85029325399

Each model possesses physical features of appropriate size, and the soft tissues are also simulated. Rudimentary underlying bony structure is also present, because its purpose is only to provide support, enabling the mechanical response of the facial soft tissues when a facemask is applied to be realized.

A human response map to tactile input while sitting was determined experimentally. It shows the zones where humans can classify signals with a high success rate based on minimum Duration of Stimulus (DOS) (“on” periods) and “off” periods of the haptic signals. It was also shown experimentally that a human’s ability to recognize tactile patterns depends on the level of engagement required by the activity. This paper provides an approach to predict a human response map for various activities. The map during sitting is used to design the signals to send information to a human. Two types of signals are developed: sequence stimuli and digital codes. Sequence stimuli create an on/off rhythm for the vibration motors that humans can sense directly without a decoding process. Experiments show that humans can recognize 10 levels of sequence stimuli with a success rate greater than 80%. This class of signals is useful for applications where information must be repeated frequently, e.g., range information sent to a human parking a car. The second class of signals is digital codes, similar to Morse code, where a sequence of long and short motor DOS represents each code. The meaning of the signal is associated with a specific code. From 27 digital codes, experiments showed a successful recognition rate of 78.7%. An application for the digital code method is to pick specific menu items, based on the codes, for fast food restaurants. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.","Haptic; Haptic belt; Haptic wrist; Human computer interaction; Tactile; Tactons; Vibrotactile","Codes (symbols); Signaling; Haptic; Haptic wrist; Tactile; Tactons; Vibrotactile; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-85011876423

Nanogenerators capable of harvesting energy from human activities is considered as a promising alternative for powering the wearable electronic devices, considering the sustainability and rich biomechanical energy from human body. Currently, most of the nanogenerators are aimed at converting limited forms of mechanical energy, mostly pressing or bending, which hampers adaptive exploitation of bodily energy source. Also, the incapability to respond to multiple forms of mechanical stimuli deters the nanogenerators from functioning as full-range human activities sensors.

This paper aims to study the impact resistance of UHP-SFRC panels subjected to the aircraft engine. Firstly, a series of reduce-scaled engine model perforation test was conducted, in which the residual velocities of the engine missiles as well as the damage of both engine missile and target slab were derived and assessed. Then, a mesoscopic model of UHP-SFRC considering the random distribution, volumetric ratio, as well as the bonding and slipping effects of the fibers was established. By using the finite element program LS-DYNA and comparing with the macroscopic homogenous approach, the present test was better reproduced by the mesoscopic approach.

How to identify the key factors and comb through their interrelations to improve passenger comfort efficiently is a critical problem in cabin design. To solve this problem, a hybrid model is proposed to identify the key factors and discuss the interrelation between them based on the questionnaire data. First, factor analysis is conducted to segment complex influencing factors into groups and to extract the most important factors. Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method and fuzzy set theory are combined in the next analysis, considering both the interrelation between factors and the fuzziness of subjective comfort perception concurrently.

Protein human β2-microglobulin (HB2m) is classically associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis, but the single point mutant D76N was recently identified as the causative agent of a hereditary systemic amyloidosis affecting visceral organs. Here, we use D76N as a model system to explore the early stage of the aggregation mechanism of HB2m by means of an integrative approach framed on molecular simulations. Discrete molecular dynamics simulations of a structured-based model predict the existence of two intermediate states populating the folding landscape. The intermediate I1 features an unstructured C-terminus, while I2, which is exclusively populated by the mutant, exhibits two unstructured termini. Docking simulations indicate that I2 is the key species for aggregation at acidic and physiological pH contributing to rationalize the higher amyloidogenic potential of D76N relative to the wild-type protein and the ΔN6 variant. The analysis carried out here recapitulates the importance of the DE-loop in HB2m self-association at a neutral pH and predicts a leading role of the C-terminus and the adjacent G-strand in the dimerization process under acidic conditions.

The LH1 antenna of mesophilic species of phototrophic bacteria such as Rhodobacter (Rba.) sphaeroides does not possess such properties. We have engineered calcium-ion binding into the LH1 antenna of Rba. sphaeroides by progressively modifying the native LH1 polypeptides with sequences from Tch. tepidum. We show that acquisition of the C-terminal domains from LH1 α and β of Tch. tepidum is sufficient to activate calcium-ion binding and the extent of red-shifting increases with the proportion of Tch. tepidum sequence incorporated. However, full exchange of the LH1 polypeptides with those of Tch. tepidum results in misassembled core complexes. Isolated α and β polypeptides from our most successful mutant were reconstituted in vitro with BChl a to form an LH1-type complex, which was stabilised 3-fold by calcium-ions. Additionally, carotenoid specificity was changed from spheroidene found in Rba. sphaeroides to spirilloxanthin found in Tch. tepidum, with the latter enhancing in vitro formation of LH1. These data show that the C-terminal LH1 α/β domains of Tch. tepidum behave autonomously, and are able to transmit calcium-ion induced conformational changes to BChls bound to the rest of a foreign antenna complex. Thus, elements of foreign antenna complexes, such as calcium-ion binding and blue/red switching of absorption, can be ported into Rhodobacter sphaeroides using careful design processes. © 2017 The Author(s)","Antenna complex; Calcium-ion binding; Protein engineering; Reaction centre; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; Thermochromatium tepidum",,2-s2.0-85028349620

We meta-analyzed studies adopting the model to (a) examine the intercorrelations among illness representation dimensions, coping strategies, and illness outcomes; (b) test the sufficiency of a process model in which relations between illness representations and outcomes were mediated by coping strategies; and (c) test effects of moderators on model relations. Studies adopting the common-sense model in chronic illness (k = 254) were subjected to random-effects meta-analysis. The pattern of zero-order corrected correlations among illness representation dimensions (identity, consequences, timeline, perceived control, illness coherence, emotional representations), coping strategies (avoidance, cognitive reappraisal, emotion venting, problem-focused generic, problem-focused specific, seeking social support), and illness outcomes (disease state, distress, well-being, physical, role, and social functioning) was consistent with previous analyses. Meta-analytic path analyses supported a process model that included direct effects of illness representations on outcomes and indirect effects mediated by coping. Emotional representations and perceived control were consistently related to illness-related and functional outcomes via, respectively, lower and greater employment of coping strategies to deal with symptoms or manage treatment. Representations signaling threat (consequences, identity) had specific positive and negative indirect effects on outcomes through problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies. There was little evidence of moderation of model effects by study design, illness type and context, and study quality.

The mitochondrion acts as a storehouse for cytochrome c, the effector of apoptosis, and hence VDACs become intricately involved in the apoptotic pathway. Isoform 1 of VDAC is abundant in the outer mitochondrial membrane of many cell types, while isoform 2 is the preferred channel in specialized cells including brain and some cancer cells. The primary role of VDACs is metabolite flux. The pro- and anti-apoptotic role of VDAC1 and VDAC2, respectively, are secondary, and are influenced by external factors and interacting proteins. Herein, we focus on the less-studied VDAC2, and shed light on its unique functions and features. VDAC2, along with sharing many of its functions with VDAC1, such as metabolite and Ca2+ transport, also has many delineating functions. VDAC2 is closely engaged in the gametogenesis and steroidogenesis pathways and in protection from oxidative stress as well as in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and epilepsy. A closer examination of the functional pathways of VDACs indicates that the unique functions of VDAC2 are a result of the different interactome of this isoform. We couple functional differences to the structural and biophysical evidence obtained for the VDACs, and present a testament of why the two VDAC isoforms with &gt;90% sequence similarity, are functionally diverse. Based on these differences, we suggest that the VDAC isoforms now be considered as paralogs. An in-depth understanding of VDAC2 will help us to design better biomolecule targets for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2016 Cambridge Philosophical Society","apoptosis; interactome; isoforms; membrane protein; mitochondria; VDAC",,2-s2.0-84998772577

Physiological signals such as electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response and respiration were record from fourteen drives executed in a prescribed route at real drive environments. Features were widely extracted from time, spectral and wavelet multi-domains. In order to search for the optimal feature sets, Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined and adopted. Kernel-based classifiers were employed to improve the accuracy of stress detection task. Analysis I used features from 10 s intervals of data which were recorded during well-defined rest, highway and city driving conditions to discriminate three levels of diving stress achieving an averaging accuracy over 99% at per-drive level and 89% in cross-drive validation. Analysis II made continuous stress evaluation throughout a complete driving test attaining a high coincidence with the true road situation especially at the switching interval of traffic conditions. Experimental results reveal that different levels of driving stress can be characterized by specific set of physiological measures. These physiological measures could be applied to in-vehicle intelligent systems in various approaches to help the drivers better manage their negative driving status.

The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to provide a pooled prevalence estimate of bTB at a national level, assess the level of in-between variance among study reports and illustrate the spatial distribution pattern in the country. Articles published on bTB from January 2000 to December, 2016 in English language were included in the review. Pubmed, CAB direct, AJOL and Web of Science were the databases used in electronic search. A total of 127 articles were retrieved from online sources, of which 56 articles were selected for data extraction based on the specified inclusion criteria. From these selected published articles, 114 animal level data were extracted for quantitative analysis. A pooled prevalence estimate of bovine tuberculosis in Ethiopia was found to be 5.8% (95% CI: 4.5, 7.5). In a multivariable meta-regression analysis, breed and production system explained 40.9% of the explainable proportion of the in-between study variance computed. The prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in Holstein-Friesians, 21.6% (95% CI: 14.7–30.7), was higher than the prevalence in local zebus 4.1 (95% CI: 3.4–4.9). Cattle kept under intensive and semi-intensive production systems had higher prevalence, 16.6% (95% CI: 12.4–21.6), of bTB than those kept in extensive livestock production system, 4.6 (95% CI: 3.4–6.2). Bovine tuberculosis is widely distributed across major livestock producing regions of Ethiopia. However, no valid data could be retrieved from Benishanul-Gumuz, Harari and Dire Dawa. Data obtained on bTB from Somali and Gambella regional states are also few and further studies are suggested in these regions. In conclusion, this review showed that bTB in cattle in Ethiopia is widespread with high prevalence in intensive and semi-intensive management systsems that keep exotic breeds and their crosses in urban and peri-urban areas. Thus, it is suggested that the design and implementation of bTB control strategies in Ethiopia should prioritize these hotspots in order to reduce the impact of the disease on the growing dairy sector. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bovine tuberculosis; Breed; Cattle husbandry; Ethiopia; Geographic distribution","bovine tuberculosis; breed; control strategy; data base; data extraction; Ethiopia; livestock; Medline; nonhuman; prevalence; quantitative analysis; Review; systematic review; urban area; Web of Science; zebu",2-s2.0-85029819157

Convergence and communication complexity are the two key areas of concern when SBC is implemented using these overlays. Convergence guarantees accurate clustering but costs bandwidth because these systems rely on message passing to achieve convergence. In this work, we address the long tail problem, experienced by low in-degree nodes in a long tailed similarity distribution, such as power-law distribution and propose a new SBC approach, Optimum Benefit Protocol (OBP), that converges more rapidly than existing approaches and reduces the long tail. The proposed protocol only sends messages that could benefit the receiver, reducing bandwidth to one fifth of the default.

The potential benefits of these technologies, such as reduction in number of crashes, enhancing driver comfort or convenience, decreasing environmental impact, etc., have been acknowledged by transportation safety researchers and federal transportation agencies. Although these systems afford safety advantages, they may also challenge the traditional role of drivers in operating vehicles. Driver acceptance, therefore, is essential for the implementation of these systems into the transportation system. Recognizing the need for research into the factors affecting driver acceptance, this study assessed the utility of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) for modelling driver acceptance in terms of Behavioral Intention to use an ADAS. Each of these models propose a set of factors that influence acceptance of a technology. Data collection was done using two approaches: a driving simulator approach and an online survey approach. In both approaches, participants interacted with either a fatigue monitoring system or an adaptive cruise control system combined with a lane-keeping system. Based on their experience, participants responded to several survey questions to indicate their attitude toward using the ADAS and their perception of its usefulness, usability, etc. A sample of 430 surveys were collected for this study. Results found that all the models (TAM, TPB, and UTAUT) can explain driver acceptance with their proposed sets of factors, each explaining 71% or more of the variability in Behavioral Intention. Among the models, TAM was found to perform the best in modelling driver acceptance followed by TPB. The findings of this study confirm that these models can be applied to ADAS technologies and that they provide a basis for understanding driver acceptance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Driver acceptability; Driver attitude; Driver behavior; Intelligent transport systems; Vehicle automation","Adaptive control systems; Adaptive cruise control; Automobile drivers; Behavioral research; Computer control; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Highway accidents; Intelligent systems; Surveys; Traffic control; Transportation; Driver acceptability; Driver attitude; Driver behavior; Intelligent transport systems; Vehicle automations; Advanced driver assistance systems",2-s2.0-85029804273

Four different PDMS formulations with moduli ranging from 64 to 2120 kPa were used in the experiment program to cover a wide range of modulus normalized loads. The deformation of the contact surface and depth of penetration versus normalized load were measured.

However, to date, progress in this area has been surprisingly slow. Furthermore, the majority of the attempts at successful commercialization have failed, often in the face of consumer ambivalence over the perceived benefits/utility. In this review, with the focus squarely on the domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), we summarize the state-of-the-art in the area. We highlight the key possibilities and pitfalls as far as stimulating the so-called ‘lower’ senses of taste, smell, and the trigeminal system are concerned. Ultimately, we suggest that mixed reality solutions are currently the most plausible as far as delivering (or rather modulating) flavour experiences digitally is concerned. The key problems with digital fragrance delivery are related to attention and attribution. People often fail to detect fragrances when they are concentrating on something else; And even when they detect that their chemical senses have been stimulated, there is always a danger that they attribute their experience (e.g., pleasure) to one of the other senses – this is what we call ‘the fundamental attribution error’. We conclude with an outlook on digitizing the chemical senses and summarize a set of open-ended questions that the HCI community has to address in future explorations of smell and taste as interaction modalities © 2017","Augmented reality; Chemical senses; Crossmodal; Mixed reality; Smell; Taste; Trigeminal; Virtual reality","Augmented reality; Odors; Virtual reality; Chemical sense; Cross-modal; Mixed reality; Smell; Taste; Trigeminal; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-85021165293

Using a motion-based driving simulator, drivers encountered different situations in which a partially automated vehicle could no longer safely keep the lateral guidance. Drivers were distracted by a non-driving related task on a touch display or driving without an additional secondary task. While driving in partially automated mode drivers could either take their hands off the steering wheel for only a short period of time (10 s, so-called ‘Hands-on’ variant) or for an extended period of time (120 s, so-called ‘Hands-off’ variant). When the system limit was reached (e.g., when entering a work zone with temporary lines), the lateral vehicle control by the automation was suddenly discontinued and a take-over request was issued to the drivers. Regardless of the hands-off interval and the availability of a secondary task, all drivers managed the transition to manual driving safely. No lane exceedances were observed and the situations were rated as ‘harmless’ by the drivers. The lack of difference between the hands-off intervals can be partly attributed to the fact that most of the drivers kept contact to the steering wheel, even in the hands-off condition. Although all drivers were able to control the system limits, most of them could not explain why exactly the take-over request was issued. The average helpfulness of the take-over request was rated on an intermediate level. Consequently, providing drivers with information about the reason for a system limit can be recommended. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automated driving; Controllability; Lateral scenarios; Partial automation","Automation; Automobile drivers; Control system synthesis; Controllability; Steering; Wheels; Automated driving; Automated vehicles; Driver performance; Driving performance; Driving simulator; Intermediate level; Lateral scenarios; Partial automation; Automobile steering equipment",2-s2.0-85028699543

Mobile health (mHealth) might be a novel avenue to strengthen prevention efforts for child anxiety, since program effects are generally small. However, although a significant number of mHealth tools have been developed, few have been evaluated in terms of usability (or even clinical effectiveness). Usability testing is the first level of evaluation in responsible mHealth efforts as it is one of the main barriers to usage and adoption. As such, the objective of this research was to evaluate the usability of a smartphone application (app) corresponding to an indicated prevention and early intervention targeting youth anxiety. To accomplish this, 132 children (Mage = 9.65, 63% girls) and 45 service providers (Mage = 29.13, 87% female) rated our app along five established dimensions of usability (ease of use, ease of learning, quality of support information, satisfaction, and stigma). Findings showed that the app was highly and positively rated by youth and providers, with some variations (lower ratings when errors occurred). Path analyses also showed that system understanding was significantly related to greater system satisfaction, but that such relation occurred through the quality of support information offered by the app. Together, this has research and clinical implications as it highlights avenues for advancing youth care via mHealth usability evaluation, including prior to establishing effectiveness. © 2017","anxiety; child; prevention; smartphone; usability","adult; anxiety disorder; application service provider; Article; child; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; clinical research; early intervention; female; health care quality; human; juvenile; male; mobile application; path analysis; patient satisfaction; preventive health service; priority journal; prophylaxis; stigma; total quality management",2-s2.0-85010931999

However, for nanocelluloses to move beyond solely an academic interest, a thorough understanding of their interaction with water-soluble polymers is needed. In this work, we address a conflicting trend in literature that suggests polyethylene glycol (PEG) adsorbs to CNC surfaces by comparing the adsorption behaviour of PEG with CNCs versus fumed silica. While PEG is known to have strong hydrogen bonding tendencies and holds water tightly, it is sometimes (we believe erroneously) presumed that PEG binds to cellulose through hydrogen bonding in aqueous media. To test this assumption, the adsorption of PEG to CNCs and fumed silica (both in the form of particle films and in aqueous dispersions) was examined using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, isothermal titration calorimetry, rheology and dynamic light scattering. For all PEG molecular weights (300–10,000 g/mol) and concentrations (100–10,000 ppm) tested, strong rapid adsorption was found with fumed silica, whereas no adsorption to CNCs was observed. We conclude that unlike silanols, the hydroxyl groups on the surface of CNCs do not readily hydrogen bond with the ether oxygen in the PEG backbone. As such, this work along with previous papermaking literature supports the opinion that PEG does not adsorb to cellulose surfaces. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adsorption phenomena; Cellulose nanocrystals; Fumed silica; Polyethylene glycol; QCM-D","Adsorption; Cellulose; Cellulose derivatives; Hydrogen bonds; Light scattering; Nanocrystals; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylenes; Quartz crystal microbalances; Silica; Adsorption phenomena; Cellulose nano-crystals; Cellulose nanocrystal (CNCs); Cellulose nanofibrils; Fumed silicas; Isothermal titration calorimetry; Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation; Watersoluble polymers; Produced Water; Adsorption; Cellulose; Polyethylene Glycol; Silica; Surfaces",2-s2.0-85028978391

Among the causes of bicycle accidents, the loss of control due to inadequate handlebar control is a particularly common one. So, investigation of handlebar controllability (HC) is an important part in finding ways to deal with this type of accident. In this study, HC was examined considering the effect of pavement roughness level and the interaction effects of Age and Gender. The results showed that cyclist’s HC was negatively affected by pavement roughness level. The examination ofthe interaction effect of cyclists’ age on the correlation between HC and pavement roughness level indicated that elderly cyclists generally suffer more from the effect of pavement roughness on their HC, compared to younger ones. Especially, as they get older, the effect of pavement roughness on their HC even becomes greater. The interaction effect of Gender was found not to be significant. The results of this study could help in proposing countermeasures to deal with accidents resulting from loss of control and it may also serve as a basis for further studies on the potential field of HC. © 2017, Aracne Ed.

They are easily recognized across cultures and suitable for various applications. In this paper, we use deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), state-of-the-art in the field of sketch recognition, to address several applications of automatic sketch processing: complete and partial sketch recognition, sketch retrieval using query-by-example (QbE), and sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) i.e the retrieval of images using a QbE paradigm but where the query is a sketch. We first focus on improving sketch recognition. For this purpose we compare different ConvNet architectures, training paradigms and data fusion schemes. This enabled us to outperform previous state-of-the-art in two large scale benchmarks for sketch classification. We achieved a mean average accuracy of 79.18% for the TU-Berlin sketch benchmark and 93.02% for the sketchy database. For partial sketch recognition, we were able to produce a system that achieves a mean average accuracy of 52.58% with only 40% of the strokes. We then conduct a comprehensive study of ConvNets features to enhance sketch retrieval and image retrieval, using a kNN similarity search paradigm in the ConvNet feature space. For the sketch retrieval tasks, we compare the performance obtained with features extracted from various depths (ConvNet layers) using one of the best performing model from the previous work. For the sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), a sketch query is used to retrieve images of objects that belong to the same category, or even with a shape and pose close to the sketch query. The main challenge in the field of SBIR is to obtain efficient cross-domain features for sketch-image similarity measure. For this, besides comparing features extracted from different depth, we additionally compare different training approaches (some novel) for the ConvNets applied to sketches and images. Eventually, our best SBIR system achieves state-of-the-art results on the sketchy database (close to 40% recall at k = 1). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Sketch recognition; Sketch retrieval; Sketch-based image retrieval","Data fusion; Deep neural networks; Image processing; Neural networks; Query processing; Convolutional neural network; Image similarity; Query-by example; Similarity search; Sketch recognition; Sketch retrieval; Sketch-based image retrievals; State of the art; Image retrieval",2-s2.0-85019681009

Shangri–La is a medical retrieval system that can potentially help clinicians to make decisions on difficult cases. It retrieves articles from the biomedical literature when querying a case description and attached images. The system is based on a multimodal retrieval approach with a focus on the integration of visual information connected to text. The approach includes a query–adaptive multimodal fusion criterion that analyses if visual features are suitable to be fused with text for the retrieval. Furthermore, image modality information is integrated in the retrieval step. The approach is evaluated using the ImageCLEFmed 2013 medical retrieval benchmark and can thus be compared to other approaches.

To support this, a hybrid approach incorporating gaze control criteria and perceptual measurements for social cues is applied to the robot. For the perception part, representative non-verbal behaviors indicating human-interaction intent are designed based on the psychological analysis of human-human interaction, and these behavioral features are quantitatively measured by core perceptual components including visual, auditory, and spatial modalities. In addition, each aspect of recognition performance is improved through temporal confidence reasoning as a post-processing step. On the other hand, two factors of the physical space and conversational intimacy are tactically applied to the model calculation as a way of strengthening social gaze control effect of the robot. Interaction experiments with performance evaluation are given to verify that the proposed model is suitable to assess intended behaviors of individuals and perform gaze behavior about multiple persons.

In vitro and in vivo skin permeation and retention were studied using porcine abdominal skin and mice skin using the Franz diffusion cell. Skin distribution and cellular uptake of LCN and CHI-LCN were also investigated. The particle size and surface charge were 244.9 ± 2.1 nm and −19.2 ± 1.1 mV, respectively, for LCNs and 300.0 ± 7.6 nm and 24.7 ± 2.4 mV, respectively, for CHI-LCN. The permeation of 5α-reductase inhibitors was significantly greater with CHI-LCN compared with LCN, whereas there was no significant difference observed in the skin distribution. In fluorescence studies, fluorescence intensity was higher for CHI-LCNs throughout the skin, whereas more intense fluorescence was seen only in the epidermis layer for LCN. CHI-LCN showed greater cellular uptake than LCN, resulting in internalization of 98.5 ± 1.9% of nanoparticles into human keratinocyte cells.

Using parent peptide aurein 2.2, we designed a peptide array (∼100 peptides) with single and multiple W and R mutations and identified antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). These novel AMPs were conjugated to hyperbranched polyglycerols (HPGs) of different molecular weights and number of peptides to improve their antimicrobial activity and toxicity. The cell and blood compatibility studies of these conjugates demonstrated better properties than those of the AMP alone. However, conjugates showed lower antimicrobial activity in comparison to that of peptides, as determined from minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against S. aureus, but considerably better than that of the available polymer-AMP conjugates in the literature. In addition to measuring MICs and characterizing the biocompatibility, circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to investigate the interaction of the novel conjugates with model bacterial biomembranes. Moreover, the novel conjugates were exposed to trypsin to evaluate their stability. It was found that the conjugates resist proteolysis in comparison with unprotected peptides. The peptide conjugates were active in serum and whole blood. Overall, the results show that combining a highly active AMP and low-molecular-weight HPG yields bioconjugates with excellent biocompatibility, MICs below 100 μg/mL, and proteolytic stability, which could potentially improve its utility for in vivo applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","antimicrobial peptide-polymer conjugates; aurein peptides; biocompatibility; bioconjugation; Hyperbranched polyglycerol; proteolysis","Bacteria; Biocompatibility; Biomaterials; Blood; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Dendrimers; Dichroism; Microorganisms; Microwave integrated circuits; Molecular weight; Organic polymers; Polymers; Polypeptides; Proteolysis; Anti-microbial activity; Bio-conjugation; Hyperbranched polyglycerol; Hyperbranched polyglycerols; Inhibition concentrations; Polymer conjugate; Polymer molecular weight; Staphylococcus aureus; Peptides",2-s2.0-85032668153

Although routing flexibility enables the proposed zone-picking network to be free of the problems caused by the fixed-sequence-route constraint in a sequential zone-picking line, it incurs a new problem – tote dispatching. This problem and another problem – order selection – both affect the performance of the proposed zone-picking network. In this paper, we study both problems and propose different methods (ranging from simple rules to complicated rules) for them. Computer simulations are conducted to understand the Total System Time (TST) performance of every individual rule and the mutual effects between tote-dispatching rules and order-selection rules. A smaller TST means the system can complete picking tasks with less time. Two environmental factors – order size and system workload – are considered in simulations. The analysis of simulation results shows because of its routing flexibility the proposed zone-picking network outperforms the sequential zone-picking line regardless of whichever flexible-routing tote-dispatching rule is used. Furthermore, the dispatching rule that lets orders begin their next picking operations as early as possible and the order-selection rule that considers the number of zone-visitation coincidences between the selected order and the orders currently in the system and the picking time of the selected order are the best dispatching rule and order-selection rule respectively. Finally, the analysis of simulation results indicates both environmental factors significantly affect the system's order-picking performance. For the order-size factor, it is found a greater order size leads to a greater TST. For the system-workload factor, it is found underload and overload can both lead to the poor TST performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Distribution center; Order picking; Order selection; Sequential zone-picking line; Tote dispatching; Zone-picking network","Electric load dispatching; Distribution centers; Order picking; Order selection; Tote dispatching; Zone pickings; Network routing",2-s2.0-85029810097

This study was aimed at systematically examining such relationships using four salts of diphenhydramine (DPH), a first-generation H-receptor antagonist, i.e., hydrochloride (DPH-HCl), citrate (DPH-Cit), saccharinate (DPH-Sac), and acesulfamate (DPH-Acs). The conformation and intermolecular interactions of DPH as well as crystal packing in the four salts were considerably different. Both the energy framework and visualization of the crystal structure revealed the greatest plasticity of DPH-Acs, which was characterized by drastically different intermolecular interactions in orthogonal directions. This was consistent with its facile bending behavior and the lowest hardness. The most plastic DPH-Acs also exhibited the best tabletability, which was accompanied by greater compressibility and compactibility as well as smaller elastic recovery than the other three salts. Among the three hard brittle DPH salts, higher crystal hardness corresponded to poorer tabletability.

High pH (10.0) inhibited microsphere formation, yielding small and inhomogeneous microspheres. Compared to neutral pH, low pH also increased the content of silk crystalline β-sheet structure from approx. 30% to above 40%. As a result, the microspheres produced at low pH were more thermally stable as well as resistant to chemical (8 M urea) and enzymatic (protease XIV) degradation when compared to microspheres prepared at neutral pH.

The technology acceptance model, which considers perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived playfulness, was extended by integrating perceived interaction (i.e., learner-instructor interaction and learner-system interaction) and then analyzing the effects of these perceptions on satisfaction and continued use. Data were collected from 150 participants (rehabilitation therapists, medical paraprofessionals, and parents of children with developmental delay) recruited from a single medical center in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling and partial-least-squares techniques were used to evaluate relationships within the model. The modeling results indicated that both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were positively associated with both learner-instructor interaction and learner-system interaction. However, perceived playfulness only had a positive association with learner-system interaction and not with learner-instructor interaction.

To address this problem, we have developed transformation heuristics that, starting with an ideal formal specification, guide its conversion into an animatable form.

For this study, an LSD outbreak was defined as the occurrence of at least one LSD case in a specified geographical area. An observational study was conducted on a total of 2053 (1304 vaccinated and 749 unvaccinated) cattle in 339 infected herds located in 10 sub-kebeles and a questionnaire survey was administered to 224 herd owners. Over 60% of the herd owners reported that the vaccine has a low to very low effect in protecting animals against clinical LSD; almost all of them indicated that the vaccine did not induce any adverse reactions. In the unvaccinated group of animals 31.1% were diagnosed with LSD while this was 22.5% in the vaccinated group (P < 0.001). Severity of the disease was significantly reduced in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49; 0.96). Unvaccinated infected animals were more likely (predicted fraction = 0.89) to develop moderate and severe disease than vaccinated infected animals (predicted fraction = 0.84). LSD vaccine efficacy for susceptibility was estimated to be 0.46 (i.e. a susceptibility effect of 0.54) while the infectiousness effect of the vaccine was 1.83. In other words, the vaccine reduces the susceptibility by a factor of two and increases infectiousness by approximately the same amount. LSD transmission occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated animals, the estimated reproduction ratio (R) was 1.21 in unvaccinated animals compared to 1.19 in vaccinated ones, and not significantly different. In conclusion, KS1 O-180 vaccination, as applied currently in Ethiopia, has poor efficacy in protecting cattle populations against LSD, neither by direct clinical protection nor by reducing transmission, and this signifies the urgent need to either improve the quality of the vaccine or to develop potent alternative vaccines that will confer good protection against LSD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Capripoxvirus; Kenyan sheep pox (KS1 O-180) vaccine; Lumpy skin disease; Reproduction ratio; Severity; Vaccine efficacy","Kenyan sheep pox virus strain vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; Article; bovine; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug sensitivity; Ethiopia; female; field study; follow up; infection control; infection prevention; lumpy skin disease; Lumpy skin disease virus; male; nonhuman; observational study; prospective study; skin nodule; unspecified side effect; vaccination; veterinary clinic; virus transmission",2-s2.0-85028572308

Five reinforced concrete beam–anchorage specimens designed to undergo bond failure were exposed to corrosion at one of the anchorage zones by accelerated corrosion. Two additional beams without exposure to corrosion were included as reference specimens. The corroded beams were subjected to four variable periods of corrosion, leading to four levels of steel mass loss (5%, 10%, 20% and 30%). After these corrosion periods, all seven beams were tested to assess their bond performance using a four-point load setup. The beams were continuously monitored by attached acoustic emission sensors throughout the four-point load test until bond failure. The analysis of acquired acoustic emission signals from bond testing was performed to detect early stages of bond damage. Further analysis was executed on signal strength of acoustic emission signals, which used cumulative signal strength, historic index (H(t)) and severity (Sr) to characterize the bond degradation in all beams. This analysis allowed early identification of three stages of damage, namely, first crack, initial slip and anchorage cracking, before their visual observation, irrespective of corrosion level or sensor location. Higher corrosion levels yielded significant reduction in both bond strength and corresponding acoustic emission parameters. The results of acoustic emission parameters (H(t) and Sr) enabled the development of a damage classification chart to identify different stages of bond deterioration. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Acoustic emission monitoring; ageing concrete structures; beams; bond strength; reinforcing steel corrosion","Anchorage zones; Anchorages (foundations); Bond strength (materials); Concrete beams and girders; Concretes; Corrosion; Cracks; Damage detection; Electron emission; Reinforced concrete; Acoustic emission monitoring; Acoustic emission sensors; Acoustic emission signal; beams; Corroded reinforced concrete beams; Experimental investigations; Reinforced concrete beams; Reinforcing steels; Acoustic emission testing",2-s2.0-85031276526

Further, extensive new results are reported on the isotherm contours and average Nusselt numbers of confined contaminated bubbles in the range of conditions: Reynolds number, Re: 0.1 to 200; Prandtl number, Pr: 1 to 1000; power-law index, n: 0.2 to 1.6 and stagnant cap angle, α: 0 to 180°.

At Re ≤ 1 and Pr ≤ 10, the average Nusselt number is almost independent of power-law indices and the stagnant cap angle. For Pe > 10, regardless of values of the confinement ratio and Reynolds number, for α ≥ 60 the average Nusselt number decreases with an increasing stagnant cap angle whereas for α < 60 the effect of contamination is found to be insignificant.

In order to minimize Jacobian factorizations, the inexact Newton algorithm combined with the sparse Cholesky matrix factorization (INC) is suggested with an unbalance-independent relation for the determination of a forcing term in the INC. Further, some shared memory parallel computing techniques are incorporated into the state transformation procedures developed previously (parallel state transformation procedure) and the matrix factorization (parallelized factorization) for full utilization of the resources of an ordinary personal computer. All the algorithms are integrated in a finite element program specialized in time history analysis of aseismic supertall building structures, with some features from OpenSees. Computational efficiency, as well as accuracy, of the proposed speedup algorithms is demonstrated on one 12-story reinforced concrete frame (K1) and 4 frame-core-tube supertall buildings (S1–S4). The results from the demonstration indicate that, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the proportion of time consumed in Jacobian factorization becomes relatively more dominant. The combination of the INC and the parallelized factorization can achieve better acceleration performance in this case. Factors associated with the forcing term of the INC have much influence on computational efficiency and should be selected based on building scale. Combination of all the algorithms in the biggest model (S4) yields an average of 28.72 of acceleration ratio even with peak ground acceleration equal to 3.2 g. In all cases considered, a desirable agreement in structural response is always reached between conventional time history analysis method and the method using the proposed speedup algorithms.

Poroelastic Road Surface (PERS) is a novel type of pavement surface, which recycles tire rubber into low-noise pavements. This study aims to explore the suitability of PERS for urban roads in cold regions. Both laboratory tests and numerical simulations were conducted to characterize the mechanical and functional performances of PERS using a conventional porous asphalt (PA) as reference. The results indicated that the tensile strength reserve, which is the difference between the average tensile strength and the cooling-related tensile stress at a certain temperature, of PERS is higher than that of the PA at low temperature, while the ultimate tensile strain of the PERS is much larger than PA. The sound absorption coefficients of PERS have higher and wider peak compared with PA, indicating better noise absorption performance. The pavement with PA surface is more prone to surface cracks due to large tensile stresses at some specific offset locations from the loads, which do not exist in PERS. The deformation of the ice layer on top the PERS layer is larger than that on top of the PA layer at the same temperature, and the maximum horizontal strain of the PERS layer is larger than that of the PA. These findings prove the suitability of PERS for urban roads in cold regions, which can lead to significant economic and social benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic properties; Cold region; De-icing system; Low temperature cracking; Poroelastic road surface","Acoustic noise; Acoustic properties; Acoustic wave absorption; Cracks; Pavements; Roads and streets; Scrap metal reprocessing; Sound insulating materials; Surface defects; Temperature; Tensile strength; Tensile stress; Transportation; Cold regions; Economic and social benefits; Functional performance; Horizontal strain; Low noise pavements; Low temperature cracking; Poroelastic road surfaces; Sound absorption coefficients; Tensile strain",2-s2.0-85028296955

Several techniques to automatically generate parallel programs from high-level parallel languages or sequential codes have been proposed. To properly exploit the scalability of HPC clusters, these techniques should take into account the combination of data communication across distributed memory, and the exploitation of shared-memory models. In this paper, we present a new communication calculation technique to be applied across different SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) code blocks, containing several uniform data access expressions. We have implemented this technique in Trasgo, a programming model and compilation framework that transforms parallel programs from a high-level parallel specification that deals with parallelism in a unified, abstract, and portable way. The proposed technique computes at runtime exact coarse-grained communications for distributed message-passing processes. Applying this technique at runtime has the advantage of being independent of compile-time decisions, such as the tile size chosen for each process. Our approach allows the automatic generation of pre-compiled multi-level parallel routines, libraries, or programs that can adapt their communication, synchronization, and optimization structures to the target system, even when computing nodes have different capabilities. Our experimental results show that, despite our runtime calculation, our approach can automatically produce efficient programs compared with MPI reference codes, and with codes generated with auto-parallelizing compilers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed communications; Parallel programming; SPMD models; Trasgo","Codes (symbols); Memory architecture; Message passing; Parallel programming; Program compilers; Structural optimization; Ad-hoc communication; Calculation techniques; Distributed communications; High performance computing systems; Message passing process; Single program multiple data; SPMD model; Trasgo; High level languages",2-s2.0-85028928076

Previous work, namely sequential pattern mining on the cloud (SPAMC), has already addressed the scalability problem. It supports the MapReduce cloud computing architecture for mining frequent sequential patterns on large datasets. However, this existing algorithm does not address the iterative mining problem, which is the problem that reloading data incur additional costs. Furthermore, it did not study the load balancing problem. To remedy these problems, we devised a powerful sequential pattern mining algorithm, the sequential pattern mining in the cloud-uniform distributed lexical sequence tree algorithm (SPAMC-UDLT), exploiting MapReduce and streaming processes. SPAMC-UDLT dramatically improves overall performance without launching multiple MapReduce rounds and provides perfect load balancing across machines in the cloud. The results show that SPAMC-UDLT can significantly reduce execution time, achieves extremely high scalability, and provides much better load balancing than existing algorithms in the cloud. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.","Big data; Cloud computing; Data mining; MapReduce; Sequential pattern mining; Streaming MapReduce",,2-s2.0-85015613838

Numerous experimental, modeling, and simulation based works have been done on this new FET with bulk materials for various geometries until now. On the other hand, the two-dimensional layered material is considered as an alternative to current Si technology because of its ultra-thin body and high mobility. Very recently few simulation based works have been done on monolayer molybdenum disulfide based JLFET mainly to show the advantage of JLFET over conventional FET. However, no comprehensive simulation-based work has been done for double gate JLFET keeping in mind the prominent transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) to the authors’ best knowledge. In this work, we have studied quantum ballistic drain current-gate voltage characteristics of such FETs within non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) framework. Our simulation results reveal that all these TMDC materials are viable options for implementing state of the art Junctionless MOSFET with emphasis on their performance at short gate lengths.

The impact of charge neutral biomolecules on the electrical characteristics of the biosensor has been analyzed under dry environment situation. Our study shows that these materials could provide high sensitivity in the sub-threshold region as a channel material in nano-biosensor, a trend demonstrated by silicon on insulator FET sensor in the literature.

An emerging approach to overcome this challenge is the application of service-oriented architecture. Over the last few years, Rich Services, which is a type of service-oriented architecture, has emerged as an excellent technique for facilitating integration of services in the large-scale systems. In this paper, inspired by the notion of Rich Services, we propose the Rich Device-Services approach to enable a scalable and dynamic integration of heterogeneous devices in IoT.

Overcrowding has negatively impacted conservation of the natural and cultural heritage of the beaches, and has increased human pressure, leading to an increase in geomorphological susceptibility. The resulting reduction in geomorphological resilience has had a negative impact on beach facilities.

Human serum albumin (HSA), a regulator of metal and protein transportation, can modulate metal-Aβ interactions and Aβ aggregation in human fluid; however, the molecular mechanisms for such activities remain unclear. Herein, we report the molecular-level complexation between Zn(II), Cu(II), Aβ, and HSA, which is able to alter the aggregation and cytotoxicity of Aβ peptides and induce their cellular transportation. In addition, a single Aβ monomer-bound HSA is observed with the structural change of Aβ from a random coil to an α-helix. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies indicate that Aβ-HSA complexation causes no structural variation of HSA in solution. Conversely, ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) results present that Aβ prevents the shrinkage of the V-shaped groove of HSA in the gas phase. Consequently, for the first time, HSA is demonstrated to predominantly capture a single Aβ monomer at the groove using the phase transfer of a protein heterodimer from solution to the gas phase. Moreover, HSA sequesters Zn(II) and Cu(II) from Aβ while maintaining Aβ-HSA interaction. Therefore, HSA is capable of controlling metal-free and metal-bound Aβ aggregation and aiding the cellular transportation of Aβ via Aβ-HSA complexation. The overall results and observations regarding HSA, Aβ, and metal ions advance our knowledge of how protein-protein interactions associated with Aβ and metal ions could be linked to AD pathogenesis. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Body fluids; Copper compounds; Gases; Glycoproteins; Mass spectrometry; Metal ions; Metals; Monomers; Neurodegenerative diseases; X ray scattering; Zinc; Zinc compounds; Alzheimer's disease; Extracellular region; Human serum albumins; Ion mobility-mass spectrometry; Molecular insights; Molecular mechanism; Protein-protein interactions; Structural variations; Proteins",2-s2.0-85032628332

Objectives To compare acceptance rates of alerts generated by the SafeRx® prescription CDSS among different alert types and departments in a tertiary care hospital, identify factors associated with alert acceptance, and determine whether alert overrides were justified. Methods In a retrospective study, we compared acceptance rates of all prescription alerts generated in 2013 in 18 departments of Israel's largest tertiary care center. In a prospective study in 2 internal medicine departments, we collected data on factors potentially associated with alert override, and an expert panel evaluated the justification for each overridden alert. We used multivariate analyses to examine the association between patient and physician-related factors and alert acceptance. Results In the retrospective study, of 390,841 prescriptions, 37.1% triggered at least one alert, 5.3% of which were accepted. Acceptance rates ranged from 7.9% for excessive dose alerts to 4.0% for duplicate drug and major drug-drug interactions alerts (p &lt; 0.001). In the prospective study, common reasons for alert overriding included “irrelevance to the specific condition” and “medication previously tolerated by the patient”. Weekend shifts (incident rate ratio [IRR] = 1.50 [95% CI, 1.01–2.22]) and a specific department (IRR = 1.87 [1.23–2.87]) were associated with higher alert acceptance, while night shift (IRR = 0.47 [0.26–0.85]) was associated with alert override. Most alert overrides (88.6%) were judged justified. Conclusions The vast majority of SafeRx® alerts are overridden, and overriding is justified in most cases. Minimizing the number of alerts is essential to reduce the likelihood of developing “alert fatigue”.

In this study, rheological performance, i.e., flowability, minislump, setting time, bleeding capacity; mechanical properties, i.e., flexural strength, compressive strength, shear bonding strength, and shrinkage; and impermeability of cement-based grouts containing 60% GGBFS, 60% FA, or 20% GGBF + 50% FA were investigated. The fluidity, spreading ability, and stability of grouts were also studied in the presence of a superplasticizer (SP) by itself and in combination with an antiwashout agent (AWA). The range of the water-solid ratio was 0.4-1.2, and the curing durations were 28, 91, and, in a few cases, 182 days.

The results showed that lower ethanol volume, lower pH, greater water volume, and higher PEG molecular weight led to faster sol–gel reaction rate with shorter gelation time, with pH and water volume being the most influential amongst these factors. The evolution during the fast sol–gel process was also investigated based on the infrared (IR) spectrum. The results indicated that the fast sol–gel process occurred due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between hydrolysates of Ti alkoxides and the bi-template. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements, revealing high crystallinity with small crystallite size and large specific surface area. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Evolution mechanism; Fast sol–gel; Mesoporous TiO2; Zeta potential","Crystallite size; Gelation; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen bonds; Mesoporous materials; Molecular weight; Polyethylenes; Reaction rates; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium dioxide; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; Zeta potential; Desorption measurements; Evolution mechanism; High crystallinity; Intermolecular hydrogen bonding; Large specific surface areas; Mesoporous TiO; Two-step calcination; Zeta potential measurements; Sols",2-s2.0-85020745746

Among the several types of alarms to alert the driver of an imminent collision, those most used concerning the auditory and the visual stimulus. However, it is unclear whether is more effective an audio or a visual warning. In addition, no study compared the effects on drivers’ behavior induced by an acoustic and a visual directional warning. The main objective of the present study was to assess, in response to a potential conflict event at the intersections, the effects of directional auditory and visual warnings on driving performance. A driving simulator experiment was carried out to collect drivers’ behavior in response to a vehicle that failed to stop at the intersection. The parameters reaction time and speed reduction time were used for the evaluation of the effects on driving performance. These duration variables were modeled following the survival analysis, by the use of the accelerated failure time duration model with a Weibull distribution. Results showed that when the directional warning system (auditory or visual) was present, the drivers were able to detect earlier the violator vehicle. This effect led to a more comfortable braking maneuver and, thus, less possibilities of an unexpected maneuver for the following vehicle, avoiding the car – following collisions. The effectiveness of ICWSs was more evident for the directional auditory speech message; for this condition, in fact, the lower reaction time and the longer speed reduction time were obtained. The outcomes of the present study provide useful suggestions about the most effective collision warning systems that the automotive industry should develop and equip on vehicles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Driver behavior; Driving simulator; Intersection collision warning system; Survival analysis","Alarm systems; Automobile drivers; Automobile simulators; Automotive industry; Bioinformatics; Vehicles; Weibull distribution; Collision warning system; Driver behavior; Driving performance; Driving simulator; Following vehicle; Intersection collision warning systems; Potential conflict; Survival analysis; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85030787649

These were used to form a flexible sensor for electronic skin applications, which involved vertically laminated sensors that utilize different sensing principles, thus enabling the realization of a flexible bimodal sensor with negligible interference. The pressure sensor with low resistivity and a flexible electrode, which was implemented using the sophisticated synthesis method, performed well under low-voltage (0.5 mV) operation conditions, exhibited pressure sensitivity over a wide range (3 Pa to 5 kPa), and showed excellent reliability characteristics (100,000 cycles) that can withstand severe mechanical stress. The temperature sensor, which was formed by a long bent organic conductor-metal line, changes its resistance with temperature, has a resistance change sensitivity of 0.32% per degree of temperature change, and exhibits a hysteresis-free temperature sensing capability. In particular, this device has maintained its robustness even over 5000 bending cycles. The 25 pixels temperature-pressure bimodal sensor array demonstrates very fast response rates, high sensitivity, and negligible interference performance.

In recent years, several pharmacological tools to target endocannabinoid neurotransmission have been developed, including direct and indirect cannabinoid agonists and cannabinoid antagonists. Due to their hydrophobic nature, cannabinoid agonists and antagonists need to bind specific transporters to allow their distribution in body fluids. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant plasma protein, is a key determinant of drug pharmacokinetics. As HSA binds both the endocannabinoid anandamide and the active ingredient of Cannabis sativa, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, we hypothesize that HSA can be the most important carrier of cannabinoid drugs. In silico docking observations strongly indicate that HSA avidly binds the indirect cannabinoid agonists URB597, AM5206, JZL184, JZL195, and AM404, the direct cannabinoid agonists WIN55,212-2 and CP55,940, and the prototypical cannabinoid antagonist/inverse agonist SR141716. Values of the free energy for cannabinoid drugs binding to HSA range between −5.4 kcal mol–1 and −10.9 kcal mol–1. Accounting for the HSA concentration in vivo (∼ 7.5 × 10–4 M), values of the free energy here determined suggest that the formation of the HSA:cannabinoid drug complexes may occur in vivo. Therefore, HSA appears to be an important determinant for cannabinoid efficacy and may guide the choice of the drug dose regimen to optimize drug efficacy and to avoid drug-related toxicity. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(11):834–840, 2017. © 2017 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","cannabinoid antagonists/inverse agonists; cannabinoid drugs; direct cannabinoid agonists; human serum albumin; human serum albumin:cannabinoid recognition; indirect cannabinoid antagonists",,2-s2.0-85032299652

Here, we review several illustrative examples of functional dynamics selected from our work on cyclic nucleotide signaling and amyloid inhibition. Although fundamentally diverse, a central aspect common to both fields is that function can only be rationalized by considering dynamic equilibria between distinct states of the accessible free energy landscape. The dynamic exchange between ground and excited states of signaling proteins is essential to explain auto-inhibition and allosteric activation. The dynamic exchange between non-toxic monomeric species and toxic oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins provides a foundation to understand amyloid inhibition. NMR ideally probes both types of dynamic exchange at atomic resolution. Specifically, we will show how NMR was utilized to reveal the dynamical basis of cyclic nucleotide affinity, selectivity, agonism and antagonism in multiple eukaryotic cAMP and cGMP receptors. We will also illustrate how NMR revealed the mechanism of action of plasma proteins that act as extracellular chaperones and inhibit the self-association of the prototypical amyloidogenic Aβ peptide.

Cantharidin inhibits a subgroup of serine/threonine phosphatases, thus inducing cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity.

Although the toxicity of cantharidin to the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts prevents its medical use, it is a promising lead compound for chemical modification to develop new anticancer therapeutics. In fact, cantharidin does not cause myelosuppression and displays anticancer activity against cells with a multidrug resistance phenotype.

Yet much research suggests that the MRT recruits both motor simulation and other analytic cognitive strategies that depend on visuospatial representation and visual working memory (WM). In the present study, we investigated cognitive strategies in the MRT using time-frequency analysis of EEG and independent component analysis. We scrutinized sensorimotor mu (µ) power reduction, associated with motor simulation, parietal alpha (pα) power reduction, associated with visuospatial representation, and frontal midline theta (fmθ) power enhancement, associated with WM maintenance and manipulation. µ power increased concomitant with increasing task difficulty, suggesting reduced use of motor simulation, while pα decreased and fmθ power increased, suggesting heightened use of visuospatial representation processing and WM, respectively. These findings suggest that MRT performance involves flexibly trading off between cognitive strategies, namely a motor simulation-based mental rotation strategy and WM-intensive analytic strategies based on task difficulty. Flexible cognitive strategy use may be a domain-general cognitive principle that underlies aptitude and spatial intelligence in a variety of cognitive domains.

E. amylovora is highly virulent and capable of rapid dissemination in orchards; effective control methods are still lacking. One of its most important pathogenicity factors is the exopolysaccharide amylovoran. Amylovoran is a branched polymer made by the repetition of units mainly composed of galactose, with some residues of glucose, glucuronic acid and pyruvate. E. amylovora glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, EC 2.7.7.9) has a key role in amylovoran biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyses the production of UDP-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate and UTP, which the epimerase GalE converts into UDP-galactose, the main building block of amylovoran. We determined EaGalU kinetic parameters and substrate specificity with a range of sugar 1-phosphates. At time point 120 min the enzyme catalysed conversion of the sugar 1-phosphate into the corresponding UDP-sugar reached 74% for N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate, 28% for α-D-galactose 1-phosphate, 0% for α-D-galactosamine 1-phosphate, 100% for α-D-xylose 1-phosphate, 100% for α-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate, 70% for α-D-mannose 1-phosphate, and 0% for α-D-galacturonic acid 1-phosphate.

Two scenarios were applied to select the best model: Scenario I included all wavelengths (400–2450 nm) and Scenario II encompassed characteristic bands of Fe. Pre-processing techniques used to select the best model included: first and second derivatives (FD and SD), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) and standard normal variate. The abilities of the predictive models were evaluated by splitting soil samples into two random groups (80 and 20%). The first group (80%) was used to evaluate calibration and validation sets by employing the cross‐validation method, and the second group (20%) was applied to test the models. The coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error and residual prediction deviation were calculated to evaluate the models. Applying Scenario I indicated that the PLSR model with SD pre-processing was a more accurate technique for predicting the Fe concentration, whereas in the Scenario II, the PLSR model with MSC pre-processing had a better performance. Comparing Scenarios I and II indicated that the more reliable models for predicting the soil Fe content could be constructed by the PLSR model with the SD pre-processing techniques and all wavelengths. The modeling results produced by the PLSR model with the SD pre-processing could be used to detect, map and monitor Fe-contaminated soils by proximal and remote sensing in the mining areas. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Fe-contaminated soil; Partial least squares regression (PLSR); Principal component regression (PCR); VNIR/SWIR spectroscopy","Contamination; Forecasting; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Iron compounds; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soils; Calibration and validations; Coefficient of determination; Contaminated soils; Multiplicative scatter correction; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Principal component regression; Standard normal variates; VNIR/SWIR spectroscopy; Soil pollution",2-s2.0-85032508497

High-quality computational meshes for DFNs are first generated using the conforming meshing approach FraC.

Computer based soil erosion and landscape evolution models (LEMs) offer the potential to be reliable assessment and prediction tools. An advantage of such models is that they provide both erosion and deposition patterns as well as total catchment sediment output. However, before use, like all models they require calibration and validation. In recent years LEMs have been used for a variety of both natural and disturbed landscape assessment. However, these models have not been evaluated for their reliability in steep forested catchments. Here, the SIBERIA LEM is calibrated and evaluated for its reliability for two steep forested catchments in south-eastern Australia. The model is independently calibrated using two methods. Firstly, hydrology and sediment transport parameters are inferred from catchment geomorphology and soil properties and secondly from catchment sediment transport and discharge data. The results demonstrate that both calibration methods provide similar parameters and reliable modelled sediment transport output. A sensitivity study of the input parameters demonstrates the model's sensitivity to correct parameterisation and also how the model could be used to assess potential timber harvesting as well as the removal of vegetation by fire. © 2017","Bedload; Forest hydrology; Landscape evolution model; Sediment transport; SIBERIA; Suspended sediment","Calibration; Erosion; Forestry; Hydrology; Logging (forestry); Runoff; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Soils; Suspended sediments; Bed load; Calibration and validations; Erosion and deposition; Forest hydrologies; Landscape assessments; Landscape evolutions; SIBERIA; South-eastern Australia; Catchments; bedload; calibration; catchment; geomorphology; headwater; hydrology; landscape evolution; model validation; prediction; sediment transport; sedimentation; soil erosion; suspended sediment; Australia",2-s2.0-85029049736

The grain misorientation angle is parameterized by fixing the lower grains while rotating the upper grains about the out-of-plane axis. Brittle failure of the grain aggregate is observed and nominal strength obtained. In the crack-free situation, the grain misorientation exerts an obvious weakening effect on the nominal strength, which is most pronounced at misorientation angles around 20°. Such trend applies to the pre-cracked situation but is much less pronounced. Both misorientation and pre-crack lead to size effect. The nominal strength shows a decreasing trend with the grain size, indicating that grain refinement tends to improve the load bearing capacity, which coincides with the observation in practice. Further, it is shown that the size effect diagram without hydrogen can be divided into three regimes. The conclusions apply to the case with hydrogen, except that the trend of the size effect curve can be affected by large grain sizes due to the longer absolute distance of hydrogen diffusion.

During past years L-amino acids have been produced from deracemization of DL-solution employing the stereoselective flavoenzyme D-amino acid oxidase. On the other hand, the isolation of corresponding D-isomer was hampered by the scarce availability of a suitable L-amino acid oxidase activity. On this side, L-amino acid deaminase (LAAD), only present in the Proteus bacteria, represents a suitable alternative. This FAD-containing enzyme catalyzes the deamination of L-amino acids to the corresponding α-keto acids and ammonia, with no hydrogen peroxide production (a potentially dangerous oxidizing species) since the electrons of the reduced cofactor are transferred to a membrane-bound cytochrome. Very recently the structure of LAAD has been solved: in addition to a FAD-binding domain and to a substrate-binding domain, it also possesses an N-terminal putative transmembrane α-helix (residues 8–27, not present in the crystallized protein variant) and a small α + β subdomain (50–67 amino acids long, named “insertion module”) strictly interconnected to the substrate binding domain. Structural comparison showed that LAAD resembles the structure of several soluble amino acid oxidases, such as L-proline dehydrogenase, glycine oxidase or sarcosine oxidase, while only a limited structural similarity with D- or L-amino acid oxidase is apparent.

While viral HA acylation is crucial in virus replication, its physico-chemical role is unknown. We used virus-like particles (VLP) to study the effect of acylation on morphology, protein incorporation, lipid composition, and membrane fusion. Deacylation interrupted HA-M1 interactions since deacylated mutant HA failed to incorporate an M1 layer within spheroidal VLP, and filamentous particles incorporated increased numbers of neuraminidase (NA). While HA acylation did not influence VLP shape, lipid composition, or HA lateral spacing, acylation significantly affected envelope curvature. Compared to wild-type HA, deacylated HA is correlated with released particles with flat envelope curvature in the absence of the matrix (M1) protein layer. The spontaneous curvature of palmitate was calculated by molecular dynamic simulations and was found to be comparable to the curvature values derived from VLP size distributions. Cell-cell fusion assays show a strainindependent failure of fusion pore enlargement among H2 (A/Japan/305/57), H3 (A/ Aichi/2/68), and H3 (A/Udorn/72) viruses. In contradistinction, acylation made no difference in the low-pH-dependent fusion of isolated VLPs to liposomes: fusion pores formed and expanded, as demonstrated by the presence of complete fusion products observed using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). We propose that the primary mechanism of action of acylation is to control membrane curvature and to modify HA's interaction with M1 protein, while the stunting of fusion by deacylated HA acting in isolation may be balanced by other viral proteins which help lower the energetic barrier to pore expansion. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.","Cryo-electron microscopy; Electron microscopy; Membrane fusion; Palmitoylation; Protein acylation","cholesterol; ganglioside; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; liposome; sialidase; sphingomyelin; acylation; animal cell; Article; controlled study; COS-7 cell line; deacylation; electron microscopy; electron tomography; erythrocyte; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; Influenza A virus; lipid analysis; lipid composition; mass spectrometry; MDCK cell line; membrane curvature; membrane fusion; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; palmitoylation; plasmid; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; virus assembly; virus envelope; virus like agent; virus morphology; virus replication; virus strain; Western blotting; wild type",2-s2.0-85031090712

Cognitive studies confirm a cultural dissonance with the subsurface and highlight lay anxieties about tampering with nature. In addressing those concerns, factual information is argued to be subordinate to values and beliefs in shaping public perspectives on contested geoscientific issues. In this context, scientists' attention to technical accuracy and their emphasis on professional consensus may do little to influence multiple publics whose worries instead root into their sense of place, trust and governance, as well as equity and ethics.

However, the magnitude and extent of impairment of brain functioning due to increased sleep pressure is still not completely understood. Resting state network (RSN) analyses have become increasingly popular because they allow us to investigate brain activity patterns in the absence of a specific task and to identify changes under different levels of vigilance (e.g. due to increased sleep pressure). RSNs are commonly derived from BOLD fMRI signals but studies progressively also employ cerebral blood flow (CBF) signals. To investigate the impact of sleep pressure on RSNs, we examined RSNs of participants under high (19 h awake) and normal (10 h awake) sleep pressure with three imaging modalities (arterial spin labeling, BOLD, pseudo BOLD) while providing confirmation of vigilance states in most conditions. We demonstrated that CBF and pseudo BOLD signals (measured with arterial spin labeling) are suited to derive independent component analysis based RSNs. The spatial map differences of these RSNs were rather small, suggesting a strong biological substrate underlying these networks. Interestingly, increased sleep pressure, namely longer time awake, specifically changed the functional network connectivity (FNC) between RSNs. In summary, all FNCs of the default mode network with any other network or component showed increasing effects as a function of increased ‘time awake’. All other FNCs became more anti-correlated with increased ‘time awake’. The sensorimotor networks were the only ones who showed a within network change of FNC, namely decreased connectivity as function of ‘time awake’. These specific changes of FNC could reflect both compensatory mechanisms aiming to fight sleep as well as a first reduction of consciousness while becoming drowsy. We think that the specific changes observed in functional network connectivity could imply an impairment of information transfer between the affected RSNs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Arterial spin labeling; BOLD; Cerebral blood flow; Imaging modality; Independent component analysis; Pseudo BOLD; Time awake; Vigilance","adult; alertness; arterial spin labeling; Article; BOLD signal; brain blood flow; daytime somnolence; default mode network; electroencephalography; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; resting state network; sleep deprivation; wakefulness; young adult",2-s2.0-85023741880

However, it is still a complex task for the BMI users to control the process of objects grasping and lifting with the robotic arm. It is hard to achieve high efficiency and accuracy even after extensive trainings. One important reason is lacking of sufficient feedback information for the user to perform the closed-loop control. In this study, we proposed a method of augmented reality (AR) guiding assistance to provide the enhanced visual feedback to the user for a closed-loop control with a hybrid Gaze-BMI, which combines the electroencephalography (EEG) signals based BMI and the eye tracking for an intuitive and effective control of the robotic arm. Experiments for the objects manipulation tasks while avoiding the obstacle in the workspace are designed to evaluate the performance of our method for controlling the robotic arm. According to the experimental results obtained from eight subjects, the advantages of the proposed closedloop system (with AR feedback) over the open-loop system (with visual inspection only) have been verified.

With the aim of restoring their sensory and motor functions, theoretical and technological investigations have been carried out in the field of neuroprosthetic systems. For transmission of sensory feedback, several interfacing modalities including indirect (non-invasive), direct-to-peripheral-nerve (invasive), and cortical stimulation have been applied. Peripheral nerve interfaces demonstrate an edge over the cortical interfaces due to the sensitivity in attaining cortical brain signals. The peripheral nerve interfaces are highly dependent on interface designs and are required to be biocompatible with the nerves to achieve prolonged stability and longevity. Another criterion is the selection of nerves that allows minimal invasiveness and damages as well as high selectivity for a large number of nerve fascicles. In this paper, we review the nerve-machine interface modalities noted above with more focus on peripheral nerve interfaces, which are responsible for provision of sensory feedback. The invasive interfaces for recording and stimulation of electro-neurographic signals include intrafascicular, regenerative-type interfaces that provide multiple contact channels to a group of axons inside the nerve and the extra-neural-cuff-type interfaces that enable interaction with many axons around the periphery of the nerve. Section Current Prosthetic Technology summarizes the advancements made to date in the field of neuroprosthetics toward the achievement of a bidirectional nerve-machine interface with more focus on sensory feedback. In the Discussion section, the authors propose a hybrid interface technique for achieving better selectivity and long-term stability using the available nerve interfacing techniques.

The gene was discovered around the time that a similar type I rhodopsin/guanylyl cyclase fusion protein, RhoGC, was shown to control phototaxis of an aquatic fungus through a cGMP signaling pathway. RhoPDE has potential as an optogenetic tool catalyzing the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides. Here we provide an expression and purification system for RhoPDE, as well as a crystal structure of the C-terminal phosphodiesterase catalytic domain. We show that RhoPDE contains an even number of transmembrane segments, with N- and C-termini both located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The purified protein exhibits an absorption maximum at 490 nm in the dark state, which shifts to 380 nm upon exposure to light. The protein acts as a cGMP-selective phosphodiesterase. However, the activity does not appear to be modulated by light. The protein is also active with cAMP as a substrate, but with a roughly 5-7-fold lower kcat. A truncation consisting solely of the phosphodiesterase domain is also active with a kcat for cGMP roughly 6-9-fold lower than that of the full-length protein. The isolated PDE domain was crystallized, and the X-ray structure showed the protein to be a dimer similar to human PDE9.

The main component, pSBMA, is a highly hydrophilic zwitterionic polymer with a high potential for biomedical application. The DOPA functionality, an extensively studied major component of the adhesion properties in mussels, is known to universally enhance polymeric adhesion properties even in the presence of water. The third component, a nitrobenzyl-containing dimethacrylate crosslinker, is efficiently cleaved upon UV irradiation. Proton NMR analysis of the crosslinker, 2-nitro-1,3-benzenedimethanol dimethacrylate (NBDM), demonstrates that photocleavage of the o-nitrobenzyl ester occurs rapidly for 30 minutes, then gradually continues for another 3 hours. The same patterns of photocleavage were observed in a terpolymer adhesive containing the nitrobenzyl crosslinker, poly(N-methacryloyl-3,4-dihydroxyl-l-phenylalanine-co-sulfobetaine methacrylate-co-2-nitro-1,3-benzenedimethanol dimethacrylate), poly(MDOPA-co-SBMA-co-NBDM).

The proposed approach first reconstructs an initial 3D model of the human subject offline using Kinect depth cameras or from a general 3D model if such information is unavailable in the original data. The human pose of the subject is then tracked with multi-view videos using an Annealed Particle Filter (APF)-based tracker with a new Color-based Likelihood (CbL) function and a Bayesian Kalman filter smoother (BKFS) so as to deform the previous captured model to the new position for model-based rendering. An immediate application of the proposed approach is to support fly-over effects in view transfer in IBR systems with limited cameras since it avoids reconstructing the complete dynamic 3D model where large number of cameras may be required. Moreover, for static background, the background can be rendered using the IBR with pre-captured depth maps to further enhance user&#x0027;s experience. To reduce the artifacts during fly-over caused by tracking errors and model deformation, a novel morphing technique utilizing a new Free-form Deformation-based artifacts suppression (FFD-AS) method and other user interface design techniques are also proposed for smooth transition between the original view and the model rendered views. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the publicly available HumanEva dataset and our captured RGB-D multi-view dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed APF-based tracker offered improved tracking performance compared with the conventional bi-directional silhouette (BiS) likelihood criterion. The proposed morphing approach is also shown to be effective in mitigating the rendering artifacts during view transfer.

For many people with muscle weakness, assistive devices provide the means to regain mobility and independence. These devices range from well-established technology, such as wheelchairs, to newer technologies, such as exoskeletons and exosuits. For assistive devices to be used in everyday life, they must provide assistance across activities of daily living (ADLs) in an unobtrusive manner. This article introduces the Myosuit, a soft, wearable device designed to provide continuous assistance at the hip and knee joint when working with and against gravity in ADLs. This robotic device combines active and passive elements with a closedloop force controller designed to behave like an external muscle (exomuscle) and deliver gravity compensation to the user. At 4.1 kg (4.6 kg with batteries), the Myosuit is one of the lightest untethered devices capable of delivering gravity support to the user's knee and hip joints. This article presents the design and control principles of the Myosuit. It describes the textile interface, tendon actuators, and a bi-articular, synergy-based approach for continuous assistance. The assistive controller, based on bi-articular force assistance, was tested with a single subject who performed sitting transfers, one of the most gravityintensive ADLs. The results show that the control concept can successfully identify changes in the posture and assist hip and knee extension with up to 26% of the natural knee moment and up to 35% of the knee power. We conclude that the Myosuit's novel approach to assistance using a bi-articular architecture, in combination with the posture-based force controller, can effectively assist its users in gravity-intensive ADLs, such as sitting transfers.

A coarse-grained molecular envelope function model is developed to enable the investigation of large scale D-A heterojunctions, taking into account morphology and molecular orientation as well as the underlying quantum nature of the system. Simulations show that, upon photoexcitation, Frenkel excitons delocalize over several molecules in <300 fs. At the interface, they dissociate without dwelling in intermediate charge transfer states, evincing that exciton motion and dissociation cannot be describe by point particle models. Moreover, as decoherence suppresses the excitonic quantum coherence length, it also decreases the geminate recombination rate. Although ultrafast coherent charge separation is more efficient at early times and, particularly, for excitons created at the interface, diffusion becomes important for excitons created far away from the D-A interface. In this case, decoherence provides a slower but steadier diffusion migration that protects the exciton from geminate recombination.

By virtue of the strong base-pairing and π-π interactions, AdAn forms an alternate distichous assembly, wherein the adenines are near-orthogonally flanked to the columnar anthracene-on-anthracene (An-An) stacks. The preliminary photophysical and redox analysis of AdAn in organic solvent reveals a summation of adenine (Ad) and anthracene (An) spectral features with minimal perturbation in the ground-state properties. The frontier molecular orbital analysis suggests favorable charge transfer characteristics in the dyad, which is further corroborated by the negative value of the free energy for electron transfer from 1Ad∗ to An (ΔGet = -1.25 eV) and Ad to 1An∗ (ΔGet = -0.12 eV) obtained via Weller analysis. Upon photoexcitation (λex = 266 and 355 nm), self-assembled AdAn reveals the formation of radical ion-pair intermediates (τcrA = 120 ms), which display a solvent polarity dependence as demonstrated via nanosecond and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The ""emergence upon assembly"" approach offers segregated trajectories of the charge carriers, i.e. delocalization of the electron through the columnar π-channels of anthracenes and the diffusion of the holes across hydrogen-bonded adenines, resulting in persistent radical ion-pair intermediates. Though the unsolicited photoexcited-state pathways of AdAn lead to undesirable photoproducts, the long-lived charge-separated state from a favorable arrangement of DA stack proposes an elegant DA assembly design for emergent solution processable photofunctional devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Charge transfer; Free energy; Free radical reactions; Ground state; Hydrogen bonds; Molecular orbitals; Organic solvents; Solvents; Charge-separated state; Comprehensive analysis; Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy; Frontier molecular orbitals; Ground state properties; Photofunctional devices; Solution processable; Transfer characteristics; Anthracene",2-s2.0-85032744189

Moreover, only minimal research has focused on mistreatment in Latin America and the Caribbean, a region notable for social inequalities and inequitable access to maternal health care. Methods: In this article, we discuss the results of a literature review that sought to contribute to the determination of best practices in defining and measuring the mistreatment of women during childbirth, particularly within Latin America and the Caribbean. The review includes a total of 57 English, Spanish, and Portuguese-language research publications and eight legal documents that were published between 2000 and 2017. Results: While the typologies of ""disrespect and abuse"" and ""mistreatment during facility-based childbirth"" are most frequently employed in global studies, ""obstetric violence"" remains the most commonly operationalized term in Latin America and the Caribbean in both research and policy contexts. Various researchers have advocated for the use of those three different typologies, yet the terms all share commonalities in highlighting the medicalization of natural processes of childbirth, roots in gender inequalities, parallels with violence against women, the potential for harm, and the threat to women's rights. For measuring mistreatment, half of the research publications in this review use qualitative methods, such as in-depth interviews and focus groups. After analyzing the strengths and limitations of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches to assessing mistreatment, we recommend mixed methods designs as the optimal strategy to evaluate mistreatment and advocate for the inclusion of direct observations that may help bridge the gap between observed measures and participants' self-reported experiences of mistreatment. Conclusions: No matter the conceptual framework used in future investigations, we recommend that studies seek to accomplish three objectives: (1) to measure the perceived and observed frequencies of mistreatment in maternal health settings, (2) to examine the macro and micro level factors that drive mistreatment, and (3) to assess the impact of mistreatment on the health outcomes of women and their newborns. © 2017 The Author(s).","Dehumanization of care; Disrespect and abuse; Gender-based violence; Latin America and the Caribbean; Maternal health care; Measurement; Medicalization; Mistreatment; Obstetric violence; Violence","Caribbean; childbirth; conceptual framework; consensus; dehumanization; female; gender based violence; human; human experiment; information processing; interview; male; maternal care; medicalization; newborn; nomenclature; outcome assessment; Portuguese (language); publication; qualitative analysis; scientist; women's rights",2-s2.0-85032342507

The effect of GNPs with a varying weight fraction (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 1 wt%) on microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties of AA7068 metal matrix is studied. In addition to this the developed nanocomposites were subjected to the standard T6 heat treatment conditions and its effect on aforementioned properties was also studied. Mechanical properties of as cast and T6 heat treated nanocomposites showed increase in tensile strength and elongation values up to 0.5 wt% GNPs reinforced AA7068 nanocomposites, thereafter drop in these properties was observed. A similar behavior was observed in case of grain size, where grain refinement of AA7068 matrix by GNPs reached saturation point for 0.5 wt%. The average ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the specimens before and after extrusion processes and T6 heat treatment increases from 263 MPa to 372 MPa and 495–615 MPa after adding 0.5 wt% GNPs, respectively. Finally, the wear resistance of the AA7068 alloy and its nanocomposite with 0.5 wt% GNPs in T6 conditions was significantly higher than that of as cast conditions. The obtained results indicate that GNPs (up to 0.5 wt%) are effective in improving the mechanical properties and wear resistance of AA7068 metal matrix in both as cast and T6 conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Graphene; Mechanical properties; Nanocomposites; Wear","Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Graphene; Heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Metallurgy; Metals; Nanocomposites; Reinforcement; Tensile strength; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Graphene nanoplatelets; Liquid metallurgies; Mechanical and tribological properties; Metal matrix nano composites; Strength and elongations; Synthesis and characterizations; T6 heat treatment; Ultimate tensile strength; Metallic matrix composites",2-s2.0-85028855268

Depending on the choice of particle shape and interaction strength, the formed fibers are reproducibly either straight or, for reasons of packing efficiency, spontaneously chiral. As they grow radially, increasing stresses cause chiral fibers to untwist either continuously or via morphological rearrangement. It is also found that, due to the kinetics of fiber initiation, the isotropic solution has to be significantly supercooled before aggregation takes place. As a result, the thermal hysteresis of one formed fiber extends to 13.9% of the formation temperature. In the presence of a three-thread seed cluster of 15 particles, however, monotonic fiber growth is observed 9.3% above the normal formation temperature. Thus, as in many experimental systems, it is the kinetic pathway, rather than the thermodynamic stability of the final assembly, that dominates the observed behavior. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Hysteresis; Molecular dynamics; Self assembly; Thermodynamic stability; Experimental system; Formation temperature; Interaction strength; Isotropic solutions; Molecular dynamics simulations; Packing efficiency; Shaped particles; Thermal hysteresis; Fibers",2-s2.0-85032622079

The ligands and cages were characterized using a combination of 1H, 13C, and DOSY nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and in three cases, X-ray crystallography. The molecular recognition properties of the cages with neutral and anionic guests were examined, in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), using NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and molecular modeling. No binding was observed with simple aliphatic and aromatic guest molecules. However, anionic sulfonates were found to interact with the octahedral cages and the binding interaction was size selective. The smaller [Pd6(1 a, b)8]12+ cages were able to interact with three p-toluenesulfonate guest molecules while the larger [Pd6(2 a, b)8]12+ systems could host four of the anionic guest molecules.

Here, an automated aerosol-jet printing technique is introduced for precisely controlling the thin-film perovskite growth in a planar heterojunction p–i–n solar cell device structure. The roles of some of the user defined parameters from a computer-aided design file are studied for the reproducible fabrication of pure CH3NH3PbI3 thin films under near ambient conditions. Preliminary power conversion efficiencies up to 15.4% are achieved when such films are incorporated in a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate-perovskite-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester type device format. It is further shown that the deposition of atomized materials in the form of a gaseous mist helps to form a highly uniform and PbI2 residue-free CH3NH3PbI3 film and offers advantages over the conventional two-step solution approach by avoiding the detrimental solid–liquid interface induced perovskite crystallization. Ultimately, by integrating full 3D motion control, the fabrication of perovskite layers directly on a 3D curved surface becomes possible. This work suggests that 3D automation with aerosol-jet printing, once fully optimized, could form a universal platform for the lab-to-fab process transfer of solution-based perovskite photovoltaics and steer development of new design strategies for numerous embedded structural power applications. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This is particularly the case during formal design reviews at any point during a product's lifecycle where engineering changes are not fully documented or where salient but important aspects of decision making are difficult to document explicitly. Though many software systems are available to support design reviews, they have not necessarily met the expectations of industry. Consequently, traditional knowledge capture methods tend to be time-consuming, costly and disruptive leading to many companies simply giving up on this crucial aspect of product development. This paper presents research carried out with regard to prototyping and testing a potential knowledge engineering capture and reuse solution, demonstrating real-time user-logging using virtual design environments focused on team-based design ‘reviews’. Called the Virtual Aided Design Engineering Review (VADER) system, it provides millisecond precision time-phased knowledge capture in an automatic and unobtrusive manner. Both structured and unstructured data are synthesised via a ubiquitous integration and temporal synchronisation (UbiITS) framework that enables interactive information mapping, retrieval and mining. VADER's frontend includes a virtual reality based 3D model view display as a multiuser collaborative interface and an auxiliary web interface for concurrent access by multiple distributed users during product design discussions. Feedback from engineers using the system demonstrated that this concept is one which believe would substantially enhance their engineering task knowledge capture, rapid retrieval and reuse capability. It was also surmised that, if required, such a system can be extended throughout the whole product development process capturing individual and team-based engineers’ inputs across the whole cradle-to-grave product life cycle. Also, due to its generic nature, this approach is not limited only to engineering applications or virtual environments but can potentially be used in other sectors using computer-based technologies of any kind. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","cyber-physical systems; design review; industry 4.0; Knowledge capture; knowledge engineering; multimodal time synchronisation; product lifecycle management; user logging","Cyber Physical System; Decision making; Embedded systems; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Precision engineering; Product design; Product development; Virtual reality; Computer based technologies; Design review; Engineering applications; Interactive informations; Knowledge capture; Multi-modal; Product development process; Product life cycle management; Life cycle",2-s2.0-85031999183

Taking advantage of the size-dependent properties typical of nanoparticles, nanowires, and thin films, nanolattices redefine the limits of the accessible material-property space throughout different disciplines. Herein, the exceptional mechanical performance of nanolattices, including their ultrahigh strength, damage tolerance, and stiffness, are reviewed, and their potential for multifunctional applications beyond mechanics is examined.

The troika agreement included health reforms and austerity measures of the National Health Service (NHS) in Portugal to save non-essential health care costs. This research aimed to identify potential barriers among the elderly population (aged 65 and above) to healthcare access influenced by the economic crisis and the troika agreement focussing on the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality (MoU) in Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal. Methods: The qualitative study is including 13 semi-structured interviews of healthcare experts, municipality authority, health care providers, negotiator of the troika agreement, hospital managers, health economists and elderly. A content analysis was performed to evaluate the interviews applying Nvivo2011 software. The barriers identified were clustered towards the five areas of the 'Conceptual framework on health care access' by Levesque et al. (Int J Equity Health 12:18, 2013). Results: Healthcare access for the elderly was found inadequate in four areas of the framework: availability; appropriateness; approachability; and affordability. The fifth area on acceptability was not identified since the study neither followed a gender nor ethnic specific purpose. The main identified barriers were: current financial situation and pension cuts; insufficient provision and increased user fees in primary care; inadequate design and availability of hospital care service; lack of long-term care facilities; increased out-of-pocket-payment on pharmaceuticals; limitations in exemption allowances; cuts in non-emergent health transportation; increased waiting time for elective surgery; and poor unadapted housing conditions for elderly. Conclusions: The health reforms and health budget cuts in the MoU implemented as part of the troika agreement have been associated with increasing health inequalities in access to healthcare services for the elderly population. The majority of responses disclosed an increasing deficiency across the entire National Health Service (NHS) to collaborate, integrate and communicate between the different healthcare sectors for providing adequate care to the elderly. An urgent necessity of restructuring the health care system to adapt towards the elderly population was implied. © 2017 The Author(s).","Economic crisis; Elderly; Health care access; Health inequalities; Health reform; Portugal; Qualitative research; Troika; Urban health",,2-s2.0-85032175874

However, the field is still in its infancy, and discoveries about the nature of cell-microenvironment interactions continue to overturn much early progress in the field. Key challenges continue to be dissecting the roles of chemistry, structure, mechanics, and electrophysiology in the cell microenvironment, and understanding and harnessing the roles of periodicity and drift in these factors. This review encapsulates where recent advances appear to leave the ever-shifting state of the art, and it highlights areas in which substantial potential and uncertainty remain. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Biomimetic materials; Biomimetics; Cells; Cytology; Electrophysiology; Enzyme activity; Gene therapy; Physiology; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; Cell differentiation; Extracellular matrices; Improved controls; Key determinants; Microenvironments; Pathophysiology; State of the art; Threedimensional (3-d); Cell engineering; biomimetic material; chemistry; extracellular matrix; metabolism; tissue engineering; tumor microenvironment; Biomimetic Materials; Cellular Microenvironment; Extracellular Matrix; Tissue Engineering",2-s2.0-85032267162

Operating the HiPIMS discharge with such short pulses optimizes the deposition rate and provides a higher fraction of ionized metal flux, while the presence of the additional magnetic field facilitates the transport of charged particles towards the substrate, leading to a higher deposition rate. The density of the deposited thin films was obtained by measuring the areal atomic density using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and the film thickness by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy. The nanoindentation results were initially analyzed using the Oliver-Pharr method, and then, in order to correct de pile-up errors, other methods have been employed. Compared to the other samples, mainly due to the high energetic bombardment during the growing process and intense surface diffusion, the Cu thin films deposited using HiPIMS assisted by an additional magnetic field exhibit significantly smoother surfaces, higher crystallinity, denser microstructure, higher hardness and Young's modulus, and lower coefficient of friction. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Copper; Hardness; Magnetron sputtering; Nanoindentation; Nanoscratch; Thin film","Charged particles; Copper; Deposition; Deposition rates; Elastic moduli; Electric power transmission; Film growth; Friction; Hardness; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnetron sputtering; Microstructure; Nanocrystals; Nanoindentation; Piles; Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Substrates; Ultrashort pulses; Coefficient of frictions; Comparative studies; Conventional dc magnetron sputtering; Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopies; Nano-crystalline structures; Nano-scratch; Oliver-Pharr method; Rutherford back-scattering spectrometry; Thin films",2-s2.0-85006087880

One of the optimum solutions to overcome fossil fuel degrading and global warming is electric vehicle. The challenging aspect in electric vehicle is its energy storage system. Many of the researchers mainly concentrate on the field of storage device cost reduction, its age increment, and energy densities' improvement.

The analysis of organotin derivatives of the unsubstituted iminophosphorane I1 (SnMe3I1 and SnClMe2I1) and the comparison with the non-carboranyl analog (SnClMe2I3), reveals the reduced donor capacity of the nitrogen atom due to the closo-carborane group. To promote the coordination of this weak donor atom, new phosphine–iminophosphorane ligands (IP1 and IP2), with an extra –PPh2 group on the other cage carbon atom, were synthesized and structurally characterized. The analysis of the products formed by the reaction of these ligands with the metal precursor cis-[PdCl2(PhCN)2] reveals that the phosphine group promotes the coordination of the iminophosphorane nitrogen atom, yielding (P, N) chelates. However, this coordination mode activates the closo-carborane ligands towards deboronation, and the complexes evolve to the nido derivatives in response to the polar solvents. The activation is increased by the presence of extra donor groups, like in the tridentate ligand IP2, with an extra thioether group.

Herein we generate and compare millions of simple PPI models for insight into the mechanisms of specific recognition and binding. We use a coarse-grained approach whereby amino acids are counted in the interface, and these counts are used as binding affinity predictors. We perform lasso regression, a modern regression technique aimed at interpretability, with every possible amino acid combination (over 106 unique feature sets) to select only those amino acid predictors that provide more information than noise. This approach circumvents arbitrary binning and assumptions about the binding environment that obscure other binding affinity models. Aggregated analysis of these models trained at various interfacial cutoff distances informs the roles of specific amino acids in different binding contexts. We find that a simple amino acid count model outperforms detailed intermolecular contact and binned residue type models. We identify the prevalence of serine, glycine, and tryptophan in the interface as particularly important for predicting binding affinity across a range of distance cutoffs. Although current sample size limitations prevent a robust consensus model for binding affinity prediction, our approach underscores the relevance of a residue-based description of the protein-protein interface to increase our understanding of specific interactions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acids; Binding energy; Bins; Biochemistry; Combinatorial mathematics; Coarse-grained approaches; Intermolecular contacts; Protein-protein binding; Protein-protein interactions; Protein-protein interface; Quantitative description; Regression techniques; Specific recognition; Proteins",2-s2.0-85032002013

In addition, in the medical industry, studies of many of the developments and applications are actively conducted based on the development of information communication technology. The aim of medical-information systems is the construction of an advanced IT and integrated u-healthcare system that evolves in the direction of integrated medical-based IT-convergence systems. Accordingly, to resolve the problems of telemedicine, in terms of the remote access to medical data, some public and private initiatives have been proposed, ranging from patient-mobility approaches to medical data. In addition, regarding GENICloud, which provides links with the existing future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud, two out of the seven GENIAM APIs have been announced as the common APIs of the future Internet testbeds in GENI, and they have been implemented and are provided. In the present GENI Cloud system, due to the provision of limited APIs, restrictions may occur in the future Internet testbeds and the Eucalyptus Cloud system management. Therefore, this study proposes a cloud-based mobile health service for the enhancement of the quality of service (QoS) including factors such as reliability and response time to resolve the problems of the broadband-communication infrastructure in the existing mobile health service and the delay problem on the wireless body area network. In this paper, we propose the cloud-based u-healthcare network with a QoS-guaranteed mobile health service. For this method, the TMO-distribution object model that was used in the existing research to implement a reliable and efficient cloud system for users was not used, and instead, a cloud-platform environment was built up through the construction of a distributed system based on a cluster-based mobile object. For this purpose, this study considered the characteristics of the wireless-communication environments between the terminals and the cloud servers in the mobile cloud environment and the proposed cloud mobility services and the specialized mobile cloud-control software. Later, for linkages with cloud computing environments and testbeds was proposed. In addition, this study carried out a cloud mobility-control design to provide a service in the mobile cloud environment that is based on the actual future Internet testbeds. Lastly, based on the structured cloud-platform environment, this study designed access interfaces to provide a mobile healthcare service in consideration of the user convenience. For the mobile-service access interfaces, since the same service interfaces can be used to access the characteristics and functions of all of the applications from browsers and device clients, the model-view-controller structure of the platform was designed, including the components for the further improvement of the requirements, reuse, and maintenance of the codes in medium and large distributed systems. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Cloud based PHR platform; Cloud framework; Distributed networking; HCI; Smart health","Cloud computing; Health; Health care; Human computer interaction; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Medical problems; mHealth; Testbeds; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Broadband Communication; Cloud computing environments; Cloud-based; Distributed networking; Information communication technology; Model view controller; Wireless body area network; Wireless communications; Quality of service",2-s2.0-85032018511

This work demonstrates extension of our previous work from a single domain (i.e., physical activity) to multiple domains (physical activity, nutrition and clinical) for context-awareness.

This work explicitly focuses on key challenges linked to multi-level context modeling, reasoning and fusioning based on the mlCAF open-source ontology. More specifically, it addresses the interpretation of contexts from three different domains, their fusioning conforming to richer contextual information.

Curli nanofibers exhibit exceptional underwater adhesion to various surfaces, have high rigidity and strong tensile mechanical properties, and thus hold great promise in biomaterials. The mechanisms of how curli fibers strongly attach to surfaces and detach under force remain elusive. To investigate curli fiber adhesion to surfaces, we developed a coarse-grained curli fiber model, in which the protein subunit CsgA (curli specific gene A) self-assembles into the fiber. The coarse-grained model yields physiologically relevant and tunable bending rigidity and persistence length. The force-induced desorption of a single curli fiber is examined using coarse-grained modeling and theoretical analysis. We find that the bending energy penalty arising from high persistence length enhances the resistance of the curli fiber against desorption and thus strengthens the adhesion of the curli fiber to surfaces. The CsgA-surface adhesion energy and the curli fiber bending rigidity both play crucial roles in the resistance of curli fiber against desorption from surfaces. To enable the desorption process, the applied peeling force must overcome both the interfacial adhesion energy and the energy barrier for bending the curli fiber at the peeling front. We show that the energy barrier to desorption increases with the interfacial adhesion energy, however, the bending induced failure of a single curli fiber limits the work of adhesion if the proportion of the CsgA-surface adhesion energy to the CsgA-CsgA cohesive energy becomes large. These results illustrate that the optimal adhesion performance of nanofibers is dictated by the interplay between bending, surface energy and cohesive energy. Our model provides timely insight into enterobacteriaceae adhesion mechanisms as well as future designs of engineered curli fiber based adhesives. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","adhesion to surfaces; amyloid fibril; bending energy penalty; coarse-grained model; curli fiber; force-induced desorption","Adhesion; Biofilms; Desorption; Energy barriers; Glycoproteins; Interfaces (materials); Nanofibers; Physiological models; Rigidity; Adhesion mechanisms; Adhesion performance; Amyloid fibril; Bending energies; Coarse grained models; Extracellular matrices; Interfacial adhesion energy; Tensile mechanical properties; Fibers",2-s2.0-85032654606

To identify principle transcriptional regulators that could be therapeutic targets of obesity, we investigated transcriptomic modulation in the duodenal mucosa following low-fat (LF) and HF meal ingestion. Methods: Whereas one group of mice was sacrificed after fasting, the others were fed ad libitum with LF or HF meal, and sacrificed 30 min, 1 h and 3 h after the beginning of the meal. A transcriptome analysis of the duodenal mucosa of the 7 groups was conducted using both microarray and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method followed by an Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). Results: SAGE and microarray showed that the modulation of a total of 896 transcripts in the duodenal mucosa after LF and/or HF meal, compared to the fasting condition. The IPA identified lipid metabolism, molecular transport, and small molecule biochemistry as top three molecular and cellular functions for the HF-responsive, HF-specific, HF-delay, and LF-HF different genes. Moreover, the top transcriptional regulator for the HF-responsive and HF-specific genes was peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). On the other hand, the LF-responsive and LF-specific genes were related to carbohydrate metabolism, cellular function and maintenance, and cell death/cellular growth and proliferation, and the top transcriptional regulators were forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and cAMP response element binding protein 1 (CREB1), respectively. Conclusions: These results will help to understand the molecular mechanisms of intestinal response after LF and HF ingestions, and contribute to identify therapeutic targets for obesity and obesity-related diseases. © 2017 The Author(s).","Duodenum; High-fat diet; Low-fat diet; Microarray; Mucosa; Serial analysis of gene expression",,2-s2.0-85032181296

For these purposes, an experiment was conducted providing two types of analysis: (i) the evaluation of a self-assessment of the driving style; (ii) the prediction of aggressive driving style based on drivers’ activity and environment parameters. Sixty seven h of driving data from 10 drivers were collected for analysis in this study. The new parameters used in the experiment are the car door opening and closing manner, which were applied to improve the prediction accuracy. An Android application called Sensoric was developed to collect low-level smartphone data about the users’ activity. The driving style was predicted from the user’s environment and activity data collected before driving. The prediction was tested against the actual driving style, calculated from objective driving data. The prediction has shown encouraging results, with precision values ranging from 0.727 up to 0.909 for aggressive driving recognition rate.

Many factors such as human, organisational and environmental factors affect IS in an organisation. Therefore, investigating ISs success is considered to be a complex problem. Also, because of the competitive business environment and the high amount of information flow in organisations, new issues like resilient ISs and successful customer relationship management (CRM) have emerged. A resilient IS will provide sustainable delivery of information to internal and external customers. This paper presents an integrated approach to enhance and optimise the performance of each component of a large IS based on CRM and resilience engineering (RE) in a gas company. The enhancement of the performance can help ISs to perform business tasks efficiently. The data are collected from standard questionnaires. It is then analysed by data envelopment analysis by selecting the optimal mathematical programming approach. The selected model is validated and verified by principle component analysis method.

Three-dimensional epitaxial islands were observed to precipitate and grow on the surfaces. In situ time-sequenced measurements demonstrated that the growth rates were commensurate with those obtained for epitaxial islands formed on calcite crystals reacted with Cd2+-bearing aqueous solutions of the same range in supersaturation with respect to the pure metal carbonate phase. This finding was unexpected as rhodochrosite (MnCO3) and calcite display a 10% lattice mismatch, based on the area of their 101¯4 surface unit cells, whereas the lattice mismatch is only 4% for otavite (CdCO3) and calcite. Coatings of varying thicknesses were therefore synthesized by reacting calcite single crystals in calcite-equilibrated aqueous solutions with up to 250 μM MnCl2. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray reflectivity (XRR), and AFM measurements of the reacted crystals demonstrated the formation of an epitaxial (Mn,Ca)CO3 solid solution. The epitaxial solid solution had a spatially complex composition, whereby the first few nanometers were rich in Ca and the Mn content increased with distance from the original calcite surface, culminating in a topmost region of almost pure MnCO3 for the thickest coatings. The effective lattice mismatch was therefore much smaller than the nominal mismatch thus explaining the measured growth rates.

At elevated process temperatures, inter-diffusion of atomic species can occur among these metal layers, causing sub-optimal performance of interconnects, which may lead to the failure of an IC. Thus, typically a thin barrier metal layer is used to prevent the inter-diffusion of atomic species within interconnects. For ICs with sub-10 nm transistors (10 nm technology node), the design rule (thickness scaling) demands the thinnest possible barrier layer. Therefore, here we investigate the critical thickness of a titanium-nitride (TiN) barrier that can prevent the cobalt diffusion using multi-scale modeling and simulations. First, we compute the Co diffusion barrier in crystalline and amorphous TiN with the nudged elastic band method within first-principles density functional theory simulations. Later, using the calculated activation energy barriers, we quantify the Co diffusion length in the TiN metal layer with the help of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Such a multi-scale modelling approach yields an exact critical thickness of the metal layer sufficient to prevent the Co diffusion in IC interconnects. We obtain a diffusion length of a maximum of 2 nm for a typical process of thermal annealing at 400 °C for 30 min. Our study thus provides useful physical insights for the Co diffusion in the TiN layer and further quantifies the critical thickness (∼2 nm) to which the metal barrier layer can be thinned down for sub-10 nm ICs. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","activation energy; density functional theory; diffusion; integrated circuits; kinetic Monte Carlo; sentauraus sprocess","Activation energy; Cesium compounds; Chemical activation; Cobalt; Density functional theory; Diffusion; Integrated circuit interconnects; Integrated circuits; Intelligent systems; Metals; Monte Carlo methods; Timing circuits; Titanium compounds; Titanium nitride; First-principles density functional theory; Integrated circuits (ICs); Kinetic Monte Carlo; Kinetic monte carlo simulation; Multi-scale modelling; Nudged elastic band methods; S-process; Sub-optimal performance; Diffusion barriers",2-s2.0-85032747726

Herein, we report the development of a novel series of thiosemicarbazones derived from 1-benzylpiperidine, a pharmacophore within the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Donepezil. These thiosemicarbazones were designed to target five major AD hallmarks, including: low acetylcholine levels, dysfunctional autophagy, metal dys-homeostasis, protein aggregation and oxidative stress.

The constitutive behavior of the elastoplasticity in the iron matrix and the elastic-brittle failure for the glass microsphere were simulated in the models. An appropriate RVE size was statistically determined by evaluating elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and yield strength in terms of model sizes and boundary conditions. The model was validated by the agreement with experimental findings. The tensile deformation mechanism of the syntactic foam considering the fracture of the microspheres was then investigated. In addition, the feasibility of introducing the interfacial deboning behavior to the proposed model was briefly investigated to improve the accuracy in depicting fracture behaviors of the syntactic foam.

However, the existing resource management schemes with predesigned SCMA codebooks cannot fully exploit user diversities in the frequency domain, thus degrading the performance of SCMA systems. To fully exploit the potential of SCMA, we in this paper design a more flexible and configurable SCMA through adaptively adjusting the codebook design and assignment according to the user&#x2019;s features. Specifically, for the uplink networks, we first formulate a detection complexity minimization problem by jointly considering the codebook design (i.e., mapping matrix and constellation graph design) and codebook assignment, which is an integer linear program and NP-hard in general. To tackle this hard problem effectively, we first borrow the idea of dual coordinate search to devise a suboptimal but computational efficient algorithm to determine the mapping matrix and codebook assignment. Based on the obtained mapping matrix, we use the multi-dimensional modulation characteristic of SCMA to carefully design the constellations for each codebook to further reduce the detection complexity. For the downlink networks, we formulate a total power consumption minimization problem by jointly considering the codebook design and assignment and power allocation. Exploiting the special structure of the problem, we employ the Lagrangian dual decomposition technique to propose a fast iterative algorithm, which can solve the problem optimally with low complexity.

This approach enables direct incorporation of membrane proteins into supported lipid bilayers without using detergents and reconstitution and preserves native lipids and membrane species. Such a system can be advantageous as in vitro models of in vivo cell surfaces for study of the roles of membrane proteins as drug targets in drug delivery, host-pathogen interactions, tissue engineering, and many other bioanalytical and sensing applications. However, the impact of methods used to induce cell blebbing (vesiculation) on protein and membrane properties is still unknown. This study focuses on characterization of cell blebs created under various bleb-inducing conditions and the result on protein properties (orientation, mobility, activity, etc.) and lipid scrambling in this platform. The orientation of proteins in the cell blebs and planar bilayers is revealed using a protease cleavage assay. Lipid scrambling in both cell blebs and planar bilayers is indicated through an annexin V binding assay. To quantify protein confinement, immobility, etc., incorporation of GPI-linked yellow fluorescent protein (GPI-YFP) was used in conjunction with single-molecule tracking (SMT) microscopy. Finally, to investigate the impact of the bleb induction method on protein activity and expression level, cell blebs expressing human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) were analyzed by an enzyme activity assay and immunoblotting. This work enriches our understanding of cell plasma membrane bleb bilayers as a biomimetic platform, reveals conditions under which specific properties are met, and represents one of the few ways to make molecularly complete supported bilayers directly from cell plasma membranes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","cell blebs; cell plasma membrane vesicles; planar mammalian cell membrane; protein diffusion; single-molecule tracking; Supported lipid bilayer","Biological membranes; Biomimetics; Cell membranes; Cells; Cytology; Enzyme activity; Lipid bilayers; Mammals; Membranes; Molecules; Proteins; Soaps (detergents); Surface mount technology; Tissue engineering; Cell plasma membranes; Mammalian cells; Protein diffusion; Single-molecule tracking; Supported lipid bilayers; Cell engineering",2-s2.0-85031674545

Here we report crystal structures of the N-terminal domain of anthranilate-CoA ligase PqsA, the first enzyme of PQS biosynthesis, in complex with anthraniloyl-AMP and with 6-fluoroanthraniloyl-AMP (6FABA-AMP) at 1.4 and 1.7 Å resolution. We find that PqsA belongs to an unrecognized subfamily of anthranilate-CoA ligases that recognize the amino group of anthranilate through a water-mediated hydrogen bond.

Two previously reported experiments of our research group, related to fluorescence matrices derived from kinetics and high-performance liquid chromatography, were adapted to be carried out in a more automated fashion.

Cognitive training games on computer, video and mobile platforms have shown ample and positive support. However, the generalized effects are not agreed upon unanimously, and the game tasks are usually simple and decontextualized due to the limitations of measurements. This study adopted a qualitative approach of design-based research (DBR) to systematically review and pragmatically examine the regime, presentation and feedback design of a cognitive training game for older adults. An overview of the literature of cognitive aging and training games was conducted to form the theoretical conjectures of the design, and an iterative cycle and process were employed to develop a mobile game for older adults who are homebound or receiving care in a nursing home. Stakeholders, i.e., elderly users and institutional administrators, were invited to participate in the design process. Using two cycles of design and evaluation, a working prototype of an iPad-based app that accounted for the needs of elderly adults in terms of form, appearance and working function was developed and tested in the actual contexts of the participants' homes and an assisted living facility. The results showed that the cognitive training game developed in this study was accepted by the participants, and a high degree of satisfaction was noted. Moreover, the elements of the interface, including its size, layout and control flow, were tested and found to be suitable for use. This study contributes to the literature by providing design suggestions for such games, including the designs of the cognitive training structure, interface, interaction, instructions and feedback, based on empirical evidence collected in natural settings. This study further suggests that the effectiveness of cognitive training in mobile games be evaluated through field and physical testing on a larger scale in the future. © 2017 Lu, Lin and Yueh.","App; Cognitive training; Design-based research; Elderly adult; Mobile game",,2-s2.0-85031498419

One of the most prominent areas of healthcare in which robots are implemented is nursing homes. However, nursing and technology are often considered as being contradictory, an attitude originating in the view of “the natural” versus “the artificial”. Social media mirror this view, including in attitudes and societal debates regarding nursing and care robots. However, little is known about this topic in previous research. Objectives: To examine user behaviour in social media platforms on the topic of nursing and care robots. Design: A retrospective and cross-sectional observation study design was applied. Methods: Data were collected via the Alchemy streaming application programming interface. Data from social media were collected from 1 January 2014 to 5 January 2016. The data set consisted of 12,311 mentions in total. Results: Nursing and care robots are a small-scale topic of discussion in social media.

It was found in the data that 67.9% of the mentions were positive, 24.4% were negative and 7.8% were neutral. Discussion: The volume and visibility of the data on nursing robots found in social media, as well as the attitudes to nursing robots found there, indicate that nursing care robots, which are seen as representing a next step in technological development in healthcare, are a topic on the rise in social media.

Owing to their ability to deliver exogenous molecules into cells easily and effectively, their flexible design that allows transporters to comprise various chemical structures and functions, and their potential in chemical and cell biology studies and clinical applications, CPPs have been attracting enormous interest among researchers in related fields. Consequently, publications on CPPs have increased significantly.Although there are many types of CPPs with different physicochemical properties and applications, arginine-rich CPPs, which include the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) TAT peptide and oligoarginines, are among the most extensively employed and studied. Previous studies demonstrated the importance of the guanidino group in arginine, which confers flexibility in transporter design. Therefore, in addition to peptides, various transporters rich in guanidino groups, which do not necessarily share specific chemical and three-dimensional structures, have been developed.Typically, cell-penetrating transporters have 6-12 guanidino groups. Since the pKa of the guanidino group in arginine is approximately 12.5, these molecules are highly basic and hydrophilic. Our group is interested in why these cationic molecules can penetrate cells. Understanding their mechanism of action should lead to the rational design of intracellular delivery systems that have high efficacy. Additionally, novel cellular uptake mechanisms may be elucidated during the course of these studies. Therefore, our group is trying to understand the basic aspects underlying the ability of these peptides to penetrate cells. Regarding the delivery of biopharmaceuticals including proteins and nucleic acids, achieving efficient and effective delivery to target organs and cells is one of the biggest challenges. Furthermore, when the target sites of these drug molecules are within cells, effective cell penetration becomes another obstacle. Cells are surrounded by a membrane that separates the inside of the cell from its outside. This barrier function is critical for keeping cellular contents inside cells, and without this, cells cannot function. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of action of CPPs is necessary to overcome these obstacles and will allow us not only to improve CPP-mediated delivery but also to create other types of intracellular delivery systems.In this Account, we summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms of internalization of arginine-rich CPPs, from the viewpoints of both direct cell-membrane penetration (i.e., physicochemical aspects) and endocytic uptake (i.e., physiological aspects), and discuss the implications of this knowledge. We also discussed loosening of lipid packing as a factor to promote direct cell-membrane penetration. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,2-s2.0-85031690183

However, it is unclear how chronic paralysis specifically impacts cortical oscillations associated with attempted movement of impaired limbs. We hypothesized that µ- (8-13 Hz) and β- (15-30 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) would be less modulated for individuals with hand paralysis due to cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). To test this, we compared the modulation of ERD from magnetoencephalography (MEG) during attempted and imagined grasping performed by participants with cervical SCI (n = 12) and able-bodied controls (n = 13). Seven participants with tetraplegia were able to generate some electromyography (EMG) activity during attempted grasping, whereas the other five were not. The peak and area of ERD were significantly decreased for individuals without volitional muscle activity when they attempted to grasp compared with able-bodied subjects and participants with SCI,with some residual EMG activity. However, no significant differences were found between subject groups during mentally simulated tasks (i.e., motor imagery) where no muscle activity or somatosensory consequences were expected. These findings suggest that individuals who are unable to produce muscle activity are capable of generating ERD when attempting to move, but the characteristics of this ERD are altered. However, for people who maintain volitional muscle activity after SCI, there are no significant differences in ERD characteristics compared with able-bodied controls. These results provide evidence that ERD is dependent on the level of intact muscle activity after SCI. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Source space MEG was used to investigate sensorimotor cortical oscillations in individuals with SCI. This study provides evidence that individuals with cervical SCI exhibit decreased ERD when they attempt to grasp if they are incapable of generating muscle activity. However, there were no significant differences in ERD between paralyzed and able-bodied participants during motor imagery. These results have important implications for the design and evaluation of new therapies, such as motor imagery and neurofeedback interventions. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","Event-related desynchronization; Magnetoencephalography; Paralysis; Sensorimotor rhythms; Spinal cord injury","Article; cervical spinal cord injury; chronic disease; clinical article; electromyography; evoked response; female; human; magnetoencephalography; male; muscle contraction; neuromodulation; paralysis; priority journal; rhythm; sensorimotor function",2-s2.0-85031996244

The channels do not open and close; they appear and disappear due to subunit association and dissociation. Many different types of experiments support this monomer ↔ dimer mechanism. Recently, however, this mechanism was challenged, based on experiments with lipid vesicle-incorporated gA under conditions where vesicle fusion could be controlled. In these experiments, sustained channel activity was observed long after fusion had been terminated, which led to the proposal that gA single-channel current transitions result from closed-open transitions in long-lived bilayer-spanning dimers. This proposal is at odds with 40 years of experiments, but involves the key assumption that gA monomers do not exchange between bilayers. We tested the possibility of peptide exchange between bilayers using three different types of experiments. First, we demonstrated the exchange of gA between 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DC22:1PC) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DC18:1PC) lipid vesicles using a fluorescence assay for gA channel activity. Second, we added gA-free DC22:1PC vesicles to both sides of planar DC18:1PC bilayers preincubated with gA, which reduced channel activity up to 10-fold. Third, we added gA-containing DC22:1PC vesicles to one or both sides of DC18:1PC planar bilayers, which produced much higher channel activity when the gA-containing vesicles were added to both sides of the bilayer, as compared to one side only. All three types of experiments show that gA subunits can exchange between lipid bilayers. The exchange of subunits between bilayers thus is firmly established, which becomes a crucial consideration with respect to the mechanism of channel formation. © 2017 Biophysical Society",,,2-s2.0-85031508428

We assess the ability of 2D-IR spectroscopy in combination with multivariate data analysis to quantify changes in secondary structure of the multifunctional calcium-binding messenger protein Calmodulin (CaM) as a function of temperature and Ca2+ concentration. Our approach produced quantitative agreement with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in detecting the domain melting transitions of Ca2+-free (apo) CaM (reduction in α-helix structure by 13% (CD) and 15% (2D)). 2D-IR also allows accurate differentiation between melting transitions and generic heating effects observed in the more thermally stable Ca2+-bound (holo) CaM. The functionally relevant random-coil-α-helix transition associated with Ca2+ uptake that involves just 7-8 out of a total of 148 amino acid residues was clearly detected. Temperature-dependent Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations show that apo-CaM exists in dynamic equilibrium with holo-like conformations, while Ca2+ uptake reduces conformational flexibility.

Plastic instability theory with the rule of mixtures (ROM) was then applied to the obtained phase properties to estimate the UTS/UE of the Q&P steels.

EEG based BCIs for typing popularly utilize event related potentials (ERPs) for inference. Presentation paradigm in current ERP-based letter by letter typing BCIs typically query the user with an arbitrary subset of characters. However, the typing accuracy and speed can potentially be enhanced with more informed subset selection. In this manuscript, we introduce the active recursive Bayesian state estimation (active-RBSE) framework for inference and sequence optimization. Prior to each iteration of presentation, rather than showing a subset of randomly selected characters, this framework optimally selects a subset based on a query function. Selected queries are made adaptively specialized for users during each intent detection. Through a simulation-based study, we assess the effect of active-RBSE on the performance of a language-model assisted typing BCI in terms of typing speed and accuracy. To provide a baseline for comparison, we also utilize standard presentation paradigms namely, row and column matrix presentation paradigm and also random rapid serial visual presentation paradigms. The results show that utilization of active-RBSE can enhance the online performance of the system, both in terms of typing accuracy and speed. Moreover, we conduct online experiments with human participants to study the human-in-the-loop effect on the performance of the proposed framework and the results were consistent with the simulations. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","active learning; Brain computer interface; event related potential; matrix speller; P300; recursive Bayesian state estimation; RSVP keyboard","Brain models; Computer simulation languages; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Interface states; Interfaces (computer); Iterative methods; Network function virtualization; Probabilistic logics; Set theory; State estimation; Active Learning; Bayes method; Bayesian state estimation; Context modeling; Event related potentials; P300; Vocabulary; Brain computer interface",2-s2.0-85028928856

In this paper, we present recent results about the effect of the structure and microstructure of iron-rich glass-ceramics obtained from mill scale on their electrical behavior. Five iron-rich glass compositions were investigated. The crystalline phases of the crystallized (glass-ceramic) materials were identified by X-ray diffractometry, and phase content quantifications were performed by the Rietveld method. The crystallinity and porosity were also related to the electrical behavior of the glass-ceramics, which was determined by impedance spectroscopy, and the hardness, measured by the Vickers indentation method. Albite, andradite, anorthite, clinopyroxene, franklinite, nepheline, and spinel were shown to be the main crystalline phases present in the investigated compositions. The conductivity showed an increasing trend with the degree of crystallinity. This behavior was attributed to a decrease in porosity, an increase in the concentration of charge carriers in the glass phase (iron, Li+, and Na+), and an increase in the number of conduction paths through the glassy phase/crystalline phase interfaces. The relationship between hardness and crystallinity could not be verified due to the structural complexity of the glass-ceramics studied. However, a nearly linear relationship was found between the effect of porosity and hardness. The G2Z composition exhibited a hardness of 6.1 ± 0.5 GPa at 850 °C, which is a value in very good agreement with other iron-rich glass-ceramics studied. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Electrical properties; Glass-ceramics; Mill scale; Waste valorization","Ceramic materials; Crystalline materials; Electric properties; Hardness; Iron; Iron compounds; Phase interfaces; Porosity; Structural ceramics; X ray diffraction analysis; Degree of crystallinity; Impedance spectroscopy; Microstructural development; Mill scale; Steel-making industries; Structure and microstructures; Vickers indentation method; Waste valorizations; Glass ceramics",2-s2.0-85020275797

The proposed oSDFT algorithm directly computes the DFT bins of the shifted window by simply adding (or subtracting) the bins of a previous window and an updating vector.

This study employed an inexpensive and scalable technique to place elastomeric sensors directly onto a monolithic structure representing the finger of a soft robotic prosthetic hand. The chemical affinity between the solvent used, and the soft elastomers (thermoplastic urethane, TPU, and styrene-butadiene-styrene, SBS) allowed the blending of the TPU and the SBS at the finger interface, creating a highly compliant piezoresistive sensor, that was directly deposited in the desired place.

This effect was confirmed by thermal behavior and small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) analysis. From the crystallization and melting analyses, it was shown that the peak temperature, shape and enthalpy decreased as the SFL ratio increases. Meanwhile, the bi-component oleogels exhibited new peaks in the SAXD profile, which imply a self-assembly modification. The microscopic study through polarized and electrons revealed a change in the structure. Therefore, it can be concluded that a synergistic effect between SEs and SFL, more particularly at 7:3 ratio, towards sunflower oil structuring could be obtained. These findings shed light for greater applications of SEs as structuring and carrier agent in foods and pharmaceutical. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Lecithin; Microstructure; Oleogel; Rheology; Self-assembly; Sucrose-esters; Surfactants; Synergistic","Esters; Gelation; Hydrogen bonds; Lecithin; Microstructure; Oils and fats; Rheology; Sugar (sucrose); Sunflower oil; Surface active agents; X ray diffraction; Mixed surfactant systems; Molecular ordering; Oleogel; Rheological property; Small angle x-ray diffractions; Sucrose esters; Sunflower lecithin; Synergistic; Self assembly; phosphatidylcholine; sucrose ester derivative; sunflower oil; surfactant; Article; chemical modification; cryoelectron microscopy; crystallization; electron; enthalpy; flow kinetics; gelation; hydrogen bond; melting point; polarization; polarization microscopy; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; temperature; X ray diffraction",2-s2.0-85019969076

The study supported herein aims to present a framework of how to simulate an advanced ventilative cooling algorithm of a window system on coupled BPS environments (ESP-r and BCVTB tools). Parametric analysis has been conducted to verify specific operational functions of the system. The analysis uses a renovated single-family house in Denmark (monitored June–August, 2016). Parametric analysis was highlighted that the performance of the developed ventilative cooling strategy for these climatic conditions was not affected by the number of opening steps (3 or 5) for low and medium natural indoor ventilation cooling set points (22–24 °C). For all the examined spaces, the static trigger set points perform better than the dynamic for all the evaluating metrics and criteria that were included in this study. Under the proposed framework, the simulation of any other developed ventilative cooling concept or system is possible. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive thermal comfort; BCVTB; Building energy performance; Domestic automation; ESP-r; Renovation; Residential building; Simulation coupling; Temperate climate","Automation; Buildings; Climatology; Control system analysis; Control systems; Housing; Risk assessment; Adaptive thermal comfort; BCVTB; Building energy performance; ESP-r; Renovation; Residential building; Temperate climate; Cooling systems",2-s2.0-85029690271

These samples were collected from the discharge of a cool hydrothermal system (CHS) on a ridge flank, where typical reaction temperatures in the volcanic crust are low (2–20 °C) and fluid residence times are short. Ridge-flank hydrothermal systems extract 25% of Earth's lithospheric heat, with a global discharge rate equivalent to that of Earth's river discharge to the ocean; CHSs comprise a significant fraction of this global flow. Upper crustal temperatures around Dorado Outcrop are ∼15 °C, the calculated residence time is <3 y, and the composition of discharging fluids is only slightly altered from bottom seawater. Many of the major ions concentrations in spring fluids are indistinguishable from those of bottom seawater; however, concentrations of Rb, Mo, V, U, Mg, phosphate, Si and Li are different. Applying these observed differences to calculated global CHS fluxes results in chemical fluxes for these ions that are ≥15% of riverine fluxes. Fluxes of K and B also may be significant, but better analytical resolution is required to confirm this result. Spring fluids also have ∼50% less dissolved oxygen (DO) than bottom seawater. Calculations of an analytical model suggest that the loss of DO occurs primarily (>80%) within the upper basaltic crust by biotic and/or abiotic consumption. This calculation demonstrates that permeable pathways within the upper crust can support oxic water–rock interactions for millions of years. © 2017 The Author(s)","crustal alteration; dissolved oxygen; geochemical fluxes; hydrothermal; ridge flank","Dissolved oxygen; Geochemistry; Seawater; crustal alteration; Eastern pacific Ocean; hydrothermal; Hydrothermal system; Lithospheric heat; Reaction temperature; ridge flank; Rock interaction; Hydrochemistry; Cocos plate; dissolved oxygen; geochemistry; hydrothermal system; seafloor; spring (hydrology); upper crust; water-rock interaction; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East)",2-s2.0-85029175339

The work focuses on the need to manage the temporal dimension and how the system must be maintained. The proposal involves the integration of a CBR system in a commercial Smart Home architecture that includes sensors, data communication and data integration. The CBR system analyses the daily activity at home as temporal event sequences, using temporal edit distance to identify the most similar cases. Most common Case-Based Maintenance (CBM) algorithms adapted to the temporal problem (t-CNN, t-RENN, t-ICF, t-DROP1 and t-RCFP) are used to reduce the number of cases in the case base in order to contribute to its long term maintenance. The experiments carried out analyse the effect of different temporal CBM algorithms in common risk scenarios (waking up during the night, falls and falls with loss of consciousness). Data experiments are generated synthetically based on real behaviour patterns of 12 hours’ and 24 hours’ duration. Algorithms are compared using a paired t-test analysis. The results show that the algorithms t-CNN and t-DROP1 are able to create case-bases that statistically present the same average results as the original case-base but with a 10–20% in size. Algorithms t-ICF, t-RCFP and t-RENN can build similar case-bases to the original with a 10–50% size reduction, although they are not totally equivalent since they have significantly different average results than the original case-base. Finally, algorithm t-RENN does not significantly reduce the size of the case-base because it commonly deletes cases describing abnormal scenarios. We demonstrate that the proposed temporal CBR system is able to detect the different proposed risk scenarios when there is a large number of cases. That is, the CBR systems are useful in the long term. Experiments indicate that the temporal CBM algorithms analysed are able to reduce case-bases successfully to detect abnormal scenarios. However, success in creating a maintained case-base equivalent to the original depends on the number of cases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Case-base maintenance; Case-based reasoning; Smart homes","Automation; Data integration; Information management; Intelligent buildings; Maintenance; Risk perception; Behaviour patterns; Case base maintenance; Case based maintenances; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Loss of consciousness; Smart homes; Temporal dimensions; Temporal event sequences; Case based reasoning",2-s2.0-85025679174

These biomaterials benefit from retaining a large amount of water, effective mass transfer, similarity to natural tissues and the ability to form different shapes. However, having relatively poor mechanical properties is a limiting factor associated with hydrogel biomaterials. Controlling the biomechanical properties of hydrogels is of paramount importance. In this work, firstly, mechanical characteristics of hydrogels and methods employed for characterizing these properties are explored. Subsequently, the most common approaches used for tuning mechanical properties of hydrogels including but are not limited to, interpenetrating polymer networks, nanocomposites, self-assembly techniques, and co-polymerization are discussed. The performance of different techniques used for tuning biomechanical properties of hydrogels is further compared. Such techniques involve lithography techniques for replication of tissues with complex mechanical profiles; microfluidic techniques applicable for generating gradients of mechanical properties in hydrogel biomaterials for engineering complex human tissues like intervertebral discs, osteochondral tissues, blood vessels and skin layers; and electrospinning techniques for synthesis of hybrid hydrogels and highly ordered fibers with tunable mechanical and biological properties. We finally discuss future perspectives and challenges for controlling biomimetic hydrogel materials possessing proper biomechanical properties. Statement of Significance Hydrogels biomaterials are essential constituting components of engineered tissues with the applications in regenerative medicine and drug delivery. The mechanical properties of hydrogels play crucial roles in regulating the interactions between cells and extracellular matrix and directing the cells phenotype and genotype. Despite significant advances in developing methods and techniques with the ability of tuning the biomechanical properties of hydrogels, there are still challenges regarding the synthesis of hydrogels with complex mechanical profiles as well as limitations in vascularization and patterning of complex structures of natural tissues which barricade the production of sophisticated organs. Therefore, in addition to a review on advanced methods and techniques for measuring a variety of different biomechanical characteristics of hydrogels, the new techniques for enhancing the biomechanics of hydrogels are presented.

The understanding, interface and interaction with heating controls hold the potential to influence how heating is operated and, in turn, how much energy is consumed. A study is presented to test a series of hypotheses that the design of the home-heating interface can positively influence the achievement of home-heating goals, if it is specifically designed to communicate a user mental model (UMM) of how the system functions. This would encourage appropriate inhabitant behaviour. The experiment involved 20 pairs of participants matched by age, gender and home-heating experience. The participants were asked to attain a series of home-heating goals using an accelerated home-heating simulator. The impact of specific design features of a novel interface design was compared with an interface offering a traditional home-heating system experience. The evidence confirms that design features contributed to differences in UMMs, intentional behaviour and goal achievement. A mental model approach to design can be used as a means of putting users ‘in control’ of their heating system to enable them to fulfil their home-heating goals better. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","behaviour change; design; energy; energy conservation; feedback; mental models; occupants; space heating","Cognitive systems; Design; Energy conservation; Feedback; Heating equipment; Space heating; Behaviour changes; Design features; energy; Interface designs; Mental model; Occupant behaviour; occupants; System functions; Heating",2-s2.0-85031489625

As the Linux kernel forms the central part of various operating systems that are used by millions of users, the kernel must be continuously adapted to the changing demands and expectations of these users. The Linux kernel provides its services to an application through system calls. The combined set of all system calls forms the essential Application Programming Interface (API) through which an application interacts with the kernel. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 8,770 changes that were made to Linux system calls during the last decade (i.e., from April 2005 to December 2014). In particular, we study the size of the changes, and we manually identify the type of changes and bug fixes that were made. Our analysis provides an overview of the evolution of the Linux system calls over the last decade. We find that there was a considerable amount of technical debt in the kernel, that was addressed by adding a number of sibling calls (i.e., 26% of all system calls). In addition, we find that by far, the ptrace() and signal handling system calls are the most challenging to maintain.

A comparison of three crystal structures of Leishmania major fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (LmFBPase) along with enzyme kinetic data show how AMP acts as an allosteric inhibitor and provides insight into its metal-dependent reaction mechanism. The crystal structure of the apoenzyme form of LmFBPase is a homotetramer in which the dimer of dimers adopts a planar conformation with disordered “dynamic loops”. The structure of LmFBPase, complexed with manganese and its catalytic product phosphate, shows the dynamic loops locked into the active sites. A third crystal structure of LmFBPase complexed with its allosteric inhibitor AMP shows an inactive form of the tetramer, in which the dimer pairs are rotated by 18° relative to each other. The three structures suggest an allosteric mechanism in which AMP binding triggers a rearrangement of hydrogen bonds across the large and small interfaces. Retraction of the “effector loop” required for AMP binding releases the side chain of His23 from the dimer–dimer interface. This is coupled with a flip of the side chain of Arg48 which ties down the key catalytic dynamic loop in a disengaged conformation and also locks the tetramer in an inactive rotated T-state. The structure of the effector site of LmFBPase shows different structural features compared with human FBPases, thereby offering a potential and species-specific drug target. © 2017","allostery; crystal structure; enzyme kinetics; gluconeogenesis; leishmaniasis","adenosine phosphate; apoenzyme; arginine; fructose 2,6 bisphosphate; fructose bisphosphatase; manganese; metal ion; phosphate; tetramer; adenosine phosphate; coenzyme; enzyme inhibitor; fructose bisphosphatase; protein binding; allosterism; Article; catalysis; controlled study; crystal structure; enzyme active site; enzyme conformation; enzyme structure; hydrogen bond; Leishmania major; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nonhuman; priority journal; sequence alignment; species difference; structure analysis; thermostability; allosterism; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; coenzyme; enzymology; human; kinetics; metabolism; molecular model; protein conformation; protein multimerization; X ray crystallography; Adenosine Monophosphate; Allosteric Regulation; Coenzymes; Crystallography, X-Ray; Enzyme Inhibitors; Fructose-Bisphosphatase; Humans; Kinetics; Leishmania major; Manganese; Models, Molecular; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Multimerization",2-s2.0-85029620159

This paper presents a detailed coupled hydro-mechanical analysis to study the effects of nearby natural fractures on hydraulically induced fracture propagation and changes in fracture permeability. Two rock domains were considered in comparison: FD1, with one fracture, and FD2, with two adjacent parallel or non-parallel fractures. It was assumed that water injection occurred in a borehole that intersected the single fracture in FD1 and one of the two fractures in FD2. Simulations were made for a time period of 3 h with an injection period of 2 h followed by 1 h of shut-in. An elastic-brittle model based on the degradation of material properties was implemented in a 2D finite-difference scheme and used for elements of the intact rock subjected to tension and shear failure. The intact rock was considered to have a low but non-negligible permeability. A verification study against analytical solutions showed that the fracture propagation and stress concentrations due to differential boundary stresses could be accurately represented by our model. Next, a base case was considered, in which the stress ratio (SR) between the magnitudes of the maximum and minimum boundary stresses, the permeability kR of the intact rock and the initial permeability kTF of the tension failure regions were fixed. In FD2, the distance dF between the two natural fractures defined by the closest distance was also fixed. The results showed that in both rock domains, the fracture started to propagate when the pore pressure was approximately 85% of the magnitude of the minimum boundary stress. The propagation of a single fracture was significantly greater than the propagation of a double fracture system because, in the latter case, the pore pressure decreased when the two fractures connected. As a result, changes in permeability in FD2 were smaller than in FD1. At the end of injection, the maximum ratios between the final and initial permeability of the natural fractures were found to be approximately 3 and 2 for rock domains FD1 and FD2, respectively. For non-parallel fractures, the controlling factor for fracture propagation was the separation between the tips of the pressurised fracture and the neighbouring non-pressurised fracture. A sensitivity study was conducted to study the influence of the key parameters dF, SR, kR and kTF on the simulation results. Fracture propagation showed more sensitivity to dF and SR than to the other parameters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Coupled hydro-mechanical effects; Elastic-brittle model; Fracture propagation and connectivity; Hydraulic fracturing stimulation; Permeability changes","Brittle fracture; Finite difference method; Hydraulic fracturing; Mechanical permeability; Oil well flooding; Pore pressure; Rocks; Water injection; Coupled hydro mechanicals; Finite difference scheme; Fracture permeability; Fracture propagation; Fracturing operations; Hydraulically induced fractures; Initial permeability; Permeability change; Fracture",2-s2.0-85028517275

(2) How are the reactions/inputs collected from the participants in response to the stimuli in the studies?

The main aim of this article was to describe the challenging design process of an interactive artwork for nursing home residents, in co-creation with all stakeholders and to share the used methods and lessons learned. This process is illustrated by the design of the interface of VENSTER as a case. Methods: Nursing home residents from the psychogeriatric ward, informal caregivers, client representatives, health care professionals and members of the management team were involved in the design process, which consisted of three phases: (1) identify requirements, (2) develop a prototype and (3) conduct usability tests. Several methods were used (e.g. guided co-creation sessions, “Wizard of Oz”). Each phase generated “lessons learned”, which were used as the departure point of the next phase. Results: Participants hardly paid attention to the installation and interface. There, however, seemed to be an untapped potential for creating an immersive experience by focussing more on the content itself as an interface (e.g. creating specific scenes with cues for interaction, scenes based on existing knowledge or prior experiences). “Fifteen lessons learned” which can potentially assist the design of an interactive artwork for nursing home residents suffering from dementia were derived from the design process. Conclusions: This description provides tools and best practices for stakeholders to make (better) informed choices during the creation of interactive artworks. It also illustrates how co-design can make the difference between designing a pleasurable experience and a meaningful one.Implications for rehabilitationCo-design with all stakeholders can make the difference between designing a pleasurable experience and a meaningful one.There seems to be an untapped potential for creating an immersive experience by focussing more on the content itself as an interface (e.g. creating specific scenes with cues for interaction, scenes based on existing knowledge or prior experiences).

Nanofibers, characterized by high porosity, flexibility, and a large specific surface area, are the ideal material for ultrasensitive, fast-responding, and user-friendly sensor design. Indeed, a large specific surface area increases the sensitivity and response time of the sensor as the contact area with the analyte is enlarged. Thanks to the flexibility of membranes, nanofibrous sensors cannot only be applied in high-end analyte detection, but also in personal, daily use. Many different nanofibrous sensors have already been designed; albeit, the most straightforward and easiest-to-interpret sensor response is a visual change in color, which is of particular interest in the case of warning signals. Recently, many researchers have focused on the design of so-called colorimetric nanofibers, which typically involve the incorporation of a colorimetric functionality into the nanofibrous matrix. Many different strategies have been used and explored for colorimetric nanofibrous sensor design, which are outlined in this feature article. The many examples and applications demonstrate the value of colorimetric nanofibers for advanced optical sensor design, and could provide directions for future research in this area. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The energetic component system is composed of four main components, namely a donor unit (HNS+HMX), a bulkhead (STS), an acceptor explosive (RDX), and a propellant (BKNO3) for gas generation. The pressurized gases generated from the burning propellant were purged into a 10 cc release chamber for study of the inherent oscillatory flow induced by the interferences between shock and rarefaction waves. The pressure fluctuations measured from experiment and calculation were investigated to further validate the peculiar peak at specific characteristic frequency (ωc = 8.3 kHz).

BDP-1 has a longer linker between the phenothiazine and the BODIPY chromophore than BDP-2. Moreover, the two chromophores in BDP-2 assume a more orthogonal geometry both at the ground and in the first excited state (87°) than that of BDP-1 (34-40°).

Many different materials have been proposed for use in such a process, the process requiring fast CO2 absorption reaction kinetics as well as being able to cycle the material for multiple cycles without loss of capacity. Lithium ternary oxide materials, and in particular Li2ZrO3, have displayed promising performance, but further modifications are needed to improve their rate of reaction with CO2. Previous studies have linked rates of lithium ionic conduction with CO2 absorption in similar materials, and in this work we present work aimed at exploring the effect of aliovalent doping on the efficacy of Li2ZrO3 as a CO2 sorbent. Using a combination of X-ray powder diffraction, theoretical calculations, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we studied the impact of Nb, Ta, and Y doping on the structure, Li ionic motion, and CO2 absorption properties of Li2ZrO3. These methods allowed us to characterize the theoretical and experimental doping limit into the pure material, suggesting that vacancies formed upon doping are not fully disordered but instead are correlated to the dopant atom positions, limiting the solubility range. Characterization of the lithium motion using variable-temperature solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance confirms that interstitial doping with Y retards the movement of Li ions in the structure, whereas vacancy doping with Nb or Ta results in a similar activation energy as observed for nominally pure Li2ZrO3. However, a marked reduction in the CO2 absorption of the Nb- and Ta-doped samples suggests that doping also leads to a change in the carbonation equilibrium of Li2ZrO3, disfavoring the CO2 absorption at the reaction temperature. This study shows that a complex mixture of structural, kinetic, and dynamic factors can influence the performance of Li-based materials for CCS and underscores the importance of balancing these different factors in order to optimize the process. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation energy; Calculations; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Doping (additives); Lithium; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Reaction kinetics; Thermogravimetric analysis; Vacancies; X ray powder diffraction; Aliovalent doping; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); First-principles calculation; Reaction temperature; Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance; Ternary oxide material; Theoretical calculations; Variable temperature; Nuclear magnetic resonance",2-s2.0-85031330383

Membrane lipids with 2H-labeled acyl chains or polar head groups are studied using 2H NMR to yield knowledge of their atomistic structures in relation to equilibrium properties. This review demonstrates the principles and applications of solid-state NMR by unifying dipolar and quadrupolar interactions and highlights the unique features offered by solid-state 2H NMR with experimental illustrations. For randomly oriented multilamellar lipids or aligned membranes, solid-state 2H NMR enables direct measurement of residual quadrupolar couplings (RQCs) due to individual C-2H-labeled segments. The distribution of RQC values gives nearly complete profiles of the segmental order parameters SCD(i) as a function of acyl segment position (i). Alternatively, one can measure residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) for natural abundance lipid samples to obtain segmental SCH order parameters. A theoretical mean-torque model provides acyl-packing profiles representing the cumulative chain extension along the normal to the aqueous interface. Equilibrium structural properties of fluid bilayers and various thermodynamic quantities can then be calculated, which describe the interactions with cholesterol, detergents, peptides, and integral membrane proteins and formation of lipid rafts. One can also obtain direct information for membrane-bound peptides or proteins by measuring RDCs using magic-angle spinning (MAS) in combination with dipolar recoupling methods. Solid-state NMR methods have been extensively applied to characterize model membranes and membrane-bound peptides and proteins, giving unique information on their conformations, orientations, and interactions in the natural liquid-crystalline state. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Biological membranes; Chains; Couplings; Crystalline materials; Light polarization; Lipid bilayers; Lipids; Magic angle spinning; Membranes; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Peptides; Proteins; Soaps (detergents); Equilibrium properties; Equilibrium structural properties; Integral membrane proteins; Liquid crystalline state; Quadrupolar interactions; Residual dipolar coupling (RDCs); Solid-state NMR spectroscopy; Thermodynamic quantities; Phase interfaces; lipid bilayer; chemistry; lipid bilayer; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; thermodynamics; Lipid Bilayers; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Thermodynamics",2-s2.0-85031096703

Mental workload estimation is especially important for particular people such as pilots, soldiers, crew and surgeons to guarantee the safety and security. Different physiological signals have been used to estimate mental workload based on the n-back task which is capable of inducing different mental workload levels. This paper explores a feature weight driven signal fusion method and proposes interactive mutual information modeling (IMIM) to increase the mental workload classification accuracy. We used EEG and ECG signals to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for heterogeneous bio-signal fusion. The experiment of mental workload estimation consisted of signal recording, artifact removal, feature extraction, feature weight calculation, and classification. Ten subjects were invited to take part in easy, medium and hard tasks for the collection of EEG and ECG signals in different mental workload levels. Therefore, heterogeneous physiological signals of different mental workload states were available for classification. Experiments reveal that ECG can be utilized as a supplement of EEG to optimize the fusion model and improve mental workload estimation. Classification results show that the proposed bio-signal fusion method IMIM can increase the classification accuracy in both feature level and classifier level fusion. This study indicates that multi-modal signal fusion is promising to identify the mental workload levels and the fusion strategy has potential application of mental workload estimation in cognitive activities during daily life. © 2017 by the authors.

With the help of lenses, sunlight is concentrated onto miniature, highly efficient multi-junction solar cells with a photovoltaic performance above 40%. To ensure illumination with direct radiation, CPV modules must be installed on trackers to follow the sun's path. However, the costs of huge concentration optics and the photovoltaic technology used, narrow the market possibilities for CPV technology. Efforts to reduce these costs are being undertaken by the promotion of Cu(Inx,Ga1-x)Se2 solar cells to take over the high cost multi-junction solar cells and implementing more compact devices by minimization of solar cell area.

Computational approaches to understand this puzzle face three major challenges: (i) unfolded ensembles are usually neglected, (ii) simulation studies of the folded states are often too short, and (iii) the majority of investigations focus on a few protein pairs, obscuring the prevalence of different strategies across multiple protein systems. We address these concerns by carrying out all-atom simulations to characterize physicochemical properties of both the folded and the disordered ensemble in multiple (12) thermophilic-mesophilic homologous protein pairs. We notice two clear trends in most pairs (10 out of 12). First, specific distribution of charges in the native basin - sampled from multimicrosecond long Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories - leads to more favorable electrostatic interaction energy in thermophiles compared to mesophiles. Next, thermophilic proteins have lowered electrostatic interaction in their unfolded state - generated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation - compared to their mesophilic counterparts. The net contribution of interaction energy to folding stability, however, remains more favorable in thermophiles compared to mesophiles. The overall contribution of electrostatics quantified by combining the net interaction energy and the solvation penalty of folding - due to differential charge burial in the folded and the unfolded ensemble - is also mostly favorable in thermophilic proteins compared to mesophiles. The systems that deviate from this trend provide interesting test cases to learn more about alternate design strategies when modification of charges is not viable due to functional reasons. The unequal contribution of the unfolded state to the stability in thermophiles and mesophiles highlights the importance of modeling the disordered ensemble to understand thermophilic adaptation as well as protein stability, in general.

This unique combination of properties results in multifunctional coatings that are a zwitterionic derivative of intrinsically conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) synthesized via oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD).

EMT allows epithelial cells to lose their highly adhesive nature and instead adopt the spindle-like appearance, as well as the invasive and migratory behavior, of mesenchymal cells. We hypothesize that a bistable switch between the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes governs EMT, allowing the cell to maintain its mesenchymal phenotype even after it leaves the primary tumor microenvironment and EMT-inducing extracellular signal. Results: This work presents a simple mathematical model of EMT, specifically the roles played by four key proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway: Dishevelled (Dvl), E-cadherin, β-catenin, and Slug. The model predicts that following activation of the Wnt pathway, an epithelial cell in the primary carcinoma must attain a threshold level of membrane-bound Dvl to convert to the mesenchymal-like phenotype and maintain that phenotype once it has migrated away from the primary tumor. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of the model suggests that in both the epithelial and the mesenchymal states, the steady state behavior of E-cadherin and the transcription factor Slug are sensitive to changes in the degradation rate of Slug, while E-cadherin is also sensitive to the IC50 (half-maximal) concentration of Slug necessary to inhibit E-cadherin production. The steady state behavior of Slug exhibits sensitivity to changes in the rate at which it is induced by β-catenin upon activation of the Wnt pathway. In the presence of sufficient amount of Wnt ligand, E-cadherin levels are sensitive to the ratio of the rate of Slug activation via β-catenin to the IC50 concentration of Slug necessary to inhibit E-cadherin production. Conclusions: The sensitivity of E-cadherin to the degradation rate of Slug, as well as the IC50 concentration of Slug necessary to inhibit E-cadherin production, shows how the adhesive nature of the cell depends on finely-tuned regulation of Slug. By highlighting the role of β-catenin in the activation of EMT and the relationship between E-cadherin and Slug, this model identifies critical parameters of therapeutic concern, such as the threshold level of Dvl necessary to inactivate the GSK-3β complex mediating β-catenin degradation, the rate at which β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, and the IC50 concentration of Slug needed to inhibit E-cadherin production. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bistable; Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT); Wnt",,2-s2.0-85031046237

Experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are the preferred forms of protein structure determination and have achieved great success over the most recent decades. Computational methods may be an alternative when experimental techniques fail. However, computational methods are severely limited when it comes to predicting larger macromolecule structures with little sequence similarity to known structures. The incorporation of experimental restraints in computational methods is becoming increasingly important to more reliably predict protein structure. One such experimental input used in structure prediction and refinement is cryo-EM densities. Recent advances in cryo-EM have arguably revolutionized the field of structural biology. Our previously developed cryo-EM-guided Rosetta-MD protocol has shown great promise in the refinement of soluble protein structures. In this study, we extended cryo-EM density-guided iterative Rosetta-MD to membrane proteins. We also improved the methodology in general by picking models based on a combination of their score and fit-to-density during the Rosetta model selection. By doing so, we have been able to pick models superior to those with the previous selection based on Rosetta score only and we have been able to further improve our previously refined models of soluble proteins. The method was tested with five membrane spanning protein structures. By applying density-guided Rosetta-MD iteratively we were able to refine the predicted structures of these membrane proteins to atomic resolutions. We also showed that the resolution of the density maps determines the improvement and quality of the refined models. By incorporating high-resolution density maps (â4 Å), we were able to more significantly improve the quality of the models than when medium-resolution maps (6.9 Å) were used.

Progress in experimental techniques has provided a large number of high-resolution structures of viruses and viruslike particles (VLP), while molecular dynamics simulations may furnish lively and complementary insights on the fundamental forces ruling viral assembly, stability, and dynamics. However, the large size and complexity of these macromolecular assemblies pose significant computational challenges. Alternatively, Coarse-Grained (CG) methods, which resign atomistic resolution privileging computational efficiency, can be used to characterize the dynamics of VLPs. Still, the massive amount of solvent present in empty capsids or envelopes suggests that hybrid schemes keeping a higher resolution on regions of interest (i.e., the viral proteins and their surroundings) and a progressively coarser description on the bulk may further improve efficiency. Here we introduce a mesoscale explicit water model to be used in double- or triple-scale simulations in combination with popular atomistic parameters and the CG water used by the SIRAH force field. Simulations performed on VLPs of different sizes, along with a comprehensive analysis of the PDB, indicate that most of the VLPs so far reported are amenable to be handled on a GPU-accelerated desktop computer using this simulation scheme. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,,2-s2.0-85032184322

The GOES flare started at 00:21:35 and peaked at 00:26:30 UT. The IRIS slit pointed near the center of the flare, while the EIS slit pointed 35 to its west. About 4 minutes before the GOES flare start, the IRIS C II and Si IV intensities became (and remained) greater than their pre-flare averages, indicating that the flare had begun and that the chromosphere and transition region were involved. IRIS first detected blueshifted Fe XXI emission at 00:22:42 UT, by which time the C II and Si IV intensities had increased by factors around 100 and their profiles were redshifted. Simultaneous, cospatial blueshifted Fe XXI emission with redshifted C II and Si IV emission indicates explosive chromospheric evaporation. EIS spectra reveal Fe XXIII emission that is too weak to measure velocities, and intensity enhancements by factors about 1.7 in the Fe XIV and Fe XVI emission. Lines from both of these coronal ions show redshifts ≈9 km s-1 around 00:24:00 UT, and the Fe XIV 264.7/274.2 intensity ratio reveals an increase of ne from (1.03 ± 0.20) × 109 before to (3.58 ± 0.68) × 109 cm-3 during the flare. The redshifted coronal line emission and increased ne are consistent with warm rain falling and accumulating in the remote area observed by EIS. A fit to the RHESSI hard X-ray spectrum yields a nonthermal energy injection rate of 4.9 × 1026 erg s-1, from which we estimate a HXR beam energy flux range consistent with explosive evaporation. © 2017.

However, traditional exoskeletons involve the use of complex rigid systems that impede the natural movement of joints, and thus reduce the wearability and cause discomfort to the user. The objective of this paper is to design and evaluate a soft robotic glove that is able to provide hand function assistance using fabric-reinforced soft pneumatic actuators. These actuators are made of silicone rubber which has an elastic modulus similar to human tissues. Thus, they are intrinsically soft and compliant. Upon air pressurization, they are able to support finger range of motion (ROM) and generate the desired actuation of the finger joints. In this work, the soft actuators were characterized in terms of their blocked tip force, normal and frictional grip force outputs. Combining the soft actuators and flexible textile materials, a soft robotic glove was developed for grasping assistance during ADL for stroke survivors. The glove was evaluated on five healthy participants for its assisted ROM and grip strength. Pilot test was performed in two stroke survivors to evaluate the efficacy of the glove in assisting functional grasping activities. Our results demonstrated that the actuators designed in this study could generate desired force output at a low air pressure. The glove had a high kinematic transparency and did not affect the active ROM of the finger joints when it was being worn by the participants. With the assistance of the glove, the participants were able to perform grasping actions with sufficient assisted ROM and grip strength, without any voluntary effort. Additionally, pilot test on stroke survivors demonstrated that the patient's grasping performance improved with the presence and assistance of the glove. Patient feedback questionnaires also showed high level of patient satisfaction and comfort. In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated the possibility of using soft wearable exoskeletons that are more wearable, lightweight, and suitable to be used on a daily basis for hand function assistance of stroke survivors during activities of daily living. © 2017 Yap, Lim, Nasrallah and Yeow.","Activities of daily living; Hand exoskeleton; Rehabilitation; Soft actuators; Soft robotic","adult; Article; cerebrovascular accident; comfort; controlled study; daily life activity; equipment design; feasibility study; female; grip strength; hand function; human; human experiment; kinematics; male; muscle contraction; normal human; patient satisfaction; pilot study; range of motion; soft robotic glove; survivor",2-s2.0-85030677491

However, their underlying fundamental biological vs. engineering mechanisms are, by definition, dramatically different and can even be antithetical. Even our approach to each is diametrically opposite: inductive science for the study of biological systems vs. engineering synthesis for the design and construction of robotic systems. The past 20 years have seen several conceptual advances in both fields and the quest to unify them. Chief among them is the reluctant recognition that their underlying fundamental mechanisms may actually share limited common ground, while exhibiting many fundamental differences. This recognition is particularly liberating because it allows us to resolve and move beyond multiple paradoxes and contradictions that arose from the initial reasonable assumption of a large common ground. Here, we begin by introducing the perspective of neuromechanics, which emphasizes that real-world behavior emerges from the intimate interactions among the physical structure of the system, the mechanical requirements of a task, the feasible neural control actions to produce it, and the ability of the neuromuscular system to adapt through interactions with the environment. This allows us to articulate a succinct overview of a few salient conceptual paradoxes and contradictions regarding under-determined vs. over-determined mechanics, under- vs. over-actuated control, prescribed vs. emergent function, learning vs. implementation vs. adaptation, prescriptive vs. descriptive synergies, and optimal vs. habitual performance. We conclude by presenting open questions and suggesting directions for future research. We hope this frank and open-minded assessment of the state-of-the-art will encourage and guide these communities to continue to interact and make progress in these important areas at the interface of neuromechanics, neuroscience, rehabilitation and robotics. © 2017 The Author(s).","Hand; Neuromuscular control; Prosthetics",,2-s2.0-85031122765

Glial cell-derived tumors and the cells derived from them are highly heterogeneous and variable in their mechanical properties, their response to treatments, and their properties in vitro. Some glioma samples are stiffer than normal brain when measured ex vivo, but even those that are soft in vitro stiffen after deformation by pressure gradients that arise in the tumor environment in vivo. Such mechanical differences can strongly alter the phenotype of cultured glioma cells. Alternatively, chemical signaling might elicit the same phenotype as increased stiffness by activating intracellular messengers common to both initial stimuli. In this study the responses of three different human glioma cell lines to changes in substrate stiffness are compared with their responses on very soft substrates composed of a combination of hyaluronic acid and a specific integrin ligand, either laminin or collagen I. By quantifying cell morphology, stiffness, motility, proliferation, and secretion of the cytokine IL-8, glioma cell responses to increased stiffness are shown to be nearly identically elicited by substrates containing hyaluronic acid, even in the absence of increased stiffness. PI3-kinase activity was required for the response to hyaluronan but not to stiffness. This outcome suggests that hyaluronic acid can trigger the same cellular response, as can be obtained by mechanical force transduced from a stiff environment, and demonstrates that chemical and mechanical features of the tumor microenvironment can achieve equivalent reactions in cancer cells. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Biomechanics; Cell culture; Collagen; Cytology; Diseases; Enzyme activity; Hyaluronic acid; Organic acids; Stiffness; Substrates; Tumors; Cellular response; Glioma cell lines; Integrin ligands; Intracellular messengers; Mechanical feature; Mechanical force; Substrate stiffness; Tumor microenvironment; Cells; collagen type 1; glycosaminoglycan; Hermes antigen; hyaluronic acid; interleukin 8; laminin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; polyacrylamide gel; protein; proteoglycan; rhamm protein; unclassified drug; vimentin; wortmannin; adherent cell; Article; cell migration; cell motility; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell spreading; cell structure; controlled study; cytokine release; cytoskeleton; enzyme activity; ex vivo study; glioblastoma; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; phenotype; pressure gradient; priority journal; rigidity; tumor microenvironment; Young modulus",2-s2.0-85031283346

Patients with mild deformities are generally treated conservatively by using the so called Vacuum Bell (VB) i.e. a suction cup to be placed on the patient's sternal region. Three different sizes, as well as a model fitted for young women, of VB are available on the market. Unfortunately, the variability of the surface to be treated, the possible asymmetry of the caved-in area and the prolonged use, can make the device uncomfortable and, in some cases, ineffective for the patient. In order to cope with these issues, the present paper proposes a computer-aided method for customized vacuum bell design to be used by non-expert user, e.g. by medical staff. In particular, the present work entails the development of a system comprising: 1) a dedicated software capable of acquiring the 3D chest geometry - by using a low-cost range sensor, i.e. Kinect v2 - and of processing the point cloud so to generate NURBS surfaces of the chest; 2) a procedural CAD modeling of a personalized VB implemented within Siemens NX 11 CAD environment. Using the devised method, the medical staff is required only to use the 3D scanning system for acquiring the patient chest and to sketch, in a CAD-based interface, the boundary of the area to be treated. Once these tasks are performed, the system automatically builds the personalized VB model, ready to be manufactured. © 2017 CAD Solutions, LLC","design customization; Procedural CAD modeling; reverse engineering; vacuum bell","Bells; Patient treatment; Reverse engineering; CAD modeling; Computer aided methods; Costal cartilages; Design customization; Different sizes; NURBS surface; Range sensors; Semi-automatics; Computer aided design",2-s2.0-85030694087

This study aims to find user interface (UI) priorities according to older user groups based on their lifestyle and develop quality of UI (QUI) models for large electronic home appliances and mobile products. Methods: A segmentation table designed to show how older users can be categorized was created through a review of the literature to survey 252 subjects with a questionnaire. Factor analysis was performed to extract six preliminary lifestyle factors, which were then used for subsequent cluster analysis. The analysis resulted in four groups. Cross-analysis was carried out to investigate which characteristics were included in the groups. Analysis of variance was then applied to investigate the differences in the UI priorities among the user groups for various electronic devices. Finally, QUI models were developed and applied to those electronic devices. Results: Differences in UI priorities were found according to the four lifestyles (“money-oriented,” “innovation-oriented,” “stability- and simplicity-oriented,” and “innovation- and intellectual-oriented”). Twelve QUI models were developed for four different lifestyle groups associated with different products. Three washers and three smartphones were used as an example for testing the QUI models. Conclusion: The UI differences of the older user groups by the segmentation in this study using several key (i.e., demographic, socioeconomic, and physical-cognitive) variables are distinct from earlier studies made by a single variable. The differences in responses clearly indicate the benefits of integrating various factors of older users, rather than single variable, in order to design and develop more innovative and better consumer products in the future. The results of this study showed that older users with a potentially high buying power in the future are likely to have higher satisfaction when selecting products customized for their lifestyle. Designers could also use the results of UI evaluation for older users based on their lifestyle before developing products through QUI modeling.

Very modest decreases were observed in the elasticity modulus of printed nanocomposites (~ 14%, compared to that of bulk counterparts), indicating excellent interlayer adhesion and superior performance to those reported in literature. Consequently, the conductivity was largely preserved after printing, in both through-layer and cross-layer directions.

These guiding principles relegate the operator to a monitoring role, increasing risks for humans to lack system understanding. The out of the loop performance problem arises when operators suffer from complacency and vigilance decrement; consequently, when automation does not behave as expected, understanding the system or taking back manual control may be difficult. Close to the out of the loop problem, mind wandering points to the propensity of the human mind to think about matters unrelated to the task at hand. This article reviews the literature related to both mind wandering and the out of the loop performance problem as it relates to task automation. We highlight studies showing how these phenomena interact with each other while impacting human performance within highly automated systems. We analyze how this proximity is supported by effects observed in automated environment, such as decoupling, sensory attention, and cognitive comprehension decrease.

Such information can potentially be exploited to make devices and interfaces more user aware. In this line of research, we took a further step by studying neural correlates of different levels of cognitive processes and developing a method that allows to quantify how deeply presented information is processed in the brain. Methods/Approach: Seventeen participants took part in an EEG study in which we evaluated different levels of cognitive processing (no processing, shallow, and deep processing) within three distinct domains (memory, language, and visual imagination). Our investigations showed gradual differences in the amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERPs) and in the extend and duration of event-related desynchronization (ERD) which both correlate with task difficulty. We performed multi-modal classification to map the measured correlates of neurocognitive processing to the corresponding level of processing. Results: Successful classification of the neural components was achieved, which reflects the level of cognitive processing performed by the participants. The results show performances above chance level for each participant and a mean performance of 70-90% for all conditions and classification pairs. Significance: The successful estimation of the level of cognition on a single-trial basis supports the feasibility of user-state adaptation based on ongoing neural activity. There is a variety of potential use cases such as: a user-friendly adaptive design of an interface or the development of assistance systems in safety critical workplaces. © 2017 Nicolae, Acqualagna and Blankertz.","Cognitive processes; Encephalography (EEG); Event-related potentials (ERPs); Oscillatory activity; Single-trial classification","adult; classification; clinical article; electroencephalogram; event related potential; feasibility study; female; human; imagination; language; male; memory; nervous system; workplace",2-s2.0-85030705675

However, while considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of their technological realization, the ability of robots to interact with humans in an intuitive and social way is still quite limited. An important challenge for social robotics is to determine how to design robots that can perceive the user's needs, feelings, and intentions, and adapt to users over a broad range of cognitive abilities. It is conceivable that if robots were able to adequately demonstrate these skills, humans would eventually accept them as social companions. We argue that the best way to achieve this is using a systematic experimental approach based on behavioral and physiological neuroscience methods such as motion/eye-tracking, electroencephalography, or functional near-infrared spectroscopy embedded in interactive human-robot paradigms. This approach requires understanding how humans interact with each other, how they perform tasks together and how they develop feelings of social connection over time, and using these insights to formulate design principles that make social robots attuned to the workings of the human brain. In this review, we put forward the argument that the likelihood of artificial agents being perceived as social companions can be increased by designing them in a way that they are perceived as intentional agents that activate areas in the human brain involved in social-cognitive processing. We first review literature related to social-cognitive processes and mechanisms involved in human-human interactions, and highlight the importance of perceiving others as intentional agents to activate these social brain areas. We then discuss how attribution of intentionality can positively affect human-robot interaction by (a) fostering feelings of social connection, empathy and prosociality, and by (b) enhancing performance on joint human-robot tasks. Lastly, we describe circumstances under which attribution of intentionality to robot agents might be disadvantageous, and discuss challenges associated with designing social robots that are inspired by neuroscientific principles. © 2017 Wiese, Metta and Wykowska.","Attribution of intentionality; Human-robot interaction; Mind perception; Social neuroscience; Social robotics",,2-s2.0-85030532644

Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.","Aging; Focus groups; Older adults; Qualitative; Tablet computers; Technology",,2-s2.0-85030531151

Despite the numerous studies, their roles in health and disease remain to be fully disclosed. The recent discovery of AuIII complexes as potent and selective inhibitors of aquaglyceroporin isoforms paves the way to their possible therapeutic application. The binding of the selective human AQP3 inhibitor, the cationic complex [Au(bipy)Cl2]+ (Aubipy), to the protein channel has been investigated here by means of a multi-level theoretical workflow that includes QM, MD and QM/MM approaches. The hydroxo complex was identified as the prevalent form of Aubipy in physiological media and its binding to AQP3 studied by MD. Both non-covalent and coordinative Aubipy–AQP3 adducts were simulated to probe their role in the modulation of water channel functionality. The electronic structures of representative Aubipy–AQP3 adducts were then analysed to unveil the role played by the metal moiety in their stabilisation. This study spotlights the overall importance of three key aspects for AQP3 inhibition: 1) water speciation of the AuIII complex, 2) stability of non-covalent adducts and 3) conformational changes induced within the pore by the coordinative binding of AuIII. The obtained results are expected to orient future developments in the design of isoform-selective AuIII inhibitors. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Aside from using this remarkable ability to exploit the terrestrial magnetic field map to sense direction, a subset is also able to implement a version of the so-called geophysical positioning system. How do these animals detect magnetic fields? The answer to this rather deceptively simple question has proven to be quite elusive. The currently prevalent theories, while providing interesting insights, fall short of explaining several aspects of magnetoreception. For example, minute magnetic particles have been detected in magnetically sensitive animals. However, how is the detected magnetic field converted into electrical signals given any lack of experimental evidence for relevant electroreceptors? In principle, a magnetoelectric material is capable of converting magnetic signals into electricity (and vice versa). This property, however, is rare and restricted to a rather small set of exotic hard crystalline materials. Indeed, such elements have never been detected in the animals studied so far. In this work we quantitatively outline the conditions under which a biological cell may detect a magnetic field and convert it into electrical signals detectable by biological cells. Specifically, we prove the existence of an overlooked strain-mediated mechanism and show that most biological cells can act as nontrivial magnetoelectric materials provided that the magnetic permeability constant is only slightly more than that of a vacuum. The enhanced magnetic permeability is easily achieved by small amounts of magnetic particles that have been experimentally detected in magnetosensitive animals. Our proposed mechanism appears to explain most of the experimental observations related to the physical basis of magnetoreception. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,"Animals; Biological materials; Biomagnetism; Cells; Crystalline materials; Cytology; Geomagnetism; Magnetic fields; Magnetic permeability; Vacuum applications; Electrical signal; Experimental evidence; Magnetic particle; Magneto sensitives; Magnetoelectric materials; Physical mechanism; Positioning system; Terrestrial magnetic fields; Magnetism",2-s2.0-85030997010

Cigarette smokings is currently accountable for more than 480,000 deaths each year in United States (US) and is the leading cause of preventable death in the US. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers and if smoking continues at its current proportion among adolescents, one in every 13 Americans aged 17 years or younger is expected to die prematurely from a smoking-related illness. Even though there has been a marginal smoking decline of around 5% in recent years (2005 vs 2015), smokers still account for 15% of the US adult population.

Further, we discuss prophylactic interventions and associated benefits and provide a rationale for the scope of clinical treatment. Conclusions: Considering these premises, it is evident that much detailed translational and clinical studies are needed. Factors such as the length of smoking cessation for ex-smokers, the level of smoke exposure in case of SHS, pre-established health conditions, genetics (and epigenetics modification caused by chronic smoking) are few of the criteria that need to be evaluated to begin assessing the prophylactic and/or therapeutic impact of treatments aimed at chronic and former smokers (especially early stage ex-smokers) including those frequently subjected to second hand tobacco smoke exposure.

Each system or website normally uses a specific rating scale, in many cases differing from scales used by other systems in their granularity, visual metaphor, numbering or availability of a neutral position. While many works in the field of survey design reported on the effects of rating scales on user ratings, these, however, are normally regarded as neutral tools when it comes to recommender systems. In this paper, we challenge this view and provide new empirical information about the impact of rating scales on user ratings, presenting the results of three new studies carried out in different domains.

The readability of mobile learning applications has received extensive attention by the designers and developers. The reason for such concern is due to its importance in determining usability related issues especially in the design context for children. In many cases, children find it difficult to interact with mobile reading apps. This is because apps for reading and for entertainment require different features. As such, this study sets out three objectives: 1) to evaluate five reading apps for young children from design perspectives; 2) to examine the readability for current existing mobile apps for reading and 3) to propose and evaluate mobile apps UI guideline for readability. Readability indices, observation and interview were conducted on 6 - 8 years old students. The obtained result showed that certain reading apps provide better reading experience for children than others. Some of the reasons are mostly related to the design characteristics embedded within the app. In addition, the use of animation was found to stimulate children reading experience as it is believed to offer the interactivity elements to gain their interest and willingness to read. These findings are believed to provide the recommendations and insights for designers of reading apps for children. © 2017 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85031312796

The process was considered successful and many politicians said that they have never before been that well informed when making a decision. The case primarily shows that besides the common knowledge brokerage roles targeting knowledge exchange, the honest brokerage approach relates more to managing social relationships and balancing political games and rapidly evolving discussions. Trustful relationships increased the perceived credibility of the brokers and ensured two-way communication.

In this study, two 4-T interfaces were designed, called SlideType and FlyType. These interfaces use two different target selection methods, slide-and-click and fly-and-touch, respectively, and their prototypes were implemented using an optical hover-tracking touchpad. An experiment with the prototypes showed that FlyType was faster than SlideType and could achieve a text entry speed over 24 words per minute after practicing 2 hr. In addition, a microanalysis of thumb movements during the experiment showed that there are clear quantitative differences between the two methods in the degree of ballisticity of finger motions, in the concurrency of the movements of the two thumbs, and in the degree of integration between reaching and selecting actions, and that FlyType supports a more integral, ballistic, and concurrent motor skill than SlideType. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Target tracking; Ballisticity; Design option; Finger motion; Motor skills; Target selection; Text entry; Touchpad; Ballistics",2-s2.0-85014460342

In this paper, LSound which is a Visual Language Programming (VLP) framework has been developed to model plant to music sound and generate music score and vice versa. The objectives of this research has three folds: (i) To expand the grammar dictionary of L-Systems music based on visual programming, (ii) To design and produce a user-friendly and icon based visual language framework typically for L-Systems musical score generation which helps the basic learners in musical field and (iii) To generate music score from plant models and vice versa using L-Systems method. This research undergoes a four phases methodology where the plant is first modelled, then the music is interpreted, followed by the output of music sound through MIDI and finally score is generated. LSound is technically compared to other existing applications in the aspects of the capability of modelling the plant, rendering the music and generating the sound. It has been found that LSound is a flexible framework in which the plant can be easily altered through arrow-based programming and the music score can be altered through the music symbols and notes.

However, there was no evidence of the structure of PMP22 or how mutations affect its folding. Therefore, in this study, we combined bioinformatics and homology modeling approaches to obtain three-dimensional native and mutated PMP22 models and its anchoring to a POPC membrane, submitted to.5-μs MD simulations, to determine how the L16P and T118M mutations affect the conformational behavior of PMP22. In addition, we investigated the ability of the native and mutated species to accumulate in the ER, via interaction with RER1, by combining protein–protein docking and MD simulations, taking the conformations that were most representative of the native and mutated PMP22 systems and RER1 conformations. Principal component analysis over MD simulations revealed that L16P and T118M mutations resulted in increased structural instability compared to the native form, which is consistent with previous experimental findings of increased structural fluctuations along a loop connecting transmembrane α-helix1 and α-helix2. Docking and MD simulations coupled with the MMGBSA approach allowed the identification that the binding interface for the PMP22-RER1 complex takes place through transmembrane α-helix1 and α-helix2, with higher effective binding free energy values between the mutated PMP22 systems and RER1 than for the native PMP22, mainly through van der Waals interactions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","binding free energy calculations; charcot–marie–tooth; docking; molecular dynamics simulations; PMP22","endoplasmic reticulum sorting receptor 1; peripheral myelin protein 22; receptor protein; unclassified drug; alpha helix; Article; bioinformatics; Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy type 1a; conformational transition; endoplasmic reticulum; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; missense mutation; molecular docking; molecular model; myelination; peripheral nervous system; principal component analysis; priority journal; protein binding; protein folding; protein misfolding; protein protein interaction; structural homology",2-s2.0-84990200598

Universal GIS (Geographic information system) algorithms, as alternatives to tightly coupled approaches, can reduce development costs. However, a unified representation of spatial data is necessary to support the development of universal GIS algorithms. To this end, this research proposes and implements a template-based approach using geometric algebra to create a unified representation of multidimensional data. The template is composed of parameters and operators for GIS representation and computation. The template approach can support general GIS analyses with parameter unfolding and operator integration methods. A case study of intersection analysis shows that developing programming scripts based on computation templates is much simpler than traditional methods. The results suggest that the template-based method is more efficient than traditional methods and more convenient for high-dimensional applications. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","computation template; Geometric algebra; script-based programming","algorithm; geometry; GIS; numerical method; numerical model; spatial analysis; spatial data",2-s2.0-85021813559

The typical taekwondo training session takes place in a hall or large open spaces in the presence of a trainer. Even though this is the most widely used approach of Taekwondo training, this approach has some limitations in supporting self-directed training. Self-directed taekwondo training is required for the trainees to improve their skills and performance. There are varieties of supplementary taekwondo training materials available, however, most of them are still lacking in terms of three-dimensional visualization. This paper introduces the Virtual Taekwondo Training Environment (VT2E) prototype for self-directed training. The aim of this paper is to determine whether the intervention of the new taekwondo training approach using virtual reality contributes to the trainees' satisfaction in self-directed training. Pearson Correlation and Regression analyses were used to determine the effects of Engaging, Presence, Usefulness and Ease of Use on trainees' satisfaction in using the prototype. The results provide empirical support for the positive and statistically significant relationship between Usefulness and Ease of Use and trainees' satisfaction for taekwondo training.

For example, pedestrians may prefer better-illuminated walking environments, shorter travel distances, and greater numbers of pedestrian companions. Route selection at night is therefore a multi-objective optimization problem. However, multi-objective optimization problems are commonly solved by combining multiple objectives into a single weighted-sum objective function. This study extends the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm by modifying several strategies, including the representation of the solutions, the limited neighborhood search, and the Pareto front approximation method. The extended algorithm can be used to generate an optimal route set for pedestrians at night that considers travel distance, the illumination of the walking environment, and the number of pedestrian companions. We compare the proposed algorithm with the well-known Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm and discuss the stability, diversity, and dynamics of the generated solutions. Experiments within a study area confirm the effectiveness of the improved algorithm. This algorithm can also be applied to solving other multi-objective optimization problems. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial bee colony; Pedestrian navigation; route planning; safety","algorithm; navigation; optimization; pedestrian; transportation planning; transportation safety; Apoidea",2-s2.0-85021797166

We describe a study in north-east Scotland involving 22 participants who undertook walks of their choice using GPS smartphone applications to track their routes. Tracked routes were uploaded to a touch table and small group sessions explored spatial behavior in, and perceptions and knowledge of, local landscapes. Individual interviews 4-6 weeks later elicited reflections on the touch table session and personal engagement with the landscape. Two types of findings are reported: (i) observations and recommendations relating to the use of a touch table in combination with GPS applications; and (ii) knowledge exchange and insights afforded by group discussion and individual reflection.

A second experiment evaluated the influence of task load and informational message type (i.e. single words vs. grouped phrases) on that same collaborative task. In both experiments, the relationship of personal characteristics (attentional control and spatial ability) to performance and workload was also measured. In addition to objective performance and self-report of cognitive load, we evaluated different physiological responses in each experiment. Results showed a performance–workload association for directional cues, message type and task load. EEG measures however, proved generally insensitive to such task load manipulations. Where significant EEG effects were observed, right hemisphere amplitude differences predominated, although unexpectedly these latter relationships were negative. Although EEG measures were partially associated with performance, they appear to possess limited utility as measures of workload in association with tactile displays. Practitioner Summary: As practitioners look to take advantage of innovative tactile displays in complex operational realms like human–robotic interaction, associated performance effects are mediated by cognitive workload. Despite some patterns of association, reliable reflections of operator state can be difficult to discern and employ as the number, complexity and sophistication of these respective measures themselves increase. © 2016, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","human-robot interaction; Objective performance; physiological reactions; subjective response; tactile signalling","Display devices; Human computer interaction; Mice (computer peripherals); Physiological models; Physiology; Psychophysiology; Robotics; Amplitude difference; Collaborative tasks; Objective performance; Personal characteristics; Physiological reactions; Physiological response; Robotic interaction; subjective response; Human robot interaction; controlled study; electroencephalogram; human; physician; right hemisphere; robotics; self report; workload",2-s2.0-85026242905

Male NMRI mice have received the daily injection of curcumin NPs at dose of 12.5 or 25 mg/kg. All interventions were injected intraperitoneally (i.p), 10 days before PTZ administration and the injections were continued until 1 h before each PTZ injection. Spatial learning and memory was evaluated using Morris water maze test after the 7th PTZ injection. Animals have received 10 injections of PTZ and then, brain tissues were removed for histological evaluation. Nissl staining was used to determine the level of cell death in hippocampus and immunostaining method was performed against NeuN and GFAP/Iba1 for assessment of neuronal density and glial activation respectively. Behavioral results showed that curcumin NPs exhibit anticonvulsant activity and prevent cognitive impairment in fully kindled animals. The level of cell death and glial activation reduced in animals which have received curcumin NPs compared to those received free curcumin.

A major challenge in the development of highly concentrated mAb solutions is their long-term stability and often incalculable viscosity. The complexity of the molecule itself, as well as the various molecular interactions, make it difficult to describe their solution behavior. To study the formulation stability, long- and short-range interactions and the formation of complex network structures have to be taken into account. For a better understanding of highly concentrated solutions, we combined established and novel analytical tools to characterize the effect of solution properties on the stability of highly concentrated mAb formulations. In this study, monoclonal antibody solutions in a concentration range of 50–200 mg/ml at pH 5–9 with and without glycine, PEG4000, and Na2SO4 were analyzed. To determine the monomer content, analytical size-exclusion chromatography runs were performed. ζ-potential measurements were conducted to analyze the electrophoretic properties in different solutions. The melting and aggregation temperatures were determined with the help of fluorescence and static light scattering measurements. Additionally, rheological measurements were conducted to study the solution viscosity and viscoelastic behavior of the mAb solutions. The so-determined analytical parameters were scored and merged in an analytical toolbox. The resulting scoring was then successfully correlated with long-term storage (40 d of incubation) experiments. Our results indicate that the sensitivity of complex rheological measurements, in combination with the applied techniques, allows reliable statements to be made with respect to the effect of solution properties, such as protein concentration, ionic strength, and pH shift, on the strength of protein-protein interaction and solution colloidal stability. © 2017 The Author(s).

I explore a new analytic unit, learning along lines, as a tool for supporting the design and analysis of learning contexts where the leading mode of engagement for young learners was physical and digital mobility through the city. Learning along lines emerged from a design study in which youth produced counter-maps of their neighborhood to share with city stakeholders. Using a spatiotemporal framewo rk, I analyze youth learning locative literacies along lines they made of their neighborhood through a designed task, global positioning system (GPS) drawing. First, I focus on young people learning to scale their mobility to a neighborhood grid along lines they made through walking and gesture. Second, I focus on young people learning to negotiate inscriptions along lines they made by walking with maps and GPS devices through their neighborhood. Third, I focus on youth learning to re-member their embodied effort along lines they made discursively during moments of reflection. The analyses are intended to push the field’s understanding of mobility in conceptualizing and designing new forms of learning locative literacies.

The study focuses on size and weight adjectives in both languages and on linguistic evidence in two areas: their lexicalizations of the importance senses as found in the dictionaries, and their roles in the instantiation of the two primary metaphors in natural discourse as found in the corpora. Our further analysis also shows that the primary metaphors can be manifested without explicit use of size and weight words when relevant conceptual frames in the source, evoked by other words or images, are mapped onto the target domain, thus activating the relevant region of our encyclopedic knowledge and triggering off the primary metaphors in our conceptual system. We also construct a hypothetical mapping scheme for primary metaphors based on the OBJECT image schema, in which OBJECT is mapped onto its target via three of its fundamental dimensions: SIZE, WEIGHT, and SOLIDITY.

The present study addresses this need by proposing a conceptual UX interaction model that incorporates the characteristics of usability and user interaction level based on quality of experience. A method to apply the model and the steps to implement the data collection and analysis are also proposed. The UX interaction model requires a systematic approach to: (1) decompose the product or service characteristics during a UX interaction process; (2) determine typology of UX items of each characteristic; and (3) select appropriate and feasible strategies to improve these UX items.

While the main motivation of this paper was to provide a user interface for physically disabled people to express their artistic natures, a special emphasis is given on graphical user interface design where bio-signals are the single input source. Among three bio-signal sources investigated—electromyography, electrooculography and electroencephalography (EEG)—stimulus-based human–computer interaction design (EEG feature extraction method) is found to be the most promising for achieving design environments to perform complex tasks. In the proposed stimulus-based brain–computer-interaction application, the user communication with a computer is achieved by coupling intended functionalities with stimuli signals on the computer screen. Constant focus on the intended command stimulates the brain. In return, the brain releases a response signals (steady state visual evoked potential). In theory, brain’s response signals and the stimulus signals are identical. Once successfully identified, the presence of a signal pattern that is identical to the one of the alternative stimulus signals (paired with a command in a user interface) indicates the intention of a user. Since each option is associated with a unique signal pattern, multiple options can simultaneously be offered to users. The main challenge of working with stimulus signals is that the response signals are weak and they are buried inside of highly polluted EEG signals that include brain’s natural activities. In this paper, we introduce a signal processing algorithm based on Lorenz systems of differential equations for identifying the source of stimulus signals. Our experiments strongly suggest that bio-signal-based design environments to perform complex tasks, including geometric modeling can be achieved by utilizing stimulus-based signal processing methodology. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Brain–computer interface; Chaos theory; EEG; Geometric design; Lorenz system; Steady state visual evoked potential; Support system for physically challenged users","Biomedical signal processing; Brain; Chaos theory; Design; Differential equations; Electroencephalography; Electromyography; Electrophysiology; Feature extraction; Geometry; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Interface states; Interfaces (computer); Signal processing; Computer interaction; Feature extraction methods; Geometric design; Lorenz system; Signal processing algorithms; Steady state visual evoked potentials; Support systems; User communication; User interfaces",2-s2.0-84961212991

For simplicity, these devices are designed to be operated by purposefully modulating specific predetermined neurophysiological signals, such as the sensorimotor rhythm. However, the ability to modulate a given neurophysiological signal is highly variable across individuals, contributing to the inconsistent performance of BCIs for different users. These differences suggest that individuals who experience poor BCI performance with one class of brain signals might have good results with another. In order to take advantage of individual abilities as they relate to BCI control, we need to move beyond the current approaches. In this letter, we explore a new BCI design aimed at a more individualized and user-focused experience, which we call open-ended BCI. Individual users were given the freedom to discover their own mental strategies as opposed to being trained to modulate a given brain signal. They then underwent multiple coadaptive training sessionswith the BCI. Our first open-ended BCI performed similarly to comparable BCIs while accommodating a wider variety of mental strategies without a priori knowledge of the specific brain signals any individualmight use. Post hoc analysis revealed individual differences in terms of which sensory modality yielded optimal performance.We found a large and significant effect of individual differences in background training and expertise, such as in musical training, on BCI performance. Future research should be focused on finding more generalized solutions to user training and brain state decoding methods to fully utilize the abilities of different individuals in an open-ended BCI. Accounting for each individual's areas of expertise could have important implications on BCI training and BCI application design. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"Brain; Interfaces (computer); Neurophysiology; Sensory analysis; User centered design; Application design; Brain computer interfaces (BCIs); Co-adaptive trainings; Decoding methods; Generalized solution; Individual Differences; Priori knowledge; Sensory modality; Brain computer interface",2-s2.0-85029326201

The venerable NOD2 data reduction software package for single-dish radio continuum observations, which was developed for use at the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope, has been successfully applied over many decades. Modern computing facilities, however, call for a new design. Aims. We aim to develop an interactive software tool with a graphical user interface for the reduction of single-dish radio continuum maps. We make a special effort to reduce the distortions along the scanning direction (scanning effects) by combining maps scanned in orthogonal directions or dual- or multiple-horn observations that need to be processed in a restoration procedure. The package should also process polarisation data and offer the possibility to include special tasks written by the individual user. Methods. Based on the ideas of the NOD2 package we developed NOD3, which includes all necessary tasks from the raw maps to the final maps in total intensity and linear polarisation. Furthermore, plot routines and several methods for map analysis are available. The NOD3 package is written in Python, which allows the extension of the package via additional tasks. The required data format for the input maps is FITS. Results. The NOD3 package is a sophisticated tool to process and analyse maps from single-dish observations that are affected by scanning effects from clouds, receiver instabilities, or radio-frequency interference. The ""basket-weaving"" tool combines orthogonally scanned maps into a final map that is almost free of scanning effects. The new restoration tool for dual-beam observations reduces the noise by a factor of about two compared to the NOD2 version. Combining single-dish with interferometer data in the map plane ensures the full recovery of the total flux density. Conclusions. This software package is available under the open source license GPL for free use at other single-dish radio telescopes of the astronomical community. The NOD3 package is designed to be extendable to multi-channel data represented by data cubes in Stokes I, Q, and U. © ESO, 2017.","Methods: data analysis; Radio continuum: general; Techniques: image processing; Techniques: polarimetric","Computer aided software engineering; Graphical user interfaces; Image processing; Open source software; Open systems; Polarization; Radio interference; Radio telescopes; Restoration; Scanning; Software packages; User interfaces; Astronomical community; Interactive software tool; Methods:data analysis; Radio continuum: general; Radio frequency interference; Restoration procedure; Techniques: image processing; Techniques: polarimetric; Data reduction",2-s2.0-85032578378

Portable, inexpensive BCIs can mitigate these problems, but it remains unclear whether their low-cost design compromises their performance. Therefore, we developed a portable, low-cost BCI and compared its performance to that of a conventional BCI. Methods: The BCI was assembled by integrating a custom electroencephalogram (EEG) amplifier with an open-source microcontroller and a touchscreen. The function of the amplifier was first validated against a commercial bioamplifier, followed by a head-To-head comparison between the custom BCI (using four EEG channels) and a conventional 32-channel BCI. Specifically, five able-bodied subjects were cued to alternate between hand opening/closing and remaining motionless while the BCI decoded their movement state in real time and provided visual feedback through a light emitting diode. Subjects repeated the above task for a total of 10 trials, and were unaware of which system was being used. The performance in each trial was defined as the temporal correlation between the cues and the decoded states. Results: The EEG data simultaneously acquired with the custom and commercial amplifiers were visually similar and highly correlated (ρ = 0.79). The decoding performances of the custom and conventional BCIs averaged across trials and subjects were 0.70 m 0.12 and 0.68 m 0.10, respectively, and were not significantly different. Conclusion: The performance of our portable, low-cost BCI is comparable to that of the conventional BCIs. Significance: Platforms, such as the one developed here, are suitable for BCI applications outside of a laboratory. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Biomedical amplifiers; brain-computer interfaces; embedded software; microcontrollers; mobile computing; neurofeedback","Costs; Data visualization; Decoding; Electroencephalography; Embedded software; Interfaces (computer); Light emitting diodes; Microcontrollers; Mobile computing; Open source software; Visual communication; Brain computer interfaces (BCIs); Decoding performance; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Highly-correlated; Neurofeedback; Performance assessment; Temporal correlations; Visual feedback; Brain computer interface; amplifier; Article; biomedical technology assessment; brain computer interface; calibration; comparative study; computer; electroencephalogram; hand movement; human; neurofeedback; neurorehabilitation; software; task performance; brain computer interface; brain mapping; computer interface; cost benefit analysis; device failure analysis; devices; economics; equipment design; evaluation study; evoked response; miniaturization; physiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; United States; Amplifiers, Electronic; Brain Mapping; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Evoked Potentials; Humans; Miniaturization; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; United States; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-85029918291

In immersive virtual environments, object selection is usually done at arm's length in mid-air by directly intersecting the desired object with the user's hand. However, selecting objects outside user's arm-reach still poses significant challenges, which direct approaches fail to address. Techniques proposed to overcome such limitations often follow an arm-extension metaphor or favor selection volumes combined with ray-casting. Nonetheless, while these approaches work for room sized environments, they hardly scale up to larger scenarios with many objects. In this paper, we introduce a new taxonomy to classify existing selection techniques. In its wake, we propose PRECIOUS, a novel mid-air technique for selecting out-of-reach objects, featuring iterative refinement in Virtual Reality, an hitherto untried approach in this context. While comparable techniques have been developed for non-stereo and non-immersive environments, these are not suitable to Immersive Virtual Reality. Our technique is the first to employ an iterative progressive refinement in such settings. It uses cone-casting to select multiple objects and moves the user closer to them in each refinement step, to allow accurate selection of the desired target. A user evaluation showed that PRECIOUS compares favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. Indeed, our results indicate that PRECIOUS is a versatile approach to out-of-reach target acquisition, combining accurate selection with consistent task completion times across different scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","3D user interfaces; Object selection; Out-of-reach; Progressive refinement; Virtual reality","User interfaces; Virtual reality; 3D user interface; Design and evaluations; Immersive virtual environments; Immersive virtual reality; Object selection; Out-of-reach; Progressive refinement; State-of-the-art approach; Iterative methods",2-s2.0-85024363937

We found that perceived individual and safety benefits among different user groups tended to facilitate engagement in some, while other less engaged groups developed resistance and unsanctioned workarounds if systems were perceived to be inadequate. We identified both the opportunity and need for sustained engagement across user groups around system enhancement (e.g., through customizing software) and the development of user competencies and effective use. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to move away from an episodic view of engagement focused on the preimplementation phase, to more continuous holistic attempts to engage with and respond to end-users. © Health Research and Educational Trust","adoption; engagement; Health information technology; implementation","adoption; clinical decision support system; clinical trial; computerized provider order entry; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; England; hospital; human; medical information; multicenter study; participant observation; prescription; safety; semi structured interview; software; study design; thematic analysis; clinical decision support system; computer interface; consumer attitude; England; health personnel attitude; hospital management; in service training; interpersonal communication; leadership; organization and management; physician order entry system; Attitude of Health Personnel; Communication; Consumer Behavior; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; England; Hospital Administration; Humans; Inservice Training; Leadership; Medical Order Entry Systems; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-84990984000

Given candidate functionalities such as ""print,"" ""bookmark,"" and ""share,"" a designer has to choose which functionalities to include and which to leave out. Such choices critically affect the acceptability, productivity, usability, and experience of the design. However, designers may overlook reasonable designs because there is an exponential number of functionality sets and multiple factors to consider. This article is the first to formally define this problem and propose an algorithmic method to support designers to explore alternative functionality sets in early stage design. Based on interviews of professional designers, we mathematically define the task of identifying functionality sets that strike the best balance among four objectives: usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use, and profitability. We develop an integer linear programming solution that can efficiently solve very large instances (set size over 1,300) on a regular computer. Further, we build on techniques of robust optimization to search for diverse and surprising functionality designs. Empirical results from a controlled study and field deployment are encouraging. Most designers rated computationally created sets to be of the comparable or superior quality than their own.

Five different test study cases are presented, four in Slovenia and one in Austria, each with different specific target user groups and their own dynamics. According to the project disposition goals the focus was on the elderly. Methods, such as think-aloud protocol in combination with a guided interview and observation of verbal as well as of non-verbal responses, were used. To ensure the repeatability of tests and to help guide the process, a special questionnaire was developed. The research questions focused on: the navigation and interaction concept, the content, the readability, and the overall acceptance and the perception of value of the TV-WEB service. More than 74 users participated in the user experience studies, 27 of them 65 years old or older.

Study Design: Participants were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions in a fully factorial design: 2 home pages (quick links, current MPF home page) × 2 data displays (simplified, current MPF display) × 2 plan types (stand-alone prescription drug plan [PDP], Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage [MA-PD]). Principal Findings: The quick links page resulted in more favorable perceptions of the MPF, improved users’ understanding of the information, and increased the probability of choosing the objectively best plan. The simplified data display resulted in a more favorable evaluation of the website, better comprehension of the displayed information, and, among those choosing a PDP only, an increased probability of choosing the best plan.

It is widely recognised that the most effective strategy to design it is to create working prototypes and analyse user’s reactions when interacting with them. Starting from this consciousness, we will discuss of how virtual reality (VR) technologies can support engineers to build prototypes suitable to this aim. Furthermore we will demonstrate how VR-based prototypes do not only represent a valid alternative to physical prototypes, but also a step forward thanks to the possibility of simulating and rendering multisensory and real-time modifiable interactions between the user and the prototype. These characteristics of VR-based prototypes enable engineers to rapidly test with users different variants and to optimise the multisensory experience perceived by them during the interaction. The discussion is supported both by examples available in literature and by case studies we have developed over the years on this topic. Specifically, in our research we have concentrated on what happens in the physical contact between the user and the product.

These icons must reflect and depict the functionality associated with them especially for mentally retarded users. However, a notable variation is reported in the design of various mobile phone interface icons even for a single functionality that make mobile phone ineffective for users with moderate disability. Thus, unable to achieve sustainability in icons designs posits challenges of understanding among mentally retarded users that leads towards the unpleasant effect on their mental health. This calls serious questions of what are the characteristics of sustainable design of icons, what is the state of practice for sustainable design of icons in various mobile interfaces and how it influences on their mental health. This paper aims to respond these questions through literature review pertinent to sustainable design of icons initially. Besides, a detail experiment is conducted to investigate the effect of the characteristics of sustainable icons design to effectively interact with mobile for mentally retarded users. Users with moderate developmental disability participated in the experiment to investigate effect on their mental health. Top four selling mobile brands including IPhone, Samsung, Huawei and QMobile were used in the experiment. As supported by existing research, results indicated that mentally retarded users are suffering with confusion and misunderstanding due to the unsustainable design of icons that eventually influence on their mental health.

The objective of this study was to evaluate BCI performance using uniquely colored stimuli. Methods In addition to the GW stimuli, the current study tested two types of color stimuli (grey to color [GC] and color intensification [CI]). The main hypotheses were that in a checkboard paradigm, unique color stimuli will: (1) increase BCI performance over the standard GW paradigm; (2) elicit larger event-related potentials (ERPs); and, (3) improve offline performance with an electrode selection algorithm (i.e., Jumpwise). Results Online results (n = 36) showed that GC provides higher accuracy and information transfer rate than the CI and GW conditions. Waveform analysis showed that GC produced higher amplitude ERPs than CI and GW. Information transfer rate was improved by the Jumpwise-selected channel locations in all conditions. Conclusions Unique color stimuli (GC) improved BCI performance and enhanced ERPs. Jumpwise-selected electrode locations improved offline performance.

Channel selection in BCI systems is essential to avoid over-fitting, to reduce the computational cost and to increase the users' comfort. Although several algorithms have previously developed for that purpose, metaheuristics based on swarm intelligence have not been exploited yet in P300-based BCI systems. In this study, a comparative among five different swarm methods, based on the behavior of biological systems, is shown. Those methods have been applied in order to optimize the channel selection procedure in this kind of systems, and have been tested with the 'III BCI Competition 2005' database II. Results show that the five methods can achieve similar or even higher accuracies than that obtained without performing any channel selection procedure. Owing to the fact that all the applied methods are able to drastically reduce the required number of channels without compromising the system performance, as well as to overcome the common 8-channel set and the backward elimination algorithm, we conclude that all of them are suitable for use in the P300-BCI systems channel selection procedure. © 2016 CEA.","aprendizaje automático; electroencefalografía; optimización y métodos computacionales; Palabras clave Interfaces; sistemas biomédicos; sistemas de comunicación","Artificial intelligence; Interfaces (computer); Optimization; Swarm intelligence; Backward elimination; Channel selection; Computational costs; Device control; Direct communications; Meta heuristics; Overfitting; P300-based BCI; Brain computer interface",2-s2.0-85031744276

In this article, we review recent advances in the use of hydrogenated-fluorinated surfactant mixtures to achieve interfacial patterning. For even relatively simple systems comprised of binary mixed monolayers of hydrogenated and perfluorinated fatty acids, a diverse range of film morphologies can be generated at the air-water interface and successfully transferred onto solid substrates. Systematic investigations reported over the past several years have allowed for correlation between the chemical structure of the film constituents with the gross film morphology and underlying crystalline structure of the films. Early thermodynamic models based on the interplay between dipole-dipole repulsion forces between charged headgroups balanced by line tension between phases that were formulated to describe phase-behavior in simple phospholipid monolayer systems have proven highly useful to describe morphologies for the immiscible surfactant blends. Beyond simple binary fatty acid mixtures, highly-structured films have also been reported in mixed phospholipid systems, which have found important application in controlling the physical, compositional and performance properties of lung surfactant mixtures, as well as in semifluorinated alkane monolayers which form unique, hemimicellar structures at both liquid and solid interfaces. We also describe advances in using these approaches to pattern photopolymerizable, luminescent surfactants, which have found extensive use in colorimetric and fluorometric sensing devices. The long-term outlook for this field, with an emphasis on potential applications and future research directions are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fluorocarbon; Interfaces; Monolayer; Patterning; Phase-separation; Surfactant","Air; Binary mixtures; Bins; Fatty acids; Fluorocarbons; Hydrogenation; Interfaces (materials); Mixtures; Monolayers; Morphology; Phase separation; Phospholipids; Separation; Surface active agents; Crystalline structure; Fluorinated surfactant; Future research directions; Patterning; Performance properties; Phospholipid monolayers; Semifluorinated alkanes; Surfactant monolayers; Phase interfaces",2-s2.0-85026289396

The models provide rich insights about what constructs influence the experiential component of human-computer interactions and about how these constructs are related.

The objective of this study was to explore the shear failure characteristics of asphalt–aggregate interface by researching the interface shear strength and the continuous shear failure process. First, the oblique shear tests were conducted to investigate the interface shear strength under the influences of surface roughness, binder aging, loading rate, and aggregate type. Second, the direct shear tests were implemented to explore the continuous failure characteristics of the interface in terms of load–displacement curves. The interface bond-slip constitutive relation was established as a piecewise linear cohesive zone model. Finally, the grey relational analysis (GRA) was conducted to identify and prioritize the correlation between the applied experimental conditions and the interface bond-slip model parameters. The study results indicate that the improvement of surface roughness and loading rate could induce higher interface shear strength and a basalt aggregate with less silica has greater resistance to interface shear damage than a granite aggregate due to its stronger adhesion to binder. The interface shear resistance energy could benefit from higher surface roughness and normal stress level. Although binder aging could increase the interface shear strength, it imposes an adverse impact on the interface shear resistance energy. The established bond-slip constitutive model of the asphalt–aggregate interface could represent a three-stage evolutionary process of the interface shear failure. By performing the GRA, the binder aging condition would be the most significant factor affecting the interface shear performance when compared with the surface roughness and the normal stress. © 2017, RILEM.","Asphalt–aggregate interface; Grey relational analysis; Load–displacement curve; Shear resistance energy; Shear strength","Aggregates; Asphalt; Binders; Bins; Piecewise linear techniques; Shear strength; Surface roughness; Constitutive relations; Displacement curve; Experimental conditions; Failure characteristics; Grey relational analyses (GRA); Grey relational analysis; Interface shear strength; Shear resistances; Asphalt mixtures",2-s2.0-85027881241

The 3-D NWSR profile is applied to the surface of the nanowires, and then, the interface traps are generated and randomly placed in the interfacial layer between the silicon and high-k. First, the interaction between NWSR and RIT in a single-NW FET is investigated; the NWSR-induced performance varia-tion is not independent on the RIT-induced variation. Then, the correlation of NWSR profiles and RIT in stacked-NW FETs is explored. The degree of correlation between the NWSR profiles of stacked-NWs is varied in three cases: 1) positively correlated; 2) negatively correlated; and 3) uncorrelated. Without RITs, the NWSR-induced performance variation of the stacked-NW FETs dramatically increases as the NWSR profiles of the nanowires become positively correlated. However, with RITs, the more positively correlated the NWSR profiles of the nanowires, the larger is the V-T variation that the interface traps induce. Interface traps barely affect the V-T variation of the negatively correlated NWSR profiles.

To develop the ANN system, the relationship between reservoir parameters and hydraulic fracturing was investigated, and the results were used to obtain ranges of key reservoir properties. Based on the learning data set generated from the categorized ranges, the optimum ANN architecture was designed by adjusting the ANN design parameters, such as training algorithms, and the number of hidden layers and hidden layer neurons.

The focus is on the development and use of the linear matching method framework (LMMF) on a wide range of crucial aspects for the power industry. The LMMF is reviewed to show a wide range of capabilities of the direct methods under this framework, and the basic theory background is also presented. Different structural integrity aspects are covered including the calculation of shakedown, ratchet, and creep rupture limits. Furthermore, the crack initiation assessments of an un-cracked body by the LMM are shown for cases both with and without the presence of a creep dwell during the cyclic loading history. Finally, an overview of the in house developed LMM plug-in is given, presenting the intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) developed. The efficiency and robustness of these direct methods in calculating the aforementioned quantities are confirmed through a numerical case study, which is a semicircular notched (Bridgman notch) bar. A two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model is adopted, and the notched bar is subjected to both cyclic and constant axial mechanical loads. For the crack initiation assessment, different cyclic loading conditions are evaluated to demonstrate the impact of the different load types on the structural response. The impact of creep dwell is also investigated to show how this parameter is capable of causing in some cases a dangerous phenomenon known as creep ratcheting.

However, in terms of accuracy, reliable particle tracking is a challenging task since results depend on sample illumination, particle overlap, motion blur and noise from recording sensors. Additionally, the computational performance is also an issue if, for example, a computationally expensive process is executed, such as axial particle position reconstruction from digital holographic microscopy data. Versatile robust tracking programs handling these concerns and providing a powerful post-processing option are significantly limited. Solution method: UmUTracker is a multi-functional tool to extract particle positions from long video sequences acquired with either light microscopy or digital holographic microscopy.

To reduce the computational load for 3D tracking, it uses an efficient implementation of the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld light propagation model. To analyze and visualize the data, an efficient data analysis step, which can for example show 4D flow visualization using 3D trajectories, is included.

The method is based on Fitts's law, an empirical model of human motor performance for aimed movements. Head motion is recorded in a series of goal-crossing tasks and a regression model of the movement time (MT) is estimated for each user. Values of R2 above 0.9 are indicators of a strong correlation of those motion patterns with the linear model proposed by Fitts. The analysis of MT confirmed that head movements of users without disability follow Fitts's law and showed that 3 users with CP (MACS IV and V) had the same behavior. There was a weaker correlation (R2=0.839) for one individual with cervical dystonia and ballistic movements and no correlation for two users with cervical hypotonia and dyskinetic CP. Results show the impact of ballistic movements and poor postural control in computer interaction. They also provide the foundation for new interaction techniques to develop a universal computer interface for motor impaired users. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cerebral palsy; Fitts's law; Head orientation; Human-computer interaction; Inertial sensor; Motor disorder","Ballistics; Diseases; Regression analysis; Cerebral palsy; Computer interaction; Fitts's law; Human computer interaction (HCI); Inertial sensor; Interaction techniques; Motor impaired users; Universal computers; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-85019845834

Digital technology interventions that increase task engagement, e.g., through performance feedback, increased challenge, and incentives (often referred to as ‘gamification’), could therefore offer safety benefits. To explore the impact of such interventions, we conducted experiments in a high-fidelity driving simulator with thirty-two participants. In two counterbalanced conditions (control and intervention), we compared driving behaviour, physiological arousal, and subjective experience. Results indicate that the gamified boredom intervention reduced unsafe coping mechanisms such as speeding while promoting anticipatory driving. We can further infer that the intervention not only increased one's attention and arousal during the intermittent gamification challenges, but that these intermittent stimuli may also help sustain one's attention and arousal in between challenges and throughout a drive. At the same time, the gamified condition led to slower hazard reactions and short off-road glances. Our contributions deepen our understanding of driver boredom and pave the way for engaging interventions for safety critical tasks. © 2017","Automotive user interfaces; Boredom; Distraction; Driving simulator study; Electrocardiography (ECG); Electrodermal activity (EDA); Gamification; Human-computer interaction; Mobile interactions; Psychophysiology; Road safety; Smartphone use; Task engagement; Technology augmented driving","Accident prevention; Automobile simulators; Electrocardiography; Physiology; Psychophysiology; Roads and streets; Transportation; User interfaces; Boredom; Distraction; Driving simulator study; Electrodermal activity; Gamification; Mobile interaction; Road safety; Task engagement; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-85020920730

Researchers have investigated privacy from various perspectives and in a multitude of settings, yet there have been few attempts to understand privacy versus satisfaction, particularly from the perspective of conflict management. Because users’ privacy can be negatively affected by social networking sites (SNSs), this study focuses on the privacy conflicts between SNSs and their users. Drawing on conflict management theory, this article investigates the effects of different conflict management styles exhibited by an SNS on users’ satisfaction with its privacy practices, which then affects their intention to disclose personal information. The SNS examined in this study is Facebook, the most popular SNS with the largest number of users. Data were collected using an online survey and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that the two cooperative conflict management styles demonstrated by the SNS—accommodating and problem-solving—positively affect users’ satisfaction with the privacy practices of the SNS both directly and indirectly through perceived privacy risk control. With regard to uncooperative styles, an avoiding style negatively affects user satisfaction directly, whereas an asserting style negatively affects user satisfaction indirectly through perceived privacy risk. The results also support that satisfaction is positively related to intention; users who are satisfied with the privacy practices of SNSs are more willing to disclose personal information than unsatisfied ones. © 2016 Decision Sciences Institute","Conflict Management; Intention to Disclose Personal Information; Privacy; Social Networking Sites (SNSs); Users’ Satisfaction with SNSs’ Privacy Practices",,2-s2.0-84994484707

In automatic speech transcription, recognition errors are inevitable, which makes user feedback such as manual error correction necessary. In this paper, an approach is proposed to improve the accuracy of speech transcription by exploiting user feedback and word repetition. The method aims at learning from user feedback and recognition results of preceding utterances and then correcting errors when repeated words are falsely recognized in following utterances. An interaction scheme for user feedback is proposed, which facilitate error correction by candidate lists and provide a new kind of feedback referred to as word indication to extend error correction from repeated words to repeated phrases. For template extraction and matching, the representation of word template and recognition results based on syllable confusion network (SCN) is proposed. During the transcription, templates of multi-syllable words/phrases based on SCN are extracted from user feedback and the N-best lattice, and then matched in SCN corresponding to recognition results of subsequent utterances to yield a new candidate list when repeated words are detected. Experimental results show that considerate error reduction is achieved in the newly-generated candidate lists. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Error correction; Repeated word; Speech transcription; User feedback","Error correction; Errors; Speech; Speech recognition; Speech transmission; Template matching; Automatic speech; Confusion networks; Interaction schemes; Recognition error; Repeated word; Speech transcriptions; Template extraction; User feedback; Transcription",2-s2.0-85020464474

This design approach guides designers through a four-step process, to develop a design model that fits in with the product experience. In order to better understand how this design approach works, this study takes the concept of analepsis as an example of product experience to demonstrate the process.

We systematically reviewed technical approaches that contribute to improved infobutton design, implementation and functionality. Methods We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database from inception to March 1, 2016 for studies describing the use of infobuttons. We selected full review comparative studies, usability studies, and qualitative studies examining infobutton design and implementation. We abstracted usability measures such as user satisfaction, impact, and efficiency, as well as prediction accuracy of infobutton content retrieval algorithms and infobutton adoption/interoperability. Results We found 82 original research studies on infobuttons. Twelve studies met criteria for detailed abstraction. These studies investigated infobutton interoperability (1 study); tools to help tailor infobutton functionality (1 study); interventions to improve user experience (7 studies); and interventions to improve content retrieval by improving prediction of relevant knowledge resources and information needs (3 studies). In-depth interviews with implementers showed the Health Level Seven (HL7) Infobutton standard to be simple and easy to implement. A usability study demonstrated the feasibility of a tool to help medical librarians tailor infobutton functionality. User experience studies showed that access to resources with which users are familiar increased user satisfaction ratings; and that links to specific subsections of drug monographs increased information seeking efficiency. However, none of the user experience improvements led to increased usage uptake. Recommender systems based on machine learning algorithms outperformed hand-crafted rules in the prediction of relevant resources and clinicians’ information needs in a laboratory setting, but no studies were found using these techniques in clinical settings. Improved content indexing in one study led to improved content retrieval across three health care organizations. Conclusion Best practice technical approaches to ensure optimal infobutton functionality, design and implementation remain understudied. The HL7 Infobutton standard has supported wide adoption of infobutton functionality among clinical information systems and knowledge resources. Limited evidence supports infobutton enhancements such as links to specific subtopics, configuration of optimal resources for specific tasks and users, and improved indexing and content coverage.

Our fully automatic modeller for arbitrary tunnel alignments provides a high degree of automation for the generation, the setup and the execution of the simulation model, connecting the multi-level information model with the open-source simulation software KRATOS. The software of SATBIM is organized in a modular way in order to offer high flexibility not only for further extensions, but also for adaptation to future improvements of the simulation software.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that can leverage the time-series modeling ability of hidden Markov model and the fuzzy inference ability of fuzzy neural network. First, a complex dynamic gesture is decomposed and fed into the hybrid model. The likelihood probability of an observation sequence estimated by the hidden Markov model is used as fuzzy membership degree of the corresponding fuzzy class variable in fuzzy neural network. Next, fuzzy rule modeling and fuzzy inference are performed by fuzzy neural network for gesture classification. To spot key gestures accurately, a threshold model is introduced to calculate the likelihood threshold of an input pattern and provide a reliability measure of whether to accept the pattern as a gesture. Finally, the proposed method is applied to recognize ten user-defined dynamic gestures for controlling interactive digital television in a smart room.

The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for integrating EBD with lighting simulation tools. Based on a literature review, it was investigated how EBD and lighting simulation can be combined to provide a holistic lighting performance evaluation method. The results show that they can mutually benefit from each other. EBD makes it possible to evaluate and/or improve performance metrics by utilizing user feedback. On the other hand, performance metrics can be used for a better description of evidence, and to analyze the effects of lighting with more details.

We aim to underline the complexity of regulating (internal and external) effects on the human body and highly individual physiological (emotion) responses and provide a starting point for engineering researchers entering the field. Although great advances have been made in scenarios involving human-machine interactions, the critical elements—the actions and responses of the human—remain far beyond automatic control, because of the irrational behavior of human subjects. These (re)actions, which cannot be satisfactorily modeled, stem mostly from the fact that human behavior is regulated by emotions. The physiological measurement of the latter can thus be a potential door to future advances for the community. In this paper, following a brief overview of the foundations and ongoing discussions in psychology and neuroscience, various emotion-related physiological responses are explained on the basis of a systematic review of the autonomic nervous system and its regulation of the human body. Based on sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system responses, various sensor measurements that are relevant in an engineering context, such as electrocardiography, electroencephalography, electromyography, pulse oximetry, blood pressure measurements, respiratory transducer, body temperature measurements, galvanic skin response measurements, and others, are explained. After providing an overview of ongoing engineering and human-computer interaction projects, we discuss engineering-specific challenges and experiment setups in terms of their usability and appropriateness for data analysis. We identify current limitations associated with the use of physiology sensors and discuss developments in this area, such as software-based facial affect coding and near-infrared spectroscopy. The key to truly understanding user experience and designing systems and products that integrate emotional states dynamically lies in understanding and measuring physiology.

This problem can be mitigated by (i) optimizing product flexibility and adaptability to react to uncertain requirements, and (ii) reducing the most critical uncertainties. The flexibility of a product to adapt to new or changing requirements has been shown to extend the service life of large complex engineered systems (e.g., aircraft carriers, aircraft, communication systems, and space craft). These systems must remain in service for extended periods of time, even though the environments and requirements may change dramatically. Applying these proven techniques to products designed for the developing world can alleviate the problem of uncertain requirements. This paper presents and demonstrates a technique aimed at improving the success of developing world engineering projects. Flexibility and adaptability minimize the impact of uncertainties, and are enabled by numerically optimized amounts of designed-in excess. A sensitivity analysis performed on the system model helps the designer prioritize the set of uncertain requirements and parameters for refinement. The technique is demonstrated in the design of a cookstove intended for use in the developing world. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.","Adaptability; Developing world; Evolvability; Excess; Improved cookstove; Reconfigurability; Reconfigure; System design","Aircraft carriers; Aircraft communication; Developing countries; Sensitivity analysis; Systems analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptability; Developing world; Evolvability; Excess; Improved cookstove; Reconfigurability; Reconfigure; Product design",2-s2.0-85015871762

To provide an optimal reaction environment, minimal self- and cross-hybridization must be achieved among these oligonucleotides. To address this problem, we developed EvOligo, which is a software package that provides the means to design and group DNA and RNA molecules with defined lengths. EvOligo combines two modules. The first module performs oligonucleotide design, and the second module performs oligonucleotide grouping. The software applies a nearest-neighbor model of nucleic acid interactions coupled with a parallel evolutionary algorithm to construct individual oligonucleotides, and to group the molecules that are characterized by the weakest possible cross-interactions. To provide optimal solutions, the evolutionary algorithm sorts oligonucleotides into sets, preserves preselected parts of the oligonucleotides, and shapes their remaining parts. In addition, the oligonucleotide sets can be designed and grouped based on their melting temperatures. For the user's convenience, EvOligo is provided with a user-friendly graphical interface. EvOligo was used to design individual oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide pairs, and groups of oligonucleotide pairs that are characterized by the following parameters: (1) weaker cross-interactions between the non-complementary oligonucleotides and (2) more uniform ranges of the oligonucleotide pair melting temperatures than other available software products. In addition, in contrast to other grouping algorithms, EvOligo offers time-efficient sorting of paired and unpaired oligonucleotides based on various parameters defined by the user. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","DNA libraries; genetic algorithms; oligonucleotide design; oligonucletide grouping; RNA libraries.",,2-s2.0-85031085988

In particular, the development of user interfaces (UIs) is one of the most time-consuming activities in the software lifecycle. This is even more demanding when data have to be retrieved by accessing flexibly different online resources. Indeed, software development is moving more and more toward composite applications that aggregate on the fly specific Web services and APIs. In this article, we present a mashup model that describes the integration, at the presentation layer, of UI components. The goal is to allow non-technical end users to visualize and manipulate (i.e., to perform actions on) the data displayed by the components, which thus become actionable UI components. This article shows how the model has guided the development of a mashup platform through which non-technical end users can create component-based interactive workspaces via the aggregation and manipulation of data fetched from distributed online resources. Due to the abundance of online data sources, facilitating the creation of such interactive workspaces is a very relevant need that emerges in different contexts. A utilization study has been performed in order to assess the benefits of the proposed model and of the Actionable UI Components; participants were required to perform real tasks using the mashup platform.

Consequently, three-node full-duplex in cellular networks must deal with self-interference and user-to-user interference, which can be managed by power control and user-frequency assignment techniques. This paper investigates the problem of maximizing the sum spectral efficiency by jointly determining the transmit powers in a distributed fashion, and assigning users to frequency channels. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem, which is shown to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. We investigate a close-to-optimal solution approach by dividing the joint problem into a power control problem and an assignment problem. The power control problem is solved by Fast-Lipschitz optimization, while a greedy solution with guaranteed performance is developed for the assignment problem. Numerical results indicate that compared with the half-duplex mode, both spectral and energy efficiencies of the system are increased by the proposed algorithm. Moreover, results show that the power control and assignment solutions have important, but opposite roles in scenarios with low or high self-interference cancellation. When the self-interference cancellation is high, user-frequency assignment is more important than power control, while power control is essential at low self-interference cancellation. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","5G mobile communication; full-duplex; interference cancellation; optimization methods; power control","Combinatorial optimization; Energy efficiency; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Polynomial approximation; Wave interference; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular network; Channel allocation; Full-duplex transmissions; Guaranteed performance; Mixed integer nonlinear problems; Power control problem; Resource management; Wireless communications; Power control",2-s2.0-85028856446

In these new systems, various domains coexist in time, evolve together and influence each other. Thus, application-specific tools are necessary for specifying and validating designs and simulating systems. However, nowadays, different tools are employed to simulate each domain independently. Mainly, the cause of the lack of co-simulation instruments to simulate all domains together is the extreme difficulty of combining and synchronizing various tools. In order to reduce that difficulty, an adequate architecture for the final co-simulator must be selected. Therefore, in this paper the authors investigate and propose a methodology for the design of CPSS co-simulation tools. The paper describes the four steps that software architects should follow in order to design the most adequate co-simulator for a certain application, considering the final users’ needs and requirements and various additional factors such as the development team’s experience.

In this paper, we describe three user studies undertaken to investigate users’ typing abilities and preferences on tiny QWERTY keyboards. The first two studies, using a smartphone as a substitute for a smartwatch, tested five different keyboard sizes (2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 cm). Study 1 collected typing data from participants using keyboards and given asterisk feedback. We analyzed both the distribution of touch points (e.g., the systematic offset and shape of the distribution) and the effect of keyboard size. Study 2 adopted a Bayesian algorithm based on a touch model derived from Study 1 and a unigram word language model to perform input prediction. We found that on the smart keyboard, participants could type between 26.8 and 33.6 words per minute (WPM) across the five keyboard sizes with an uncorrected character error rate ranging from 0.4% to 1.9%. Participants’ subjective feedback indicated that they felt most comfortable with keyboards larger than 2.5 cm. Study 3 replicated the 3.0 and 3.5 cm keyboard tests on a real smartwatch and verified that in terms of text entry speed, error rate and user preference, there was no significant difference between the results measured on a smartphone and that on a smartwatch with same sized keys. This study result indicated that the results of Study 1 and 2 are applicable to smartwatch devices. Finally, we conducted a simulation to investigate the performance of different touch/language models based on our collected data.

Especially when α = 1 and α = 0 the trainer or trainee cannot receive any information form the slave side. For enlarging the control flexibility and enhancing the system transparency, a novel method with multiple adaptive dominance factors is proposed in this paper. An ideal application of this method is on-line operation and supervision. The supervisor and operator can adjust the factors and switch the operation roles and states freely. Once the slave robot handled by the operator diverges from the planned path, the dominance factors will change adaptive to limit the operator’s movement. The adaptive principles are concluded from the dynamic performance measured by the measuring functions. The conclusions suggest that the varying range of the system dynamic performance is wider than the traditional method. In addition, considering the time delays between the slave and master sides, we proved the system stability conditions covering all the range of dominance factors.

The study was conducted at the Vietnamese Training Centre for Orthopaedic Technologies and involved seventeen Vietnamese participants with unilateral transtibial amputation, all of whom were long term users of prosthetics. All participants were fitted with two sockets manufactured using both hand-cast and PCAST techniques with International Committee of the Red Cross components. Walking tests (timed up and go test and six-minute-walk-test), spatio-temporal gait analyses and subjective comfort assessments were completed after a short acclimatisation period with each socket. The participant-preferred socket was also noted. No significant differences were found for the measures of mobility, functional capacity, spatio-temporal gait parameters, gait symmetry, perceived comfort or participant socket preference. The results show the initial patient outcomes are similar when participants are fitted with a hand-cast PTB socket and a PCAST hydrocast sockets.

Experimental estimation of impedance requires specialized tools with highly reproducible perturbation dynamics and reliable measurement capabilities. This paper presents the design and mechanical characterization of the ETH Knee Perturbator: An actuated exoskeleton for perturbing the knee during gait. Methods: A novel wearable perturbation device was developed based on specific experimental objectives. Bench-Top tests validated the device's torque limiting capability and characterized the time delays of the on-board clutch. Further tests demonstrated the device's ability to perform system identification on passive loads with static initial conditions. Finally, the ability of the device to consistently perturb human gait was evaluated through a pilot study on three unimpaired subjects. Results: The ETH Knee Perturbator is capable of identifying mass-spring systems within 15% accuracy, accounting for over 95% of the variance in the observed torque in 10 out of 16 cases. Five-degree extension and flexion perturbations were executed on human subjects with an onset timing precision of 2.52% of swing phase duration and a rise time of 36.5 ms. Conclusion: The ETH Knee Perturbator can deliver safe, precisely timed, and controlled perturbations, which is a prerequisite for the estimation of knee joint impedance during gait. Significance: Tools such as this can enhance models of neuromuscular control, which may improve rehabilitative outcomes following impairments affecting gait and advance the design and control of assistive devices. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Gait biomechanics; mechanical impedance; neuromechanics; perturbation; powered prostheses and orthoses; system identification","Exoskeleton (Robotics); Gait analysis; Identification (control systems); Religious buildings; Time delay; Gait biomechanics; Mechanical impedances; Neuromechanics; Orthoses; perturbation; Joints (anatomy); Article; biomechanics; gait; human; impedance; knee function; knee perturbation device; leg exoskeleton; measurement accuracy; neuromuscular function; pilot study; range of motion; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; exoskeleton (rehabilitation); Gait Disorders, Neurologic; joint characteristics and functions; knee; neurorehabilitation; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; robotics; sensitivity and specificity; treatment outcome; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Exoskeleton Device; Gait; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Humans; Knee Joint; Neurological Rehabilitation; Range of Motion, Articular; Reproducibility of Results; Robotics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85029934917

This problem occurs because the tethered view only partially visualizes spatial information, unlike the bird’s-eye view. Operators are thus inhibited to build their spatial mental model because the transitions happen as the robot moves. This paper presents an approach to improve the visual momentum of the tethered view by complementing the omitted spatial information. The approach augments simplified spatial cues on the excluded areas of a tethered view. The cues are purportedly used to illuminate the basic spatial structure of the surroundings and can thus help operators in constructing their spatial mental models.

The use of specialized hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), has also been on the rise. The traditional design methodology for FPGAs, however, requires hardware knowledge, which makes the platform inaccessible to software engineers. High-level synthesis (HLS) tools aim to resolve this issue by allowing software design methodologies to be used for FPGAs. However, HLS remains difficult to use for many software engineers, as there are tasks, such as system integration, which is still mostly a manual process. Consequently, creating a multicore hardware system on an FPGA is not feasible for most software engineers. To this end, we provide an HLS framework, which can automatically generate a multicore hardware system from software. We provide support for POSIX threads, which can be compiled to concurrently executing hardware cores that can be used in a processor-accelerator hybrid system, or in a hardware-only system without a processor.

The reaction yielded a coating with a surface roughened by droplet domains. Previous analysis revealed that domains consisted of the high OH resin. Carbonyl peaks originating from IPDI exhibited intensities commensurate with IPDI concentration for single resin coatings. However, commensuration was absent from the blend phases due to a diffusion gradient. The gradient is evidenced by the domains’ resistance toward in-situ caprolactam and introduced styrene monomer.

The analysis proposed in this article relies on interrelated studies conducted at three levels: in vitro (mechanical tests), in silico (finite elements simulations) and in vivo (clinical survival rates). The in vitro and the in silico studies proved that an appropriate variation of the geometric design of the preparations enables to increase up to 80% the mechanical strength of ceramic reconstructions. The in vivo clinical study of CAD/CAM full ceramic crowns was performed in accordance with the principles stated within the in vitro and the in silico studies and provided a 98.97% success rate over a 6 years period. The variations of geometric design parameters for dental preparation allows for reconstructions with a mechanical breaking up to 80% higher than that of a non-appropriate combination. These results are confirmed in clinical practice.

Many children with ASD are also diagnosed with Intellectual Disabilities (ID), yet design studies involving children with ASD and ID are scarce. Rewards can have a positive impact on children's learning and motivation, but little is known about the nature and impact of rewards for children with ASD, and/or ID. Digital technologies are well placed to provide task-based rewards, and in combination with a better understanding of the reward preferences of children with ASD and/or ID this has significant potential to enhance learning. This paper presents two robust participatory design (PD) studies involving children with: i) ASD; ii) ID; and iii) both ASD and ID. The studies aimed to identify: i) the reward preferences of children with ASD and/or ID (RQ1) and ii) how rewards might develop throughout a task as the child progresses (RQ2). Results revealed a number of reward categories that were common to all children, as well as children's preferences for how rewards could develop as they progress through computer-based tasks, for the first time. Original implications for designing computer-based rewards embedded within digital intervention/educational technologies for children with ASD and/or ID, are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Autism Spectrum Disorders; Computer-assisted learning; Intellectual disability; Participatory design; Rewards; Technology design","Computer aided instruction; Diseases; Autism spectrum disorders; Computer assisted learning; Intellectual disability; Participatory design; Rewards; Technology designs; E-learning",2-s2.0-85019684625

Forthcoming applications are demanding to this technology a step forward in the conceiving stage of positive displacement machines. The compendium of the qualities and the inherent characteristics of trochoidal-gear technology, especially towards the gerotor pump, together with scale/size factor and magnetic-driven transmission has led to the idea of a magnet-sleeve-sealed variable flow mini trochoidal-gear pump. From its original concept, to the last phase of the design development, the proof of concept, this new product will intend to overcome problems such as noise, vibration, maintenance, materials, and dimensions. The paper aims to show the technological path followed from the concept, design, and model, to the manufacture of the first prototype, where the theoretical and numerical approaches are not always directly reflected in the prototype performance results. Early in the design process, from a standard-commercial sintered metal mini trochoidal-gear unit, fundamental characteristics and dimensional limitations have been evaluated becoming the strategic parameters that led to its configuration. The main technical challenge to confront is being sealed with non-exterior driveshaft, ensuring that the whole interior is filled and wetted with working fluid and helping the hydrodynamic film formation, the pumping effect, and the heat dissipation. Subsequently, the mini pump architecture, embodiment, methodology, materials, and manufacture are presented. The trend of applications of polymer composite materials and their benefits wanted to be examined with this new mini pump prototype, and a pure polyoxymethylene mini trochoidal-gear set has been designed and manufactured. Finally, both the sintered and the polymer trochoidal-gear units have been experimentally tested in an in-house full-instrumented mini test bench. Although the main goal of the presented work is the development of a new mini trochoidal-gear pump prototype rather than a numerical study, the results have been compared with numerical simulation. Subsequently, the prototype of the mini trochoidal-gear pump is a feasible proof of concept supported by functional indexes and the experimental results. © 2017 by the authors.

Usability heuristics are lightweight inspection methods that can be applied to identify usability problems, requiring less time and human resources. Many usability heuristics have been proposed for evaluating traditional user interfaces. However, due to the virtual reality environment's distinctive characteristics, traditional heuristics do not effectively fit such systems' nature. Virtual reality is beneficial to many applications, especially in surgical training with safety-critical procedures that pose a relatively high risk for patients. Thus, there is a need for a specific set of surgical simulation heuristics based on virtual reality, since the interaction style is markedly different from direct manipulation of graphical user interface.

In this context, automated reasoning based on Satisfiability (SAT) or Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is very effective. For a given application, however, selecting the best reasoning engine is a daunting task requiring first-hand experience and insight into engine-specific implementation details. Developers have to decide which concrete engine to use and how to integrate the engine into an application. Although file formats, e.g., DIMACS CNF or SMT-LIB, standardize the input of SAT and SMT solvers, not all engines provide input interfaces compliant with these standards. When following the standard, advanced (and not standardized) features of the solvers remain unused and their integration is left to the users. This work presents metaSMT, a framework that eases the integration of existing reasoning engines into applications. Inspired by SMT-LIB, metaSMT provides a domain-specific language that allows for engine-independent programming and offers a generic interface to advanced features as an extra abstraction layer. State-of-the-art solvers for satisfiability and other theories are available via metaSMT with little programming effort. Language bindings for C++ and Python are provided.

These functions are realized by artificially transplanting the tactile sensation of a healthy part of the user's body to the amputated part of their body. The haptic transplant technology transmits the force sensation of the prosthesis to the master interface attached to the amputee's healthy part of body using bilateral control without a force sensor.

This stress basis is automatically adapted to the current user edited shape on the fly, and thereby offers reliable stress estimation. We then introduce a new finite element discretization scheme to use the reduced basis for fast stress analysis.

The diode leakage currents have been extensively studied using the back-gate bias as a means to alter the space-charge (SC) condition at the P- region (I-region)/buried oxide interface from accumulation to full depletion, and finally to inversion. Both dark leakage current analysis and low-frequency noise characterization performed on the suspended SOI lateral p-i-n diode indicate device degradation induced by microelectromechanical systems postprocessing (i.e., deep reactive-ion etching or aluminum deposition). A low-Temperature (250 °C) in situ (i.e., using embedded microheater) annealing of SOI lateral p-i-n diode after postprocessing allows reduction of the diode leakage current and optimization of the device performance by neutralizing the interface traps and improving carriers' lifetime and surface recombination velocity. Numerical simulations have been performed with Atlas/SILVACO for deeper analysis of the leakage current behavior in the lateral p-i-n diode and identification of the generation mechanism dominating the diode leakage behavior. Simulation reveals that the dominant generation rate in the diode depends on the SC conditions, the interface trap density, and the carriers' lifetime in the I-region. The experimental and simulated behaviors of 'as processed' and annealed diode leakage current are shown to be in good qualitative agreement. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Annealing; characterization; dark leakage current; interface traps; low-frequency noise (LFN); P+P?N+ (p-i-n) diode; silicon on insulator (SOI); simulation.","Aluminum coatings; Annealing; Characterization; Diodes; Electromechanical devices; MEMS; Numerical models; Optical sensors; Reactive ion etching; Silicon; Silicon on insulator technology; Spurious signal noise; Temperature; Interface traps; Low-Frequency Noise; Performance evaluation; PiN diode; Silicon-on- insulators (SOI); simulation; Leakage currents",2-s2.0-85028691937

Moreover, the data violate the assumption of independence underlying standard linear regression models, leading to Type I error inflation. To solve these problems, we present AGSuite, a free Shiny application for researchers studying AGL. The suite’s intuitive Web-based user interface allows researchers to generate strings from a database of published grammars, compute feature measures (e.g., Levenshtein distance) for each letter string, and conduct a feature analysis on the strings using linear mixed effects (LME) analyses. The LME analysis solves the inflation of Type I errors that afflicts more common methods of repeated measures regression analysis. Finally, the software can generate a number of graphical representations of the data to support an accurate interpretation of results. We hope the ease and availability of these tools will encourage researchers to take full advantage of item-level variance in their datasets in the study of AGL. We moreover discuss the broader applicability of the tools for researchers looking to conduct feature analysis in any field. © 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Artificial grammar learning; Feature analysis; Linear mixed effects analysis; Shiny application","computer interface; controlled study; data base; decision making; error; experimental model; female; grammar; human; human experiment; language; learning; linear regression analysis; male; scientist; software; statistical model",2-s2.0-85020429411

By using a large spherical explosive charge to drive the expansion of a water saturated synthetic sand shell, it has been possible to create sand front impact speeds with a test plate that exceeded 1200 m/s. Direct observations of the evolution of the sand front were made using a pair of high speed video cameras, and revealed rapid initial acceleration of the sand accompanied by the formation of locally faster sand spikes, followed by deceleration. The pressure evolution and specific impulse during particle impact were measured using the Kolsky bar. A discrete particle-based numerical simulation method implemented in the IMPETUS Afea code was then used to simulate the pressure and impulse applied to the Kolsky bar and to model dynamic deformation of the plate and its support structure. The simulation analyzed the interactions between the explosively accelerated high explosive, air, and sand particles and the shock fronts that propagated though each interface after detonation. The impulse applied to the test plate and its support structure were well reproduced by the simulation. The simulations also revealed significant dispersion of the sand, with some sand particles attaining radial velocities that were almost 50% higher than that of the main front. They also identified the presence of an experimentally unobservable instability at the energetic material-wet sand interface. The deceleration of the sand with distance of propagation was found to be the result of momentum transferring collisions with the background air, resulting in the formation of a strong air shock ahead of the sand front. This processes resulted in the eventual transfer of all the sand momentum to the air and significantly influenced the dynamically changing topology of the sand-air interface. While the differential acceleration of the sand particles to form a dispersed front, and their deceleration by air drag were well modeled, the topology of the sand instabilities at the sand front-air interface were not resolved by the simulations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic deformation; Fluid-structure interaction; Particle-based simulation","Deformation; Explosives; Fluid structure interaction; Ground supports; High speed cameras; Interfaces (materials); Numerical methods; Particles (particulate matter); Plates (structural components); Stress-strain curves; Topology; Video cameras; Differential accelerations; Direct observations; Dynamic deformation; High speed video cameras; Internal explosion; Numerical simulation method; Particle-based simulation; Support structures; Sand",2-s2.0-85013998908

Thus, technicians or club DJs now spend double to triple the time previously required before a show on matching the lighting control sequence musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) with the music, which is very time consuming. Thus, a methodology for automatic stage-lighting regulation would be very useful. Recently, the development of music emotion recognition (MER) and neural network algorithms has progressed significantly. Feelings related to music can be recognized and are even quantifiable using a supervised machine learning approach. In this study, a variety of music signal features from 2,087 song clips were captured, and then, a cross-validation test based on the support vector machine's (SVM) accuracy of classifying them into Thayer's emotion plane was applied to the main features related to music emotions, in order to produce linear quantitative values for describing music emotions. Music emotions and color preferences for stage lighting were subsequently studied. Using the experimental results, a support vector regression (SVR) model was trained to construct simulations. To increase the realism of the simulations, we developed an automatic music segment detection methodology based on music signal intensity to capture the different music strengths and feelings in each segment. Furthermore, music genres were studied as a factor for developing a comprehensive automatic stage lighting system based on feelings, genre, and the intensity of each segment of music. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Automatic music segment detection; Automatic stage-lighting regulation; Lighting color regulation based on music emotions and genre; Music emotion recognition; Support vector regression (SVR)","Electronic musical instruments; Learning systems; Speech recognition; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Cross-validation tests; Music emotions; Music segments; Musical instrument digital interfaces; Neural network algorithm; Stage lighting; Supervised machine learning; Support vector regression (SVR); Lighting",2-s2.0-85019625713

For this, experimental investigations are carried out and four experimental truss models with different interfacial imperfections are tested under four-point bending. Finite element models are also developed to conduct the corresponding mechanism and parametric analyses. The test results show that interfacial imperfections between the steel tube and concrete core have significant effects on the ultimate loading capacity of CFST trusses. The ultimate loading capacity of tested models with 100% interfacial separation, 10% depth separation and 20% depth separation are 9.2%, 18.0% and 37.7% lower than that of the model with fully bonded steel tube and concrete core.

To relax this difficulty, this paper develops a promising progressive structure simulation from SgOctβR's sequence, to its predicted structure of SgOctβR in vacuum, to its conformation as well as its complex with endogenous ligand octopamine in a solvent-membrane system. The combined approach of multiple sequence alignment, static structural characterization, and dynamic process of conformational change during binding octopamine reveal three important aspects.

In the literature, limited work has been carried out on the above-stated issue; moreover, due to approximation factors of polynomials, a tolerance error cannot be overseen. Reliable before-fabrication forecasting requires exact mathematical calculation of the parameters involved. A second-order polynomial equation is calculated mathematically for key performance parameters of both modes. This eliminates the approximation factor, and an exact result can be studied, maintaining high accuracy. The elimination of approximation factors and an approach of exact results are based on a new design parameter (δ) that we propose.

This system consisted of three components, a fan, motor, and the flow resistance of the motor, or of the vacuum cleaner. The combined characteristics of the fan and the motor were obtained from torque matching at a constant throttling condition, and a pressure drop was implemented under a constant flow rate to account for the flow resistance. By combining these two steps, the performance characteristics of the fan-motor assembly and the vacuum cleaner system could be predicted over the whole range of operation, based on the characteristics of each component. The predicted performance for power, flow rate, pressure, and efficiency using the present method agreed well with the experimental results obtained for an equivalent system, within 2% difference at best efficiency point. Three models of the fan-motor assembly (S1, S2, and S3) were analyzed at the component level, and the decrease in efficiency produced by flow resistance was estimated to be 1% (S1 and S3 models) or 4.7% (S2 model) using the present method. The characteristics of the fan, extracted from those of the fan-motor assembly, were used for validating the computational fluid dynamics. The computational fluid dynamics results of this study predicted higher efficiency due to simplification of the geometry, but an accurate prediction of best efficiency point location was obtained. The proposed method is also applicable for detecting system leakage and identifying system resistance without direct measurement. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.","Centrifugal fan; computational fluid dynamics; flow resistance; system-level analysis; vacuum cleaner","Computational geometry; Dynamics; Efficiency; Fans; Fluid dynamics; Vacuum cleaners; Accurate prediction; Best efficiency point; Centrifugal fans; Constant flow rates; Flow resistance; Performance characteristics; Predicted performance; System-level analysis; Computational fluid dynamics",2-s2.0-85030163546

Achieving efficiency, ensuring portability, while preserving programming tractability on such hardware prompted the HPC community to design new, higher level paradigms while relying on runtime systems to maintain performance. However, the common weakness of these projects is to deeply tie applications to specific expert-only runtime system APIs. The OpenMP specification, which aims at providing common parallel programming means for shared-memory platforms, appears as a good candidate to address this issue thanks to the latest task-based constructs introduced in its revision 4.0. The goal of this paper is to assess the effectiveness and limits of this support for designing a high-performance numerical library, ScalFMM, implementing the fast multipole method (FMM) that we have deeply re-designed with respect to the most advanced features provided by OpenMP 4. We show that OpenMP 4 allows for significant performance improvements over previous OpenMP revisions on recent multicore processors and that extensions to the 4.0 standard allow for strongly improving the performance, bridging the gap with the very high performance that was so far reserved to expert-only runtime system APIs. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","commutativity; compiler; fast multipole method; High performance computing; multicore architecture; OpenMP; parallel programming model; priority; runtime system","Application programming interfaces (API); Computer architecture; Memory architecture; Multiprocessing systems; Numerical methods; Parallel programming; Program compilers; Software architecture; Commutativity; compiler; Fast multipole method; High performance computing; Multicore architectures; OpenMP; Parallel programming model; priority; Runtime systems; Multicore programming",2-s2.0-85029351687

In this paper, we argue that this triad reflects a primarily intra-scientific perspective, rather than the needs and considerations of policy-makers themselves. Using over seventy semi-structured interviews with policy-makers, we present alternative criteria for effective science-policy interactions based on experiences in the urban water sector. We find that applicability, comprehensiveness, timing and accessibility (ACTA) better summarises the most important aspects of scientific research when it comes to influencing decision-making, while finding that CRELE was a poor predictor of policy-maker concerns. Whilst the ACTA quartet effectively gives double-billing to the ‘relevance’ component of CRELE, credibility and legitimacy were much lower priorities for policy-makers interviewed. This article questions whether CRELE is a useful mindset for researchers interested in policy influence. These findings will be of interest to those engaged in debates related to effective science-policy interactions more broadly, and researchers that want to marshal policy influence more specifically. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Credibility; Legitimacy; Policy process; Relevance; Science-policy interface","water; Article; decision making; environmental policy; government; grounded theory; priority journal; public figure; research; science; scientist; semi structured interview; thematic analysis; urban area",2-s2.0-85022070938

First, according to the story elements, inter-sessions are divided into groups, whereby the layout of the entities will be optimized in individual groups. Then, the hierarchical relationships of entities in polar coordinates can be confirmed. Finally, we use several skills, e.g., interaction, labels and a fan-shaped visualization view, to enable people better understand how story evolves and track the hierarchical relationship more conveniently. Experimental results show that the proposed hierarchical plot visualization method in polar coordinates can reveal discontinuous events and nonlinear stories.

Given a set of items from a group of users, Group Recommender Systems generate a subset of those items within a given group budget (i.e. the number of items to have in the final recommendation). Recommending to a group of users based on the ordered preferences provided by each user is an open problem.

It is shown in this paper that the podium can impose significant differential restraint on coupled tower walls. Incompatible tower wall displacements under lateral loads were found to be the main contributor to the generation of in-plane strutting forces in floors above and below the podium-tower interface level. Shear force localisations in the interior tower wall immediately above the interface was found to be the direct consequence of these actions. Key parameters contributing to this detrimental shear force localisation in a tower wall were analysed by way of parameter studies on representative models of the building and sub-assemblages. It is revealed that the in-plane rigid diaphragm assumption commonly adopted in practice can significantly suppress compatibility forces generated within the building floor leading to unconservative design of the tower walls.

Design Single-group, repeated-measures study. Setting Academic medical center. Participants Individuals (N=28) with SCI or spinal cord disease who used MWCs completed a telephone screening, and 21 of them were eligible and completed the study. Interventions Participants' personal MWCs were modified to have seat dump angles of 0° or 14°, with a vertical backrest. Participants completed at least 3 propulsion cycles in each condition, during which spine and shoulder motion data were collected with fiberoptic and electromagnetic sensors, respectively. Main Outcome Measures Thoracolumbar spinal curvature, glenohumeral kinematics, and scapulothoracic kinematics at the start of push (SP), mid-push (MP), end of push (EP), and mid-recovery. Results Participants had significantly less lordosis in the 14° condition for all propulsion events. Median differences ranged from 2.0° to 4.6°. Lordosis differences were more pronounced in those with low SCI. Scapulothoracic internal rotation was increased in the 14° condition at SP and MP (mean differences, 2.5° and 2.7°, respectively). Relative downward rotation increased in the 14° condition at SP and MP (mean differences, 2.4° and 2.1°, respectively). Scapulothoracic differences were more pronounced in those with high SCI. No glenohumeral rotations were significantly different between the conditions. Conclusions Scapulothoracic kinematics and spinal curvature differences during propulsion may be associated with the position of other body segments or postural stability. Because no differences were observed at the glenohumeral joint, the risk of subacromial impingement may not be affected by this seat angle change. © 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","Posture; Rehabilitation; Shoulder; Spinal cord injuries; Spine; Wheelchairs","adult; biomechanics; body position; disabled person; equipment design; female; human; lordosis; male; pathophysiology; physiology; shoulder; spinal cord disease; spinal cord injury; wheelchair; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Disabled Persons; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Lordosis; Male; Posture; Shoulder Joint; Spinal Cord Diseases; Spinal Cord Injuries; Wheelchairs",2-s2.0-85019151733

Fostering collaboration within BbCNs is a top priority for construction project managers, yet no explicit body of knowledge has focused on investigating the relevant research gaps in knowledge. The present study intends to address this gap by plotting the storyline of relevant research studies in the last 10 years (2006–2016). A “Collaboration Pentagon” consisted of context, process, task, team and actor as the theoretical lens is created through integration of relevant frameworks. The study draws upon a bibliometric analysis of 1031 studies on BIM alongside the outcome of a qualitative evaluation of a total of 62 carefully selected papers on collaboration in BbCNs. The findings reveal that the scholarship on collaboration on BIM-enabled projects has predominately focused on technology as one antecedent of collaboration while project-related and managerial antecedents have remained under-researched. Moreover, though enhancing collaboration necessitates inclusion of all influential antecedents, studies with such an all-inclusive perspective are rare. The study contributes to the field through this inclusive Collaboration Pentagon and by providing a systematic and objective evaluation of available literature on collaboration in BbCNs and uncovering respective gaps. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA","Bibliometric analysis; Building information modelling (BIM); Collaboration; Construction project management; Mixed methods systematic review","Information management; Managers; Project management; Bibliometric analysis; Building Information Modelling; Collaboration; Construction project management; Systematic Review; Architectural design; literature review; modeling; project management; qualitative analysis; research",2-s2.0-85024115642

Herein we report multiple receptor conformers based molecular docking as a practical alternative to account for the receptor flexibility. Multiple (forty) conformers of Mycobacterium Enoyl ACP Reductase (InhA) are generated from Molecular Dynamics simulation and twenty crystallographic structures of InhA bound to different inhibitors are obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Fluorine directed modifications are performed to currently available anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide. The modified drugs are optimized using B3LYP 6-31G (d,p) level of theory. Dipole moment, frontier orbital gap and thermodynamical properties such as electronic energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of these optimized drugs are investigated. These drugs are subsequently docked against the conformers of InhA. Molecular docking against multiple InhA conformations show variation in ligand binding affinity and suggest that Ser94, Gly96, Lys165 and Ile194 amino acids play critical role on strong drug-InhA interaction. Modified drug N1 showed greater binding affinity compared to EN in most conformations. Structure of PDB ID: 2NSD and snapshot conformer at 5.5 ns show most favorable binding with N1 compared to other conformers. Fluorine participates in forming fluorine bonds and contributes significantly in increasing binding affinity. Our study reveal that addition of trifluoromethyl group explicitly shows promise in improving thermodynamic properties and in enhancing hydrogen bonding and non-bonded interactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that EN and N1 remained in the binding pocket similar to the docked pose of EN-InhA and E1-InhA complexes and also suggested that InhA binds to its inhibitor in inhibitor-induced folding manner. ADMET calculations predict modified drugs to have improved pharmacokinetic properties. Our study concludes that multiple receptor conformers based molecular docking can be an alternative to study the effect of receptor flexibility in ligand binding and fluorine directed modifications can improve drug efficacy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Drug design; Enoyl ACP reductase (InhA); Ensemble-based docking; Molecular docking; Molecular dynamics; Quantum calculation","Bins; Fluorine; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Hydrogen bonds; Ligands; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Crystallographic structure; Drug Design; Enoyl ACP reductase (InhA); Molecular docking; Molecular dynamics simulations; Pharmacokinetic properties; Quantum calculation; Thermodynamical properties; Binding energy; amino acid; enoyl acp reductase; ethionamide; fluorine; hydrogen; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; Article; binding affinity; chemical reaction; complex formation; conformation; crystallography; dipole; drug receptor binding; drug structure; enthalpy; hydrogen bond; ligand binding; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; molecular weight; nonhuman; priority journal; quantum mechanics; simulation; thermodynamics",2-s2.0-85029799813

Our team is developing an innovative programme allowing patients to self-assess and self-monitor their nutrition at the bedside. The present study aimed to assess usability and patient perceptions of an electronic foodservice system (EFS) for participating in nutrition care. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in an Australian tertiary hospital. Participants were sampled purposively and included patients who were able to provide informed consent and communicate in English. Patient interviews were conducted at the bedside and consisted of: (i) usability testing of the EFS using ‘Think Aloud’ technique and (ii) questioning using a semi-structured interview guide to understand perceptions of the EFS. Interview data were analysed using inductive content analysis. Results: Thirty-two patients were interviewed. Their perceptions of using the EFS to participate in nutrition care were expressed in five categories: (i) Familiarity with technology can affect confidence and ability but is not essential to use EFS; (ii) User interface design significantly impacts EFS usability; (iii) Identifying benefits to technology increases its acceptance; (iv) Technology enables participation, which occurs to varying extents; and (v) Degree of participation depends on perceived importance of nutrition. Conclusions: Patients found the EFS acceptable and acknowledged benefits to its use. Several factors appeared to influence usability, acceptability and willingness to engage with the system, such as user interface design and perceived ease of use, benefits and importance.

Despite these regulatory efforts, the actual energy consumption significantly deviates from these ambitious goals. Based on this observation it will be argued that it is possible to explain this deviation by putting the focus on users’ practices rather than solely focusing on building physics. In order to determine the impact of building physics and user behaviour on heating energy consumption separately, a mixed methods approach was developed. Actual heat energy consumption data of flats in two German refurbishment areas was collected and semi-standardized interviews with the inhabitants of 80 of these households were conducted. We use qualitative data to identify households’ practices related to energy consumption and measure the relative impact of these practices with quantitative data. Aside from the building physics, we can observe that preferences for thermal comfort as well as ventilation practices have the strongest influence on households’ heating energy consumption after retrofitting. Based on these findings, it is argued that future policy measures should focus on user-technology interface design rather than solely focusing on ever stricter efficiency standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Building physics; Energy efficiency; Heating energy consumption; Mixed methods; Practice theory",,2-s2.0-85026676672

In order to improve the physical and mental health of these patients, robotic devices that can help them to regain the mobility to stand and walk are highly desirable. The aim of this study is to develop a wearable exoskeleton suit to help paralysed patients regain the ability to stand up/sit down (STS) and walk. Methods A lower extremity exoskeleton named CUHK-EXO was developed with considerations of ergonomics, user-friendly interface, safety, and comfort. The mechanical structure, human-machine interface, reference trajectories of the exoskeleton hip and knee joints, and control architecture of CUHK-EXO were designed. Clinical trials with a paralysed patient were performed to validate the effectiveness of the whole system design. Results With the assistance provided by CUHK-EXO, the paralysed patient was able to STS and walk. As designed, the actual joint angles of the exoskeleton well followed the designed reference trajectories, and assistive torques generated from the exoskeleton actuators were able to support the patient's STS and walking motions. Conclusion The whole system design of CUHK-EXO is effective and can be optimised for clinical application.

The gene-by-drug interactions are an important dimension of optimal drug repositioning and development strategies. While gene-by-drug interactions have been curated and presented in various databases, novel bioinformatics tools and approaches are timely, and required with a specific focus to support drug positioning. We report, in this study, the design of a public web-accessible transcriptomic-/gene expression-guided pharmaceuticals search tool, geneXpharma (www.genexpharma.org). GeneXpharma is a public platform with user-centric interface that provides statistically evaluated gene expressions and their drug interactions for 48 diseases under seven different disease categories. GeneXpharma is designed and organized to generate hypotheses on druggable genome within the disease-gene-drug triad and thus, help repositioning of drugs against diseases. The search system accommodates various entry points using drugs, genes, or diseases, which then enable researchers to extract drug repurposing candidates and readily export for further evaluation. Future developments aim to improve the geneXpharma algorithm, enrich its content, and enhance the website interface through addition of network visualizations and graphical display items.

Unfortunately, accurate determination of these parameters is often complicated and time consuming, in part due to the need for different software at the various analysis steps and for validating the results. Here, we present an integrated, cross-platform and open-source software that is significantly more versatile than the typical line shape fitting application. The software is a completely redesigned version of PINT (https://pint-nmr.github.io/PINT/). It features a graphical user interface and includes functionality for peak picking, editing of peak lists and line shape fitting. In addition, the obtained peak intensities can be used directly to extract, for instance, relaxation rates, heteronuclear NOE values and exchange parameters. In contrast to most available software the entire process from spectral visualization to preparation of publication-ready figures is done solely using PINT and often within minutes, thereby, increasing productivity for users of all experience levels.

Interactive approaches to train mindfulness are presented and discussed in relation to Bergomi’s conceptual mindfulness model and Vago and Silbersweig’s neurobiological approach for cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. Based on existing interactive technologies, key design guidelines are developed to investigate the delivery of mindfulness by interactive media, including the design recommendations of personalization, gamification, and social features for the S-ART component intention and motivation; biofeedback training and narrative for emotion regulation; moral dilemmas, perspective taking, and cooperative design for prosociality; and explorative self-reflection, visualization and immersive feedback, and the integration of internal stimuli for self-transcendence. The paper recommends to apply a more extensive definition of mindfulness, which includes ethical and spiritual development. As a design premise for mindfulness technology, it is advised to strive for embodied experiences that adapt to the user’s internal state. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Emotion regulation; Games; Motivation; Prosociality; Self-transcendence; Technology",,2-s2.0-85029773021

Most of the existing models focus on isotropic materials and some on transversely isotropic materials. We propose a modeling method for orthotropic materials, which exhibits different mechanical behaviors along three orthogonal directions. First, constraints for the strain energy density in linear elastic models are analyzed, and a positive-definite elasticity tensor is derived for an orthotropic material. Second, an orthotropic deformation controlling frame-field is conceptualized and a frame construction tool is developed for users to define the desired material properties. A quaternion Laplacian smoothing algorithm is proposed, and several user-defined rotation minimizing frames are propagated into the entire body of the deformable object, which forms a smooth frame-field. Third, the corotational linear FEM model coupled with the orthonormal frame-field is formulated to realize a dynamics system, which can deal with large deformations. All the algorithms have been implemented in a comprehensive modeling and simulation system, and a GUI is provided to design the orthotropic model.

Yet the unique touch operations of the mobile interface offer opportunities, too. In this paper, our measurements based on the real traces from gamers and viewers reveal that strong associations exist between the gamers' touch interactions and the viewers' gazing patterns. Motivated by this, we present a novel interaction-aware optimization framework to improve the energy utilization and stream quality for mobile gamecasting. Our framework incorporates a touch-assisted prediction module to extract association rules for gazing pattern prediction and a tile-based optimization module to utilize energy on mobile devices efficiently.

Linked Data, a new form of knowledge representation and publishing described by RDF, can provide a more precise and comprehensible semantic structure to satisfy the aforementioned requirement. Further, the SPARQL query language for RDF is the foundation of many current researches about Linked Data querying. However, these SPARQL-based methods cannot fully express the semantics of the query, so they cannot unleash the potential of Linked Data. To fill this gap, this paper designs a new querying method which extends the SPARQL pattern. Firstly, the authors present some new semantic properties for predicates in RDF triples and design a Semantic Matrix for Predicates (SMP). They then establish a well-defined framework for the notion of Semantically-Extended Query Model for the Linked Data (SEQMLD). Moreover, the authors propose some novel algorithms for executing queries by integrating semantic extension into SPARQL pattern. Lastly, experimental results show that the authors' proposal has a good generality and performs better than some of the most representative similarity search methods.

Results obtained show good agreement with all those aspects of response, while providing insights, guidance, and a validated model that will be of benefit in future studies of CFSSP-Walls. In a second part of this paper, the calibrated finite element model is used to provide insights and generate knowledge on some important aspects of wall behavior that is valuable for the design of CFSSP-Walls.

For this new structural system, such insights into structural behavior are severely lacking. The findings here provide such insights on the distribution of wall-to-footing forces, shear force demands in critical tie bars, cumulative plastic strain value at failure due to low-cycle fatigue, the effect of hoop and shear stresses on uniaxial steel plate yielding, and the effect of interface friction on the force flow within boundary elements.

This paper reports on the design, development, and pilot of a novel intervention which aims to reduce repeat offending by first-time convicted drink driving offenders. It explores whether an online program is acceptable and user friendly and contains useful and relevant content, with a sample of first-time drink driving offenders recruited at the time of conviction. Method: Building upon existing research into interventions to reduce drink driving recidivism and problem alcohol use, a tailored program was designed to provide content specifically concerned with drink driving and with an additional component related to alcohol use. Following stakeholder and internal review, the ‘Steering Clear First Offender Drink Driving Program’ was subsequently piloted with 15 first-time drink driving offenders. Evaluative data was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: The pilot results indicate that the participants found the program to be user friendly, as demonstrated by high scores in relation to navigation, online delivery, engagement, avatar usage and straightforwardness. They reported that they found the content to be useful and relevant and that the key learning area was in relation to the consequences of drink driving. Conclusion: Online interventions for reducing risky behaviour such as drink driving may be useful and cost effective from a public health perspective. Potentially, they can directly address risky behaviours associated with alcohol use in high-risk cohorts that may not ordinarily receive intervention. © 2017, International Society of Behavioral Medicine.","Alcohol; Drink driving; Health risk behaviour; Online intervention; Steering clear first offender drink driving program; Treatment",,2-s2.0-85020648490

In 5G, small/semi-macro cells using Massive MIMO (M-MIMO) with much wider bandwidth in higher frequency bands are overlaid on macro cell with existing frequency band. Moreover, high density deployment of small/semimacro cell is expected to improve areal capacity. However, in low SHF band (below 6 GHz), antenna array size of M-MIMO is large so that it cannot be installed on some environments. Therefore, to improve system throughput on various use cases in 5G, we have proposed distributed Massive MIMO (DM-MIMO). DM-MIMO coordinates lots of distributed transmission points (TPs) that are located in ultra-high density (UHD). Furthermore, DM-MIMO uses various numbers of antenna elements for each TP. In addition, DM-MIMO with UHD-TPs can create user-centric virtual cells corresponding to user mobility, and design of flexible antenna deployment for DM-MIMO is applicable to various use cases. Then, some key parameters such as the number of the distributed TPs, the number of antenna elements for each TP, and proper distance between TPs, should be determined. This paper presents such parameters for 5G DM-MIMO with flexible antenna deployment under fixed total transmission power and constant total number of antenna elements. Computer simulations show that DM-MIMO can achieve more than 1.9 times higher system throughput than an M-MIMO system using 128 antenna elements. © 2017 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","5g; Distributed massive MIMO; Flexible antenna deployment; Low shf bands; Ultra-high density; Virtual cell","5G mobile communication systems; Antenna arrays; Antennas; Cells; Cytology; Frequency bands; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Radio broadcasting; Antenna deployments; Distributed transmissions; Flexible antennas; Low shf bands; Performance enhancements; Radio access technologies; Ultrahigh density; Virtual cells; Microwave antennas",2-s2.0-85030476954

To contribute to MC from information communication and user interaction aspects, this work proposes an Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) RFID tag with an Impulse-Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) transmitter and an inkjet-printed Electrochromic (EC) display. First, compared to the conventional UHF RFID tags, the proposed tag shows the advantage of higher transmission data rate with still low power consumption. The response time in multi-tag accessing scenarios can be reduced to less than 500 ms per 1000 tags by the pipeline of the tag responses in IR-UWB link and the reader acknowledgments in UHF RFID link as well as by reducing the length of empty slots. Second, the tag is integrated with a flexible EC display manufactured by inkjet-printing on the polyimide substrate. It works as an automatically refreshed paper label that offers an intuitive human-to-device interface to improve the efficiency of the offline workers. To conquer the material variations and make use of the long retention time of the printed EC display, its threshold voltage is utilized and a feedback comparator enabling the display driver by the threshold voltage is designed. A System-on-Chip (SoC) is implemented in UMC 0.18 μm CMOS process. According to the experimental results: 1) the IR-UWB transmitter achieves 1.02 V pulse amplitude and 900 ps pulse duration with 18 pJ/pulse energy consumption; 2) the EC display driver automatically refreshes the display when the image fades out, and consumes 1.98 μW per 1 cm2 display size to retain an image.

Despite of the convenience of cloud storage, security challenges have risen upon the fact that users do not physically possess their data any more. Thus, some auditing schemes are introduced to ensure integrity of the outsourced data. And among them Panda is a public auditing scheme for shared data with efficient and secure user revocation proposed by Wang et al. It argued that it could verify the integrity of shared data with storage correctness and public auditing. In this paper, we analyze this scheme and find some security drawbacks. Firstly, Panda cannot preserve shared data privacy in cloud storage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that Panda is vulnerable to integrity forgery attack, which can be performed by malicious cloud servers to forge a valid auditing proof against any auditing challenge even without correct data storage. Then we pinpoint that the primary cause of the insecurity is the linear combinations of sampled data blocks without random masking properly. Finally, we propose an improvement of Panda together with data privacy preserving and sound public auditing while incurring optimal communication and computation overhead. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud computing; Internet of things; Multimedia data; Privacy preserving; Public auditing; Shared data","Cloud computing; Digital storage; Internet; Internet of things; Computation overheads; Data-privacy preserving; Multimedia data; Optimal communication; Privacy preserving; Public auditing; Security challenges; Shared data; Data privacy",2-s2.0-84949501928

The out-of-band emissions of a nonlinear power amplifier create interference to the other users. The target is then to maximize the achievable uplink rate in a multiuser multicarrier cognitive network where a cognitive user should not introduce interference to the other users more than a specified threshold level, called interference power constraint. This task is formulated as a convex optimization problem with interference power constraints. Obtaining a closed-form solution for this problem is, however, not feasible due to its nonlinear nature. Accordingly, the problem is solved numerically, and extensive simulations are conducted to obtain performance results. The obtained results are also compared with a more simple heuristic approach. The results show that the proposed scheme provides a maximum rate while at the same time also guaranteeing that the interference levels are lower than the specified interference power constraint. The results also indicate that the maximum rate can be closely approximated by using the assisted or optimization-directed heuristic approach.

Previous research unveils students' deficits in understanding the behavior of structural elements in a three-dimensional (3D) context due to the shortcomings of traditional lecturing approaches, which put too much emphasis on the analysis of individual structural members, thereby falling short in providing a solid, easy-to-follow, and holistic approach to analyzing complex structures with a large number of interconnected elements. In this paper, the authors introduce a new pedagogy for teaching structural analysis that incorporates mobile augmented reality (AR) and interactive 3D visualization technology. The goal of this study is to enhance the contents used in structural analysis textbooks and on worksheets by visualizing discrete structural members employing AR along with interactive 3D models in order to illustrate how the structures behave under different loading conditions. Students can interactively change the load and observe the reaction resulting from this change with the instant feedback provided by the AR interface. The feasibility of AR concepts and interaction metaphors, as well as the potential of using AR for teaching structural analysis are investigated, specifically by focusing on challenges regarding content integration and interaction. An AR application is designed and developed, and a pilot study is conducted in a junior level structural analysis class to assess the pedagogical impact and the design concepts employed by the AR tool. Control and test groups are deployed, and students’ performance is measured using pre- and post-tests. The results of the pilot study indicate that the utilized AR design concepts have potential to contribute to students’ learning by providing interactive and 3D visualization features, which support constructive engagement and retention of information in students. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Augmented reality; Education; Structural members; Students; Teaching; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Civil engineering programs; Construction engineering; Interaction metaphors; Interactive 3-D models; Interactive 3d visualizations; Mobile augmented reality; Structural elements; Threedimensional (3-d); Structural analysis",2-s2.0-85031736734

The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive methodology applied to an office building. First, sensitivity analysis allows users to identify and prioritize the most influential inputs of their model. Non-influential inputs can then be fixed to their nominal values, without impacting the results. The remaining set of parameters makes it possible to assess quantitative measures such as Sobol’ indices which give useful information on the model variance. Different methods are suitable for such calculations but generally rely on specific sample design. Meta-model reduction based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion can be used as a post-processing method and appears to be the best compromise between accuracy and computation time for our case study.

The evolution of SDR and the involved departure from digital representations of classical radio architecture towards more abstract software systems raises new requirements of increased flexibility and versatility. The proposed Data Flow Control for C++ (DFC++) processing framework concept addresses those requirements by employing modern programming techniques and flow control mechanisms to allow for variable data rates, dynamic paths, and flexible component designs. Another important trend is the integration of various embedded platforms in the software radio domain. The rapidly increasing performance and efficiency of embedded processors enables the deployment of SDR systems in more space and power constrained environments. Therefore covering a heterogeneous hardware selection becomes increasingly important for processing frameworks.

However, large-span shells require additional supporting structures to strengthen fragile regions. The problem of designing optimal stiffeners is therefore becoming a major challenge for shell applications. To address it, we propose a computational framework to design and optimize rib layout on arbitrary shell to improve the overall structural stiffness and mechanical performance. The essential of our method is to place ribs along the principal stress lines which reflect paths of material continuity and indicates trajectories of internal forces. Given a surface and user-specified external loads, we perform a Finite Element Analysis. Using the resulting principal stress field, we generate a quad-mesh whose edges align with this cross field. Then we extract an initial rib network from the quad-mesh. After simplifying rib network by removing ribs with little contribution, we perform a rib flow optimization which allows ribs to swing on surface to further adjust rib distribution. Finally, we optimize rib cross-section to maximally reduce material usage while achieving certain structural stiffness requirements. We demonstrate that our rib-reinforced shell structures achieve good static performances.

While the crawler is responsible for accessing these web pages and giving it to the indexer for making them available to the users of search engine, the rate at which these web pages change has created the necessity for the crawler to employ refresh strategies to give updated/modified content to the search engine users. Furthermore, Deep web is that part of the web that has alarmingly abundant amounts of quality data (when compared to normal/surface web) but not technically accessible to a search engine’s crawler. The existing deep web crawl methods helps to access the deep web data from the result pages that are generated by filling forms with a set of queries and accessing the web databases through them. However, these methods suffer from not being able to maintain the freshness of the local databases. Both the surface web and the deep web needs an incremental crawl associated with the normal crawl architecture to overcome this problem. Crawling the deep web requires the selection of an appropriate set of queries so that they can cover almost all the records in the data source and in addition the overlapping of records should be low so that network utilization is reduced. An incremental crawl adds to an increase in the network utilization with every increment. Therefore, a reduced query set as described earlier should be used in order to minimize the network utilization. Our contributions in this work are the design of a probabilistic approach based incremental crawler to handle the dynamic changes of the surface web pages, adapting the above mentioned method with a modification to handle the dynamic changes in the deep web databases, a new evaluation measure called the ‘Crawl-hit rate’ to evaluate the efficiency of the incremental crawler in terms of the number of times the crawl is actually necessary in the predicted time and a semantic weighted set covering algorithm for reducing the queries so that the network cost is reduced for every increment of the crawl without any compromise in the number of records retrieved. The evaluation of incremental crawler shows a good improvement in the freshness of the databases and a good Crawl-hit rate (83 % for web pages and 81 % for deep web databases) with a lesser over head when compared to the baseline. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bayes theorem; Deep web; Incremental crawl; Information retrieval; Semantic weighted set covering algorithm; Set covering algorithm","Database systems; Information retrieval; Search engines; Semantic Web; Semantics; Websites; Bayes theorem; Deep web; Incremental crawl; Set covering algorithms; Weighted set; World Wide Web",2-s2.0-84988411310

These data are collected with the intention of enabling front-line clinicians to make effective clinical judgments. Ironically, prior human–systems integration (HSI) studies show that the flood of data degrades rather than aids decision-making performance. Health surveillance operations can focus on aggregate changes to population health or on the status of individual people. In the case of clinical monitoring, medical device alarms currently create an information overload situation for front-line clinical workers, such as hospital nurses. Consequently, alarms are often missed or ignored, and an impending patient adverse event may not be recognized in time to prevent crisis. One innovation used to improve decision making in areas of data-rich environments is the Human Alerting and Interruption Logistics (HAIL) technology, which was originally sponsored by the US Office of Naval Research. HAIL delivers metacognitive HSI services that empower end-users to quickly triage interruptions and dynamically manage their multitasking. HAIL informed our development of an experimental prototype that provides a set of context-enabled alarm notification services (without automated alarm filtering) to support users’ metacognition for information triage. This application is called HAIL Clinical Alarm Triage (HAIL-CAT) and was designed and implemented on a smartwatch to support the mobile multitasking of hospital nurses. An empirical study was conducted in a 20-bed virtual hospital with high-fidelity patient simulators. Four teams of four registered nurses (16 in total) participated in a 180-minute simulated patient care scenario. Each nurse was assigned responsibility to care for five simulated patients and high rates of simulated health surveillance data were available from patient monitors, infusion pumps, and a call light system. Thirty alarms per nurse were generated in each 90-minute segment of the data collection sessions, only three of which were clinically important alarms. The within-subjects experimental design included a treatment condition where the nurses used HAIL-CAT on a smartwatch to triage and manage alarms and a control condition without the smartwatch. The results show that, when using the smartwatch, nurses responded three times faster to clinically important and actionable alarms. An analysis of nurse performance also shows no negative effects on their other duties. Subjective results show favorable opinions about utility, usability, training requirement, and adoptability.

However, a linear accelerator device is needed to produce the beam safely. Mobile linear accelerators have been designed as dedicated units that can be moved into the operating room and deliver radiation in situ. Correct and safe dose delivery is a key concern when using mobile accelerators. The applicator is commonly fixed to the patient's bed to ensure that the dose is delivered to the prescribed location, and the mobile accelerator is moved to dock the applicator to the radiation beam output (gantry). In a typical clinical set-up, this task is time-consuming because of safety requirements and the limited degree of freedom of the gantry. The objective of this study was to present a navigation solution based on optical tracking for guidance of docking to improve safety and reduce procedure time. Method: We used an optical tracker attached to the mobile linear accelerator to track the prescribed localization of the radiation collimator inside the operating room. Using this information, the integrated navigation system developed computes the movements that the mobile linear accelerator needs to perform to align the applicator and the radiation gantry and warns the physician if docking is unrealizable according to the available degrees of freedom of the mobile linear accelerator. Furthermore, we coded a software application that connects all the necessary functioning elements and provides a user interface for the system calibration and the docking guidance. Result: The system could safeguard against the spatial limitations of the operating room, calculate the optimal arrangement of the accelerator and reduce the docking time in computer simulations and experimental setups. Conclusions: The system could be used to guide docking with any commercial linear accelerator. We believe that the docking navigator we present is a major contribution to IOERT, where docking is critical when attempting to reduce surgical time, ensure patient safety and guarantee that the treatment administered follows the radiation oncologist's prescription. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","docking; hard docking; image-guided surgery; IOERT; optical tracking; soft docking","Article; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; computer simulation; controlled study; dosimetry; electron therapy; eye tracking; human; intraoperative radiotherapy; patient safety; radiation beam; radiation dose; radiation oncologist; radiation safety; rectum; software; testis",2-s2.0-85031290592

The augmented reality allows end-users to interact with the information displayed and perform tasks, while increasing the user’s perception about the real world by adding virtual information to it. Speech is the most natural way of communication: it allows hands-free interaction and may allow end-users to quickly and easily access a range of features available. Speech recognition technology is often available in most of the current mobile devices, but it often uses Internet to receive the corresponding transcript from remote servers, e.g., Google speech recognition. However, in some outdoor environments, Internet is not always available or may be o ered at poor quality. We integrated an o -line automatic speech recognition module into an AR application for outdoor usage that does not require Internet. Currently, speech interaction is used within the application to access five di erent features, namely: to take a photo, shoot a film, communicate, messaging related tasks, and to request information, either geographic, biometric, or climatic. The application makes available solutions to manage and interact with the mobile device, o ering good usability. We have compared the online and o - line speech recognition systems in order to assess their adequacy to the tasks. Both systems were tested under di erent conditions, commonly found in outdoor environments, such as: Internet access quality, presence of noise, and distractions. © Rui Pascoal, Ricardo Ribeiro, Fernando Batista, and Ana de Almeida","Augmented Reality; Natural Language Processing; Outdoor Environments; Speech Recognition; Sphinx for Mobile Devices","Augmented reality; Human computer interaction; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Natural language processing systems; Online systems; Slate; Speech; Speech communication; Automatic speech recognition; Hands-free interactions; Mobile applications; Outdoor environment; Speech interaction; Speech recognition systems; Speech recognition technology; Virtual information; Speech recognition",2-s2.0-85032642925

To characterize the adhesive strength, a simple model of a cellphone that consists of a glass window attached to body frame using double-sided tape was designed and fabricated. The adhesion strength with different pull out speeds and aging times was measured using a conventional pull out testing method. To investigate the detailed delamination process of the adhesive layer, the digital image correlation technique was applied. Moreover, in recent years, the trend of using metal for a body frame of a cellphone has gradually increased due to the fashion of metal frames. Therefore, two materials for body frames were considered for testing in this study: Aluminum was the representative metal and polycarbonate was the representative conventional material. The results showed that the strain at the interface between the adhesive layer and body frame is higher than that at the interface between adhesive layer and glass window for both cases of aluminum and polycarbonate frames. Moreover, the fracture energy in the aluminum body frame is higher than that in the polycarbonate body frame. In order to validate the experimental results, the cohesive elements in ABAQUS™ were used for the modeling bonding layer. The results showed a good agreement between simulation and experiment. © 2017, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Adhesion strength; Cohesive element; Digital image correlation (DIC); Double-sided tape","Adhesion; Adhesives; Aluminum; Bond strength (materials); Characterization; Glass; Image analysis; Materials testing; Metal testing; Polycarbonates; Strain measurement; Telephone sets; Testing; Adhesive strength; Cohesive element; Conventional materials; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Digital image correlation technique; Double sided; Frame materials; Strength characterization; Strength of materials",2-s2.0-85032284999

Despite their undisputed impact in current society, their engineering is still in its infancy and companies find it difficult to adopt them due to their inherent complexity. Existing attempts to provide architectural guidelines for their engineering fail to take into account important Big Data characteristics, such as the management, evolution and quality of the data. Objective: In this paper, we follow software engineering principles to refine the λ-architecture, a reference model for Big Data systems, and use it as seed to create Bolster, a software reference architecture (SRA) for semantic-aware Big Data systems. Method: By including a new layer into the λ-architecture, the Semantic Layer, Bolster is capable of handling the most representative Big Data characteristics (i.e., Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability and Veracity). Results: We present the successful implementation of Bolster in three industrial projects, involving five organizations. The validation results show high level of agreement among practitioners from all organizations with respect to standard quality factors. Conclusion: As an SRA, Bolster allows organizations to design concrete architectures tailored to their specific needs. A distinguishing feature is that it provides semantic-awareness in Big Data Systems. These are Big Data system implementations that have components to simplify data definition and exploitation. In particular, they leverage metadata (i.e., data describing data) to enable (partial) automation of data exploitation and to aid the user in their decision making processes. This simplification supports the differentiation of responsibilities into cohesive roles enhancing data governance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Big Data; Data analysis; Data management; Semantic-aware; Software reference architecture","Data reduction; Decision making; Information management; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Software engineering; Concrete architecture; Data characteristics; Decision making process; Industrial projects; Inherent complexity; Semantic-aware; Software engineering principles; Software reference architectures; Big data",2-s2.0-85020375972

The study compared the following two conditions: a) 4K-resolution 55“ screen with a 21” touchscreen versus b) 4K-resolution 55″ screen with keyboard/mouse. The touchscreen acted both as an interaction device for data entry and navigation and as an additional source of information. A within-subject experiment was conducted among 20 college engineering students. A primary task of preventing tanks from overfilling as well as a secondary task of manual logging with situation awareness questions were designed for the study. Primary Task performance (including tank level at discharge, number of tank discharged and performance score), Secondary Task Performance (including Tank log count, performance score), system interaction times, subjective workload, situation awareness questionnaire, user experience survey regarding usability and condition comparison were used as the measures. Parametric data resulted in two metrics statistically different means between the two conditions: The 4K-keyboard condition resulted in faster Detection + Navigation time compared to the 4K-touchscreen condition, by about 2 s, while participants within the 4K-touchscreen condition were about 2 s faster in data entry than in the 4K-keyboard condition. No significant results were found for: performance on the secondary task, situation awareness, and workload. Additionally, no clear significant differences were found in the non-parametric data analysis. However, participants showed a slight preference for the 4K-touchscreen condition compared to the 4K-keyboard condition in subjective responses in comparing the conditions. Introducing the touchscreen as an additional/alternative input device showed to have an effect in interaction times, which suggests that proper design considerations need to be made. While having values shown on the interaction device provides value, a potential issue of visual distraction exists when having an additional visual display. The allocation of visual attention between primary displays and the touchscreen should be further investigated. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Interaction method; Process control display; Touch input; Touchscreen","Behavioral research; Display devices; Students; Surveys; Tanks (containers); Touch screens; Typewriter keyboards; Interaction devices; Interaction methods; Situation awareness; Subject experiment; Subjective workload; System interactions; Touch inputs; Visual distractions; Process control; adult; Article; awareness; college student; computer; computer input device; computer mouse; data analysis; female; human; human computer interaction; keyboard; male; process control display; task performance; touchscreen; workload",2-s2.0-85018397710

In order to evaluate the usability of inter-device interaction, this paper compared two fundamental inter-device interaction styles, i.e., one-handed and two-handed interaction. The one-handed interaction style only uses one hand to select an object from a large display device while the two-handed interaction style needs the cooperation of two hands to realize a selection. A framework was developed to implement these two interaction styles. Based on the framework, a pretest-posttest, repeated-measures study was conducted to compare their differences. All participants went through eight tasks, which were differentiated by both the selection order (sequential or random order) and the density level (sparse or dense layout), using both interaction styles. During the study, both the completion time and the error rate in each task with each interaction style were recorded. In addition, the IBM Post-Study Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) was used to evaluate the subjective satisfaction on each interaction style. The overall PSSUQ score indicates that both interaction styles receive positive feedback with high user satisfaction. The study also revealed that the one-handed interaction took less time to complete tasks (i.e., more efficient) than the two-handed interaction, while the two-handed interaction style had a lower error rate than the one-handed interaction, and especially so in a dense layout. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,2-s2.0-85026268457

However, Garbage Collection (GC) is an important performance concern for flash-based SSDs, because it tends to disrupt the normal operations of an SSD. This problem continues to plague flash-based storage systems, particularly in the high performance computing and enterprise environment. An important root cause for this problem, as revealed by previous studies, is the serious contention for the flash resources and the severe mutually adversary interference between the user I/O requests and GC-induced I/O requests. The on-board buffer cache within SSDs serves to play an essential role in smoothing the gap between the upper-level applications and the lower-level flash chips and alleviating this problem to some extend. Nevertheless, the existing cache replacement algorithms are well optimized to reduce the miss rate of the buffer cache by reducing the I/O traffic to the flash chips as much as possible, but without considering the GC operations within the flash chips. Consequently, they fail to address the root cause of the problem and thus are far from being sufficient and effective in reducing the expensive I/O traffic to the flash chips that are in the GC state. To address this important performance issue in flash-based storage systems, particularly in the HPC and enterprise environment, we propose a Garbage Collection aware Replacement policy, called GCaR, to improve the performance of flash-based SSDs. The basic idea is to give higher priority to caching the data blocks belonging to the flash chips that are in the GC state. This substantially lessens the contentions between the user I/O operations and the GC-induced I/O operations. To verify the effectiveness of GCaR, we have integrated it into the SSD extended Disksim simulator. The simulation results show that GCaR can significantly improve the storage performance by up to 40.7 percent in terms of the average response times. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Cache management; Flash storage; Garbage collection; Performance evaluation; Solid state drive","Cache memory; Data storage equipment; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Refuse collection; Storage management; Cache management; Flash storage; Garbage collection; Performance evaluation; Solid state drives; Flash-based SSDs",2-s2.0-85029929182

They constitute 20% to 30% of the known bacterial, archaean and eukaryotic organisms' genomes. In humans, their importance is emphasized as they represent 50% of all known drug targets. Nevertheless, experimental determination of their three-dimensional (3D) structure has proven to be both time consuming and rather expensive, which has led to the development of computational algorithms to complement the available experimental methods and provide valuable insights. Scope of review This review highlights the importance of membrane proteins and how computational methods are capable of overcoming challenges associated with their experimental characterization. It covers various MP structural aspects, such as lipid interactions, allostery, and structure prediction, based on methods such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Machine-Learning (ML). Major conclusions Recent developments in algorithms, tools and hybrid approaches, together with the increase in both computational resources and the amount of available data have resulted in increasingly powerful and trustworthy approaches to model MPs. General significance Even though MPs are elementary and important in nature, the determination of their 3D structure has proven to be a challenging endeavor. Computational methods provide a reliable alternative to experimental methods. In this review, we focus on computational techniques to determine the 3D structure of MP and characterize their binding interfaces.

A better understanding of pullout of soil nail thus becomes important to assess the stability of a soil-nailed system. In the present study, an investigation into the pullout behaviour of soil nail with circular discs along the shaft has been carried out by a three-dimensional finite element analysis using Abaqus/Explicit routine. A total of 67 simulations have been performed to accurately predict the pullout behaviour of soil nail. The soil nail under study has circular discs along its shaft varying in numbers from 1 to 4. The pullout of this soil nail in a pullout test box has been simulated with a constant overburden pressure of 20 kPa acting on the nail. The pullout load–displacement characteristics, stresses around soil nail and failure mechanism during pullout are studied. Variations of dimensionless factors such as normalised pullout load factor and bearing capacity factor have been obtained with different combinations of parameters in terms of relative disc spacing ratio, anchorage length ratio, embedment ratio, diameter ratio and displacement ratio. From the results of analyses, it is found that nail with more circular discs requires higher pullout load.

We formulate the centralized scheduling and resource allocation problem as equivalent to a multi-dimensional stable roommate matching problem, in which the users and time/frequency resources are considered as disjoint sets of objects to be matched with each other.

To remedy the defects of recognizer based on electromyogram (EMG), we develop a pure mechanical sensor architecture for intent pattern recognition of lower-limb motion. The sensor system is composed of an accelerometer, a gyroscope mounted on the prosthetic socket, and two pressure sensors mounted under the sole. To compensate the delay in the control of prosthesis, the signals in the stance phase are used to predict the terrain and speed in the swing phase. Specifically, the intent pattern recognizer utilizes intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) according to the Cartesian product of walking speed and terrain. Moreover, the sensor data are fused via Dempster-Shafer's theory. And hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to recognize the realtime motion state with the reference of the prior step. The proposed method can infer the prosthesis user's intent of walking on different terrain, which includes level ground, stair ascent, stair descent, up and down ramp. The experiments demonstrate that the intent pattern recognizer is capable of identifying five typical terrain-modes with the rate of 95.8%.

Currently lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton robots used in the hospitals need more power to correct abnormal motor patterns of stroke patients' legs. These gait rehabilitation robots are powered by cumbersome and bulky electric motors, which provides a poor user experience. A newly developed gait rehabilitation exoskeleton robot actuated by low-cost and lightweight pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) is presented in this research. A model-free proxy-based sliding mode control (PSMC) strategy and a model-based chattering mitigation robust variable control (CRVC) strategy were developed and first applied in rehabilitation trainings, respectively. As the dynamic response of PAM due to the compressed air is low, an innovative intention identification control strategy was taken in active trainings by the use of the subject's intention indirectly through the estimation of the interaction force between the subject's leg and the exoskeleton. The proposed intention identification strategy was verified by treadmill-based gait training experiments. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","CRVC; exoskeleton; gait; intention identification; lower limb; pneumatic artificial muscle; PSMC; Rehabilitation robot; sliding mode control","Compressed air; Electronic medical equipment; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Muscle; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Pneumatic drives; Pneumatics; Robots; Sliding mode control; CRVC; gait; Lower limb; Pneumatic artificial muscle; PSMC; Rehabilitation robot; Patient rehabilitation",2-s2.0-85020209448

In split-depth images (also often called split-depth GIFs due to the commonly used file format), static virtual occluders inform of vertical or horizontal bars are added to a video clip, which leads to occlusions that are interpreted by the observer as a depth cue. In this paper, we study different factors that contribute to the illusion and propose a solution to generate split-depth images for a given RGB + depth image sequence. The presented solution builds upon a motion summarization of the object of interest (OOI) through space and time. It allows us to formulate the bar positioning as an energy-minimization problem, which we solve efficiently. We take a variety of important features into account, such as the changes of the 3D effect due to changes in the motion topology, occlusion, the proximity of bars or the OOI, and scene saliency. We conducted a number of psycho-visual experiments to derive an appropriate energy formulation. Our method helps in finding optimal positions for the bars and, thus, improves the 3D perception of the original animation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of examples.

Ten healthy young adults participated in this study. They stood on a support surface, which suddenly moved in one of four horizontal directions (forward, backward, left and right), with the biofeedback system turned on or off. The testing sequence of the four perturbation directions and the two system conditions (turned on or off) was randomized. The resulting reaction time and CoM displacement were analysed. Results showed that the vibrotactile feedback system significantly improved balance control during translational perturbations. The positive results of this preliminary study highlight the potential of a plantar force measurement based biofeedback system in improving balance under perturbations of the support surface.

The experiment compared direct user interactions during pointing at a target, which was continuously visible or presented briefly and disappeared, in both stereoscopic and real environments, at three parallax/depth levels. The position data, collected by a motion system, were used to compute accuracy, signed error, movement time, and throughput. The results showed inaccurate egocentric distance judgment in stereoscopic displays and accurate perceptions in the real world. The overall inaccuracy, which was overestimation of about 10 cm, was relatively better than that achieved in previous studies. The overestimation decreased as the egocentric distance increased. However, providing visual objects did not improve the accuracy. The study concluded that direct pointing could minimize the underestimation problems commonly reported in stereoscopic viewing studies and showed practical significance for developers to focus on incorporating more direct and natural human-virtual reality interactions for improved performance.

However, the lack of tools to visualize information from interactive data, including messages left to the videos at particular timestamps as well as the temporal variations of learners' online participation and perceived experience, has prevented people from gaining more insights from video-watching logs. In this paper, we focus on extracting and visualizing useful information from time-anchored comments that learners left to specific time points of the videos when watching them. Timestamps as a kind of metadata of messages can be useful to recover the interactive dynamics of learners occurring around the videos. Therefore, we present a visualization system to analyze and categorize time-anchored comments based on topics and content types.

Only one or two interactive features, not three, led to a significant increase in the change score compared with the control condition, by increasing vividness of the stimulus website and decreasing defensive responses.

This war clearly signifies many ‘battlefronts’ representing the interface of the mucosal-surface cells with the dynamic biofilms composed of commensal and potential pathogenic species, as well as more recent knowledge demonstrating active invasion of cells and tissues of the periodontium leading to skirmishes in connective tissue, the locality of bone and even in the local vasculature. Research in the discipline has uncovered a concerted effort of the microbiome, using an array of survival strategies, to interact with other bacteria and host cells. These strategies aid in colonization by ‘ambushing, infiltrating and outflanking’ host cells and molecules, responding to local environmental changes (including booby traps for host biomolecules), communicating within and between genera and species that provide MASINT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence) to enhance sustained survival, sabotage the host inflammatory and immune responses and by potentially adopting a ‘Fabian strategy’ with a war of attrition and resulting disease manifestations. Additionally, much has been learned regarding the ever-increasing complexity of the host-response armamentarium at both cellular and molecular levels that is addressed in this review. Knowledge regarding how these systems fully interact requires both new laboratory and clinical tools, as well as sophisticated modeling of the networks that help maintain homeostasis and are dysregulated in disease. Finally, the triggers resulting in a ‘coup de main’ by the microbiome (exacerbation of disease) and the characteristics of susceptible hosts that can result in ‘pyrrhic victories’ with collateral damage to host tissues, the hallmark of periodontitis, remains unclear. While much has been learned, substantial gaps in our understanding of the ‘parameters of this war’ remain elusive toward fulfilling the Sun Tzu adage: ‘If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.’. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) may benefit care home residents and improve efficiency of care delivery. This is an approach to care in which there is a thorough multidisciplinary assessment (physical and mental health, functioning and physical and social environments) and a care plan based on this assessment, usually delivered by a multidisciplinary team. The CGA process is known to improve outcomes for community-dwelling older people and those in receipt of hospital care, but less is known about its efficacy in care home residents. Methods and analysis Realist review was selected as the most appropriate method to explore the complex nature of the care home setting and multidisciplinary delivery of care. The aim of the realist review is to identify and characterise a programme theory that underpins the CGA intervention. The realist review will extract data from research articles which describe the causal mechanisms through which the practice of CGA generates outcomes. The focus of the intervention is care homes, and the outcomes of interest are health-related quality of life and satisfaction with services; for both residents and staff. Further outcomes may include appropriate use of National Health Service services and resources of older care home residents. The review will proceed through three stages: (1) identifying the candidate programme theories that underpin CGA through interviews with key stakeholders, systematic search of the peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed evidence, (2) identifying the evidence relevant to CGA in UK care homes and refining the programme theories through refining and iterating the systematic search, lateral searches and seeking further information from study authors and (3) analysis and synthesis of evidence, involving the testing of the programme theories. Ethics and dissemination The PEACH project was identified as service development following submission to the UK Health Research Authority and subsequent review by the University of Nottingham Research Ethics Committee. The study protocols have been reviewed as part of good governance by the Nottinghamshire Healthcare Foundation Trust. We aim to publish this realist review in a peer-reviewed journal with international readership. We will disseminate findings to public and stakeholders using knowledge mobilisation techniques. Stakeholders will include the Quality Improvement Collaboratives within PEACH study. National networks, such as British Society of Gerontology and National Care Association will be approached for wider dissemination. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Because crowdsourcing's success depends on a mass of motivated crowdsourcees, crowdsourcing platforms have increasingly been imbued with motivational design features borrowed from games; a practice often called gamification. While the body of literature and knowledge of the phenomenon have begun to accumulate, we still lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding of conceptual foundations, knowledge of how gamification is used in crowdsourcing, and whether it is effective. We first provide a conceptual framework for gamified crowdsourcing systems in order to understand and conceptualize the key aspects of the phenomenon. The paper's main contributions are derived through a systematic literature review that investigates how gamification has been examined in different types of crowdsourcing in a variety of domains. This meticulous mapping, which focuses on all aspects in our framework, enables us to infer what kinds of gamification efforts are effective in different crowdsourcing approaches as well as to point to a number of research gaps and lay out future research directions for gamified crowdsourcing systems. Overall, the results indicate that gamification has been an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation and the quality of the crowdsourced work; however, differences exist between different types of crowdsourcing: the research conducted in the context of crowdsourcing of homogenous tasks has most commonly used simple gamification implementations, such as points and leaderboards, whereas crowdsourcing implementations that seek diverse and creative contributions employ gamification with a richer set of mechanics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crowdsourcing; Gamification; Human computation; Literature review; Persuasive technology; Research agenda","Human computer interaction; Gamification; Human computation; Literature reviews; Persuasive technology; Research agenda; Crowdsourcing",2-s2.0-85019568466

Among them, 3D trees are an important class, consisting of unique structures, characteristics and botanical features. Nevertheless, trees are an especially challenging case for 3D manufacturing. They typically consist of non-volumetric patch leaves, an extreme amount of small detail often below printable resolution and are often physically weak to be self-sustainable. We introduce a novel 3D tree printability method which optimizes trees through a set of geometry modifications for manufacturing purposes. Our key idea is to formulate tree modifications as a minimal constrained set which accounts for the visual appearance of the model and its structural soundness. To handle non-printable fine details, our method modifies the tree shape by gradually abstracting details of visible parts while reducing details of non-visible parts. To guarantee structural soundness and to increase strength and stability, our algorithm incorporates a physical analysis and adjusts the tree topology and geometry accordingly while adhering to allometric rules. Our results show a variety of tree species with different complexity that are physically sound and correctly printed within reasonable time. The printed trees are correct in terms of their allometry and of high visual quality, which makes them suitable for various applications in the realm of outdoor design, modeling and manufacturing. © 2017 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2017 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We conducted this study to determine how often geriatric patients were discharged on a newly started antipsychotic during admission with a plan for discontinuation of the antipsychotic documented in the discharge summary. Design: We conducted retrospective chart review identifying geriatric inpatients in our health system started on a new antipsychotic during admission. In patients discharged from the hospital on a new antipsychotic, we examined the discharge summary for a discontinuation treatment plan. Results: Of 487 patients started on a new antipsychotic, 147 (30.2%) were discharged on the antipsychotic. Of those, 121 (82.3%) had a diagnosis of delirium. Discharge summaries of 15 (12.4%) patients discharged on an antipsychotic with a diagnosis of delirium included instructions for discontinuation of the antipsychotic. Of those patients discharged with instructions for discontinuation, 12 (80%) received a psychiatric or geriatric medicine consult. Conclusion: In our health system, the majority of geriatric patients with delirium, discharged on a new antipsychotic had no instructions outlined to outpatient providers for discontinuation management.

The proposed model first uses various recommendation algorithms to get a list of original recommendation results. Combined with the customer's feedback in an interactive manner, it then establishes the weights of corresponding recommendation algorithms. Finally, the synthetic formula of evidence theory is used to fuse the original results to obtain the final recommendation products. The recommendation performance of the proposed method is compared with that of traditional methods. The results of the experimental study through a Taobao online dress shop clearly show that the proposed method increases the efficiency of data mining in the consumer coverage, the consumer discovery accuracy and the recommendation recall. The hybrid recommendation algorithm complements the advantages of the existing recommendation algorithms in data mining.

We investigate the effects of aggregate travel stress, which we define as the accumulated strain experienced by a team when traveling, on key components of team functioning and performance including team task performance, team concentration level, and counterproductive work behaviors (CWB). Design/Methodology/Approach: We analyze 3054 games played in the National Football League across six seasons using multilevel structural equation modeling. Replicating our findings, we also analyzed an additional 11,802 games played in the National Basketball Association across five seasons. Findings: Aggregate travel stress, as a latent construct, negatively impacts team task performance and team concentration level. Team concentration partially mediates the relationship between aggregate travel stress and CWB. Implications: Findings suggest that travel has a deleterious effect on various forms of team functioning and performance. As a result, organizations and leaders need to be aware of the potential side effects of travel, and researchers need to further incorporate travel into models and examinations of workplace stress. Originality/Value: This is the first study to provide a theoretically driven investigation of the effects of business travel on team outcomes and to apply COR theory to team-level phenomena.

Subsequently, a conformational ensemble of the Drosophila melanogaster octopamine receptor in mushroom bodies (OAMB) was created from a molecular dynamics simulation to resemble a flexible receptor for docking studies. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of several metabolites, i.e. mostly aromatic esters. Interestingly, these aromatic esters were found to exhibit relatively higher binding affinities to OAMB than the receptor's natural agonist, octopamine. The molecular origin of this observed enhanced affinity is the p-stacking interaction between the aromatic moieties of the residues and ligands.

In addition, research suggests that the activation of stereotypes also depends on the context of accompanying verbal information. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to one cell of a 2 (stereotype of the agent: young vs. old) × 2 (stereotypical priming within the text: young vs. old) between-subjects factorial design in order to examine if stereotypes impact learning processes.

Results revealed that transfer performance is only enhanced when agents and texts activate together either old or young stereotypes, whereas retention performance was not affected by the manipulation.

Methods fMRI data were acquired from healthy controls and patients with MS, with the subjects peforming self paced bilateral finger tapping in block design. GABA spectroscopy was performed with voxel placed on the area of maximum activation during fMRI. Activation volume and BOLD signal changes at primary motor cortex (M1), as well as GABA concentration were calculated for each patient. Results Activation volume correlated with BOLD signal change in healthy controls, but no such correlation was observed in patients with MS. This difference was likely the result of higher intersubject noise variance in the patient population. GABA concentration correlated with M1 activation volume in patients but not in controls, and did not correlate with any fMRI metric in patients or controls. Conclusion Our data suggest that activation volume is a more robust measure than BOLD signal change in a group with high intersubject noise variance as in patients with MS. Additionally, this study demonstrated difference in correlation behavior between GABA concentration and the 2 fMRI metrics in patients with MS, suggesting that GABA - activation volume correlation is more appropriate measure in the patient group. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Activation volume; BOLD signal; fMRI; GABA","4 aminobutyric acid; 4 aminobutyric acid brain level; activation volume; adult; Article; BOLD signal; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; multiple sclerosis; nervous system parameters; primary motor cortex; priority journal; right hemisphere; sensorimotor cortex; spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85021084821

In the present study, the existence of Hu-MIF-1 from parasites have been explored by mining WormBase. A total of 35 helminths were found to have Hu-MIF-1 homologs, including some parasites of importance for public health. Physicochemical, structural, and biological properties of Hu-MIF-1 were compared with its orthologs in parasites showing that most of these are secretory proteins, with positive net charge and presence of the Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys motif that is critical for its oxidoreductase activity. The inhibitor-binding site present in Hu-MIF-1 is well conserved among parasite MIFs suggesting that Hu-MIF inhibitors may target orthologs in pathogens. The binding of Hu-MIF-1 to its cognate receptor CD74 was predicted by computer-assisted docking, and it resulted to be very similar to the predicted complexes formed by parasite MIFs and human CD74. More than 1 plausible conformation of MIFs in the extracellular loops of CD74 may be possible as demonstrated by the different predicted conformations of MIF orthologs in complex with CD74. Parasite MIFs in complex with CD74 resulted with some charged residues oriented to CD74, which was not observed in the Hu-MIF-1/CD74 complex. Our findings predict the binding mode of Hu-MIF-1 and orthologs with CD74, which can assist in the design of novel MIF inhibitors. Whether the parasite MIFs function specifically subvert host immune responses to suit the parasite is an open question that needs to be further investigated. Future research should lead to a better understanding of parasite MIF action in the parasite biology.

Objective: To examine the literature for accommodation time given during biomechanical investigations to determine whether consensus exists. Study design: Systematic review. Methods: A systematic search was completed on 7 January 2016 using PubMed and Scopus. Results: The search resulted in 156 investigations. Twenty-eight studies did not provide an accommodation or were unclear (e.g. provided a “break in period”), 5 studies tested their participants more than once, 25 tested only once and on the same day participants received a new prosthesis (median (range): above-knee: 60 (10–300) min; below-knee: 18 (5–300) min), and 98 tested once and gave a minimum of 1 day for accommodation (hip: 77 (60–180) days; above-knee: 42 (1–540) days; below-knee: 21 (1–475) days). Conclusion: The lack of research specifically examining accommodation and the high variability in this review’s results indicates that it remains undecided how much accommodation is necessary. There is a need for longitudinal biomechanical investigations to determine how outcomes change as amputees accommodate to a new prosthesis. Clinical relevance: The results of this review indicate that little research has been done regarding lower-limb amputees accommodating to a new prosthesis. Improper accommodation could lead to increased variability in results, results that are not reflective of long-term use, and could cause clinicians to make inappropriate decisions regarding a prosthesis. © 2016, © The International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics 2016.","accommodation; biomechanics; Biomechanics of prosthetic/orthotic devices; prosthetics; systematic review",,2-s2.0-85030114623

Findings from previous studies have found that a number of intended benefits of the technology have not yet been realised to date, partially due to poor system adoption among health professionals such as nurses. Previous studies have suggested that nurse managers can support the effective adoption and use of the technology by nurses. However, no known studies have identified what role nurse managers have in supporting technology adoption, nor the specific strategies that managers can employ to support their staff. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to better understand the role of the nurse manager in point-of-care nurses' use of EHRs, and to identify strategies that may be effective in supporting clinical adoption. Methods and analysis This study will use a qualitative descriptive design. Interviews with both nurse managers and point-of-care nursing staff will be conducted in a Canadian mental health and addiction healthcare organisation where an EHR has been implemented. A semistructured interview guide will be used, and interviews will be audio recorded. Transcripts will be analysed using a directed content analysis technique. Strategies to ensure the trustworthiness of the data analysis procedure and findings will be employed. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for this study has been obtained. Dissemination strategies may include a paper submission to a peer-reviewed journal, a conference submission and meetings to share findings with the study site leadership team. Findings from this research will be used to inform a future study which aims to assess levels of competencies and perform a psychometric analysis of the Nursing Informatics Competency Assessment for the Nurse Leader instrument in a Canadian context. © 2017 Article author(s).","health informatics; mental health; qualitative research",,2-s2.0-85031326145

Our present study thus focused on the specificity of NF on three levels: band specificity, cognitive specificity, and baseline specificity. Ten healthy middle-aged individuals performed ten sessions of SMR (sensorimotor rhythm, 12–15 Hz) NF training. A second group (N = 10) received feedback of a narrow gamma band (40–43 Hz). Effects of NF on EEG resting measurements (tonic EEG) and cognitive functions (memory, intelligence) were evaluated using a pre-post design. Both training groups were able to linearly increase the target training frequencies (either SMR or gamma), indicating the trainability of these EEG frequencies. Both NF training protocols led to nonspecific changes in other frequency bands during NF training. While SMR NF only led to concomitant changes in slower frequencies, gamma training affected nearly the whole power spectrum. SMR NF specifically improved memory functions. Gamma training showed only marginal effects on cognitive functions. SMR power assessed during resting measurements significantly increased after SMR NF training compared to a pre-assessment, indicating specific effects of SMR NF on baseline/tonic EEG. The gamma group did not show any pre-post changes in their EEG resting activity. In conclusion, SMR NF specifically affects cognitive functions (cognitive specificity) and tonic EEG (baseline specificity), while increasing SMR during NF training nonspecifically affects slower EEG frequencies as well (band non-specificity). Gamma NF was associated with nonspecific effects on the EEG power spectrum during training, which did not lead to considerable changes in cognitive functions or baseline EEG activity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cognitive training; EEG; Neurofeedback; Resting state; Specificity; Tonic EEG","clinical article; female; human; intelligence; male; memory; middle aged; neurofeedback; power spectrum; rest; rhythm",2-s2.0-85021453413

Design A population-based, retrospective cohort study Setting The province of Ontario, Canada Participants 6 639 089 Ontarians who were diagnosed with at least one of 16 selected medical conditions on 1 April 2009. Main outcome measures From the perspective of the publicly funded healthcare system, total annual healthcare costs were derived from linked provincial health administrative databases using a person-level costing method. We used generalised linear models to examine the association between the level of multimorbidity and healthcare costs and the extent to which socio-demographic variables modified this association. Results Attributable total costs of multimorbidity ranged from C377 to C2073 for young individuals and C1026 to C3831 for older adults. The association between the degree of multimorbidity and healthcare costs was significantly modified by age (p<0.001), sex (p<0.001) and neighbourhood income (p<0.001) in both age groups, and the positive association between healthcare costs and levels of multimorbidity was statistically stronger for older than younger adults. For individuals aged 65 years or younger, the increase in healthcare costs was more gradual in women than in their male counterparts, however, for those aged 65 years or older, the increase in healthcare costs was significantly greater among women than men. Lastly, we also observed that the positive association between the level of multimorbidity and healthcare costs was significantly greater at higher levels of marginalisation. Conclusion Socio-demographic factors are important effect modifiers of the relationship between multimorbidity and healthcare costs and should therefore be considered in any discussion of the implementation of healthcare policies and the organisation of healthcare services aimed at controlling healthcare costs associated with multimorbidity. © Article author(s) 2017.","health system costs; multimorbidity; population-based study; publicly funded healthcare system; socio-demographic factors","prescription drug; adult; aged; Article; association; cohort analysis; demography; female; groups by age; health care cost; health care system; human; income; major clinical study; male; multiple chronic conditions; neighborhood; retrospective study",2-s2.0-85031099938

A multiplex, single tube PCR test was designed for amplification of approximately 400 bp region of the Babesia 18S rRNA gene. Universal primers were designed to match DNA of multiple Babesia spp. and to have low levels of similarity to DNA sequences of other intracellular protozoa and Babesia hosts. The PCR products amplified from Babesia DNA isolated from human, dog, rodent, deer, and tick samples were subjected to high-resolution melting analysis for Babesia species identification. The designed test allowed detection and differentiation of four Babesia species, three zoonotic (B. microti, B. divergens, B. venatorum) and one that is generally not considered zoonotic—Babesia canis. Both detection and identification of all four species were possible based on the HRM curves of the PCR products in samples obtained from the following: humans, dogs, rodents, and ticks. No cross-reactivity with DNA of Babesia hosts or Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii was observed. The lack of cross-reactivity with P. falciparum DNA might allow using the assay in endemic malaria areas. The designed assay is the first PCR-based test for detection and differentiation of several Babesia spp. of medical and veterinary importance, in a single tube reaction. The results of the study show that the designed assay for Babesia detection and identification could be a practical and inexpensive tool for diagnostics and screening studies of diverse biological materials. © 2017, The Author(s).","18S rRNA; Babesia; Babesia canis; Babesia divergens; Babesia microti; Babesia venatorum; DNA detection; High-resolution melting; HRM; Melting curve; Multiplex-PCR; Real-time PCR; Single-tube PCR; Species identification; Universal primers","DNA; RNA 18S; adult; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; Babesia; Babesia canis; Babesia divergens; Babesia microti; Babesia venatorum; dog; human; human cell; human tissue; Ixodes ricinus; male; Microtus oeconomus; mouse; nonhuman; nucleic acid amplification; piroplasmosis; Plasmodium falciparum; polymerase chain reaction; polymerase chain reaction system; priority journal; roe deer; screening; Toxoplasma gondii",2-s2.0-85027182267

The results show that Ni atoms in Kovar alloy diffused towards the Ti-Cu metallizaton layer and remained as (Ni, Cu) solution during the solidification process. The metallization layer became thicker and evolved into a reaction layer which consisted of (Ni, Cu) solution, Cu-Ti-O and TiO. This reaction layer in the joint played an important role in relieving residual stress. Thus the maximal tensile strength of 72.6 ± 4.4 MPa was achieved.

A heuristic method is applied to examine dimensions of customer perception of seller ethics. The research community is selected out of a large group of sale experts and directly through electronic survey platform in electronic markets. According to the article findings, electronic customers are of high tendency to better understand the electronic seller's ethics, and the customer's higher perception of electronic sellers increases the shopping. On-time and correct electronic seller's responses affect positively on the customers' loyalty. The consumer loyalty regarding the ethics of electronic retailer's scale is greater completeness to evaluate consumer perceptions of e-retailers' ethics than scales using a one-dimensional approach. This study further examines both individualism and collectivism at the individual level, which is rare in the existing literature.

The secondary side of the transformer is connected in a zig-zag configuration and is fed to two six-pulse diode rectifiers, achieving 12-pulse rectifier operation. The primary advantage of the proposed system is reduction in size/weight/volume compared to the conventional 60 Hz magnetic transformer isolation rectifier system. Operating the transformer at 600 Hz is shown to result in three times reduction in size. Furthermore, the proposed system employs only two active semiconductor switching devices operating under a simple pulse width modulation scheme.

However, the process has been challenging to construction project management often resulting in failed projects. This necessitates an overwhelming need for a better approach. This paper presents a novel enterprise architecture framework for managing information about client requirements across all phases of a construction project and through-life of a built facility. The Integrated electronic Requirements Information Management Framework (eRIM) defines an information-centric, and process and service-oriented enterprise architecture approach to requirements management. It also describes how Information and Communication Technology (ICT)/Information Systems (IS) can support this information management. In developing the framework, findings from three case study projects were collated through observations, a questionnaire and interviews of construction practitioners. It is concluded that when implemented and incorporated in the management of construction projects, the eRIM architecture framework can potentially contribute towards improved and more efficient and effective management of client requirements across all stages of a project.

However, support emerging from the family front has often been neglected in previous studies. The purpose of our research is to empirically estimate the role of both work support (WS) and family support (FS) as predictors of work-to-family enrichment (WFE) and family-to-work enrichment (FWE) among sales employees in Indian organizations. Data were collected through structured questionnaires from 330 employees belonging to firms from some of the major sectors of Indian industry, namely manufacturing, IT, FMCG, pharmaceuticals and financial services. The study first validated the support scale in the Indian context using exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Further, structural equation modelling (SEM) using AMOS (version 20) was used to test the model. Results supported the 20-item work support and family support scale measuring work and family support in the Indian set-up. Further, results of SEM suggested that work as well as family support significantly predicts work-to-family enrichment as well as family-to-work enrichment. The study signals the importance of ensuring a supportive organizational environment for an effective workforce. This not only can help in enriching one’s work life, but also can impact one’s family life as well. The same phenomenon also applies to family front; a supportive family results in an improved enrichment in work domain. This study contributes to work–family literature by addressing role of support—both work and family—as predictors of WFE and FEW, which has rarely been studied in the Indian context. © 2017, © 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.","AMOS; CFA; EFA; family support; family-to-work enrichment; sales employees; SEM; Work support; work-to-family enrichment",,2-s2.0-85029092162

Conventional methods such as fatigue tests on core specimens in the laboratory or stationary deflection measurements in-situ exhibit their own disadvantages. This study proposes an innovative system to measure and evaluate the deterioration of asphalt pavements under moving loads by means of geophones, a mobile load simulator (MLS) and a back-calculation tool. A test track was evaluated with this method at three different service states. For each state, the vibrations of the test track induced by a passing truck were measured by an array of geophones. The vibrations were transferred to a surface deflection in the analysis and then used to compute the material parameters of the test track with the back-calculation tool. The results show that the deflections derived from an individual geophone are in high agreement with each other and thus the repeatability indicates the measurement is mechanically robust. The computational variation of material parameters and the corresponding mechanical responses are consistent with the increase of loading cycles applied by the MLS. It indicates that the proposed system is able to provide a tool for an accurate and efficient measurement of the surface deflection and evaluation of the deterioration of asphalt pavements under moving loads. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Asphalt pavement; Back-calculation; Geophones; Mobile load simulator; Moving loads","Asphalt; Automobile testing; Deflection (structures); Deterioration; Fatigue testing; Vibration analysis; Back calculation; Conventional methods; Deflection measurement; Geophones; Maintenance and rehabilitations; Mobile loads; Moving load; Pavement deterioration; Asphalt pavements",2-s2.0-85019983783

Methods 72 patients, who needed the covering of at least a molar and/or premolar, were included in the study. All teeth were endodontically treated, with absence of periapical lesion or active periodontitis. Ninety single crowns were made with zirconia or metal framework and covered with pressable veneering ceramics. Two independent examiners assessed the survival of restorations at 6 months, 1–4 and 5 years after restoration placement including periapical radiographs, intraoral photographs, and USPHS modified criteria. The statistical analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Results One core fracture occurred in Zircad/Zirpress crowns and one metal ceramic crown was lost for root fracture. Chipping fracture of the veneering ceramic was detected in 2 metal-ceramic crowns and in 3 zirconia-based crowns. The Estimate Cumulative Survival (ECS) and the Estimate Cumulative Success (ECSs) with standard deviation (SE) were respectively 97,73 ± 2,19 and 92,64 ± 4,14 for zirconia-based crowns whereas 97,44 ± 2,39 and 91,11 ± 4,27 for porcelain fused to metal crowns. Conclusions The present randomized controlled trial shows that the survival of zirconia-based and metal-based single crowns is similar over a follow-up period of 5 years. No significant differences in esthetic, functional and biological outcomes were demonstrated between the two groups. The main failure mode was the chipping fracture of the veneering ceramic in both materials. Study number on ClinicalTrial.gov NCT02758457.

Students in the limited navigation profile devoted little time to text access. Students in the primary profile devoted the bulk of access time to a single text. Those in the distributed profile visited the texts they accessed for fairly uniform periods of time. Students in the discriminating profile visited certain texts for substantial periods of time, while accessing other texts to a more limited extent. These four navigation profiles were found to be differentially associated with other metrics of text access (e.g., whether texts were revisited), ratings of text usefulness, and task performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hypertext; Multiple texts; Navigation; Student profiles","Biology; Education; Hypertext systems; Navigation; Students; Evolutionary biology; Hyperlinked texts; Hypertext; Information sources; Multiple source; Multiple texts; Student profiles; Task performance; Air navigation; case report; human; hypermedia; student; task performance",2-s2.0-85019877417

The time delay is one of the main challenges that influence the stability of the teleoperation systems, which leads to the discontinuous operation. Thus building a local virtual model in the master side is an effective way to solve this problem. In this paper, a new method is presented to reconstruct the virtual model of the remote object. The virtual model can estimate the real-time force feedback to the operator and eliminate the effects of the time delay. Then the tele-robotic system based on augmented reality technology is set up in our laboratory. In the tele-robotic system, the dynamic parameters including damping and stiffness of the virtual model are constantly updated by utilizing the positions and forces information from sensors of the remote robot site. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method and the correctness of the visual model parameters are verified by two experiments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Augmented reality; Force feedback; Haptic; Robot; Teleoperation","Augmented reality; Remote control; Robotics; Robots; Time delay; Augmented reality technology; Discontinuous operation; Dynamic parameters; Force feedback; Haptic; Real time force feedback; Sense of presences; Teleoperation systems; Feedback",2-s2.0-85032860689

This impacts cognitive performance by acting as a stressor, potentially interfering with the analysts' decision-making process. We investigated the effects of different noise stimuli on analysts' performance and workload in anomaly detection by simulating a noisy work environment. We utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to quantify oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as behavioral measures, which include eye tracking, reaction time, and accuracy rate. We hypothesized that noisy environments would have a negative effect on the participant in terms of anomaly detection performance due to the increase in workload, which would be reflected by an increase in PFC activity. We found that HbO for some of the channels analyzed were significantly different across noise types (p<0.05). Our results also indicated that HbO activation for short-intermittent noise stimuli was greater in the PFC compared to long-intermittent noises. These approaches using fNIRS in conjunction with an understanding of the impact on human analysts in anomaly detection could potentially lead to better performance by optimizing work environments. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","anomaly detection; eye tracking; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; noise; prefrontal cortex; workload","Chemical detection; Decision making; Employment; Hemoglobin; Human engineering; Near infrared spectroscopy; Anomaly detection; Eye-tracking; Functional near infrared spectroscopy; noise; Prefrontal cortex; workload; Infrared devices; deoxyhemoglobin; oxyhemoglobin; accuracy; adult; Article; brain function; brain level; cognition; cognitive workload; eye tracking; female; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; hemoglobin determination; human; imaging system; male; mental load; noise; prediction; prefrontal cortex; response time; simulation; work environment",2-s2.0-85028549946

This article describes two sets of phenomena. First, far from being taken for granted, open data emerge in administrations through a progressive process that entails uncertain collective inquiries and extraction work. Second, the opening process draws on a series of transformations, as data are modified to satisfy an important criterion of open data policies: the need for both human and technical intelligibility. There are organizational consequences of these two points, which can notably lead to the visibilization or the invisibilization of data labour. Finally, the article invites us to reconsider the apparent contradiction between the process of data release and the existence of raw data.

By approaching a potential supplier with a high knowledge of technology but an insufficient knowledge of the need, a unique dyad is created, characterized by a bilateral knowledge gap that stimulates increased learning and co-creation of a potentially radical innovation.

Little attention has been given to the normal cyclic loading behavior of a joint during wave propagation. This paper introduces a modification to Cundall’s continuously yielding (CY) model. The original normal behavior of the CY model is upgraded by adding the capacity to account for sophisticated characteristics during normal cyclic loading. The proposed modified-CY (M-CY) model is verified through comparison with existing experimental data. The effects of various parameters in this M-CY model are discussed, indicating that the M-CY model is capable of fitting realistic test data. Subsequently, P-wave transmission across a M-CY joint is numerically performed and evaluated. The results show that the M-CY model exhibits more transmission and consequently less reflection than the linear model as the velocity magnitude of an incident impulse approaches its peak value. Furthermore, the compatibility of the joint under an incident P-wave can be revealed by the M-CY model. The seismic stability of the tailrace tunnel of the Baihetan Hydropower Plant, which is controlled by a large fault, is studied as an engineering application of the proposed model. Seismic analysis suggests that the tunnel’s main failure mode under an earthquake would be shear slip at the intersection of the tunnel ceiling and fault. A comparison between the proposed model and original CY model illustrates that the original model would give a failure mode that overestimates the fault opening during the earthquake. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.","Continuously yielding model; Cyclic loading; Nonlinear joint; Seismic analysis; Wave propagation","Cyclic loads; Faulting; Geophysics; Seismic waves; Seismology; Wave propagation; Wave transmission; Engineering applications; Hydropower plants; Nonlinear joints; Normal cyclic loading; Rock engineering; Seismic analysis; Seismic Performance; Seismic stability; Earthquakes; cyclic loading; earthquake engineering; experimental study; joint; nonlinearity; P-wave; performance assessment; seismic anisotropy; wave propagation; wave velocity",2-s2.0-85021066558

Based on the premise that leveraging accessibility concepts to address public involvement challenges could promote their adoption in planning practice, this research investigates mechanisms to promote social learning among participants in public workshops. Potential mechanisms of learning include specific tool-based interactions and how such interactions reinforce structures of learning such as alignment and imagination. This paper details iterative testing of these mechanisms with a tool called CoAXs (short for Collaborative ACCESSibility-based stakeholder engagement system), through focus groups and exploratory workshops. A mixed-methods analysis of the workshops supports the expectation that alignment and imagination correlate positively with social learning, as measured by reported learning and dialog quality. Specific interactions with the accessibility-based features of CoAXs in turn correlate positively with alignment and imagination, at individual and group levels of analysis. These findings, while not robustly generalizable, suggest that effective targeted stakeholder engagement for public transport can be structured around collaborative accessibility mapping.

The higher similarity and conserved motifs for ferritin indicated that it belonged to a new member of ferritin family. The interaction between Ferritin and Fer147 was further confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation. The pET-28a-FER147 prokaryotic expression vector was constructed. The expressed recombinant Fer147 was then isolated, purified, and refolded. When ferritins were treated by different heavy metals, several detection methods, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), circular dichroism (CD), and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were applied to examine the structures and functions of the new protein Fer147, recombinant P. esculenta ferritin (Rferritin), and natural horse-spleen ferritin (Hferritin). SEM revealed that the three ferritin aggregates changed obviously after different heavy metals treatment, meanwhile, a little different in aggregates were detected when the ferritins were trapped by the same heavy metal. Hence, changes in aggregation structure of the three proteins are related to the nature of the different heavy metals and the interaction between the heavy metals and the three ferritins. CD data suggested that the secondary structure of the three ferritins hardly changed after different heavy metals were trapped.

This information is subsequently used in the determination of optimal intervention strategies and intervention programs. The input for these Markov models often consists of the condition states of the elements and how they have changed over time. This input is used to estimate the probabilities of transition of an object from each possible condition state to each other possible condition state in one time period. A complication in using Markov models is that there are situations in which there is an inadequate amount of data to estimate the transition probabilities using traditional methods (e.g., due to the lack of recording past information so that it can be easily retrieved, or because it has been collected in an inconsistent or biased manner). In this paper, a methodology to estimate the transition probabilities is presented that uses proportional data obtained by mechanistic-empirical models of the deterioration process. A restricted least-squares optimization model is used to estimate the transition probabilities. The methodology is demonstrated by using it to estimate the transition probabilities for a reinforced concrete (RC) bridge element exposed to chloride-induced corrosion.

This paper describes the protocol for a study to assess the comparative effectiveness of patient-targeted and provider-targeted interventions for facilitating shared decision-making about contraceptive methods. Methods and analysis We will conduct a 2×2 factorial cluster randomised controlled trial with four arms: (1) video+prompt card, (2) decision AIDS+training, (3) video+prompt card and decision AIDS+training and (4) usual care. The clusters will be clinics in USA that deliver contraceptive care. The participants will be people who have completed a healthcare visit at a participating clinic, were assigned female sex at birth, are aged 15-49 years, are able to read and write English or Spanish and have not previously participated in the study. The primary outcome will be shared decision-making about contraceptive methods. Secondary outcomes will be the occurrence of a conversation about contraception in the healthcare visit, satisfaction with the conversation about contraception, intended contraceptive method(s), intention to use a highly effective method, values concordance of the intended method(s), decision regret, contraceptive method(s) used, use of a highly effective method, use of the intended method(s), adherence, satisfaction with the method(s) used, unintended pregnancy and unwelcome pregnancy. We will collect study data via longitudinal patient surveys administered immediately after the healthcare visit, four weeks later and six months later. Ethics and dissemination We will disseminate results via presentations at scientific and professional conferences, papers published in peer-reviewed, open-access journals and scientific and lay reports. We will also make an anonymised copy of the final participant-level dataset available to others for research purposes.

Previous work has shown that online global recovery can dramatically reduce the overhead of failures when compared to the more traditional approach of terminating the job and restarting it from the last stored checkpoint. If online recovery is performed in a local manner further scalability is enabled, not only due to the intrinsic lower costs of recovering locally, but also due to derived effects when using some application types. In this paper we model one such effect, namely multiple failure masking, that manifests when running Stencil parallel computations on an environment when failures are recovered locally. First, the delay propagation shape of one or multiple failures recovered locally is modeled to enable several analyses of the probability of different levels of failure masking under certain Stencil application behaviors. Our results indicate that failure masking is an extremely desirable effect at scale which manifestation is more evident and beneficial as the machine size or the failure rate increase. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","failure masking; fault tolerance; modeling; Parallel processing; resilience; stencil computation","Failure analysis; Fault tolerance; Models; Application behaviors; Modeling and simulating; On-line recoveries; Parallel Computation; Parallel processing; resilience; Stencil computations; Traditional approaches; Recovery",2-s2.0-85030126962

In this paper, we have studied the influence of the optical absorption in glass samples on APT characterization by introducing different transition metal optical dopants to a model borosilicate nuclear waste glass. A systematic comparison is presented of the glass optical properties and the resulting APT data quality in terms of compositional accuracy and the mass spectra quality for two APT systems: one with a green laser (532 nm, LEAP 3000X HR) and one with a UV laser (355 nm, LEAP 4000X HR). These data were also compared to the study of a more complex borosilicate glass (SON68). The results show that the analysis data quality, particularly the compositional accuracy and sample yield, was clearly linked to optical absorption when using a green laser, while for the UV laser optical doping aided in improving data yield but did not have a significant effect on compositional accuracy. Comparisons of data between the LEAP systems suggest that the smaller laser spot size of the LEAP 4000X HR played a more critical role for optimum performance than the optical dopants themselves. The smaller spot size resulted in more accurate composition measurements due to a reduced background level independent of the material's optical properties. © 2017 The American Ceramic Society","atom probe tomography; borosilicate glass; microscopy; nuclear waste glasses; optical properties; rare earth oxide; transition metal oxide","Atom lasers; Atoms; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Glass transition; Laser pulses; Light absorption; Mass spectrometry; Metals; Microscopic examination; Optical properties; Probes; Radioactive wastes; Transition metal compounds; Transition metals; Ultraviolet lasers; Analytical microscopy; Atom probe tomography; Composition measurements; Nuclear waste glass; Optimum performance; Rare earth oxide; Spatial resolution; Transition-metal oxides; Borosilicate glass",2-s2.0-85020210247

They often consist of one HPC simulation program along with its corresponding data analytics programs. Unfortunately, current computing platform settings do not accommodate this emerging workflow very well, especially write-once-read-many workflows. This is mainly because HPC simulation programs store output data into a dedicated storage cluster equipped with Parallel File System(PFS). To perform analytics on data generated by simulation, data has to be migrated from storage cluster to compute cluster. This data migration could introduce severe delay which is especially true given an ever-increasing data size. To solve the data migration problem in small-medium sized HPC clusters, we propose to construct a sided I/O path, named as SideIO, to explicitly direct analysis data to data-intensive file systems (DIFS in brief) that co-locates computation with data. In contrast, checkpoint data may not be read back later, it is written to the dedicated PFS to maximize I/O throughput. There are three components in SideIO. An I/O splitter separates simulation outputs to different storage systems (PFS or DIFS); an I/O middle-ware component allows original HPC simulation programs to execute direct I/O operations over DIFS without any porting effort and an I/O scheduler dynamically smooths out both disk write and read traffic for both simulation and analysis programs. By experimenting with two real-world scientific workflows over a 46-node SideIO prototype, we found that SideIO is able to achieve comparable read/write I/O performance in small-medium sized HPC clusters equipped with PFS. More importantly, since SideIO completely avoids the most expensive data movement overhead, it achieves up to 3x speedups for hybrid scientific workflow applications compared with current solutions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Data migration; Data-intensive; HDFS; HPC; MPI; Scientific workflow","File organization; Data intensive; Data migration; HDFS; Parallel file system; Scientific applications; Scientific workflows; Simulation and analysis; Write-once-read-many; Digital storage",2-s2.0-84994360868

This paper compares two methods of foam injection, surfactant-alternating-gas (SAG) and coinjection of gas and surfactant solution, in their abilities to improve injection profiles in heterogeneous reservoirs. We examine the effects of these two injection methods on diversion by use of fractional-flow modeling. The foam-model parameters for four sandstone formations ranging in permeability from 6 to 1,900 md presented by Kapetas et al. (2015) are used to represent a hypothetical reservoir containing four noncommunicating layers. Permeability affects both the mobility reduction of wet foam in the low-quality-foam regime and the limiting capillary pressure at which foam collapses. The effectiveness of diversion varies greatly with the injection method. In a SAG process, diversion of the first slug of gas depends on foam behavior at very-high foam quality. Mobility in the foam bank during gas injection depends on the nature of a shock front that bypasses most foam qualities usually studied in the laboratory. The foam with the lowest mobility at fixed foam quality does not necessarily give the lowest mobility in a SAG process. In particular, diversion in SAG depends on how and whether foam collapses at low water saturation; this property varies greatly among the foams reported by Kapetas et al. (2015). Moreover, diversion depends on the size of the surfactant slug received by each layer before gas injection. This favors diversion away from high-permeability layers that receive a large surfactant slug. However, there is an optimum surfactantslug size: Too little surfactant and diversion from high-permeability layers is not effective, whereas with too much, mobility is reduced in low-permeability layers. For a SAG process, injectivity and diversion depend critically on whether foam collapses completely at irreducible water saturation. In addition, we show the diversion expected in a foam-injection process as a function of foam quality. The faster propagation of surfactant and foam in the higher-permeability layers AIDS in diversion, as expected. This depends on foam quality and non-Newtonian foam mobility and varies with injection time. Injectivity is extremely poor with foam injection for these extremely strong foams, but for some SAG foam processes with effective diversion it is better than injectivity in a waterflood.

Our approach facilitates the formation of large open spheres and prevents the production of an undesired insulating sulfur-containing film on the carbon surface. This mechanism leads to ∼100% sulfur utilization, almost no capacity fading, over 99% coulombic efficiency and high energy density (1,835 Wh kg-1 and 2,317 Wh l-1).

This can cause serious problems that may hinder the almost inevitable future evolution, since at best the only documentation about the software is in the form of source code comments. To address this problem, research has been focusing on automatic inference of models by applying machine learning algorithms to execution logs. However, the logs generated by a real software system may be very large and the inference algorithm can exceed the processing capacity of a single computer. This paper proposes a scalable, general approach to the inference of behavior models that can handle large execution logs via parallel and distributed algorithms implemented using the MapReduce programming model and executed on a cluster of interconnected execution nodes. The approach consists of two distributed phases that perform trace slicing and model synthesis. For each phase, a distributed algorithm using MapReduce is developed. With the parallel data processing capacity of MapReduce, the problem of inferring behavior models from large logs can be efficiently solved. The technique is implemented on top of Hadoop.

Prosthetic eye wearers have reduced tear amount, and they often experience dry eye symptoms including dryness, irritation, discomfort, and discharge. Most modern ocular prostheses are made of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), which is highly hydrophobic. Previous research has shown that improving the wettability of contact lens materials decreases its wearers discomfort by increasing lubrication. Therefore, hydrophilic modification of PMMA-based ocular prostheses might also improve patient discomfort by improving lubrication. We modified the surfaces of PMMA-based ocular prostheses using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which is hydrophilic. To do this, we used two strategies. One was a “grafting from” method, whereby PEG was polymerized from the PMMA surface. The other was a “grafting to” method, which involved PEG being covalently bonded to an amine-functionalized PMMA surface. Assessments involving the water contact angle, ellipsometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that PEG was successfully introduced to the PMMA surfaces using both strategies. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images revealed that neither strategy caused clinically significant alterations in the PMMA surface morphology. In vitro bacterial adhesion assessments showed that the hydrophilic modifications effectively reduced bacterial adhesion without inducing cytotoxicity. These results imply that hydrophilic surface modifications of conventional ocular prostheses may decrease patient discomfort and ocular prosthesis-related infections. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial adhesion; Hydrophilic surface modification; Ocular prosthesis; Poly(ethylene glycol) grafting; Poly(methyl methacrylate)-based ocular prosthesis","Adhesion; Atomic force microscopy; Esters; Ethylene glycol; Grafting (chemical); Hydrophilicity; Lubrication; Polyethylene glycols; Polyethylene oxides; Polymers; Polyols; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface treatment; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Bacterial adhesion; Contact lens material; Covalently bonded; Hydrophilic modification; Hydrophilic surfaces; Ocular prosthesis; Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA); Water contact angle; Prosthetics; macrogol; poly(methyl methacrylate); animal cell; Article; atomic force microscopy; bacterial colonization; bacterial strain; cell viability; chemical modification; controlled study; cytotoxicity; ellipsometry; hydrophilic surface modification; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; hydroxylation; morphology; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; salinity; scanning electron microscopy; Staphylococcus epidermidis; surface property; visual prosthesis; wettability; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85023201738

A driving simulator study was conducted to examine the impact of non-driving related tasks on drivers’ ability to take over vehicle control. The task consisted of reading or proofreading a text (low vs. high visual-cognitive task load) on a tablet which was either handheld or mounted in the vehicle (low vs. high manual task load). Data from 95 participants (mean age 38 years, 47 females) were used to examine reaction times and take-over quality in time-critical steering and braking maneuvers. Manual task load was found to prolong reaction times and to deteriorate take-over quality. Surprisingly, drivers needed even longer for the first gaze at the roadway when holding the tablet in their hands. As expected, these effects were stronger in the steering compared to the braking maneuver. Effects of cognitive task load were found to be dependent on the type of driver intervention. While reaction times and take-over quality deteriorated with increasing cognitive load in the steering maneuver, hardly any effects were found in the braking maneuver. A possible explanation for this surprising finding could be that especially drivers who are intensively engaging in non-driving related tasks spontaneously react with braking to defuse the situation and gain more time. It is thus argued that cognitively demanding non-driving related tasks during automated driving do not necessarily lead to deteriorated take-over performance. Depending on situational characteristics like the required reaction or the perceptual complexity of the situation, these might have different effects on the drivers’ ability to take over. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Automated driving; Conditional automation; Driver distraction; Driver take-over; Driving simulator; Non-driving related tasks","Automation; Automobile simulators; Automotive industry; Braking; Budget control; Control system synthesis; Steering; Vehicles; Automated driving; Driver distractions; Driver take-over; Driving simulator; Non-driving related tasks; Automobile steering equipment",2-s2.0-85029415000

From the numerical simulations, it was found that the ceramic particle density and substrate material strength played the major roles in determining the embedding and ceramic retention behavior. Substrate material erosion also influenced the ceramic retention, and the material loss increased as the impact angles decreased from normal.

The LED illumination intensity is normalized as a weighting factor, following the determination of the center position of the LED image. Simulations showed that the average signal-to-noise ratio in our positioning system was 19.3 dB.

To address this issue, we have designed and characterized a new prodrug nanoparticle with controllable toxicity allowing a locally-delivered light trigger to convert the payload of the particle from a low to a high toxicity state. Methods: The nanoparticles are created entirely from light-activatable prodrug molecules using a nanoprecipitation process. The prodrug is a conjugate of doxorubicin and photocleavable biotin (DOX-PCB). Results: These DOX-PCB nanoparticles are 30 times less toxic to cells than doxorubicin, but can be activated to release pure therapeutic doxorubicin when exposed to 365 nm light. These nanoparticles have an average diameter of around 100 nm and achieve the maximum possible prodrug loading capacity since no support structure or coating is required to prevent loss of prodrug from the nanoparticle. Conclusions: These light activatable nanoparticles demonstrate tunable toxicity and can be used to facilitate future therapy development whereby light delivered specifically to the tumor tissue would locally convert the nanoparticles to doxorubicin while leaving nanoparticles accumulated in healthy tissue in the less toxic prodrug form. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","DNA intercalation; Doxorubicin; Light-activatable; Nanoparticle drug delivery vehicle; Prodrug","biotin; doxorubicin; nanoparticle; prodrug; Article; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug formulation; drug release; drug solubility; human; human cell; light exposure; particle size; precipitation; priority journal; surface property",2-s2.0-85027015732

Many cloud reputation evaluation models exist, most of which are based on subjective grading of QoS properties, or are qualitative in nature. Such models are highly prone to subjective biases. Hence, there is a need of an objective reputation model of Telemedicine services, which can estimate service levels over time without human biases. This paper presents analysis for such a quantitative reputation model. Results reflect on the evolution of reputation over time. It is significant for tentative service subscribers as it guides them for selection of a Telemedicine based cloud service provider. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Availability; Healthcare Cloud Computing; QoS; Quantitative Model; Service Level Agreement; Telemedicine","cloud computing; human; telemedicine",2-s2.0-85030652199

A grid current feedback based modified $dq$-current control technique for interfacing inverter is developed in order to achieve constant loading on the grid, transient-free operation, and power factor improvement close to unity power factor (UPF) of the utility grid during sudden load variations. This technique does not require separate calculation of reference reactive component and harmonics component of currents hence reduces control circuit complexity. In addition, it requires only three voltage and three current sensors. Three phase AANF is developed and is used for online extraction of utility voltage phase angle to generate synchronized reference current signals for interfacing inverter. AANF is used because of its adjustable accuracy and amplitude adaptability even under unbalanced voltage sag and swell, frequency variation, and distorted grid conditions. Fast and accurate behavior of three phase AANF improves the dynamic response of entire DG system control performance for sudden load variations. The dynamic behavior of the proposed grid interfaced DG system is experimentally evaluated in maintaining constant loading on grid, transient-free operation, and power factor improvement close to UPF operation of the utility grid, by compensating total reactive power and harmonic current demanded by variable linear as well as nonlinear load. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Amplitude adaptive notch filter (AANF); grid synchronization; grid-connected inverters; power quality improvement","Adaptive control systems; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Distributed power generation; Electric current control; Electric inverters; Electric power factor; Electric power transmission networks; Notch filters; Power quality; Real time control; Synchronization; Adaptive notch filters; Adaptive synchronizations; Current control techniques; Distributed generation system; Grid connected inverters; Grid synchronizations; Power quality improvement; Real-time implementations; Electric power system control",2-s2.0-85029897466

This research aimed to establish how people value speech-based take-over requests as a function of speech rate, background noise, spoken phrase, and speaker's gender and emotional tone. By means of crowdsourcing, 2669 participants from 95 countries listened to a random 10 out of 140 take-over requests, and rated each take-over request on urgency, commandingness, pleasantness, and ease of understanding. Our results replicate several published findings, in particular that an increase in speech rate results in a monotonic increase of perceived urgency. The female voice was easier to understand than a male voice when there was a high level of background noise, a finding that contradicts the literature. Moreover, a take-over request spoken with Indian accent was found to be easier to understand by participants from India than by participants from other countries. Our results replicate effects in the literature regarding speech-based warnings, and shed new light on effects of background noise, gender, and nationality.

Against this backdrop, we assessed the relationships between the 3 capabilities. We conducted an observational study applying partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique to 27 variables obtained from the 2013 American Hospital Association annual survey Information Technology (IT) supplement, which describes health IT capabilities. We included 1330 hospitals. In confirmatory factor analysis, out of the 27 variables, 15 achieved loading values greater than 0.548 at P<.001, as such were validated as the building blocks of the 3 capabilities. Subsequent path analysis showed a significant, positive, and cyclic relationship between the capabilities, in that decreases in the hospitals' adoption of one would lead to decreases in the adoption of the others.

Background: Hearing and structure preservation is the goal of cochlear implantation for advanced hearing outcomes. Currently, this is most consistently achieved with thin lateral wall electrodes. Modiolar electrodes are located nearer the modiolus and may provide some electrophysiological advantages, but have a greater tendency for causing insertion trauma. Methods: The SMA was implanted in 20 fresh-frozen human temporal bones (TB). All TBs were scanned pre- and postoperatively with cone beam computed tomography. For atraumatic insertion, the round window approach was preferred. Scalar localization and trauma were analyzed by three-dimensional image fusion reconstructions of the pre- and postimplant scans. The TBs underwent histologic examination to validate the radiologic findings. Results: Insertion through the round window was performed in 19 TBs and through a cochleostomy in one TB. In one TB trauma in the form of scala translocation was identified radiologically and histologically. In the remaining TBs there was no insertion trauma. Adequate modiolar localization of the SMA was found in 19 of 20 TBs. The mean angular insertion depth was 400 degrees without correlation to cochlea size. There was no significant statistical difference between the radiological and histological measurements of electrode localization. Conclusion: The SMA showed consistent and atraumatic insertion results in TBs. Pre- and postimplant cone beam computed tomography with image fusion was shown to be very accurate for the assessment of electrode position and insertion trauma.

A detailed review of common whole soybean extraction process is then given, along with extraction process parameters and process intensification steps that can improve yield. A novel extraction model is presented, based on a mass balance of the water phases. The extraction model reveals separation as the main limitation for protein recovery during aqueous soy protein extraction due to the high amount of okara waste stream and its high moisture content. Industrial relevance Typically, the extraction of protein from an intermediate soy-protein ingredient is studied at lab-scale. Within industry, aqueous extract from whole soybeans is commonly used for making consumer products containing both soy protein and soybean oil, and this has been the focus of this review. Key extraction process parameters are presented and challenges of each extraction step are given for the whole soybean extraction process.

Hydroxyapatite bone graft substitute was applied in the defect site unilaterally, and other site was left empty. Then, a novel micro-porous mesh (50 μm in pore diameter) or commercially available macro-porous titanium mesh (1700 μm in pore diameter) was placed on the defect and secured with screws. After 4 weeks, the mandibles were harvested, imaged using micro-computed tomography, and prepared for histological and morphometric evaluation. Higher new bone volumes (mm3), percentage of new bone volumes in the total defect volumes (bone ratio: %), and new bone area (mm2) through morphometric evaluation were found on the novel membranes with 50-μm-diameter pores compared to the commercial titanium mesh. Moreover, experiment sites without bone graft were observed with higher new bone volume and bone ratio compared with sites with bone graft. However, bone mineral density of novel mesh was observed to be lower compared with other experimental sites.

Delays in NPP outage processes can cause significant economic losses. In typical NPP outages, extremely busy outage schedules, large crew sizes, dynamic workspaces and zero tolerance of accidents pose challenges to ensuring the resilience of outage control, which should rapidly and proactively respond to delays, errors, or unexpected tasks added during outages. Two mutually interacting practical problems impede NPPs from achieving such resilient outage control: 1) how to control errors and wastes effectively during the “handoffs” between tasks, and 2) how to respond to numerous contingencies in NPP outage workflows in a responsive and proactive manner. A resilient NPP outage control system should address these two practical problems through “Human-Centered Automation (HCA),” which is improving the control process automation while fully considering human factors. Previous studies examined two categories of technologies that potentially enable HCA in outage control: 1) computational modeling and simulation methods for predicting states of field operations and workflows; 2) data collection and processing methods for capturing the reality and thus providing feedback to computational models. Unfortunately, limited studies systematically synthesize technological challenges related to these practical problems and underlying HCA principles. This paper identifies the domain requirements, challenges, and potential solutions of achieving the HCA system that effectively supports resilient NPP outage control. This proposed system aims at significantly improving the performance of handoff monitoring/control and responding to contingencies during the outage. Firstly, the authors identified information acquisition and modeling challenges of achieving human-center automation for outage control. The rest of the paper then synthesizes potential techniques available in the domains of computer science, cognitive science, system science, and construction engineering that can potentially address these challenges.

This extensive literature has established, through the analyses of glance from naturalistic datasets, a clear relationship between eyes-off-road, lead vehicle closing kinematics, and near-crash/crash involvement. Objective This paper looks at the role of driver expectation in influencing drivers’ decisions about when and for how long to remove their eyes from the forward roadway in an analysis that consider the combined role of on- and off-road glances. Method Using glance data collected in the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS), near-crashes were examined separately from crashes to examine how momentary differences in glance allocation over the 25-s prior to a precipitating event can differentiate between these two distinct outcomes. Individual glance metrics of mean single glance duration (MSGD), total glance time (TGT), and glance count for off-road and on-road glance locations were analyzed. Output from the AttenD algorithm (Kircher and Ahlström, 2009) was also analyzed as a hybrid measure; in threading together on- and off-road glances over time, its output produces a pattern of glance behavior meaningful for examining attentional effects. Results Individual glance metrics calculated at the epoch-level and binned by 10-s units of time across the available epoch lengths revealed that drivers in near-crashes have significantly longer on-road glances, and look less frequently between on- and off- road locations in the moments preceding a precipitating event as compared to crashes. During on-road glances, drivers in near-crashes were found to more frequently sample peripheral regions of the roadway than drivers in crashes. Output from the AttenD algorithm affirmed the cumulative net benefit of longer on-road glances and of improved attention management between on- and off-road locations. Conclusion The finding of longer on-road glances differentiating between safety-critical outcomes in the 100-Car NDS data underscores the importance of attention management in how drivers look both on and off the road. It is in the pattern of glances to and from the forward roadway that drivers obtained critical information necessary to inform their expectation of hazard potential to avoid a crash.

Methods: Eighteen adults, who had previously completed a 1-month closed-loop study with a non-adaptive artificial pancreas (NA-AP), volunteered for an additional 1-month extension study in which the AP was equipped with an adaptive model predictive control algorithm (R2R-AP). Continuous glucose monitoring data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis by comparing the last week of R2R-AP versus the last week of NA-AP. The primary endpoint was the time in target range (3.9-10 mmol/L) over 24 h. Results: Time in target with R2R-AP is higher than with the NA-AP, although the increase was not significant: mean 66.90% (standard deviation: 13.34) versus 61.82% (11.12), P = 0.10.

This gives more concerns and aware organization to apply information security risk management (ISRM) to develop effective and economically-viable control strategies. Even though there are numerous ISRM methods that are readily available, most of the ISRM methods prescribe a similar process that leads to establish a scope of the assessment, collecting information, producing intermediary information, and finally using the collected information to identify their security risks and provide a measured, analyzed security profile of critical information assets. Based on the “garbage in-garbage out” phenomenon, the success of ISRM planning tremendously depends on the quality of input information. However, with the amount, diversity and variety of information available, practitioners can easily deflects with grown information and becoming unmanageable. Therefore this paper contribute as a stepping stone to determine which IQ dimensions constitute the quality of the information throughout the process of gathering information during ISRM. Seems to accurately define the attributes of IQ dimensions, IQ needs to be assessed within the context of its generation. Thus, papers on IQ web were assessed and comparative analysis was conducted to identify the possible dimensions for ISRM. Then, online survey using likert structured questionnaire were distributed among a group of information security practitioners in Malaysia (N = 150). Partial least square (PLS) analysis revealed that dimension accuracy, amount of data, objective, completeness, reliability and verifiability are significantly influence the quality of information gathering for ISRM. These IQ dimensions can guide practitioners in the process of gathering quality and complete information in order to make a plan that leads to a clear direction, and ultimately help to make decisions that lead to success. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Information quality; Information security; Information Security Risk Management; Risk management","Information analysis; Quality control; Reliability analysis; Risk assessment; Security of data; Surveys; Garbage in garbage outs; Information quality; Information security risk managements; Information transfers; Integrating information; Partial least square (PLS); Quality of information; Security practitioners; Risk management",2-s2.0-85026395881

Although the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) is well-supported, much less is known about the process underlying it. Nevertheless, developing a mental model that matches the game system, which in turn models a real-world system, is a promising proposed process. Aim. This article explores the first steps in model matching: identifying the entities and (complex) relations in a game system. Method. Participants (N = 30) played the analog game DOMINION and completed a multi-step mental model mapping exercise. Categories of entities in mental model maps were inductively identified with grounded theory coding, while complex relations in mental model maps were identified via content analysis. Results. Participants described formal game entities, player actions, sociality, learning processes, and subjective experience in their mental model maps. Participants identified very few complex relations—and no feedback loops—in their mental model maps. Conclusions. Games—and analog games specifically—provide a breadth of resources for model matching and GBL. Through gameplay, learners come to affix conceptual meanings to material objects, a process dubbed lamination. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","analog games; complex systems; game-based learning; GBL; mental models; model matching",,2-s2.0-85029579378

Little is known, however, about whether or not character model changes may impact players' relationships with familiar avatars, especially since anthropomorphism-the perception of nonhuman objects as being human or humanlike-is understood as central to player-avatar interaction (PAX). This study leveraged a naturally occurring change to massively multiplayer online game avatars to conduct a field quasiexperiment to investigate whether enhanced avatar anthropomorphism influences PAX dimensions: emotional investment, anthropomorphic autonomy, suspension of disbelief, and sense of control. Longitudinal analysis showed that enhanced anthropomorphism had no significant impact on any PAX dimension immediately or over time, when controlling for demographic and gameplay variables. Player comments suggest the change was experienced not as a change in humanness, but as a shift in perceptual realism-believability, lifelikeness, depth-that impacted the experience of the avatar-mediated gameworld more broadly.

Combined with a powerful local optimization procedure and a rank-based quality-and-distance pool updating strategy, OBMA establishes a suitable balance between exploration and exploitation of its search process. Computational results on 80 popular MDP benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm matches the best-known solutions for most of instances, and finds improved best solutions (new lower bounds) for 22 instances.

Vesnarinone (a cardiotonic agent) falls into a category of drugs that inhibit phosphodiesterase 3-type (PDE3) enzymes. PDE3 enzymes have specific roles in the dehydyrolysis of intracellular second messengers 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Thus, PDE3 inhibitors elevate the intracellular concentrations of these substrates. However, it is also known that vesnarinone inhibits the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels. Since inhibition of hERG channels may cause life-threatening arrhythmias, leading to Torsades de pointes (TdP) and long QT syndrome (LQTS), it is important to understand the particular residue-drug interactions and hERG channel dynamics. Applying the computational approaches in this study, have helped to elucidate the possible binding patterns and time evaluation dynamics of this drug at hERG1 channel models (both in its open and open-inactivated states) together with the crucial amino acid residues that mostly contribute in binding processes via interaction binding energy decomposition analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"Binding energy; Bins; Drug interactions; Enzymes; Molecular dynamics; Signal transduction; Amino acid residues; Computational approach; Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); Energy decomposition analysis; Intracellular concentration; Molecular dynamics simulations; Phosphodiesterases; Structural investigation; Principal component analysis; amino acid; cyclic AMP; cyclic GMP; drug residue; phosphodiesterase III; piperanometozine; potassium channel HERG; Article; calculation; drug decomposition; drug research; drug screening; drug structure; enzyme inhibition; heart arrhythmia; human; long QT syndrome; molecular docking; molecular dynamics; priority journal; torsade des pointes",2-s2.0-85029958575

To this regard, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a leading imaging technique that has the peculiarities of high resolution and direct relationship with 3D cellular morphology. Expert human operators, however, are still required to manage most of the AFM-based analysis, thus introducing subjective bias and allowing a limited number of trials. The modality of interaction and the resulting topographic differences are often not a priori known. Also, the presence of artefacts in AFM images may affect the derived conclusions. In this work, we propose a robust and flexible strategy to analyse AFM topography images with single click-select actions by the human operator.

The average Young’s modulus (8.2 GPa), work of fracture (250 MJ m−3) and ultimate strain (28%) fall in the same range as for most previously tested spider silks. The average strength is rather low yet (645 MPa in the engineering convention), even in comparison with other Nephila spiders having similar secondary structures (as controlled by polarized Raman microscopy). The scattering of stress/strain failure values is often seen as an obstacle for the unequivocal characterization of silks, but our study evidences a great shape similarity between normalized tensile curves. The so-called strain-hardening region may be divided into a nonlinear regime (nLHR) and a linear one (LHR). The nLHR tends to disappear on averaged spectra, suggesting that it does not correspond to any specific mechanism. Instead, we propose that the plastic deformation to linear hardening transition threshold changes from one point of each fiber to the other, as a result of local heterogeneities. No major aging effect was found comparing the average properties of fresh and 30-year-old fibers, but the lower mechanical variability of the latter reveals a structural consolidation over time, to the detriment of the plastic deformation plateau. The relative extension of this plateau and both hardening regimes, the deviation to linearity in the nLHR and a newly defined εT strain may be used to compare the mechanical properties of silk fibers as a function of age, origin or testing conditions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Age hardening; Fracture; Hardening; Plastic deformation; Strain; Stress-strain curves; Tensile testing; Linear hardening; Local heterogeneity; Non-linear regimes; Secondary structures; Shape similarity; Structural consolidation; Testing conditions; Work of fracture; Silk",2-s2.0-85021807256

However, it has been argued that making inferences about learners based on absolute complexity indices (e.g., mean length of t-unit and mean length of clause) may be difficult, both from practical and theoretical perspectives (Norris &amp; Ortega, 2009). Furthermore, indices of absolute complexity may not align with some prominent theories of language learning such as usage-based theories (e.g., Ellis, 2002a,b). This study introduces a corpus-based approach for measuring syntactic sophistication in L2 writing using a usage-based, frequency-driven perspective. Specifically, novel computational indices related to the frequency of verb argument constructions (VACs) and the strength of association between VACs and the verbs that fill them (i.e., verb–VAC combinations) are developed.

Indices related to usage-based theories of syntactic development explained greater variance (R2 =.142) in holistic scores of writing quality than traditional methods of assessing syntactic complexity (R2 =.058).

Mobility fluxes were inferred using a straightforward and generalizable methodology that relies on mapping population density based on a high resolution urban footprint product, and a parameter-free human mobility model.

Including covariates related to the latent class analysis not only may improve the ability of the mixture model to clearly differentiate between subjects but also makes interpretation of latent group membership more meaningful. Very few studies have been conducted that compare the performance of various approaches to estimating covariate effects in mixture modeling, and fewer yet have considered more complicated models such as growth mixture models where the latent class variable is more difficult to identify. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to investigate the performance of four estimation approaches: (1) the conventional three-step approach, (2) the one-step maximum likelihood (ML) approach, (3) the pseudo class (PC) approach, and (4) the three-step ML approach in terms of their ability to recover covariate effects in the logistic regression class membership model within a growth mixture modeling framework. Results showed that when class separation was large, the one-step ML approach and the three-step ML approach displayed much less biased covariate effect estimates than either the conventional three-step approach or the PC approach. When class separation was poor, estimation of the relation between the dichotomous covariate and latent class variable was severely affected when the new three-step ML approach was used. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","covariate effect; growth mixture modeling; latent class analysis; latent growth modeling",,2-s2.0-85029529547

To ensure safe and effective care during emergency patient transfer from rural areas to center tertiary hospitals, reliable and real-time communication is essential. Unfortunately, real-time monitoring of patients involves transmission of various clinical multimedia data including videos, medical images, and vital signs, which requires use of mobile network with high-fidelity communication bandwidth. However, the wireless networks along the roads in rural areas range from 4G to 2G to low speed satellite links, which poses a significant challenge to transmit critical patient information. In this paper, we present a bandwidth-compliant criticality-aware system for transmission of massive clinical multimedia data adaptive to varying bandwidths during patient transport. Model-based clinical automata are used to determine the criticality of clinical multimedia data. We borrow concepts from DASH, and propose physiology-aware adaptation techniques to transmit more critical clinical data with higher fidelity in response to changes in disease, clinical states, and bandwidth condition.

All anthracene sulfides studied here were highly fluorescent. Their optical behavior was compared with that of related pyrene bisulfide and tetrasulfides. All sulfides are crystalline compounds and show good chemical stability in condensed phase. In solution, the pyrene derivatives are very stable but the anthracene derivatives suffer a slow photooxidation process under air and ambient light. While the bisulfides of anthracene and pyrene have very different spectroscopic behavior, the tetrasubstituted anthracene and pyrene sulfides exhibit quite a few similarities. Thus, the chromophoric core of the compounds consists of the aromatic core and the sulfur or oxygen atoms, so the variation from alkyl to aryl substituents does not alter the profiles of the absorption and emission spectra. All they show intense fluorescence, but sulfides bearing SCH2 or OCH2 groups display higher fluorescence efficiencies than the ones with aryl substituents. In addition, their quenching efficiencies with nitroaromatic compounds of both series are dominated by steric hindrance rather than by electronic factors.

Specifically, to integrate feed information, MOBANA uses an improved incremental text classifier, based on Kullback Leibler distance.

Specifically, within the transport domain, MOBANA identifies the real-time position of vehicles by an as-needed adjustment of planned position against the real-time position, thus dropping network load.

This approach is then extended to a more sophisticated algorithm which estimates this threshold for each sensor yielding trial-wise bad sensors.

The device we employed measured upperbody movements with an accelerometer and the duration of face-to-face communication with an infrared ray sensor on a minute-by-minute basis. We defined a coevolution measure between two people as the number of per-minute changes of their body movement and compared the indices for face-to-face and non-face-to-face situations. We found that on average, the amount of people's body movements changed correspondingly for face-toface communication and that the average rate of coevolution in the case of face-to-face communication was 3-4% higher than in the case of nonface- to-face situation.

Wing morphology and body mass influence energy expenditure of flight, such that certain characteristics may confer a greater relative advantage when making long crossings over ecological barriers by modifying the flight range or speed. We explored the possibility, among light (mass <50 g) migrating passerines, that species with relatively poorer flight performance related to wing shape and/or body mass have a lower margin for error in dealing with the exigencies of a long water crossing across the Gulf of Mexico and consequently minimize their travel time or distance.

In both spring and autumn, lighter (i.e., slower flying) species and species with more rounded wings were concentrated nearest the coastline. Our results support the idea that morphology helps to shape broad-scale bird distributions along an ecological barrier and that migration exerts some selective force on passerine morphology.

This paper reviews what is known about successful transition processes for adolescents with various chronic conditions and the unique factors associated with chronic pain and includes a call for further research on transition. Transitioning from the pediatric to the adult health care setting is challenging for adolescents with chronic conditions and their families. Loss to follow-up and negative health outcomes are linked to poor transition processes. Despite studies examining factors associated with successful transition, not all of the findings are transferable to adolescents with chronic pain.

We showed that the ancillary tptz ligand has detrimental effect on the photophysical properties of the terbium complex, showing a 2.5-fold shorter observed lifetime as compared to the hydrated binary complex [Tb(tfaa)3H2O] (τobs = 220 μs). However, it has a positive effect on the NIR emission of the neodymium complex (τobs = 10.33 μs and ϕLn = 3.2%) and visible emission of the europium complex (τobs = 678.54 μs and ϕLn = 89.45%). The Judd-Ofelt parameters (Ω2 and Ω4), the radiative (Arad) and non-radiative (Anrad) decay rates and the energy transfer (WET) and back energy transfer (WBT) rates were calculated and discussed in detail for the europium complex. The high value of Ω2 (30.88 × 10−20 cm2) indicates a greater degree of covalency in the europium – ligand bonds, on the other hand, the higher value of Ω4 (22.36 × 10−20 cm2) could be due to π–π interactions between the non-coordinating arms of the tptz co-ligand.

Developers can no longer limit themselves to low-level solutions and ignore the potential for productivity and performance portability obtained by using locality abstractions. Fortunately, the trend emerging in recent literature on the topic alleviates many of the concerns that got in the way of their adoption by application developers. Data locality abstractions are available in the forms of libraries, data structures, languages and runtime systems; a common theme is increasing productivity without sacrificing performance.

The tempered martensite morphology was largely retained after long-term thermal aging at 550 °C/5000 h, while the M23C6 and M2(C,N) type of precipitates were found to act as nucleation sites for precipitation of brittle Fe2Mo Laves phase. The grain refinement by DNT was found to be beneficial for minimizing the ductile-to-brittle transition characteristics (25 °C lower ductile-to-brittle transition temperature and 70 J higher upper shelf energy) over the CNT. Thermal embrittlement occurred in both heated treated steels, but the transition temperature of aged DNT steel remained below room temperature. Fractured Charpy specimens revealed ductile failure by void coalescence for high temperature tests, and a quasi-cleavage fracture at low temperatures with few isolated occurrence of intergranular crack in thermal embrittled steel.

Usually, the compressive strength of the CPCs is reported and, more rarely, the elastic modulus. Conversely, scarce or no data are available on Poisson's ratio and strain-to-crack-initiation. This is unfortunate, as data on the elastic response is key to, e.g., numerical model accuracy. In this study, the compressive behaviour of brushite, monetite and apatite cements was fully characterised. Measurement of the surface strains was done using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique, and compared to results obtained with the commonly used built-in displacement measurement of the materials testers. The collected data showed that the use of fixed compression platens, as opposed to spherically seated ones, may in some cases underestimate the compressive strength by up to 40%. Also, the built-in measurements may underestimate the elastic modulus by up to 62% as compared to DIC measurements. Using DIC, the brushite cement was found to be much stiffer (24.3 ± 2.3 GPa) than the apatite (13.5 ± 1.6 GPa) and monetite (7.1 ± 1.0 GPa) cements, and elastic moduli were inversely related to the porosity of the materials. Poisson's ratio was determined to be 0.26 ± 0.02 for brushite, 0.21 ± 0.02 for apatite and 0.20 ± 0.03 for monetite. All investigated CPCs showed low strain-to-crack-initiation (0.17–0.19%). In summary, the elastic modulus of CPCs is substantially higher than previously reported and it is concluded that an accurate procedure is a prerequisite in order to properly compare the mechanical properties of different CPC formulations. It is recommended to use spherically seated platens and measuring the strain at a relevant resolution and on the specimen surface. © 2017 The Authors","Apatite; Bone cement; Brushite; Calcium phosphate; Elastic modulus; Mechanical properties; Monetite; Poisson's ratio","Apatite; Bone; Calcium; Calcium phosphate; Cements; Compressive strength; Cracks; Elastic moduli; Mechanical properties; Phosphate minerals; Poisson ratio; Strain; Brushite; Calcium phosphate bone cement; Calcium phosphate cement; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Elastic properties; High-resolution measurements; Monetite; Specimen surfaces; Bone cement; calcium phosphate; calcium phosphate dibasic; Article; bone tissue; compression; compressive strength; evaluation study; geometry; porosity; priority journal; trabecular bone; Young modulus",2-s2.0-85025075724

This model is capable of producing irregular angular fragments upon particle fragmentation while conserving the total volume. The particle is modeled as a cluster of rigid polyhedral cells generated by a Voronoi tessellation. The cells are bonded along their faces by a cohesive Tresca law with independent tensile and shear strengths and simulated by the contact dynamics method. Using this model, we analyze the mechanical response of a single particle subjected to diametral compression for varying number of cells, their degree of disorder, and intercell tensile and shear strength. In particular, we identify the functional dependence of particle strength on the intercell strengths. We find that two different regimes can be distinguished depending on whether intercell shear strength is below or above its tensile strength. In both regimes, we observe a power-law dependence of particle strength on both intercell strengths but with different exponents. The strong effect of intercell shear strength on the particle strength reflects an interlocking effect between cells. In fact, even at low tensile strength, the particle global strength can still considerably increase with intercell shear strength. We finally show that the Weibull statistics describes well the particle strength variability. © 2016, OWZ.","Bonded-cell model; Contact dynamics method; Discrete element method; Fragmentation; Voronoi cell; Weibull statistics",,2-s2.0-85029918946

We present a general approach, on the basis of a Dirichlet boundary control problem, that may potentially be used in different parts of the arterial system. The relevance of this method appears when computational reconstructions of the 3D domains, prone to be considered sufficiently extended, are either not possible, or desirable, because of computational costs. On the basis of taking a fully unknown velocity profile as the control, the approach uses a discretize then optimize methodology to solve the control problem numerically. The methodology is applied to a realistic 3D geometry representing a brain aneurysm. The results show that this data assimilation approach may be preferable to a pressure control strategy and that it can significantly improve the accuracy associated to typical solutions obtained using idealized velocity profiles.

Whereas, in recent years, there has been increasingly more research on dual-career marriages (i.e. both spouses work, but not necessarily at the same workplace and/or occupation), there has been very little research on work-linked marriages. The current study focuses on work resources (i.e. family supportive supervisor behaviour and job control) as key mediating processes that explain the effect of gender on turnover intentions among work-linked employees in masculine occupations (i.e. military). Investigating gender differences is important because, compared with men, women are more likely to be in work-linked marriages and to leave their jobs. Based on role theory and conservation of resource theory, we predicted that gender was related to turnover intentions, and this relationship would be mediated by key explanatory variables (i.e. family supportive supervisor behaviours, job control and psychological distress). Mediation analyses, conducted on a sample of men and women in work-linked marriages (n = 309), provide support for the hypothesized model.

The adaptation module gradually resets the activity and sensitivity of the first module after initial stimulation and thereby enables the temporal comparisons necessary for bacterial chemotaxis.

Drugs that target the response regulator portion of two-component systems represent a potent new approach so far unexploited.

At the startup of the system, background removal and hand position detection are performed using only the depth map. After that, tracking is started using the hand positions of the previous frames in order to seek for the hand centroid of the current one. The obtained point is used as a seed for a region growing algorithm to perform hand segmentation in the depth map. The result is a mask that will be used for hand segmentation in the ILSP frame sequence. Next, we apply motion restrictions for gesture spotting in order to mark each image as a ‘Gesture’ or ‘Non-Gesture’. The ILSP counterparts of the frames labeled as “Gesture” are enhanced by using mask subtraction, contrast stretching, median filter, and histogram equalization. The result is used as the input for the feature extraction using a scale invariant feature transform algorithm (SIFT), bag-of-visual-words construction and classification through a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, we build a grammar based on the hand gesture classes to convert the classification results in control commands for the CAVE application. The performed tests and comparisons show that the implemented plugin is an efficient solution. We achieve state-of-the-art recognition accuracy as well as efficient object manipulation in a virtual scene visualized in the CAVE. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bag-of-visual-words; CAVE; Depth and speckle pattern images; Gesture spotting; Hand gesture recognition; Kinect; SVM","Caves; Face recognition; Feature extraction; Median filters; Object recognition; Palmprint recognition; Speckle; Support vector machines; Bag-of-visual-words; Gesture spotting; Hand-gesture recognition; Kinect; Speckle patterns; Gesture recognition",2-s2.0-84988698679

Poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)), a piezoelectric polymer, is widely used in biomaterial applications. We hypothesized that incorporation of zinc oxide (ZnO)nanoparticles into the P(VDF-TrFE) matrix could promote adhesion, migration, and proliferation of cells, as well as blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). In this study, we fabricated and comprehensively characterized a novel electrospun P(VDF-TrFE)/ZnO nanocomposite tissue engineering scaffold. We analyzed the morphological features of the polymeric matrix by scanning electron microscopy, and utilized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry to examine changes in the crystalline phases of the copolymer due to addition of the nanoparticles. We detected no or minimal adverse effects of the biomaterials with regard to blood compatibility in vitro, biocompatibility, and cytotoxicity, indicating that P(VDF-TrFE)/ZnO nanocomposite scaffolds are suitable for tissue engineering applications. Interestingly, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured on the nanocomposite scaffolds exhibited higher cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation compared to cells cultured on tissue culture plates or neat P(VDF-TrFE) scaffolds. Nanocomposite scaffolds implanted into rats with or without hMSCs did not elicit immunological responses, as assessed by macroscopic analysis and histology. Importantly, nanocomposite scaffolds promoted angiogenesis, which was increased in scaffolds pre-seeded with hMSCs. Overall, our results highlight the potential of these novel P(VDF-TrFE)/ZnO nanocomposites for use in tissue engineering, due to their biocompatibility and ability to promote cell adhesion and angiogenesis.

A substantial amount of static and kinetic work has focused on the binding of pyruvate or substrate mimic oxamate to the binary complex of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-NADH where substantial fluorescence quenching is typically observed. However, the quenching mechanism is not well understood limiting structural interpretation. Based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) computations with cam-B3LYP functional in conjunction with the analysis of previous experimental results, we propose that bound oxamate acts as an electron acceptor in the quenching of fluorescence of NADH in the ternary complex, where a charge transfer (CT) state characterized by excitation from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the nicotinamide moiety of NADH to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of oxamate exists close to the locally excited (LE) state involving only the nicotinamide moiety. Efficient quenching in the encounter complex like in pig heart LDH requires that oxamate forms a salt bridge with Arg-171 and hydrogen bonds with His-195, Thr-246 and Asn-140. Further structural rearrangement and loop closure, which also brings about another hydrogen bond between oxamate and Arg-109, will increase the rate of fluorescence quenching as well. © 2017 The American Society of Photobiology",,,2-s2.0-85019126142

In line with the work–home resources model, we introduce 2 contextual conditions to explain when our proposed associations may unfold. One is a facilitator: perceived organizational support; and the other is a stressor: perceived hindering work demands. The results of a matched sample of employees and their supervisors working in 2 companies in El Salvador support our hypotheses. Our findings show that the benefits of flexibility i-deals to the work domain (i.e., work performance) extend only through the family domain (i.e., family performance). Our findings also emphasize that flexibility i-deals do not unfold in a dyadic vacuum: For employees who perceive organizational support to be higher, the association between flexibility i-deals and family performance is stronger, whereas for employees who perceive hindering work demands to be lower, the association between family performance and employee work performance is also stronger. We contribute to i-deals research by (a) exploring a relevant mechanism through which flexibility i-deals influence work performance, (b) integrating the role of social context to emphasize the social aspects of i-deals, and (c) enriching the i-deals literature by introducing a resource perspective.

The corium may induce collapse of the nuclear reactor devices and, in the worst case, breach the reactor containment and escape into the environment. This work shows the capabilities of the proposed formulation to reproduce the structural failure mechanisms induced by the corium that may occur during a meltdown scenario. For this purpose, a monolithic method for FSI problems, the so-called Unified formulation, is here enhanced in order to account for the thermal field and to model phase change phenomena with the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM).

Urban trees contribute significantly in mitigating the urban heat island effect and supporting biodiversity. However, accurate and up-to-date mapping of urban tree species is difficult because of the time-consuming nature of field sampling, fine-scale spatial variation, and potentially high species diversity. Advanced remote sensing data such as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with high pulse density (25 point/m2) and hyperspectral imagery offer two different yet complementary approaches to estimating crown structure and canopy physiological information at the individual crown scale, which can be useful for mapping tree species. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of these technologies to map 15 common urban tree species using a Random Forest (RF) classifier in the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. LiDAR-derived crown structural information was combined with hyperspectral-derived spectral vegetation indices for species classification. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 51.1%, 61.0%, and 70.0% using hyperspectral, LiDAR and the combined data respectively. The overall accuracy for the two most important and iconic native coniferous species improved markedly from 78.3% up to 91% using the combined data. The results of this research highlight that (1) the combination of structural and spectral information provided an improved classification accuracy than when used separately, and variables derived from LiDAR data contributed more to the accurate prediction of species than hyperspectral features; (2) higher classification accuracies were observed for evergreen species, species with distinguishable crown structure, and species undergoing flowering; (3) and finally the anthocyanin content index and photochemical reflectance index were the most important hyperspectral features for the discrimination of tree species in the spring budburst stage. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Airborne hyperspectral; Airborne LiDAR; British Columbia, Canada; Random forest; Urban tree species classification","Anthocyanins; Biodiversity; Decision trees; Forestry; Mapping; Optical radar; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Urban planning; Vegetation; Airborne LiDAR; British Columbia , Canada; HyperSpectral; Random forests; Urban trees; Classification (of information); biodiversity; canopy architecture; coniferous tree; ecosystem service; evergreen tree; forest ecosystem; heat island; lidar; mapping method; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; tree; urban area; urban planning; British Columbia; Canada; Canada; Surrey [British Columbia]",2-s2.0-85028948905

Over the years, “amyloid cascade” emerges as principal pathogenic event in AD. β-Secretase 1 (BACE1) controls the rate-limiting step in amyloid beta (Aβ) generation and Aβ rapidly aggregates to form neurotoxic amyloid fibrils. Oxidative stress is one of the principal mediators of the observed neurotoxicity of amyloid fibril. The disease pathogenesis involves induction of multiple signaling cascades and the cross-talk therein. Thus inhibiting multiple targets could be an attractive therapeutic strategy. Here, a multi-target virtual screening protocol has been devised and used to screen an in house developed phytochemical library. Narirutin comes out as a multi-potent phytochemical. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence along with molecular modelling studies demonstrate its binding to the BACE1 active site that induces a conformational transition of the protein from open to closed form which precludes substrate recognition. Narirutin possesses strong Aβ aggregation inhibitory potential, evident from ANS and Thioflavin-T binding assay and confirmed by AFM study.

However, finding emotional information from text is a very complex task because it is needed to automatically understand of human sentences that usually are vague and dependent on context which should be interpreted and represented in different ways. The sense of a word can be inferred by investigating the frequency of occurrence of the word in a large corpus of annotated text. This paper has presented a method for learning adaptive lexicon from existing lexicon resources (static lexicons) to improve performance of emotion detection task for two data sets. The learning of adaptive lexicon would allow us to distinguish between the initial emotion of words in the static lexicons and adaptive emotion of words that is mentioned in context, and we get a better understanding of the emotional orientation of words. Furthermore, this study proposes a novel approach for emotion detection based on the combination of Meta-level features derived from static and adaptive lexicons and sentences syntactic features.

We describe the performance, structure, and computational complexity of a DTSW implementation, which is parallelizable and which can achieve the processing rates necessary for many video-based industrial monitoring applications. We describe two case studies of unsupervised monitoring for mechanical wear and for fault detection. Results suggest opportunities for boarder applications of video-based instrumentation for real-time feedback control, wear and defect detection, or statistical process control. © 2017 by ASME.","defect detection; inspection and quality control; process control and monitoring; video data science; video instrumentation","Computational efficiency; Computer graphics; Decision making; Defects; Fault detection; Inspection; Monitoring; Multimedia systems; Quality control; Statistical process control; Video signal processing; Computationally efficient; Control and monitoring; Defect detection; Industrial monitoring; Real time algorithms; Space transformations; Video data; video instrumentation; Process control",2-s2.0-85028552194

Our previous studies revealed that the DNA region containing biphenyl and salycilate metabolism gene clusters (termed the bph-sal element) was frequently deleted and transferred by conjugation to closely related P. putida strains. In this study, we first determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the KF715 genome. Next, to determine the underlying cause of genome plasticity in KF715, we compared the KF715 genome with the genomes of one KF715 defective mutant, two transconjugants, and several P. putida strains available from public databases. The gapless KF715 genome sequence revealed five replicons: one circular chromosome, and four plasmids. Southern blot analysis indicated that most of the KF715 cell population carries the bph-sal element on the chromosome whereas a small number carry it on a huge plasmid, pKF715A. Moreover, the bph-sal element is present stably on the plasmid and did not integrate into the chromosome of its transconjugants. Comparative genome analysis and experiments showed that a number of diverse putative genetic elements are present in KF715 and are likely involved in genome rearrangement.

We conducted ground distance sampling surveys along line transects and block counts from a small aircraft in Manyara Ranch in Northern Tanzania and contrasted estimates of species richness and species-specific densities from both sampling techniques. We used regression analyses (logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models) and model selection to investigate whether a species’ body size, group size, body color, as well as vegetation cover explained the variation in species presence/absence and relative density differences in aerial vs. ground-based sampling. Ground surveys detected significantly more species than aerial surveys. However, aerial surveys detected three species that were missed by ground surveys (African lions, African buffalo, and spotted hyena). Model selection suggested that species with smaller body mass and small group sizes were more likely to be missed in aerial surveys. Densities estimated from the aerial surveys were generally but non-significantly lower than the densities estimated from the ground surveys, with the exception of density estimates for African elephants which were slightly higher from aerial surveys. Density differences between the two methods were greater for species with small group size, light body color, and in areas with denser vegetation cover; these variables explained 75% of the variation in density differences between the two survey methods. Albeit being similar in operational costs in our relatively small study area, ground surveys yielded (1) more complete information with respect to wildlife community composition and (2) density estimates were mostly higher and (3) more precise and (4) appear more feasible to be implemented in community-based conservation schemes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Distance sampling; Population density; Species richness; Wildlife monitoring",,2-s2.0-85029507993

The focus of this study was to develop and verify an emotional response-monitoring paradigm for drivers, derived from electromyography signals of the upper trapezius muscle, photoplethysmography signals of the earlobe, as well as inertial motion sensing of the head movement. The relevant sensors were connected to a microcontroller unit equipped with a Bluetooth-enabled low-energy module, which allows the transmission of those sensor readings to a mobile device in real time. A mobile device application was then used to extract the data from the sensors and to determine the driver's current emotion status, via a trained support vector machine (SVM). The emotional response paradigm, tested in ten subjects, consisted of 10 min baseline, 5 min prestimulus, and 5 min poststimulus measurements. Emotional responses were categorized into three classes: relaxed, stressed, and fatigued. The analysis integrated a total of 36 features to train the SVM model, and the final stimulus results revealed a high accuracy rate (99.52%).

However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from freezing, suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia. Methods: We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13–22Hz) and high (23–35Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson disease patients (57.5 ± 5.9 years old, 4 female). The study group consisted of 5 patients with and 8 patients without freezing of gait. Results: In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta power (13–35Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general. Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around 18Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing. Interpretation: These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, movement leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients susceptible to freezing. Abnormal ∼18Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies.

The rate of advance of the weathering front can be expressed as the same rate observed in non-fractured media (or in an individual block) divided by the volume fraction of non-fractured blocks in the fractured parent material. In the model, the parent has fractures that are filled with a more porous material that contains only inert or completely weathered material. The low-porosity rock weathers by reaction-transport processes. As observed in field systems, the model shows that the weathering advance rate is greater for the fractured as compared to the analogous non-fractured system because the volume fraction of blocks is < 1. The increase in advance rate is attributed both to the increase in weathered material that accompanies higher fracture density, and to the increase in exposure of surface of low-porosity rock to reaction-transport. For constant fracture aperture, the weathering advance rate increases when the fracture spacing decreases. Equations describing weathering advance rate are summarized in the ‘List of selected equations’. If erosion is imposed at a constant rate, the weathering systems with fracture-bounded bedrock blocks attain a steady state. In the erosional transport-limited regime, bedrock blocks no longer emerge at the air-regolith boundary because they weather away. In the weathering-limited (or kinetic) regime, blocks of various size become exhumed at the surface and the average size of these exposed blocks increases with the erosion rate. For convex hillslopes, the block size exposed at the surface increases downslope. This model can explain observations of exhumed rocks weathering in the Luquillo mountains of Puerto Rico.

In this research, a novel Fe3O4/CSAC adsorbent was prepared by the thermal method using cigarette soot activated carbon (CSAC) as a template. Different instrumental techniques like XRD, SEM, EDX, TEM, VSM, BET, Zeta potential and FTIR study were used to confirm the formation of Fe3O4/CSAC. This material showed high surface area (575.604 m2/g), low pore size (6.8 nm), small particle size (less than 10 nm) and good magnetic properties (10.77 emu/g), which made the material highly effective for arsenic removal. The adsorption of arsenic was highly pH dependent and 91% and 93% of As(III) and As(V) were removed by this adsorbent at pH 7 and 3. The adsorption process followed the Langmuir isotherm model with the uptake capacities of 80.99 and 107.96 mg/g for As(III) and As(V), respectively. The adsorption data were best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetics model with the rapid adsorption in just 90 min. In presence of Cl−, NO3 −, SO4 2 −, CO3 2– and PO4 3 − anions also, the Fe3O4/CSAC showed the significant removal of As(III) and As(V). About 89% and 91% of As(III) and As(V) were desorbed with 0.5 M NaOH solution from Fe3O4/CSAC surface and the regenerated adsorbent can be used up to four consecutive cycles without any major decrease in removal efficiency.

MAP tau is a key protein in stabilizing the microtubule architecture that regulates neuron morphology and synaptic strength. When MAP tau is degraded in tauopathic disorders, neuron dysfunction results. The precise role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tauopathic disease process, however, is poorly understood. Classically, mitochondrial dysfunction has been viewed as the major source of oxidative stress and has been shown to precede tau and amyloid pathology in various dementias, but the exact mechanisms are not clear. It is known that the production of ROS by mitochondria can result in ultraweak photon emission (UPE) within cells. While of low intensity, surrounding proteins within the cytosol can still absorb these energetic photons via aromatic amino acids (e.g., tryptophan and tyrosine). One likely absorber of these photons is the microtubule cytoskeleton, as it forms a vast network spanning neurons, is highly co-localized with mitochondria, and shows a high density of aromatic amino acids. Functional microtubule networks may traffic this ROS-generated endogenous photon energy for cellular signaling, or they may serve as dissipaters/conduits of such energy to protect the cell from potentially harmful effects. Experimentally, after in vitro exposure to exogenous photons, microtubules have been shown to reorient and reorganize in a dose-dependent manner with the greatest effect being observed around 280 nm, in the tryptophan and tyrosine absorption range. In this paper, recent modeling efforts based on ambient temperature experiment are presented, showing that tubulin polymers can feasibly absorb and channel these photoexcitations via resonance energy transfer, on the order of dendritic length scales and neuronal fine structure. Since microtubule networks are compromised in tauopathic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's dementias, patients with these illnesses would be unable to support effective channeling of these photons for signaling or dissipation. Consequent emission surplus due to increased UPE production or decreased ability to absorb and transfer may lead to increased cellular oxidative damage, thus hastening the neurodegenerative process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alzheimer's disease; Coherent energy transfer; Excitonic transport; Oxidative stress; Parkinson's disease; Quantum biology; Tauopathy; Ultraweak photon emission",,2-s2.0-85028461862

Permeability and fluid chemistry indicate significantly more reaction during the second experiment at 200 °C than the first experiment at 150 °C. Permeability decreased by a factor of 2.4 and 25 during the experiments at 150 and 200 °C, respectively. Furthermore, hydrogen and methane concentrations exceeded 600 μmol/kg and 300 μmol/kg during the 200 °C experiment, and were one and two orders of magnitude higher, respectively, than the 150 °C experiment. Fe K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure analyses of alteration minerals demonstrated Fe oxidation that occurred during the 200 °C experiment. Vibrating sample magnetometer measurements on post-experimental cores indicated little to no magnetite production, suggesting that the hydrogen was largely generated by the oxidation of iron as olivine was converted to ferric iron (Fe(III)) serpentine and/or saponite. Scanning electron microscopy images suggested secondary mineralization on the post-experimental core from the 200 °C experiment, portraying the formation of a secondary phase with a honeycomb-like texture as well as calcite and wollastonite. Scanning electron microscopy images also illustrated dissolution along linear bands through the interiors of olivine crystals, possibly along pathways with abundant fluid inclusions. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy identified Cl uptake in serpentine, while Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy suggested the formation of serpentine, saponite, and talc. However, no change was observed when comparing pre- and post-experimental X-ray computed tomography scans of the cores. Furthermore, (ultra) small angle neutron scattering datasets were collected to assess changes in porosity, surface area, and fractal characteristics of the samples over the ≈ 1 nm- to 10 μm-scale range. The results from the 200 °C post-experimental core generally fell within the range of values for the two pristine samples and the 150 °C post-experimental core that underwent negligible reaction, indicating that any change from reaction was smaller than the natural variability of the dunite. Even though there was little physical evidence of alteration, the initial stage of serpentinization at 200 °C was sufficiently significant to have a dramatic effect on flow fields in the core. Furthermore, this experiment generated significant dissolved hydrogen concentrations while simulating open system dynamics. Even though open systems prevent elevated hydrogen concentrations due to continual loss of hydrogen, we speculate that this process is responsible for stabilizing ferric Fe-rich serpentine in nature while also oxidizing more ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and cumulatively generating more hydrogen than would be possible in a closed system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","(Ultra) small angle neutron scattering ((U)SANS); Fluid-rock interaction; Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy; Hydrogen; Lost City; Permeability; Serpentinization; Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM); X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy; X-ray computed tomography (XRCT)","dunite; experimental mineralogy; FTIR spectroscopy; high temperature; hydrogen; iron; neutron scattering; olivine; permeability; physicochemical property; saponite; seawater; serpentine; serpentinization; water flow; XANES spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85026907597

We conducted a daily diary study (N = 72) to test the potential negative effects of proactivity on daily well-being. Data was collected across 3 consecutive work days. During several daily measurement occasions, participants reported proactivity, work overload, negative affect, and fatigue. They also provided 4 saliva samples per day, from which cortisol was assayed. Based on the 4 samples, a measure of daily cortisol output was produced. Multilevel analyses showed that daily proactivity was positively associated with higher daily cortisol output. The positive association of daily proactivity with bedtime fatigue was marginally significant. There was no support for a mediating effect of work overload and negative affect. Implications for theory-building on the proactivity-well-being link are discussed. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Cortisol; Diary study; Proactivity; Well-being; Workload","hydrocortisone; adult; Article; controlled study; daily life activity; fatigue; female; functional status assessment; hormone determination; human; male; measurement; priority journal; saliva level; wellbeing; workload",2-s2.0-85013101209

This connectivity depends, among other parameters, inherently on species dispersal capacities. Isolation by distance (IBD) is one of the main modes of differentiation in marine species, above all in species presenting low dispersal abilities. This study reports the genetic structuring in the tropical hydrozoan Macrorhynchia phoenicea α (sensu Postaire et al., 2016a), a brooding species, from 30 sampling sites in the Western Indian Ocean and the Tropical Southwestern Pacific, using 15 microsatellite loci. At the local scale, genet dispersal relied on asexual propagation at short distance, which was not found at larger scales. Considering one representative per clone, significant positive FIS values (from −0.327*** to 0.411***) were found within almost all sites. Gene flow was extremely low at all spatial scales, among sites within islands (&lt;10 km distance) and among islands (100 to &gt;11,000 km distance), with significant pairwise FST values (from 0.035*** to 0.645***). A general pattern of IBD was found at the Indo-Pacific scale, but also within ecoregions in the Western Indian Ocean province. Clustering and network analyses identified each island as a potential independent population, while analysis of molecular variance indicated that population genetic differentiation was significant at small (within island) and intermediate (among islands within province) spatial scales. As shown by this species, a brooding life cycle might be corollary of the high population differentiation found in some coastal marine species, thwarting regular dispersal at distances more than a few kilometers and probably leading to high cryptic diversity, each island housing independent evolutionary lineages. © 2017 The Authors.

This study presents a novel procedure to assess cultural landscape features and their cultural values in the major protected areas of Greece. After identifying a set of culturally modified land cover types and habitat types the GIS-based survey of the entire Natura 2000 protected area network in Greece (419 sites) shows that roughly 67% of protected area land cover consists of cultural landscape features. This was corroborated by the distribution of culturally modified habitat types which take up approximately 50% of the areal cover in a subset of the nation's Natura 2000 network (241 Special Areas for Conservation). Moreover, a set of 12 cultural attributes involving cultural heritage values, traditional land uses and aesthetic quality indicators were scored to assess these “cultural values” in each site. Gradient maps were produced to express an initial nation-wide site ranking profile. Heatmaps help link instead of solely rank culturally valuable sites that are in proximity to each other, showcasing site clusters of outstanding value. These analyses help define the level of “culturalness” of each site based on human-modified landscape and habitat types and provide a baseline review of cultural values in protected natural areas. This screening-level survey identifies the protected areas that may require special attention for managing cultural elements-of-diversity. Difficulties with data availability and uncertainties are reviewed. This procedure supports a paradigm shift that promotes a more holistic evaluation and management of biodiversity-centered protected areas, where until recently cultural landscapes were rarely appreciated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Applied geography; Biodiversity evaluation; Cultural heritage; Land use; Mediterranean; Natura 2000","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Land use; Surveys; Aesthetic qualities; Applied geography; Cultural heritages; Holistic evaluations; Mediterranean; Natura 2000; Natura 2000 networks; Protected natural areas; Environmental protection; biodiversity; cultural heritage; cultural landscape; environmental assessment; GIS; land cover; land use change; protected area; agricultural land; agricultural parameters; applied geography; Article; conservation biology; cultural factor; cultural landscape; exploratory research; geography; grassland; Greece; habitat structure; land use; landscape; nonhuman; thematic analysis; vegetation; Greece",2-s2.0-85016729223

Interventional cardiac MR promises to improve existing procedures and enable new ones for complex arrhythmias, as well as congenital and structural heart disease. Guiding invasive procedures demands faster image acquisition, reconstruction and analysis, as well as intuitive intraprocedural display of imaging data. Standard cardiac MR techniques such as 3D anatomical imaging, cardiac function and flow, parameter mapping, and late-gadolinium enhancement can be used to gather valuable clinical data at various procedural stages. Rapid intraprocedural image analysis can extract and highlight critical information about interventional targets and outcomes. In some cases, real-time interactive imaging is used to provide a continuous stream of images displayed to interventionalists for dynamic device navigation. Alternatively, devices are navigated relative to a roadmap of major cardiac structures generated through fast segmentation and registration. Interventional devices can be visualized and tracked throughout a procedure with specialized imaging methods. In a clinical setting, advanced imaging must be integrated with other clinical tools and patient data. In order to perform these complex procedures, interventional cardiac MR relies on customized equipment, such as interactive imaging environments, in-room image display, audio communication, hemodynamic monitoring and recording systems, and electroanatomical mapping and ablation systems. Operating in this sophisticated environment requires coordination and planning. This review provides an overview of the imaging technology used in MRI-guided cardiac interventions.

The causal factors for amyloid formation are largely unknown. Mechanisms of molecular folding and assembly of human IAPP (hIAPP) into β-sheets, oligomers and fibrils have been assessed by detailed biophysical studies of hIAPP and non-fibrillogenic, rodent IAPP (rIAPP); cytotoxicity is associated with the early phases (oligomers/multimers) of fibrillogenesis. Interaction with synthetic membranes promotes β-sheet assembly possibly via a transient α-helical molecular conformation. Cellular hIAPP cytotoxicity can be activated from intracellular or extracellular sites. In transgenic rodents overexpressing hIAPP, intracellular pro-apoptotic signals can be generated at different points in β-cell protein synthesis. Increased cellular trafficking of proIAPP, failure of the unfolded protein response (UPR) or excess trafficking of misfolded peptide via the degradation pathways can induce apoptosis; these data indicate that defects in intracellular handling of hIAPP can induce cytotoxicity. However, there is no evidence for IAPP overexpression in T2DM. Extracellular amyloidosis is directly related to the degree of β-cell apoptosis in islets in T2DM. IAPP fragments, fibrils and multimers interact with membranes causing disruption in vivo and in vitro. These findings support a role for extracellular IAPP in β-sheet conformation in cytotoxicity. Inhibitors of fibrillogenesis are useful tools to determine the aberrant mechanisms that result in hIAPP molecular refolding and islet amyloidosis. However, currently, their role as therapeutic agents remains uncertain. © 2017 The authors.","Amyloid; Apoptosis; Islet; Oligomers; Type 2 diabetes; β-sheet","amylin; amyloid plaque; amyloidosis; apoptosis; Article; autophagy; cell disruption; cell migration; conformation; conformational transition; cytoplasm; cytotoxicity; endoplasmic reticulum stress; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; protein interaction; protein misfolding; protein structure; protein synthesis; unfolded protein response",2-s2.0-85031123681

In the heart, gap junction channels electrically connect myocytes and specialized conductive tissues to coordinate the atrial and ventricular contraction/relaxation cycles and pump function. In blood vessels, these channels facilitate long-distance endothelial cell communication, synchronize smooth muscle cell contraction, and support endothelial-smooth muscle cell communication. In the central nervous system they form cellular syncytia and coordinate neural function. Gap junction channels are normally open and hemichannels are normally closed, but pathologic conditions may restrict gap junction communication and promote hemichannel opening, thereby disturbing a delicate cellular communication balance. Until recently, most connexin-targeting agents exhibited little specificity and several off-target effects. Recent work with peptide-based approaches has demonstrated improved specificity and opened avenues for a more rational approach toward independently modulating the function of gap junctions and hemichannels. We here review the role of connexins and their channels in cardiovascular and neurovascular health and disease, focusing on crucial regulatory aspects and identification of potential targets to modify their function. We conclude that peptide-based investigations have raised several new opportunities for interfering with connexins and their channels that may soon allow preservation of gap junction communication, inhibition of hemichannel opening, and mitigation of inflammatory signaling. © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.",,"calcium ion; gap junction protein; messenger RNA; peptide; peptidomimetic agent; protein GAP19; protein GAP26; protein GAP27; protein inhibitor; protein JM2; unclassified drug; Article; atherosclerosis; atrial fibrillation; brain injury; calcium cell level; carboxy terminal sequence; cardiovascular disease; cell communication; cell membrane; cerebrovascular disease; channel gating; chronic inflammation; concentration response; degenerative disease; diabetes mellitus; extracellular calcium; gap junction; gene mutation; genetic disorder; heart atrium contraction; heart hypertrophy; heart infarction; heart mitochondrion; heart protection; heart ventricle contraction; heart ventricle fibrillation; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; internalization; life cycle; membrane channel; membrane permeability; mouse model; neurologic disease; nonhuman; oculodentodigital syndrome; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein metabolism; protein phosphorylation; protein processing; reperfusion injury; restenosis; retina disease; signal transduction; spinal cord injury; thrombosis; vascular disease; vascular smooth muscle cell",2-s2.0-85029857222

However, such databases do not directly cater to the needs of breeders. Here, we have attempted to develop a web interface which combines the information from functional genomic studies across different genetic backgrounds with DNA markers so that they can be readily deployed in crop improvement. In the current version of the database, we have included drought and salinity stress studies since these two are the major abiotic stresses in rice. Results: RiceMetaSys, a user-friendly and freely available web interface provides comprehensive information on salt responsive genes (SRGs) and drought responsive genes (DRGs) across genotypes, crop development stages and tissues, identified from multiple microarray datasets. 'Physical position search' is an attractive tool for those using QTL based approach for dissecting tolerance to salt and drought stress since it can provide the list of SRGs and DRGs in any physical interval. To identify robust candidate genes for use in crop improvement, the 'common genes across varieties' search tool is useful. Graphical visualization of expression profiles across genes and rice genotypes has been enabled to facilitate the user and to make the comparisons more impactful. Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) search in the SRGs and DRGs is a valuable tool for fine mapping and marker assisted selection since it provides primers for survey of polymorphism. An external link to intron specific markers is also provided for this purpose. Bulk retrieval of data without any limit has been enabled in case of locus and SSR search. Conclusions: The aim of this database is to facilitate users with a simple and straight-forward search options for identification of robust candidate genes from among thousands of SRGs and DRGs so as to facilitate linking variation in expression profiles to variation in phenotype.

While many studies have focused on mental workload in relation to human performance, a modest body of work has examined it in a motor practice/learning context without considering individual variability. Thus, this work aimed to examine mental workload by employing the NASA TLX as well as the changes in motor performance resulting from the practice of a novel reaching task. Two groups of participants practiced a reaching task at a high and low nominal difficulty during which a group-level analysis assessed the mental workload, motor performance and motor improvement dynamics. A secondary cluster analysis was also conducted to identify specific individual patterns of cognitive-motor responses. Overall, both group- and cluster-level analyses revealed that: (i) all participants improved their performance throughout motor practice, and (ii) an increase in mental workload was associated with a reduction of the quality of motor performance along with a slower rate of motor improvement. The results are discussed in the context of the optimal challenge point framework and in particular it is proposed that under the experimental conditions employed here, functional task difficulty: (i) would possibly depend on an individuals’ information processing capabilities, and (ii) could be indexed by the level of mental workload which, when excessively heightened can decrease the quality of performance and more generally result in delayed motor improvements. © 2017 IBRO","human–machine interaction; mental workload; motor performance dynamics; motor practice; reaching movements; sensorimotor mapping",,2-s2.0-85027555566

RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) type III promoters (U6 or H1) are typically used to drive shRNA expression. While useful for some knockdown applications, the robust expression of U6/H1-driven shRNAs can induce toxicity and generate heterogeneous small RNAs with undesirable off-target effects. Additionally, typical U6/H1 promoters encompass the majority of the ∼270 base pairs (bp) of vector space required for shRNA expression. This can limit the efficacy and/or number of delivery vector options, particularly when delivery of multiple gene/shRNA combinations is required. Here, we develop a compact shRNA (cshRNA) expression system based on retroviral microRNA (miRNA) gene architecture that uses RNAP III type II promoters. We demonstrate that cshRNAs coded from as little as 100 bps of total coding space can precisely generate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are active in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We provide an algorithm with a user-friendly interface to design cshRNAs for desired target genes. This cshRNA expression system reduces the coding space required for shRNA expression by >2-fold as compared to the typical U6/H1 promoters, which may facilitate therapeutic RNAi applications where delivery vector space is limiting. © The Author(s) 2017.

Parallax scrolling allows the object displayed in the foreground to move faster than the object displayed in the background, so as to create a 3D effect.

A 2 (dimension) × 2 (modality interactivity) between-subjects (N = 295) online experiment revealed that parallax scrolling influences user engagement through two routes: the cue route (perceived coolness, perceived vividness) and the action route (natural mapping, perceived ease of use).

The theoretical contribution of the study is it examined interface feature of parallax scrolling on both user perceptions and user actions using the theory of interactive media effects (TIME).

Many technological solutions are available to collect and analyse data for cancer registries nowadays. However, the lack of a well-defined common semantic model is a problem when user-defined analyses and data linking to external resources are required. The objectives of this study are: (1) design of a semantic model for local cancer registries; (2) development of a semantically-enabled cancer registry based on this model; and (3) semantic exploitation of the cancer registry for analysing and visualising disease courses. Results: Our proposal is based on our previous results and experience working with semantic technologies. Data stored in a cancer registry database were transformed into RDF employing a process driven by OWL ontologies. The semantic representation of the data was then processed to extract semantic patient profiles, which were exploited by means of SPARQL queries to identify groups of similar patients and to analyse the disease timelines of patients. Based on the requirements analysis, we have produced a draft of an ontology that models the semantics of a local cancer registry in a pragmatic extensible way. We have implemented a Semantic Web platform that allows transforming and storing data from cancer registries in RDF. This platform also permits users to formulate incremental user-defined queries through a graphical user interface. The query results can be displayed in several customisable ways. The complex disease timelines of individual patients can be clearly represented. Different events, e.g. different therapies and disease courses, are presented according to their temporal and causal relations. Conclusion: The presented platform is an example of the parallel development of ontologies and applications that take advantage of semantic web technologies in the medical field. The semantic structure of the representation renders it easy to analyse key figures of the patients and their evolution at different granularity levels. © 2017 The Author(s).","Biomedical informatics; Cancer registry; Ontology; Semantic web",,2-s2.0-85030215358

Still, another challenge facing these systems is that they are prone to noise artifacts resulting from motion of subjects, facial expressions, talking, skin tone, and illumination variations. This paper proposes an efficient non-contact system based on a digital camera to track the cardiorespiratory signal from a number of subjects (up to six persons) at the same time with a new method for noise artifact removal. The proposed system relied on the physiological and physical effects as a result of the activity of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, such as skin color changes and head motion. Since these effects are imperceptible to the human eye and highly affected by the noise variations, we used advanced signal and video processing techniques, including developing video magnification technique, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, and canonical correlation analysis to extract the heart rate and respiratory rate from multiple subjects under the noise artifact assumptions.

This enhanced electrospinnability was found to be mainly due to the highly increased conductivity of the plasma-modified PCL solutions. Consequently, more stretching of the polymer jet occurred during electrospinning, leading to the generation of bead-free fibers. Plasma treatment also results in an increased viscosity and decreased pH values. To explain these observed changes, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) has been used to examine the excited species present in the APPJ in contact with the PCL solution. This study revealed that the peaks attributed to H, CH, CH2, and C2 species could be responsible for the degradation of solvent molecules and/or PCL structures during the plasma treatment. Size exclusion chromatography and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that the molecular weight and the chemical composition of PCL were not significantly affected by the APPJ treatment. Plasma exposure mainly results in the degradation of the solvent molecules instead of modifying the PCL macromolecules, preserving the original polymer as much as possible. A hypothesis for the observed macroscopic changes in viscosity and pH values could be the generation of new chemical species such as HCl and/or HNO3. These species are characterized by their high conductivity, low pH values, and strong polarity and could enhance the solvent quality for PCL, leading to the expansion of the polymer coil, which could in turn explain the observed enhanced viscosity after plasma modification. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","APPJ; argon plasma; electrospinning; nanofibers; plasma-liquid interactions; polymer solution; surface morphology","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric pressure; Chromatography; Electrospinning; Fighter aircraft; Molecules; Nanofibers; Nitric acid; Optical emission spectroscopy; pH; Plasma applications; Plasma jets; Polymer solutions; Size exclusion chromatography; Solvents; Spinning (fibers); Surface morphology; Viscosity; APPJ; Argon plasmas; Atmospheric pressure plasma jets; Chemical compositions; N ,N-Dimethylformamide; Optical emission spectroscopies (OES); Plasma liquid; Plasma modifications; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85030157898

BiOI thin films are grown by chemical vapor transport and found to maintain the same tetragonal phase in ambient air for at least 197 d. The computations suggest BiOI to be tolerant to antisite and vacancy defects. All-inorganic solar cells (ITO|NiOx|BiOI|ZnO|Al) with negligible hysteresis and up to 80% external quantum efficiency under select monochromatic excitation are demonstrated. The short-circuit current densities and power conversion efficiencies under AM 1.5G illumination are nearly double those of previously reported BiOI solar cells, as well as other bismuth halide and chalcohalide photovoltaics recently explored by many groups. Through a detailed loss analysis using optical characterization, photoemission spectroscopy, and device modeling, direction for future improvements in efficiency is provided.

These prototypes are designed to be code-free, throwaway prototypes, and functionality cannot be added to them. The only functionality supported is the ability to link screens for simulation purposes. An existing feature of the mobile prototyping tool, Proto.io, was extended to support the use of selected Material Design Pattern Library patterns to generate prototype templates. A parser was written to convert these prototype templates, exported from Proto.io in HTML format, into Android-compatible XML that could be imported into the Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), for further development. A user study was conducted to compare the two different approaches for creating a mobile application: creating the mobile application entirely in Android Studio, or using the extended version of Proto.io for designing the mobile UI, and importing the generated XML into Android Studio for further development. These two approaches were compared in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction, as evaluated by several designers.

A shooting genre game was developed, and a task was included during development to simulate gaming actions with moving targets. Data for four efficiency metrics was gathered during two phases of user testing. The low sensitivity setting resulted in the fastest gameplay for users without disabilities, which contradicted research results from studies focusing on individuals with disabilities. It was also found that the amount of neck fatigue decreased after several sessions for users without disabilities. The efficient use of the head mouse by individuals without disabilities showed significant improvement over time for certain elements, indicating that learning took place.

Currently, there is no way to reliably reduce the number of datasets to a smaller, more manageable number without risking discarding potentially good matches. A neural network that estimates the appropriateness of HRTF datasets based on input vectors of anthropometric measurements is proposed. The shapes and sizes of listeners' heads and pinnas were measured using digital photography; the measured anthropometric parameters form the feature vectors used by the neural network. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for participants to listen to music transformed using different HRTFs and to evaluate the fitness of each HRTF dataset. The listening scores recorded were the target outputs used to train the neural networks. The aim was to learn a mapping between anthropometric parameters and listener's perception scores.

In this paper, we demonstrate that an initiative designed to recognize usability as its core function plays a critical role in the use and adoption of M-health interventions in rural communities. Two versions of an M-health intervention were developed and two interface design principles that may have an impact on users’ emotions applied, namely affective design and anthropomorphism. Using the Sethakeng rural community in the Northern Cape (South Africa) as the case study, we were able to determine the extent to which both anthropomorphism and affective design influence the adoption of an M-Health application.

The influence of the morphology on the charge transport is particularly pronounced, due to the confined monolayer of 2D-Ï€-stacked organic semiconductor molecules. The morphology, in turn, is governed by relatively weak van-der-Waals interactions and is thus prone to dynamic structural fluctuations. Accordingly, combining electronic and physical characterization and time-averaged X-ray analyses with the dynamic information available at atomic resolution from simulations allows us to characterize self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based devices in great detail. For this purpose, we have constructed transistors based on SAMs of two molecules that consist of the organic p-type semiconductor benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (BTBT), linked to a C11 or C12 alkylphosphonic acid.

The assessment of molecular interactions is often based on knowledge derived from statistics on structural data. Within the last years, the available data in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank has increased dramatically, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. This development allows the derivation of enhanced interaction models and motivates new ways of data analysis. Here, we present a method to facilitate the analysis of noncovalent interactions enabling detailed insights into the nature of molecular interactions. The method is integrated into a highly variable framework enabling the adaption to user-specific requirements. NAOMInova, the user interface for our method, allows the generation of specific statistics with respect to the chemical environment of substructures. The substructures as well as the analyzed set of protein structures can be chosen arbitrarily. Although NAOMInova was primarily made for data exploration in protein-ligand crystal structures, it can be used in combination with any structure collection, for example, analysis of a carbonyl in the neighborhood of an aromatic ring on a set of structures resulting from a MD simulation. Additionally, a filter for different atom attributes can be applied including the experimental support by electron density for single atoms.

In this study, we present mechanochromic luminescent molecules that can provide clear color changes with constant emission intensity during phase transitions.

According to this mechanism, we designed a complex with a fused ligand to preserve the enhanced emission in the aggregated state in the AIE during phase transitions between the solution, amorphous, and crystalline states. From optical measurements, it was shown that the synthesized boron complexes present bright emission in various phases. In particular, as we expected, the luminescence color was clearly altered during phase transition, whereas the emission intensity changed only slightly. Finally, we also found that diverse luminescence colors were obtained from each polymorph and for various substituents as induced by the substituent effect.

Ten DESs were screened using the COSMO-RS approach by predicting the activity coefficient at infinite dilution, γ∞ of ethanol and n-alkanes in each DES. Then, three DESs were selected for experimental validation where Tetrabutylammonium bromide/Levulinic acid (TBAB/LA) with a molar ratio (1:2) gave the best extractive performance for all systems. Ternary liquid-liquid extraction experiments were conducted at room temperature with this DES. It was found that the tie-lines of all systems have positive slopes, indicating that a small amount of solvent is required to extract ethanol.

However, only a limited number of investigations have so far been conducted into communication between self-driving cars and pedestrians. For example, when a pedestrian is about to cross a street, that pedestrian needs to know the intension of the approaching self-driving car. In the present study, we designed a novel interface known as ""Eyes on a Car"" to address this problem. We added eyes onto a car so as to establish eye contact communication between that car and pedestrians. The car looks at the pedestrian in order to indicate its intention to stop. This novel interface design was evaluated via a virtual reality (VR) simulated environment featuring a street-crossing scenario. The evaluation results show that pedestrians can make the correct street-crossing decision more quickly if the approaching car has the novel interface ""eyes"" than in the case of normal cars. In addition, the results show that pedestrians feel safer with regard to crossing a street if the approaching car has eyes and if the eyes look at them. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Autonomous Cars; Eye Contact; Interface Design; Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Communication; Virtual Reality","User interfaces; Virtual reality; Autonomous car; Evaluation results; Eye contact; Interface designs; Self drivings; Simulated environment; Street crossing; Vehicle to vehicle communications",2-s2.0-85032497010

Hence, we've developed the Hotzenplotz interface, combining possibility-driven design with psychological user needs.

Our results confirm that pure AD is significantly less able to satisfy user needs compared to manual driving and make people feeling bored/out of control. In contrast, the Hotzenplotz interface has proven to reduce the negative effects of AD.

This combination creates a barrier when we want to integrate processing engines written in a language that compiles down to machine code with a JVM-based big data analytics ecosystem. In this paper, we investigate efficient ways of executing UDFs written in Java inside a data processing engine written in C++. While it is possible to call Java code from machine code via the Java Native Interface (JNI), a naive implementation that applies the UDF one row at a time incurs a significant overhead, up to an order of magnitude. Instead, we can significantly reduce the costs of JNI calls and data copies between Java and machine code, if we execute UDFs on batches of rows, and reuse input/output buffers when possible. Our evaluation of these techniques using different scalar UDFs, in a prototype system that combines Spark and a columnar data processing engine written in C++, shows that such a combination does not slow down the execution of SparkSQL queries containing such UDFs. In fact, we find that the execution of Java UDFs inside an embedded JVM in our C++ engine is 1.12× to 1.53× faster than executing in Spark alone. Our analysis also shows that compiling Java UDFs directly into machine code is not always beneficial over strided execution in the JVM. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Data management systems; User-defined functions","C++ (programming language); Cloud computing; Codes (symbols); Data handling; Engines; Information management; Java programming language; Data analytics; Data management system; Java Native Interfaces; Java virtual machines; Processing engine; Programming interface; Prototype system; User Defined Functions; Big data",2-s2.0-85032453846

Results showed that haptic cues on steering wheel at TOR reassure drivers of their decisions rather than assisting them in decision making, and overall workload ratings are decreased using vibration cues.

This study proposed two metrics for displaying this information to the driver: automation reliability (AR), a system-centric metric; and required driver engagement (RDE), a human-centric metric. Visual displays were developed in three levels for each metric: quantitative, qualitative, and representational. Participants sorted these displays for level of AR and RDE, and rated their preference. Results showed AR displays were matched more accurately than RDE displays.

Modern sNICs have fully programmable, energy-efficient multi-core processors on which many packet processing functions, including a full-blown programmable switch, can run. However, having multiple switch instances deployed across the host hypervisor and the attached sNICs makes controlling them difficult and data plane operations more complex. This paper proposes a generalized SDN-controlled NF offload architecture called UNO. It can transparently offload dynamically selected host processors' packet processing functions to sNICs by using multiple switches in the host while keeping the data centerwide network control and management planes unmodified. UNO exposes a single virtual control plane to the SDN controller and hides dynamic NF offload behind a unified virtual management plane. This enables UNO to make optimal use of host's and sNIC's combined packet processing capabilities with local optimization based on locally observed traffic patterns and resource consumption, and without central controller involvement. Experimental results based on a real UNO prototype in realistic scenarios showpromising results: it can save processing worth up to 8 CPU cores, reduce power usage by up to 2x, and reduce the control plane overhead by more than 50%.","Networking and SDNs; Virtualization and containers","Cloud computing; Controllers; Energy efficiency; Interfaces (computer); Negative impedance converters; Packet switching; Fully programmables; Local optimizations; Multi-core processor; Networking and SDNs; Packet processing functions; Programmable switches; Realistic scenario; Resource consumption; Information management",2-s2.0-85032441066

However, their interface differs dramatically from those of news sites. On SNS, news posts lack the traditional news cues that guide audience selection of stories. Instead, they are accompanied by social cues, traces of engagement by other users with news items. This process is known as the socialization of news. This study sought to test the effect of the socialization of news on users’ attention and selection processes. By means of an experimental design employing eye-tracking measurements (N = 86), the study (1) asked whether the existence of various social cues of endorsement (user comments, ‘Likes’, and ‘Reactions’) influenced attention and selection; (2) explored how users divided their attention between news information and social cues, and whether social endorsement affected the attention given by users to news cues; (3) identified differences among users regarding their sensitivity to social endorsement (relying on two psychological traits: self-monitoring and need for cognition). The findings demonstrate that social cues have some effect on attention and selection processes; however, users varied significantly in their response to social endorsement, both in terms of attention and selection. Together, the findings suggest that the socialization of news has changed news consumption processes, and that the consumption of news on SNS might require the development of a new theoretical approach to the consumption of news. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","attention; eye tracking; Facebook; news consumption; social cues",,2-s2.0-85030173299

Burst buffers are commonly located between parallel file systems and compute nodes, handling bursty I/Os in the middle. In this architecture, burst buffers are shared resources. The performance of an SSD is significantly reduced when it is used excessively because of garbage collection, and we have observed that SSDs in a burst buffer become slow when many users simultaneously use the burst buffer. To mitigate the performance problem, we propose a new user-level I/O isolation framework in a High-Performance Computing environment using a multi-streamed SSD. The multi-streamed SSD allocates the same flash block for I/Os in the same stream. We assign a different stream to each user; thus, the user can use the stream exclusively. To evaluate the performance, we have used open-source supercomputing workloads and I/O traces from real workloads in the Cori supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. Via user-level I/O isolation, we have obtained up to a 125% performance improvement in terms of I/O throughput. In addition, our approach reduces the write amplification in the SSDs, leading to improved SSD endurance.

Analysis of signal tracks requires complex computational methods, which often make the analysts focus too much on the detailed computational steps rather than on their biological questions. Results: Here we propose Signal Track Query Language (STQL) for simple analysis of signal tracks. It is a Structured Query Language (SQL)-like declarative language, which means one only specifies what computations need to be done but not how these computations are to be carried out. STQL provides a rich set of constructs for manipulating genomic intervals and their values. To run STQL queries, we have developed the Signal Track Analytical Research Tool (START, http://yiplab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/start/ ), a system that includes a Web-based user interface and a back-end execution system. The user interface helps users select data from our database of around 10,000 commonly-used public signal tracks, manage their own tracks, and construct, store and share STQL queries. The back-end system automatically translates STQL queries into optimized low-level programs and runs them on a computer cluster in parallel. We use STQL to perform 14 representative analytical tasks. By repeating these analyses using bedtools, Galaxy and custom Python scripts, we show that the STQL solution is usually the simplest, and the parallel execution achieves significant speed-up with large data files. Finally, we describe how a biologist with minimal formal training in computer programming self-learned STQL to analyze DNA methylation data we produced from 60 pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples.

In this paper, we propose a fast, accurate, flexible and user-friendly tool, Mira, for generating performance models by applying static program analysis, targeting scientific applications running on supercomputers. We parse both the source code and binary to estimate performance attributes with better accuracy than considering just source or just binary code. Because our analysis is static, the target program does not need to be executed on the target architecture, which enables users to perform analysis on available machines instead of conducting expensive experiments on potentially expensive resources. Moreover, statically generated models enable performance prediction on nonexistent or unavailable architectures. In addition to flexibility, because model generation time is significantly reduced compared to dynamic analysis approaches, our method is suitable for rapid application performance analysis and improvement. We present empirical validation results to demonstrate the current capabilities of our approach on small benchmarks and a mini application. © 2017 IEEE.","Performance; Polyhedral model; Static analysis","Application programs; Bins; Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Computer programming; Software design; Static analysis; Supercomputers; Application performance; Performance; Performance prediction; Polyhedral modeling; Scientific applications; Static performance analysis; Static program analysis; Target architectures; Benchmarking",2-s2.0-85032638239

Working on a kernel or mini-App in the place of the original application can dramatically reduce the resources and effort required for performing software tasks such as performance optimization and porting to new platforms. However, using kernel as a proxy is based on the assumption that it represents the original application in the context of how it is being used. In this paper, we introduce an extension to the Fortran Kernel Generator (KGen) which is an automated kernel extraction tool [1]. The extension allows comparison of the execution characteristics between the original application and the generated kernel using descriptive statistics. From the comparison, the user is provided with statistics that provide information on the degree and context of representativeness of the kernel. KGen also utilizes the information generated to help it to automatically improve representativeness of the kernels whilst reducing the size of the workload generated. We applied this extension to three kernels. One is generated from a Fortran scientific library and the remaining two are generated from an earth system model. We have demonstrated that the descriptive statistics provided in the enhancement provide not only quantitative metrics and context of representativeness but also a way to improve the quality of representativeness of the kernels generated. © 2017 IEEE.","Automated kernel extraction; Codesign; Descriptive statistics; Kernel; Python; Representativeness","Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Extraction; FORTRAN (programming language); Statistics; Co-designs; Descriptive statistics; Kernel; Python; Representativeness; Application programs",2-s2.0-85032627752

This cognitive load is even greater in cases of cognitively demanding tasks as the ones typical for RE activities.

Thus, it becomes difficult for them to be utilized and their value is lost over time. Ideally, metadata should be managed along with its corresponding data by a single storage system, and can be accessed and updated directly. However, existing storage systems in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, such as Lustre parallel file system, still use a static metadata structure composed of non-extensible and fixed amount of information. The burden of metadata management falls upon the end-users and require ad-hoc metadata management software to be developed.With the advent of 'object-centric' storage systems, there is an opportunity to solve this issue. In this paper, we present SoMeta, a scalable and decentralized metadata management approach for object-centric storage in HPC systems. It provides a flat namespace that is dynamically partitioned, a tagging approach to manage metadata that can be efficiently searched and updated, and a light-weight and fault tolerant management strategy. In our experiments, SoMeta achieves up to 3.7X speedup over Lustre in performing common metadata operations, and up to 16X faster than SciDB and MongoDB for advanced metadata operations, such as adding and searching tags.

With the increasingly large number of cores on each node, applications spend a significant portion of their execution time in intra-node communication. While shared memory is commonly used for intra-node communication, it needs to copy each message once at the sender and once at the receiver side. Kernel-Assisted mechanisms transfer a message using a single copy but suffer from significant contention with a large number of concurrent accesses. Consequently, naively using Kernel-Assisted copy techniques in collectives can lead to severe performance degradation.

The performance of these programming models increasingly rely on how fast their runtime schedulers do their job. The more delay a scheduler incurs in matching a ready task to a free processor core at any point in time, the more impact it causes to the program's parallel execution. We have developed a tool that is able to detect these delayed intervals caused by the scheduler in a parallel execution, and spot them specifically on two kinds of visualizations: The logical task graph captured at runtime (DAG visualizations) and time-series visualizations of threads (timelines). By further analyzing positions of these delays on those visualizations the tool could identify possible scheduling issues in the scheduler that causes these delays, yielding improvement insights for the development of task parallel programming models. From an application programmer's perspective, our tool is useful by being able to contrast differences of various task parallel programming models executing the same program, helping users choose the right model for their application. We demonstrate that usefulness by using the tool to analyze 10 applications in BOTS benchmark suite in our case studies. © 2017 IEEE.","Performance analysis; Runtime scheduler; Scalability factors; Scheduling delay; Task parallel","Application programs; Benchmarking; Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Parallel programming; Program processors; Visualization; Application programmers; Benchmark suites; Parallel executions; Performance analysis; Programming models; Runtimes; Task parallel; Time series visualization; Scheduling",2-s2.0-85032626353

However, high structural similarities between the wild-type and mutant SOD1 proteins limit the utility of this approach. Here we addressed this challenge by converting a promiscuous natural human IgG-binding domain, the hyperthermophilic variant of protein G (HTB1), into a highly specific aggregation inhibitor (designated HTB1M) of two familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis–linked SOD1 mutants, SOD1G93A and SOD1G85R. We utilized a computational algorithm for mapping protein surfaces predisposed to HTB1 intermolecular interactions to construct a focused HTB1 library, complemented with an experimental platform based on yeast surface display for affinity and specificity screening. HTB1M displayed high binding specificity toward SOD1 mutants, inhibited their amyloid aggregation in vitro, prevented the accumulation of misfolded proteins in living cells, and reduced the cytotoxicity of SOD1G93A expressed in motor neuron–like cells. Competition assays and molecular docking simulations suggested that HTB1M binds to SOD1 via both its -helical and -sheet domains at the native dimer interface that becomes exposed upon mutated SOD1 misfolding and monomerization. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational mapping of the protein–protein interaction potential for designing focused protein libraries to be used in directed evolution. They also provide new insight into the mechanism of conversion of broad-spectrum immunoglobulin-binding proteins, such as HTB1, into target-specific proteins, thereby paving the way for the development of new selective drugs targeting the amyloidogenic proteins implicated in a variety of human diseases. © 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Bins; Diagnosis; Dimers; Enzymes; Mapping; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurons; Oxygen; Aggregation inhibitors; Amyloidogenic proteins; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Computational algorithm; Intermolecular interactions; Mapping protein surfaces; Molecular docking simulations; Yeast surface displays; Proteins; amyloid; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; hyperthermophilic variant of protein G; immunoglobulin G; oxidoreductase inhibitor; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; enzyme inhibitor; protein aggregate; algorithm; alpha helix; Article; beta sheet; binding affinity; binding competition; binding site; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug protein binding; enzyme inhibition; in vitro study; molecular docking; molecular interaction; peptide mapping; priority journal; protein aggregation; protein misfolding; protein protein interaction; simulation; amino acid sequence; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell line; chemistry; cytology; cytosol; drug effects; genetics; metabolism; molecular docking; mouse; mutation; nerve cell; protein folding; tumor cell line; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytosol; Enzyme Inhibitors; Mice; Molecular Docking Simulation; Mutation; Neurons; Protein Aggregates; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Conformation, beta-Strand; Protein Folding; Superoxide Dismutase-1",2-s2.0-85029753054

To make use of this potential, an essential technique to increase the parallelism of a program is to parallelize loops. However, a main restriction of available tools for automatic loop parallelization is that the loops often have to be 'polyhedral' and that it is, e.g., not allowed to call functions from within the loops.In this paper, we present a seemingly simple extension to the C programming language which marks functions without side-effects. These functions can then basically be ignored when checking the parallelization opportunities for polyhedral loops. We extended the GCC compiler toolchain accordingly and evaluated several real-world applications showing that our extension helps to identify additional parallelization chances and, thus, to significantly enhance the performance of applications. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Parallel processing systems; Automatic Parallelization; Loop parallelization; Parallel task; Parallelizations; Processor performance; Real-world; Side effect; C (programming language)",2-s2.0-85032621016

It is known, however, that in these regions standard modeling has a tendency to overpredict the solid and gas temperatures and the mixing rates of the gaseous species released from the packed-bed. This leads to an underprediction of the unburned hydrocarbon and soot concentrations in these regions, originating incorrect estimates of the pollutant emissions. Due to more and more stringent legislation, the combustion appliances need to improve their designs, for which deeper studies of the near-bed region modeling are necessary. This study seeks to find the main causes for the temperature and gaseous species misprediction in this region. Current biomass combustion models represent the gas-solid interaction by means of a porous medium, impeding the representation of the streaks with nonperfect mixed species that are known to be present. The modeling of gas-phase reactions with the standard eddy dissipation model is not suitable to account for complex chemical mechanisms and the weakened turbulent region created above the bed, despite its computational robustness and cost being highly appreciated. This work presents the first step toward the formulation of a modified Magnussen parameter (A), so the reaction rate resulting will reach a better physical modeling under transient packed-bed conditions, recovering the original value proposed for the Magnussen constant.

In this paper, we enable SDN with QoS guaranteed abilities, which could provide end-to-end QoS routing for each cloud user service. First of all, we implement an application identification technique on SDN controller to determine required QoS levels for each application type. Then, we implement a queue scheduling technique on SDN switch. It queues the application flows into different queues and schedules the flows out of the queues with different priorities. At last, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SDN-based QoS technique through both theoretical and experimental analysis. Theoretical analysis shows that our methods can provide differentiated services for the application flows mapped to different QoS levels.

In recent years the advanced utilization of mathematical modeling has been an important part of the regulatory review process. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models identify the need to conduct specific clinical studies, suggest specific study designs and propose appropriate labeling language. Their application allows the evaluation of the influence of intrinsic (e.g., age, gender, genetics, disease) and extrinsic [e.g., dosing schedule, drug-drug interactions (DDIs)] factors, alone or in combinations, on drug exposure and therefore provides accurate population assessment.

Mechanistic mathematical model-informed safety evaluation, with a focus on drug potential for causing arrhythmias, is now discussed as an element of the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay. One of the pillars of this paradigm is the use of an in silico model of the adult human ventricular cardiomyocyte to integrate in vitro measured data.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have been proposed in closed-loop applications for neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation. This study describes the impact of different feedback modalities on the performance of an EEG-based BMI that decodes motor imagery (MI) of leg flexion and extension. Approach. We executed experiments in a lower-limb gait trainer (the legoPress) where nine able-bodied subjects participated in three consecutive sessions based on a crossover design. A random forest classifier was trained from the offline session and tested online with visual and proprioceptive feedback, respectively. Post-hoc classification was conducted to assess the impact of feedback modalities and learning effect (an improvement over time) on the simulated trial-based performance. Finally, we performed feature analysis to investigate the discriminant power and brain pattern modulations across the subjects. Main results. (i) For real-time classification, the average accuracy was % and % for the two online sessions. The results were significantly higher than chance level, demonstrating the feasibility to distinguish between MI of leg extension and flexion. (ii) For post-hoc classification, the performance with proprioceptive feedback (%) was significantly better than with visual feedback (%), while there was no significant learning effect. (iii) We reported individual discriminate features and brain patterns associated to each feedback modality, which exhibited differences between the two modalities although no general conclusion can be drawn. Significance. The study reported a closed-loop brain-controlled gait trainer, as a proof of concept for neurorehabilitation devices. We reported the feasibility of decoding lower-limb movement in an intuitive and natural way. As far as we know, this is the first online study discussing the role of feedback modalities in lower-limb MI decoding. Our results suggest that proprioceptive feedback has an advantage over visual feedback, which could be used to improve robot-assisted strategies for motor training and functional recovery. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","brain-machine interface (BMI); electroencephalography (EEG); lower-limb rehabilitation; proprioceptive feedback","Brain computer interface; Decision trees; Decoding; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Visual communication; Visual servoing; Brain machine interface; Brain machine interface (BMIs); Closed loop applications; Discriminant power; Functional recovery; Lower limb; Neurorehabilitation; Random forest classifier; Feedback; accuracy; adult; Article; brain computer interface; classification; classifier; electroencephalograph electrode; electroencephalography; female; gait; human; human experiment; limb movement; male; normal human; priority journal; proprioceptive feedback; random forest; visual feedback; young adult",2-s2.0-85029836175

Previous reports have shown that, while organic modifiers integration between the layered mineral silicates leads to nanoclays with different degrees of hydrophobicity that become easily miscible in polymers, they could also pose possible effects at inhalation or ingestion routes of exposure. Through a systematic analysis of three organically modified and one pristine nanoclay, we aimed to relate for the first time the physical and chemical characteristics, determined via microscopical and spectroscopical techniques, with the potential of these nanoclays to induce deleterious effects in in vitro cellular systems, i.e. in immortalized and primary human lung epithelial cell lines. To derive information on how functionalization could lead to toxicological profiles throughout nanoclays' life cycle, both as-received and thermally degraded nanoclays were evaluated. Our analysis showed that the organic modifiers chemical composition influenced both the physical and chemical characteristics of the nanoclays as well as their toxicity. Overall, when cells were exposed to nanoclays with organic modifiers containing bioreactive groups, they displayed lower cellular numbers as well more elongated cellular morphologies relative to the pristine nanoclay and the nanoclay containing a modifier with long carbon chains. Additionally, thermal degradation caused loss of the organic modifiers as well as changes in size and shape of the nanoclays, which led to changes in toxicity upon exposure to our model cellular systems. Our study provides insight into the synergistic effects of chemical composition, size, and shape of the nanoclays and their toxicological profiles in conditions that mimic exposure in manufacturing and disposal environments, respectively, and can help aid in safe-by-design manufacturing of nanoclays with user-controlled functionalization and lower toxicity levels when food packaging applications are considered. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","human lung epithelial cell; life cycle; nanoclay; organic modifier; safe-by-design manufacturing; toxicity","Biological organs; Biomechanics; Biomedical equipment; Carbon; Cell culture; Cells; Cellular telephone systems; Chemical analysis; Degradation; Functional food; Life cycle; Manufacture; Mobile telecommunication systems; Nanocomposites; Organic polymers; Packaging machines; Packaging materials; Respiratory system; Silicates; Toxicity; Chemical compositions; Food-packaging materials; Human lung; Model cellular systems; Nano clays; Organic modifier; Physical and chemical characteristics; Physical and chemical properties; Nanostructured materials",2-s2.0-85029711786

We found that this excellent performance results from the following features of the film's structural and material design: (1) the sandwiched structure allows the film to switch from a three-dimensional to a two-dimensional in-plane deformation and (2) the stiffness of the SWCNT film is decreased by introducing microcracks that make deformation easy and that promote the macroscopic piezoresistive behavior of SWCNT crack islands and the microscopic piezoresistive behavior of SWCNT bundles.

In this work, a combination of physical and chemical micropatterns, formed on acrylate polymers, are used to direct the growth of primary spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the inner ear neurons. Utilizing the inherent temporal and spatial control of photopolymerization, physical microgrooves are fabricated using a photomask in a single step process. Biochemical patterns are generated by adsorbing laminin, a cell adhesion protein, to acrylate polymer surfaces followed by irradiation through a photomask with UV light to deactivate protein in exposed areas and generate parallel biochemical patterns. Laminin deactivation was shown increase as a function of UV light exposure while remaining adsorbed to the polymer surface. SGN neurites show alignment to both biochemical and physical patterns when evaluated individually. Competing biochemical and physical patterns were also examined. The relative guiding strength of physical cues was varied by independently changing both the amplitude and the band spacing of the microgrooves, with higher amplitudes and shorter band spacing providing cues that more effective guide neurite growth. SGN neurites aligned to laminin patterns with lower physical pattern amplitude and thus weaker physical cues. Alignment of SGNs shifted toward the physical pattern with higher amplitude and lower periodicity patterns which represent stronger cues. These results demonstrate the ability of photopolymerized microfeatures to modulate alignment of inner ear neurites even in the presence of conflicting physical and biochemical cues laying the groundwork for next generation cochlear implants and neural prosthetic devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","micropatterning; nerve guide; neural prosthesis; photopolymerization; protein pattern; spiral ganglion neuron; surface topography","Alignment; Cell adhesion; Cochlear implants; Neural prostheses; Photomasks; Photopolymerization; Polymeric implants; Prosthetics; Proteins; Surface topography; Cell-adhesion proteins; Cochlear implant (CIs); Micro patterning; Nerve guide; Protein patterns; Spiral ganglion neurons; Stimulating electrodes; Topographical features; Neurons",2-s2.0-85029707365

The viability of Si nanowires (NWs) as the active material for ν-NWFETs in HNN is explored through modeling and demonstrated by fabricating the first device. Using ν-NWFETs to realize HNNs is an interesting approach as by printing NWs on large area flexible substrates it will be possible to develop a bendable tactile skin with distributed neural elements (for local data processing, as in biological skin) in the backplane. The modeling and simulation of ν-NWFET based devices show that the overlapping areas between individual gates and the floating gate determines the initial synaptic weights of the neural network - thus validating the working of ν-NWFETs as the building block for HNN. The simulation has been further extended to ν-NWFET based circuits and neuronal computation system and this has been validated by interfacing it with a transparent tactile skin prototype (comprising of 6 × 6 ITO based capacitive tactile sensors array) integrated on the palm of a 3D printed robotic hand. In this regard, a tactile data coding system is presented to detect touch gesture and the direction of touch. Following these simulation studies, a four-gated ν-NWFET is fabricated with Pt/Ti metal stack for gates, source and drain, Ni floating gate, and Al2O3 high-k dielectric layer. The current-voltage characteristics of fabricated ν-NWFET devices confirm the dependence of turn-off voltages on the (synaptic) weight of each gate.

Diffusion studies with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and bulk release with the model protein fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin show that encapsulated protein molecules can be released in a sustained fashion from the hydrogel over a considerable period of time (30 d). Moreover, by modulating the porosity of the hydrogel by the simple addition of salt, the encapsulated protein molecules can be retained for a longer period of time within the hydrogel. Mesenchymal stem cells, when cultured in 3D amyloid hydrogels with growth factors fibroblast growth factor 8 and sonic hedgehog, show more neuron specific differentiation as compared to hydrogel alone.

Over the last years, most companies have focused on questions regarding the evaluation and implementation of methods for virtual testing. However, it has become more and more important to seamlessly integrate virtual testing into the overall development process. For instance, a company’s test strategy might stipulate a combination of different methods, such as SIL and HIL simulation, in order to benefit from the advantages of both in the same test process. In this case, efforts concentrate on the optimization of the overall process, from test specification to test execution, as well as the test result evaluation and its alignment with methods for virtual testing. Furthermore, software tools have to be suitable for virtual testing and the entire tool chain has to be adaptable so it can be used for different test methods for various applications that have different users. This paper introduces an exemplary validation and verification process according to ARP4754A and describes how virtual testing contributes to a more efficient overall development process. The ARINC 653 software architecture serves as an example for demonstrating the benefits of using different virtual test environments.

This approach advantage is that it uses an exact algorithm, that guarantees the optimal solution given the inputs provided by the user. The formulation shows how the technical value of an IVHM solution can be evaluated taking into account key aspects for aerospace platforms such as weight, reliability and bus capacity restrictions through a linear integer programming model solved using the branch-and-bound method.

In addition, governments are under intense scrutiny to provide security, yet they must also strive for efficiency and reduce spending. In other words, they must do more with less. Virtual simulation, is usually employed to solve these limitations. As the operator is trained to maximize weapon effectiveness, the effectiveness-focused training can be completed in an economical manner. Unfortunately, the training is completed in limited scenarios without objective levels of training factors for an individual operator to optimize the weapon effectiveness. Thus, the training will not be effective. For overcoming this problem, we suggest a methodology on guiding effectiveness-focused training of the weapon operator through usability assessments, big data, and Virtual and Constructive (VC) simulations. Usability assessments will be done to identify human factors affecting weapon’s effectiveness. Usability assessments consist of data-driven and judgment-driven analytics. The first is generated from raw simulation log files to evaluate the participant’s level of skill. The latter is generated from questionnaires, and evaluates the user’s background, experience, and opinions about various interactions within the simulation. The human factors must be found out based on several situations to reduce bias. VC simulations are executed under a variety of scenarios, and then, big data are generated such as structured, unstructured, semi-structured types. The big data, including completed questionnaires, are stored in a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and analyzed with processing via MapReduce, followed by an analytics tool. We can discover important human factors influencing weapon effectiveness, along with optimal values for these factors, which can be a guideline for effectiveness-focused training of the individual weapon operator.

The competitive inhibition of O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (OASS) by the C-terminus of serine acetyltransferase (SAT) presents a paradox, because the C-terminus of SAT binds to the active site of OASS with an affinity that is 4-6 log-fold (104-106) greater than that of the substrate. Therefore, we employed multiple approaches to understand how the substrate gains access to the OASS active site under physiological conditions. Single-molecule and ensemble approaches showed that the active site-bound high-affinity competitive inhibitor is actively dissociated by the substrate, which is not consistent with classical views of competitive antagonism. We employed fast-flow kinetic approaches to demonstrate that substrate-mediated dissociation of full length SAT-OASS (cysteine regulatory complex) follows a noncanonical ""facilitated dissociation"" mechanism. To understand the mechanism by which the substrate induces inhibitor dissociation, we resolved the crystal structures of enzyme·inhibitor·substrate ternary complexes. Crystal structures reveal a competitive allosteric binding mechanism in which the substrate intrudes into the inhibitor-bound active site and disengages the inhibitor before occupying the site vacated by the inhibitor. In summary, here we reveal a new type of competitive allosteric binding mechanism by which one of the competitive antagonists facilitates the dissociation of the other. Together, our results indicate that ""competitive allostery"" is the general feature of noncanonical ""facilitated/accelerated dissociation"" mechanisms. Further understanding of the mechanistic framework of ""competitive allosteric"" mechanism may allow us to design a new family of ""competitive allosteric drugs/small molecules"" that will have improved selectivity and specificity as compared to their competitive and allosteric counterparts. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acids; Bins; Molecules; Binding mechanisms; Competitive inhibition; Ensemble approaches; Inhibitor dissociation; O-acetyl serines; Physiological condition; Regulatory complexes; Serine acetyltransferase; Dissociation; cysteine; cysteine synthase; enzyme inhibitor; serine acetyltransferase; acetyl coenzyme A; alanine; bacterial protein; cysteine synthase; dehydroalanine; enzyme inhibitor; ligand; oligopeptide; peptide fragment; recombinant protein; serine; serine acetyltransferase; allosterism; alpha helix; amino terminal sequence; Article; beta sheet; binding affinity; binding competition; controlled study; crystal structure; dissociation; enzyme active site; enzyme inhibition; enzyme substrate complex; flow kinetics; nonhuman; priority journal; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; surface plasmon resonance; thermodynamics; allosterism; analogs and derivatives; antagonists and inhibitors; binding competition; binding site; chemistry; conformation; enzyme active site; enzymology; genetics; Haemophilus influenzae; kinetics; metabolism; molecular model; protein domain; Salmonella enterica; validation study; X ray crystallography; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Alanine; Allosteric Regulation; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Binding, Competitive; Catalytic Domain; Crystallography, X-Ray; Cysteine Synthase; Enzyme Inhibitors; Haemophilus influenzae; Kinetics; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Oligopeptides; Peptide Fragments; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Recombinant Proteins; Salmonella enterica; Serine; Serine O-Acetyltransferase",2-s2.0-85029716780

This research will use the indicator symbol?s color and position change to remind drivers to brake or accelerate. Drivers can do driving operation timely and accurately. The system has the advantages of safety, intuition and real-time. The vehicle safe speed is calculated according to the road parameters, like adhesion coefficient and slope, and vehicle parameters, such as vehicle mass and centroid. Then, the appropriate braking operations are obtained by combining the vehicle driving state. The braking information is corresponded to the color and position change of the indicator symbol to prompt the drivers by the HUD interface.

Moods are usually collected by asking participants for their current mood or for a recollection of their mood states over a specific period of time. The current study investigates the reasons to favour collecting mood through current or daily mood surveys and outlines design recommendations for mood sampling using smartphones based on these findings. These recommendations are also relevant to more general smartphone sampling procedures. Results: N=64 participants completed a series of surveys at the beginning and end of the study providing information such as gender, personality, or smartphone addiction score. Through a smartphone application, they reported their current mood 3 times and daily mood once per day for 8 weeks. We found that none of the examined intrinsic individual qualities had an effect on matches of current and daily mood reports. However timing played a significant role: the last followed by the first reported current mood of the day were more likely to match the daily mood. Current mood surveys should be preferred for a higher sampling accuracy, while daily mood surveys are more suitable if compliance is more important. © 2017 The Author(s).","Experience sampling methodology; Mood; Mood sampling; Smartphone; Smartphone study; Study design",,2-s2.0-85029520648

Our approach is to create an integrated platform for the fabrication of mechanically flexible sensor tags that can be powered and interrogated wirelessly, precluding the need of a separate on-board power source. The high level system design is aimed at minimizing the number of non-printed components and reducing power consumption to enable energy harvesting from the RF field. Digital fabrication of these systems requires a range of materials, feature sizes, and electrical characteristics. In order to integrate the various printed components on a single substrate, we developed an integrated printer to accommodate a range of inks for printing the antenna, different types of sensors, chip interconnects and wiring. For chip attachment to the flexible substrate, a method of integrating the die within the thickness of the substrate was developed. With proper system design and fabrication, a complete integrated tag for wireless sensing of temperature, strain and touch was demonstrated. Our approach facilitates customization to a wide variety of sensors and user interfaces suitable for a broad range of applications including remote monitoring of health, structures and the environment.

Historically, it has been found that people tend to perceive egocentric distances in head-mounted display (HMD) based virtual environments as being shorter than equivalent distances in the real world. Previous research has shown that in such cases, reducing the quality of the computer graphics does not make the situation significantly worse. However, other research has found that breaking the illusion of reality in a compellingly photorealistic VR experience can have a significant negative impact on distance perception accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact of ""graphical realism"" on distance perception accuracy in VR from a novel perspective. Rather than starting with a virtual 3D model and varying its surface texture, we start with a live view of the real world, presented through a custom-designed video/optical-see-through HMD, and apply image processing to the video stream to remove details. This approach offers the potential to explore the relationship between visual and experiential realism in a more nuanced manner than has previously been done. In a within-subjects experiment across three different real-world hallway environments, we asked people to perform blind walking to make distance estimates under three different viewing conditions: real-world view through the HMD; closely registered camera views presented via the HMD; and Sobel-filtered versions of the camera views, resulting a sketch-like (NPR) appearance. We found: 1) significant amounts of distance underestimation in all three conditions, most likely due to the heavy backpack computer that participants wore to power the HMD and cameras/graphics; 2) a small but statistically significant difference in the amount of underestimation between the real world and camera/NPR viewing conditions, but no significant difference between the camera and NPR conditions. There was no significant difference between participants' ratings of visual and experiential realism in the real world and camera conditions, but in the NPR condition participants' ratings of experiential realism were significantly higher than their ratings of visual realism. These results confirm the notion that experiential realism is only partially dependent on visual realism, and that degradation of visual realism, independently of experiential realism, does not significantly impact distance perception accuracy in VR. © 2017 ACM.","Non-photorealistic rendering; Spatial perception; Virtual reality","Cameras; Computer graphics; Conceptual design; Depth perception; Image processing; Sensory perception; Virtual reality; Distance perception; Graphical realisms; Head mounted displays; Immersive virtual reality; Non-Photorealistic Rendering; Spatial perception; Statistically significant difference; Viewing conditions; Helmet mounted displays",2-s2.0-85030752706

The main contribution of this paper is to propose a universal smart home control platform architecture (IAPhome) based on a multi-agent system and communication middleware, which shows significant adaptability and advantages in many aspects, including heterogeneous devices connectivity, collaborative control, human-computer interaction and user self-management. The communication middleware is an important foundation to design and implement this architecture which makes it possible to integrate heterogeneous smart devices in a flexible way.

To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks.

As more and more Internet of Things (IoT) devices with measurement and/or control capability are designed and deployed for a more stable and efficient power system, the role of communication network has become more important. To evaluate the performance of control algorithms for inter-dependent power grid and communication network, a testbed that could simulate inter-dependent power grid and communication network is desirable. In this paper, we demonstrate design and implementation of a novel co-simulator which would effectively evaluate IoT-aided algorithms for scheduling the jobs of electrical appliances. There are three major features of our cosimulator: 1) large-scale test is achieved by distributed modules that are designed based on a Turing-indistinguishable approach; 2) remote servers or test devices are controlled by local graphical user interface (we only need to configure the simulator on a local server); 3) a Software Virtual Network (SVN) approach is employed to emulate real networks, which significantly reduces the cost of real-world testbeds. To evaluate our co-simulator, two energy consumption scheduling algorithms are implemented. Experimental results show that our co-simulator could effectively evaluate these methods. Thus our co-simulator is a powerful tool for utility companies and policy makers to commission novel IoT devices or methods in future smart grid infrastructure.

Alternatively, other models have been developed to produce more sophisticated systems by applying soft computing techniques, the majority of which have rarely been used beyond classic problems, such as function optimization or approximation by genetic algorithms (GAs), or neural networks (NNs). Our study proposes an evolutionary structure with a more complex NN in order to achieve the full potential of these techniques, which the genetics of neural systems promises to do. It consists of integrating a GA to optimize the connection weights for each neuron of an NN developed previously. The idea behind this combination is to develop an NNGA model prediction of the compressive strength of concrete containing natural pozzolan. Model learning and testing were first performed based on the back-propagation algorithm. Then, the model was optimized using the proposed evolutionary structure based upon GA. More than 400 experimental data collected from past studies were used in building this model. The hybrid NNGA model was compared with NN model using the same architecture, show that the NNGA is more performant and better than NN alone. The proposed hybrid model was also experimentally validated, very acceptable results with a high correlation coefficient R2 equal to 0.93, yielding comparable results to those obtained by the ACI 209-08 and CEB-FIP models with R2 values equal to 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. However, it can help to predict the compressive strength of a specified concrete mix at any age without knowing in prior the 28 days’ compressive strength of this given concrete as it is the case in ACI 208-09 and CEB-FIB Codes.

The CAD has been validated by computing the Added Masses values of bodies whose exact formulation was found in literature. The validated tool has been applied to more complex case studies where the Added Masses values were guessed using empirical laws or the equivalent ellipsoid approximation. Significant differences have been found between approximated methods and computations on real shapes. It is shown that the precision in the Added Masses computation and the computational time depend on the meshing quality of the model and power of the PC on which the software runs.

These materials can self-heal when internal cracks intercept and break the capsules. If the healing agent is released, the crack can be sealed. However, this is not always the case. These capsules need to be designed with the adequate shape and material to be properly broken. This paper presents two application models based on the combination of eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) elements and Cohesive Surfaces technique (CS) to predict crack propagation. Two types of encapsulated systems are considered: a concrete beam in a three-point bending test, and a micro-scale model of a representative volume element of a polymer subjected to a uniaxial tensile test. Despite both systems relying on different capsule shapes and different constituent materials, the models predict a similar non-linear response of the overall material strength governed by the coupled effect of the interface strength and the capsule radii-to-thickness ratio. Furthermore, even if an inadequate material and geometry combination is used, it is found that the mere presence of capsules might achieve, under certain conditions, an interesting overall reinforcement effect. This effect is discussed in terms of clustering and volume fraction of capsules. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cohesive zone; Crack propagation; Debonding; Extended finite element method; Micro-capsules; Self-healing materials","Crack propagation; Cracks; Debonding; Encapsulation; Interfaces (materials); Self-healing materials; Steam turbines; Tensile testing; Cohesive zones; Constituent materials; Extended finite element method; Micro-capsules; Reinforcement effects; Representative volume element (RVE); Three-point bending test; Uniaxial tensile test; Finite element method",2-s2.0-85020024261

Trimmed and non-conforming patches and even blended models including classical thin-shell and solid-shell formulations can be coupled successfully while preserving a continuous flux along the coupling interfaces. In this paper, we take advantage of the method's modeling flexibility for an extension to NURBS-based laminate composite shell structures. We introduce a global-local model coupling approach to enrich laminate composite thin-shell Kirchhoff-Love models locally with a full three-dimensional continuum solution. The approach provides a reliable coupling of the classical lamina theory with a layerwise formulation revealing the full interlaminar stress state at reduced computational cost. The layerwise shell model is based purely on a mid-surface NURBS description of the shell body thus supporting the direct application of a surface-defined CAD data representation of shells. We apply a refined finite cell approach to handle efficiently trimmed geometries, as common in CAD models. We demonstrate reliability, accuracy of the coupling approach and efficiency in terms of numerical costs and modeling effort of our approach with several examples. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Free edge effects; Global-local model coupling; Interlaminar stresses; Isogeometric analysis; Laminate composite shell; Nitsche","Computation theory; Laminated composites; Shells (structures); Free-edge effects; Global-local; Interlaminar stress; Isogeometric analysis; Laminate composites; Nitsche; Computer aided design",2-s2.0-85020299277

Although this technology has the potential to improve the quality of patient care, its mere provision does not guarantee uptake: even where CDSSs are available, clinicians often fail to adopt their recommendations. This study examines the barriers and facilitators to the uptake of an evidence-based CDSS as perceived by diverse health professionals in hospitals at different stages of CDSS adoption. Methods: Qualitative study conducted as part of a series of randomized controlled trials of CDSSs. The sample includes two hospitals using a CDSS and two hospitals that aim to adopt a CDSS in the future. We interviewed physicians, nurses, information technology staff, and members of the boards of directors (n=30). We used a constant comparative approach to develop a framework for guiding implementation. Results: We identified six clusters of experiences of, and attitudes towards CDSSs, which we label as ""positions."" The six positions represent a gradient of acquisition of control over CDSSs (from low to high) and are characterized by different types of barriers to CDSS uptake. The most severe barriers (prevalent in the first positions) include clinicians' perception that the CDSSs may reduce their professional autonomy or may be used against them in the event of medical-legal controversies. Moving towards the last positions, these barriers are substituted by technical and usability problems related to the technology interface. When all barriers are overcome, CDSSs are perceived as a working tool at the service of its users, integrating clinicians' reasoning and fostering organizational learning. Conclusions: Barriers and facilitators to the use of CDSSs are dynamic and may exist prior to their introduction in clinical contexts; providing a static list of obstacles and facilitators, irrespective of the specific implementation phase and context, may not be sufficient or useful to facilitate uptake. Factors such as clinicians' attitudes towards scientific evidences and guidelines, the quality of inter-disciplinary relationships, and an organizational ethos of transparency and accountability need to be considered when exploring the readiness of a hospital to adopt CDSSs. © 2017 The Author(s).","Clinical decision support systems; Evidence-based medicine; Health information technology; Healthcare professions; Qualitative research","adoption; clinical article; clinical decision support system; controlled study; doctor nurse relation; human; information technology; learning; medical information; medicine; occupation; perception; practice guideline; professional practice; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial; staff; substitution reaction",2-s2.0-85029517811

The initiation and growth of delaminations at the inter-laminar interfaces, damage in the glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) plies, ductile damage in the resin pockets (FM94 epoxy) and the onset of plasticity in the metal layers were examined. Geometric imperfections and load eccentricity were incorporated in an explicit dynamic nonlinear analysis implemented in the software Abaqus/Explicit. A series of buckling tests on specimens with and without artificial delaminations were conducted for validation, which are described in detail in a companion paper. Tests were monitored using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for visualisation of full-field displacements and strains whilst Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring enabled detection and localisation of the onset and progression of damage. Results for ‘Glare 4B’ specimens incorporating longitudinal and transverse delaminations into both splice and doubler geometries are presented.

Vacuum-assisted HSSPME (Vac-HSSPME) evolved from this approach and the resulting methods were always found to yield high extraction efficiencies and very good sensitivities within short sampling times and at mild temperatures. Vac-HSSPME preserves the simplicity of regular HSSPME and the only extra step required is that of air-evacuating the sample container before or after introducing the sample. Moreover, fast implementation of the technique is possible when using the latest, simplified and easy to construct sample container that can hold constant low-pressure conditions for extended sampling times. The main objective of the current tutorial is to provide a general strategy that can be applied towards the development of new Vac-HSSPME methods. The most important outcomes of past theoretical investigations are highlighted and a simple criterion for predicting the effect of vacuum on HSSPME sampling of water or water-containing samples is outlined. This theoretical discussion is then used as a background to elucidate the combined effects of low sampling pressure and several other experimental parameters on HSSPME sampling. Specific implications unique to Vac-HSSPME are also discussed, providing practical tips and a troubleshooting guide to new users. The great benefits of adopting the Vac-HSSPME approach are further demonstrated by reviewing all past applications reporting the quantitative and/or qualitative determination of compounds with a low tendency to escape to the headspace in a variety of samples.

The repeat-in-toxin (RTX) domain is a repeat protein sequence that reversibly adopts the β-roll secondary structure motif specifically upon calcium binding. This conformational change was exploited for controlled biomolecular recognition. Using ribosome display, an RTX peptide library was selected to identify binders to a model protein, lysozyme, exclusively in the folded state of the peptide. Several mutants were identified with low micromolar dissociation constants. After concatenation of the mutants, a 500-fold increase in the overall affinity for lysozyme was achieved leading to a peptide with an apparent dissociation constant of 65 nM. This mutant was immobilized for affinity chromatography experiments, and the on/off nature of the molecular recognition was demonstrated as the target is captured from a mixture in the presence of calcium and is released in the absence of calcium as the RTX peptides lose their β-roll structure.

In restoration practice, indeed the wet cleaning of these artworks is usually performed by immersion of paper in water, a procedure which may lead to several drawbacks, including paper fibers swelling and dissolution of water-soluble original components. Experiments This class of gels were yet presented in literature, but their interactions with paper materials and ability to be spiked with active enzymes (as cleaning agents), have not been analyzed. To establish the suitability of these hydrogels as paper cleaning materials, first, a rheological and microstructural characterization of the gels was performed. Moreover, diffusion of macromolecules inside gels was studied using fluorescence microscopy, to check if these innovative hydrogels can be used as carriers for hydrolytic enzymes. Indeed, pastes and glues are usually found in old paper artworks, and their removal is a very delicate operation that requires a selective action, which is granted by specific hydrolytic enzymes. At the same time, spectroscopic analyses on paper samples under investigation before and after cleaning treatment has been performed, thus assessing the capabilty of these gels as cleaning materials.

The main pathological feature of PD is the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Nicotinic receptor agonists are neuroprotective in several PD models and there is considerable evidence that α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs) are important therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases. However, the involvement of α7-nAChRs and underlying signaling mechanisms in PD pathogenesis are unclear. The objective of the present study was to explore the potential functions of α7-nAChRs in PD pathology, and to determine whether these effects are exerted via Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a mouse PD model. In the in vivo study, α7-nAChR knockout (α7-KO) reversed the beneficial effects of nicotine on motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, astrocyte and microglia activation, and reduced striatal dopamine release induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Injury to SH-SY5Y cells by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium treatment was also ameliorated by nicotine, and this effect was abolished by methyllycaconitine (MLA), a selective α7-nAChR antagonist, or by siRNA-mediated α7-nAChR knockdown. Furthermore, nicotine increased expression levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling proteins in the PD mouse model or in the SH-SY5Y cells treated by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, and these effects were also reversed by MLA or α7-siRNA treatment in vivo or in vitro. These results suggest that endogenous α7-nAChR mechanisms play a crucial role in a mouse PD model via regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Alpha7 nicotinic receptors; Dopamine; Knockout; Mouse; Parkinson's disease; Wnt signaling pathway","1 methyl 4 phenylpyridinium; 1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridine; beta catenin; bungarotoxin receptor; methyllycaconitine; nicotine; small interfering RNA; Wnt protein; bungarotoxin receptor; Chrna7 protein, human; Chrna7 protein, mouse; herbicide; nerve protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; astrocyte; controlled study; corpus striatum; dopamine release; dopaminergic nerve cell; gene silencing; in vitro study; in vivo study; knockout mouse; male; microglia; motor dysfunction; mouse; mouse model; nerve cell necrosis; neuroprotection; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; Wnt signaling pathway; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C57BL mouse; cell line; dopaminergic nerve cell; drug effects; genetics; human; immunohistochemistry; intoxication; metabolism; Parkinson disease; pathology; pathophysiology; randomization; RNA interference; substantia nigra; 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor; Animals; Cell Line; Dopaminergic Neurons; Herbicides; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; MPTP Poisoning; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neuroprotection; Parkinson Disease; Random Allocation; RNA Interference; Substantia Nigra; Wnt Signaling Pathway",2-s2.0-85024098035

In certain environments, litter comprises a considerable portion of the canopy, impeding the quantification of living biomass. Decomposition incurs physical changes and the genesis of decay pigments over time, causing the optical properties of litter to evolve in tandem. In order to simulate the spectral evolution of decaying leaves and relate the spectra to meaningful quantities of the biochemical compounds present, knowledge of the in-situ absorption properties of decay pigments is required. To determine the specific absorption coefficients of decay pigments in monocot leaf litter, we developed a spectral data set of multiple species at various decay stages concurrent with quantities of foliar compounds from fiber and humic acid analysis. Utilizing leaf humic acid content, the specific absorption coefficients for initial and advanced decay pigments were estimated using the PROSPECT model. For a 70-sample evaluation data set, simulated litter spectra closely matched the Reflectance, Transmittance, and Absorptance of measured leaves, with an average %RMSE (400–2500 nm range) of 4.95. Inversion of the expanded PROSPECT model had a moderate relationship between measured gravimetric humic acid content and the model inverted sum of initial and advanced decay pigments, as indicated by the R2 = 0.62 and index of agreement = 0.72 goodness of fit statistics. Integrating the specific absorption coefficients of decay pigments into the PROSAIL model permitted the canopy reflectance of grassland scenes of intertwined photosynthetic leaves and litter to be simulated. Model inversion results aligned well with changes in canopy chlorophyll and biomass, cumulating in an R2 = 0.69 between measured and predicted leaf area index.

Hence, the inclusion of decay pigments' specific absorption coefficients are of high importance for accurate simulation of mixed vegetation scenes.

The variable Mg composition in MHC is anticipated as a promising proxy to assess paleo-hydrochemistry especially in saline lakes. Although the roles of Mg on the formation and stability of MHC have been studied intensively, the Mg speciation in MHC has remained unclear and controversial. This study examined Mg speciation in MHC using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ab initio molecular simulation, and geochemical modeling. Mg-XANES spectra of MHC with different Mg/Ca ratios prepared from mixing solutions of Na2CO3, CaCl2 and MgCl2 revealed that the Mg in MHC is a mixture of amorphous Mg carbonate (AMC) and other Mg containing phase. The contribution of AMC to total Mg is negatively correlated to the crystallinity of MHC. Results show that AMC might play a protective role in the crystallization and the transformation to stable calcium carbonates. Ab initio calculation of Mg2+ substitution into MHC showed that a limited amount of Mg2+ can be incorporated into the MHC structure. Six-fold coordination of Mg2+ is substituted for eight-fold coordination of Ca2+ in the MHC structure. The other type of Mg in MHC revealed from the XANES analyses most likely corresponds to the structural Mg in MHC. The contribution of the structural Mg is almost constant at 0.06 in Mg/Ca, representing the limit of solid solubility of Mg in MHC. The solubility products of the MHC with the limit of solid solubility of Mg and the AMC associated with MHC were estimated from the reacted solution compositions. Prediction of the Mg/Ca ratio as a function of the initial solution conditions using solubility reasonably reproduces the observed apparent Mg/Ca ratios in MHC from the present study and earlier studies. The apparent Mg/Ca ratio of MHC is useful to elucidate water chemistry, especially for CO3/Ca and Mg concentrations during MHC formation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ab initio; Amorphous Mg carbonate; Monohydrocalcite; Solubility; XANES","carbonate group; concentration (composition); geochemistry; magnesium; modeling; saline lake; solubility; speciation (chemistry); water chemistry; XANES spectroscopy",2-s2.0-85026431996

Previous research identified that the dominant vegetation communities in ABZs are wet grassland and scrub habitats and that the vegetation communities are broadly determined by the soil type (peaty or mineral). One of the primary management options available to forest managers is whether to plant native broadleaves in the ABZ or leave them to be naturally colonised. The present study sought to determine the degree to which the vegetation of ABZs influences the composition and structure of associated aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and how this might inform their future management in particular the decision of whether to afforest the ABZ with broadleaf trees. The macroinvertebrate communities from stream on peaty and mineral soils with ABZs dominated by four vegetation communities were sampled, streams bordered by grassland habitats, scrub habitats, no ABZ i.e. conifer trees planted to the streams edge and control streams with no conifer forests in the vicinity. The results of this study showed that the composition and structure of the macroinvertebrate community varied significantly between streams on peaty and mineral soils, but was largely unaffected by the ABZ type. The differences between communities across soil type can be attributed to the lower abundance and richness of Ephemeroptera and conversely the higher abundance and richness of Plecoptera in streams on peaty soils. The lack of a consistent effect of ABZ type on the macroinvertebrate community illustrates the more dominant effect of water chemistry driven by soil type particularly episodic acidity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conifer plantations; Forestry; Riparian buffer zones; Sitka spruce","Ecosystems; Forestry; Minerals; Plants (botany); Soils; Timber; Vegetation; Conifer plantations; Forestry operations; Grassland habitat; Macroinvertebrate community; Management options; Riparian buffer zones; Sitka spruce; Vegetation community; Aquatic organisms; aquatic ecosystem; broad-leaved forest; buffer zone; community dynamics; community structure; coniferous forest; grassland; macroinvertebrate; peat soil; plantation forestry; river; soil type; vegetation dynamics; Ireland; Coniferophyta; Ephemeroptera; Picea sitchensis; Plecoptera",2-s2.0-85021406228

It was found that different type of surfactants required different methodologies to evaluate the clay-polymer compatibility. It is proposed that the surface energy approach is very suitable for cationic surfactants used in this study due to their hydrophobic nature, however, such approach is not suitable for relatively less hydrophobic nonionic surfactants.

Our study therefore addresses the impact of local neighbourhood, including density and species composition, on tree nutrition for two species with a limited contrast in traits. We investigated foliar nutrition in a young mixed plantation of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), planted along a double gradient of density and species proportion. Target trees of both species were selected over the full diameter range along this double gradient, and neighbourhood (local density, species identity and diversity) was determined in a 3 m radius. Using standardized regression analysis, we investigated direct effects of tree size and neighbourhood, and indirect effects of neighbourhood through tree size. Mostly we observed positive tree size effects in both species, be it stronger in beech. For maple, direct positive species identity effects were observed for C, N, P, S, K, Mg, Mn, Zn and Al. For beech, we found indirect negative effects of stand density and diversity. These results were in general agreement with growth data, which suggests that nutrition is one of the driving factors behind complementarity in this stand. We conclude that at this stage the effect of tree size dominates over the neighbourhood effects, including density and diversity. However, the presence of beech reduced intraspecific competition in maple with a positive effect on the foliar nutrient content. As neighbourhood effects are expected to increase as the plantation matures, our findings highlight the potential of admixing tree species with limited dissimilarity in traits for practical use in forestry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Acer pseudoplatanus L.; Density; Fagus sylvatica L.; Forest nutrition; Forest plantation; Neighbourhood; Species diversity; Species identity","Biodiversity; Density (specific gravity); Manganese; Nutrients; Nutrition; Regression analysis; Acer pseudoplatanus; Fagus sylvatica L; Forest nutrition; Forest plantation; Neighbourhood; Species identity; Forestry; angiosperm; complementarity; deciduous tree; density; forest ecosystem; forestry; growth; intraspecific competition; mixed forest; neighborhood; plantation forestry; species diversity; Acer; Acer pseudoplatanus; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica",2-s2.0-85020485790

These Cu materials are obtained from the treatment of EtOH solutions of L1H or L2H with CuX2(OH2)n species (X = Cl, Br, NO3, BF4). All of these compounds have been characterised by single crystal X-ray diffraction methods, which confirms a k3-N,N′,N″-binding mode of the formally anionic L1 or L2 displaying an amido N-Cu bond following H+ loss. Complexes of stoichiometry Cu(L1)X (X = Cl [1], Br [2]) are shown to be slightly distorted square planar compounds with an N3X ligand binding set. For X = BF4, the Cu compound retains a coordinated H2O molecule and a non-coordinated BF4 counteranion to form [Cu(L1)(OH2)]BF4·H2O (3). This species demonstrates extended solid-state structure which is likewise detailed. In the case of X = NO3, the isolated species (4) is six-coordinate in nature with a κ2-O,O′-NO3 ligand and a non-coordinated solvent of crystallisation (H2O). This latter species displays a bridged dimeric structure in the solid-state and can alternatively be produced, albeit in reduced yields, from 1 and AgNO3 in wet THF mixtures. A chiral derivative, Cu(L2)Cl (i.e., 5), has also be produced by similar synthetic protocols and structurally elucidated; it displays a solid-state structure somewhat different to that of 1. The catalytic activity of both 1 and 3 was investigated towards C-C bond forming chemistry, notably the Henry (i.e., nitroaldol) reaction and methyl methacrylate polymerisation. Electrochemical investigations of these complexes display irreversible one-electron reduction potentials; a facet which helps to explain their negligible catalytic activity in (presumed) ATRP. However, both 1 and 3 are marginally active in promoting the nitroaldol reaction but the product profile is hampered by both low conversions and the formation of by-product alkenes.

One viable solution is to offload these tasks to the connected smartphone. Existing Android smartphones allocate CPU resources to a task according to its performance requirement, which is determined by the context of the task. However, due to lack of context information, smartphones cannot properly allocate resources to tasks offloaded from wearable devices. Allocating too few resources to urgent tasks (related to user interaction) may cause high interaction latency on wearable devices, while allocating too many resources to unimportant tasks (unrelated to user interaction) may lead to energy waste on the smartphone. To solve this problem, we propose a context-aware task offloading (CATO) framework, in which offloaded tasks can be properly executed on the smartphone or further offloaded to the cloud based on their context, aiming to achieve a balance between good user experience on wearable devices and energy saving on the smartphone. To validate our design, we have implemented CATO on the Android platform and developed two applications on top of it.

For a long time considered to be a purely theoretical concept, MPC transitioned into a practical and powerful tool to build privacy-enhancing technologies. However, the practicality of MPC is hindered by the difficulty to implement applications on top of the underlying cryptographic protocols. This is because the manual construction of efficient applications, which need to be represented as Boolean or arithmetic circuits, is a complex, error-prone, and time-consuming task. To facilitate the development of further privacy-enhancing technology, multiple compilers have been proposed that create circuits for MPC. Yet, almost all presented compilers only support domain specific languages or provide very limited optimization methods. In this work (this is an extended and revised version of the paper ‘Secure Two-party Computations in ANSI C’ (Holzer et al., in: ACM CCS, 2012) that reflects the progress in secure computation and describes the current optimization tool chain of CBMC-GC) we describe our compiler CBMC-GC that implements a complete tool chain from ANSI C to circuit. Moreover, we give a comprehensive overview of circuit minimization techniques, which we have identified and adapted for the creation of efficient circuits for MPC. With the help of these techniques, our compilation approach allows for a high level of abstraction from the cryptographic primitives used in MPC protocols, as well as the complex design of digital circuits. By using the model checker CBMC as a compiler frontend, we illustrate the link between MPC, formal methods, and digital logic design. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the implemented optimizations techniques for various example applications. In particular, compared with other state-of-the-art compilers, we show that CBMC-GC compiles circuits from the same source code that are up to four times smaller. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Compiler; Logic synthesis; Secure multi-party computation","Chains; Computation theory; Computer circuits; Computer programming languages; Cryptography; Data privacy; Formal methods; Graphical user interfaces; Logic circuits; Logic Synthesis; Model checking; Problem oriented languages; Program compilers; Timing circuits; Compiler; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic protocols; Domain specific languages; High level of abstraction; Privacy enhancing technologies; Secure multi-party computation; Secure two-party computations; C (programming language)",2-s2.0-85029532991

The attitudes of some static unstable missile are divergent quickly due to aerodynamic interference by the aircraft. Therefore, it is disadvantageous to missile's separation from aircraft safely. The attitude control strategy must be applied to avoid the possible collision with the aircraft. A method based on dynamic mesh technique is developed to simulate the separation trajectories with attitude control law. The FLUENT commercial code is used to solve the 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamics equation and the kinematics equation of the missile in a very rigorous manner. In order to take into account the attitude control strategy, the User-Defined-Function (UDF) is introduced to calculate the aerodynamic effect of rudder using the free-stream results originated from calculation or wind tunnel test. Different from the spring analogy method, it is highly efficient and low in computational cost without the calculation of rudder deflection and the modification of the geometry in the unsteady simulation, especially for the conceptual design or analysis. Therefore, it has a practical significance in the engineering for the security analysis of missile ejected from aircraft, the identification of safe separation zones and the assessment of attitude control law. © 2017 IEEE.","attitude control law; missile ejection; unsteady numerical simulation","Aerodynamics; Aerospace engineering; Aircraft; Aircraft accidents; Aircraft control; Attitude control; Computational geometry; Conceptual design; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Missiles; Numerical models; Rudders; Separation; Trajectories; Wind tunnels; 6 degree of freedom; Aerodynamic interference; Computational costs; Kinematics equation; Missile trajectories; Unsteady numerical simulations; Unsteady simulations; User-defined functions; Control theory",2-s2.0-85032335468

Our approach is based on the conjecture that good seeding curves can be inferred from a set of streamlines. Given a set of densely traced streamlines over the flow field, we design a sketch-based interface that allows users to describe their perceived flow patterns through drawing simple strokes directly on top of the streamline visualization results. Based on the 2D stroke, we identify a 3D seeding curve and generate a stream surface that captures the flow pattern of streamlines at the outermost layer. Then, we remove the streamlines whose patterns are covered by the stream surface. Repeating this process, users can peel the flow by replacing the streamlines with customized surfaces layer by layer. Furthermore, we propose an optimization scheme to identify the optimal seeding curve in the neighborhood of an original seeding curve based on surface quality measures. To support interactive optimization, we design a parallel surface quality estimation strategy that estimates the quality of a seeding curve without generating the surface. Our sketch-based interface leverages an intuitive painting metaphor which most users are familiar with. We present results using multiple data sets to show the effectiveness of our approach.

We considered different MB atomic charge distributions to simulate the MB electronic distribution in the singlet ground and triplet excited states. Simulation results allied to experimental data revealed that initial CL photooxidation probably occurs via a type II mechanism, to produce lipid hydroperoxide by singlet oxygen attack to the alkyl chain unsaturations. The resulting hydroperoxide group prefers to reside near the aqueous interface, to increase the membrane surface area and to decrease lipid packing. Interestingly, MB orientation changes from nearly parallel to the water-monolayer interface in the ground state to normal to the interface in its triplet excited state. The latter orientation favors oxidative chain reaction continuity via a type I mechanism, during which the hydrogen atom must be transferred from the hydroperoxide group to triplet MB. Taken together, the present results can be extrapolated to improve our understanding of how oxidation progresses in lipidic biomembrane, which will lead to the formation of oxidized species with shortened chains and will cause severe photodamage to self-organized systems.

We recorded the interactive data of spoken dialogues from 29 participants (14 dementia and 15 healthy controls) and extracted various audiovisual features. We tried to predict dementia using audiovisual features and two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and logistic regression). Here, we show that the support vector machines outperformed logistic regression, and by using the extracted features they classified the participants into two groups with 0.93 detection performance, as measured by the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also newly identified some contributing features, e.g., gap before speaking, the variations of fundamental frequency, voice quality, and the ratio of smiling.

Data uncertainties are salient in MediSyn; for example, (i) missing data are exposed in the matrix view of drug-target relations; (ii) inconsistencies between datasets are shown via overlaid layers; and (iii) data credibility is conveyed through links to data provenance. Conclusions: Through the synthesis of two manually curated datasets, cancer treatment biomarkers and drug-target bioactivities, a use case shows how MediSyn effectively supports the discovery of drug-repurposing opportunities. A study with six domain experts indicated that MediSyn benefited the drug selection and data inconsistency discovery. Though linked publication sources supported user exploration for further information, the causes of inconsistencies were not easy to find. Additionally, MediSyn could embrace more patient data to increase its informativeness. We derive design implications from the findings. © 2017 The Author(s).","Interactive visualization; Multiple datasets; Uncertainty visualization","Data handling; Drug therapy; Hospital data processing; Matrix algebra; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Data credibilities; Data inconsistencies; Design implications; Interactive visualizations; Multiple data sets; Structured knowledge; Treatment selection; Uncertainty visualization; Data visualization",2-s2.0-85029440811

The platform enables complete integration of target recognition, signal amplification, and visual signal output based on aptamer/invertase-functionalized sepharose beads, cascaded enzymatic reactions, and a 3D microfluidic paper-based analytical device with distance-based readout, respectively. The invertase-DNA conjugate is released upon target addition, after which it permeates through the cellulose and flows down into the bottom detection zone, whereas sepharose beads with larger size are excluded and stay in the upper zone. Finally, the released conjugate initiates cascaded enzymatic reactions and translates the target signal into a brown bar chart reading. By simply closing the device, the ID-oPAD enables a sample-in-answer-out assay within 30 min with visual and quantitative readout. Importantly, bound/free probe separation is achieved by taking advantage of the size difference between sepharose beads and cellulose pores, and the downstream enzymatic amplification is realized based on the compatibility of multiple enzymes with corresponding substrates. Overall, with the advantages of low-cost, disposability, simple operation, and visual quantitative readout, the ID-oPAD offers an ideal platform for point-of-care testing, especially in resource-limited areas. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","aptamer; distance-based detection; microfluidic paper-based devices; point-of-care (POC)","Analytic equipment; Cellulose; Microfluidics; Aptamers; Distance-based; Enzymatic amplifications; Paper based devices; Paper-based analytical devices; Point of care; Point-of-care testing; Signal amplifications; Paper; Cellulose; Enzymes; Paper; Three Dimensional Design",2-s2.0-85029461493

This paper proposes an online support vector machine (OSVM)-based method to solve the problem by the inter-driver variation. The method personalizes the drowsiness detecting system for a certain real user using feedback data from the user. The OSVM selects important data in previous training data and retrains itself with new feedback data for the personalization. Two OSVMs having different initial training data are personalized by the feedback data, and a switching method of the two OSVMs is used in the proposed method for low initial error and fast adaptation. Simulation was conducted using the data obtained by a wearable device and an indoor driving simulator, and the usefulness of the proposed method was validated.

Virtual dose-maps were created within RADEval and two different tumor control probability (TCP) values using a Logistic and a Poisson TCP models were calculated in RADEval using each STAPLE and each dose-map. RADEval also virtually generated a ring of normal tissue. To evaluate clinical impact, two different uncomplicated TCP (UTCP) values were calculated in RADEval by using two TCP-NTCP correlation parameters (δ = 0 and 1). NTCP values showed that semi-automatic segmentation resulted in lower NTCP with an average 1.5 -1.6 % regardless of STAPLE design.

The paper reports on the use of four different degrees of body motion induced navigational VR controllers, a TiltChair, omni-directional treadmill, a manual wheelchair joystick (VRNChair), and a joystick in relation to a participant's SS occurrence and a controller's intuitive utilization. Twenty young adult participants utilized all controllers to navigate through the same VR task environment in separate sessions. Throughout the sessions, SS occurrence was measured from a severity score by a standard SS questionnaire and from body sway by a center of pressure path length with eyes opened and closed. SS occurrence did not significantly differ among the controllers. However, time spent in VR significantly contributed to SS occurrence; hence, a few breaks to minimize SS should be interjected throughout a VR task. For all task trials, we recorded the participant's travel trajectories to investigate each controller's intuitive utilization from a computed traversed distance. Shorter traversed distances indicated that participants intuitively utilized the TiltChair with a slower speed; while longer traversed distances indicated participants struggled to utilize the omni-directional treadmill with a unnaturalistic stimulation of gait. Therefore, VR navigation should use technologies best suited for the intended age group that minimizes SS, and produces intuitive interactions for the participants. © 2017 IEEE.",,,2-s2.0-85032190398

This paper builds upon a body of work examining in-hospital older adult patients at-risk of developing pedal pressure ulcers by examining thermal images of one patient, who was reporting pain in her right foot, over 112 days of a hospital stay. Thermal images of the patient's left and right heels and malleoli were subjected to image processing to remove noise and enhance contrast, region selection and feature extraction to observe changes in temperature over time. Mean intensity within each ROI was extracted, and the difference in temperature between the left and right heels was calculated over time. The resulting temperature pattern was consistent with the physical phenomenon related to ulcer development, intervention and recovery; the right heel was similar in temperature when starting the study and at the end of the study, but was drastically warmer when experiencing erythema and drastically colder when experiencing ischaemia. These results suggest that consistent thermal imaging, in conjunction with image processing may be able to detect the formation of pressure ulcers faster than can be visually observed.

Here, we systematically compared different criteria and parameters in evaluating the accuracy of ADSA upon reducing drop volume. By scrutinizing the dependence of ADSA accuracy on various parameters, including the capillary constant (c), the Bond number (Bo), the Worthington number (Wo), and the shape parameter (Ps), we concluded that the classical Bond number failed to predict the accuracy of drop shape analysis at very small drop volumes. Thus, we proposed a replacement of the classical Bond number, called the Neumann number Ne ≥ (ΔρgR0H)/γ.

To be responsive to dynamically arrived pragmatics, we propose a self-Adaptive service-organization approach that follows an iterative life-cycle for autonomously evolving organization schemes. To face the emerging efficiency challenges, our approach adopts a greedy online algorithm for the evolution of organization schemes that considers and stores only the top-k pragmatics of each service.

To reduce the Mean Time To Repair in these systems and increment high availability, Fault Tolerance (FT) solutions are required. The checkpoint/restart approach is a widely used mechanism in FT solutions. One of the most used technique to take checkpoints in parallel applications implemented using Message Passing Interface is the coordinated checkpoints. In this paper a Fault Tolerance Manager (FTM) for coordinated checkpoint files is presented, to provide users automatic recovery from failures when losing computing nodes. This proposal makes the configuration of FT simpler and transparent for users without knowledge of their application implementation. Furthermore, system administrators are not required to install libraries in their cluster to support FTM. It takes advantage of node local storage to save checkpoints, and it distributes copies of them along all the computation nodes, avoiding the bottleneck of a central stable storage. This approach is particularly useful in IaaS cloud environments, where users have to pay for centralized stable storage services. This work is based on RADIC, a well- known architecture to provide fault tolerance in a distributed, flexible, automatic and scalable way.

In addition to controlling the oil/water ratio, exploiting emulsifiers with desirable amphiphilicity that can stabilize both the inner and outer water/oil interfaces is crucial to the formation of one-step double emulsions. In particular, new emulsifiers with saving laborious efforts are highly preferred in consideration of low cost and practical applications. In this work, a commonly used homopolymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), was attempted as emulsifiers to prepare emulsions via one-step emulsification. PEG is generally considered as a hydrophilic polymer and always anchored with a hydrophobic polymer to make the copolymer amphiphilic. In the water-chloroform binary system, PEG itself exhibits amphiphilic performance and tailors the formation of single emulsions or double W/O/W emulsions on the dependence of the oil/water ratio and the PEG concentration. A possible mechanism as explained by dissipative particle dynamics simulation was proposed to demonstrate the amphiphilic feature and emulsification capability of PEG. The amphiphilicity of PEG was further tuned by interacting with iodine as a result of the formation of a supramolecular complex, which, in turn, led to the conversion from single emulsions to O/W/O double emulsions. It is believed that this line of research provides inspiration for the preparation of controllable emulsions through supramolecular routes. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Emulsification; Emulsions; Polyethylene oxides; Polyethylenes; Supramolecular chemistry; Amphiphilic features; Dissipative particle dynamics simulation; Hydrophilic polymers; Hydrophobic polymers; PEG concentration; Possible mechanisms; Supramolecular complexes; Water/oil interfaces; Polyethylene glycols",2-s2.0-85029327298

Home security systems can be defined as monitoring of complete home/some portion of home from a remotely located or centralized location. It allows the user to watch all activities inside the home from a remote location that ultimately gives satisfaction to the owner of the home. Many home security systems exist, but they have some challenging issues like: delay, non-web enabled and difficult to handle during transfer of alerts to user in situation where any unusual event occurred inside the home. If any unusual event encountered inside the home, where security systems deployed, then system must be capable enough to send alert to the user without any delay by phone, text, or email.

A full comprehension of its dynamical and functional behavior is required for efficient applications. Here, AZ bound to gold electrode via its disulfide bridge was investigated by a molecular dynamics simulation approach taking into account for gold electron polarization which provides a more realistic description of the protein-gold interaction. Upon binding to gold, AZ undergoes slight changes in its secondary structure with the preservation of the copper-containing active site structure. Binding of AZ to gold promotes new collective motions, with respect to free AZ, as evidenced by essential dynamics. Analysis of the ET from the AZ copper ion to the gold substrate, performed by the Pathways model, put into evidence the main residues and structural motifs of AZ involved in the ET paths. During the dynamical evolution of the bionanosystem, transient contacts between some lateral protein atoms and the gold substrate occurred; concomitantly, the opening of additional ET channels with much higher rates was registered. These results provide new and detailed insights on the dynamics and ET properties of the AZ-gold system, by also helping to rationalize some imaging and conductive experimental evidences and also to design new bionanodevices with tailored features. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Bins; Copper; Covalent bonds; Electrodes; Electron transitions; Metal ions; Molecular dynamics; Optical properties; Optoelectronic devices; Proteins; Active site structure; Collective motions; Dynamical evolution; Electron polarization; Experimental evidence; Functional behaviors; Molecular dynamics simulations; Secondary structures; Gold",2-s2.0-85029283602

Wicked problems refer to ill-structured and dynamic problems that combine multidimensional elements, which often preclude the conventional problem solving approach. This pilot study introduces visual analytics (VA) methods to multi-stakeholder decision-making sessions about child injury prevention; Methods: Inspired by the Delphi method, we introduced a novel methodology-group analytics (GA). GA was pilot-tested to evaluate the impact of collaborative visual analytics on facilitating problem solving and supporting decision-making. We conducted two GA sessions. Collected data included stakeholders’ observations, audio and video recordings, questionnaires, and follow up interviews. The GA sessions were analyzed using the Joint Activity Theory protocol analysis methods; Results: The GA methodology triggered the emergence of ‘common ground’ among stakeholders. This common ground evolved throughout the sessions to enhance stakeholders’ verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as coordination of joint activities and ultimately collaboration on problem solving and decision-making; Conclusions: Understanding complex health data is necessary for informed decisions. Equally important, in this case, is the use of the group analytics methodology to achieve ‘common ground’ among diverse stakeholders about health data and their implications. © 2017 by the authors.

Base of support (BOS), together with its interaction with center of mass, is a critical indicator in above mentioned research fields. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of Xsens MVN BIOMECH, a commercial widely used inertial sensor-based motion capture system, for measuring static BOS and examine the effect of different task complexity on the accuracy. Eleven young males participated in this study and went through eleven different experimental tasks. Results showed there were considerable errors in estimating BOS area (error ranged from −12.6% to +64.6%) from Xsens MVN and a large error in foot separation distance when there was knee flexion. The estimated BOS area from MVN was smaller than the ground truth from footprint when there was no knee flexion, and larger when there was knee flexion, and it increased monotonically along with the knee flexion angles. Wrongly estimated foot separations, mainly caused by knee flexion, and the initial system estimation error on BOS, were two major reasons for error and instability of BOS estimation. The findings suggested that caution should be taken when using Xsens MVN BIOMECH to estimate BOS and foot position-related measurements, especially for postures/motions with knee flexion. © 2017 by the authors.

A Russian icon, mass-produced in Moscow in 1899, was digitised by ten institutions around Europe. The image quality was assessed by observers, and the reflectance spectra at selected points were reconstructed to characterise the icon's colourants and to obtain a quantitative estimate of accuracy. The differing spatial resolutions of the systems affected their ability to resolve fine details in the printed pattern. There was a surprisingly wide variation in the quality of imagery, caused by unwanted reflections from both glossy painted and metallic gold areas of the icon's surface. Specular reflection also degraded the accuracy of the reconstructed reflectance spectrum in some places, indicating the importance of control over the illumination geometry. Some devices that gave excellent results for matte colour charts proved to have poor performance for this demanding test object.

The limitation of this approximation is cause for serious concerns, particularly in the case of lipid membranes, where the molecular environment undergoes dramatic variations over microscopic length scales. A polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator offers a practical and computationally efficient framework for an improved representation of electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. Building on the first-generation Drude polarizable force field for the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) molecule, the present effort was undertaken to improve this initial model and expand the force field to a wider range of phospholipid molecules. New lipids parametrized include dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The iterative optimization protocol employed in this effort led to lipid models that achieve a good balance between reproducing quantum mechanical data on model compound representative of phospholipids and reproducing a range of experimental condensed phase properties of bilayers. A parametrization strategy based on a restrained ensemble-maximum entropy methodology was used to help accurately match the experimental NMR order parameters in the polar headgroup region.

A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different categories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG. © 2017 IEEE.","H.5.2 [INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]; User Interfaces - Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)","Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Marketing; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Software design; User centered design; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Visualization; Dynamic network analysis; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); H.5.2 [information interfaces and presentation]; Massively multiplayer online role-playing games; Micro and macro levels; Time-varying structure; User-centered design process; Visual analytics systems; Graphical user interfaces",2-s2.0-85032027933

Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) is extremely important for safe and precision medicine. There are various machine learning based approaches to predict adverse reactions for drugs.

We propose DrugPathSeeker, a novel interactive user interface that integrates the machine learning model, database query API, statistical analysis, and visualization for exploring and understanding of the association between drugs and ADRs.

DrugPathSeeker uses a machine learning model, Small Molecular Risk Profiler, to make ADR predictions for a given drug. The visualization uses Sankey type flow diagrams for highlighting the relation between the drugs and ADRs. The main goal of Drug-PathSeeker is to mine the gene-pathways from public databases and analyze them in a visual manner to generate a biological hypothesis.

We simulate spatial continuity with three perceptual models commonly used to create phantom sensations: the linear, logarithmic and power model. We show that these generic models lead to limited decoding precision, and propose a method for model personalization adjusting to idiosyncratic and spatial variations in perceptual sensitivity. We evaluate this approach using two haptic display layouts: circular, worn around the wrist and the upper arm, and straight, worn along the forearm. Results of a user study measuring continuous value decoding precision show that users were able to decode continuous values with relatively high accuracy (4.4% mean error), circular layouts performed particularly well, and personalisation through sensitivity adjustment increased decoding precision. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Encoding information; Haptic display; Haptic feedback; HCI; Phantom sensation; Tactile feedback; User study; Wearable","Decoding; Haptic interfaces; Human computer interaction; Wearable computers; Wearable technology; Encoding informations; Haptic display; Haptic feedbacks; Phantom sensation; Tactile feedback; User study; Wearable; Sensitivity analysis",2-s2.0-85030478237

Our evidence is obtained by three studies using a wearable haptic display with vibrotactile motors (tactors). Haptic displays intended to transmit symbols often suffer the tradeoff between throughput and accuracy. For a symbol encoded with more than one tactor simultaneous onsets (spatial encoding) yields the highest throughput at the expense of the accuracy. Sequential onset increases accuracy at the expense of throughput. In the desire to overcome these issues, we investigate aspects of prioritisation based on sensitivity applied to the encoding of haptics patterns. First, we investigate an encoding method using mixed intensities, where different body locations are simultaneously stimulated with different vibration intensities. We investigate whether prioritising the intensity based on sensitivity improves identification accuracy when compared to simple spatial encoding. Second, we investigate whether prioritising onset based on sensitivity affects the identification of overlapped spatiotemporal patterns. A user study shows that this method significantly increases the accuracy. Furthermore, in a third study, we identify three locations on the hand that lead to an accurate recall. Thereby, we design the layout of a haptic display equipped with eight tactors, capable of encoding 36 symbols with only one or two locations per symbol. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Haptic display; Haptic feedback; HCI; Skin reading; Stimulation; Tactile feedback; User study; Wearable","Haptic interfaces; Human computer interaction; Location; Signal encoding; Throughput; Wearable computers; Wearable technology; Haptic display; Haptic feedbacks; Stimulation; Tactile feedback; User study; Wearable; Encoding (symbols)",2-s2.0-85030462290

Compared to univariate datasets, analysis and visualization of multivariate datasets are much more challenging due to the complex relationships among the variables. As an effective way to visualize and analyze multivariate datasets, volume rendering has been frequently used, although designing good multivariate transfer functions is still non-trivial. In this paper, we present an interactive workflow to allow users to design multivariate transfer functions. To handle large scale datasets, in the preprocessing stage we reduce the number of data points through data binning and aggregation, and then a new set of data points with a much smaller size are generated. The relationship between all pairs of variables is presented in a matrix juxtaposition view, where users can navigate through the different subspaces. An entropy based method is used to help users to choose which subspace to explore. We proposed two weights: scatter weight and size weight that are associated with each projected point in those different subspaces. Based on those two weights, data point filter and kernel density estimation operations are employed to assist users to discover interesting features. For each user-selected feature, a Gaussian function is constructed and updated incrementally. Finally, all those selected features are visualized through multivariate volume rendering to reveal the structure of data. With our system, users can interactively explore different subspaces and specify multivariate transfer functions in an effective way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with several multivariate volumetric datasets. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Transfer functions; Visualization; Volume rendering; Volumetric analysis; Complex relationships; Entropy-based methods; Interactive workflow; Kernel Density Estimation; Multivariate data sets; Multivariate transfer function; Scientific simulations; Volumetric data sets; Data visualization",2-s2.0-85032002027

Whether it is about sensors to expand humans' sensorium, exo-skeletons augmenting physical capabilities, augmented and digital worlds breaking with physical boundaries, or curated digital memories: the value of all these technologies rises and falls with their ability to synchronize with the user's current situation, understand the needs and provide appropriate support. In this position paper we want to outline how semantic technologies can be applied to add more context and meaning to the user's role and task, and use Augmented Reality to present this information to the user. Instead of proposing yet another framework representing world knowledge we describe how to build upon existing standards, descriptions of procedures and routines, and regulations that become machine accessible. This way, machines and humans should be able to work in symbiosis. In the following we describe our motivation, list upcoming challenges and provide a first direction of how to proceed.

It defines the basic idea of the system and describes the hardware and software in the background. It then shows how the vibration patterns, that are transmitted to the user via a wristband with two vibration motors, are calculated from the data points of the graph. The system is evaluated by a brief study with five participants. Based on this evaluation the paper suggests how the system can be improved, extended and applied in different fields of data representation.

Generally, there are two forms of such an awareness; recognizing the environment and recognizing other people around us. We propose face2faceVR; an easy to use implementation of AR tracking to assist VR towards recognizing other nearby VR users. The contribution of this work are the following; 1) it is compatible with mobile VR technology that already caters towards a wider adoption, 2) it does not require a networked or shared virtual environment, and 3) it is an inexpensive implementation without any additional peripherals or hardware. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Augmented reality; Spatial awareness; Ubiquitous VR; Virtual reality","Augmented reality; Virtual reality; Wearable computers; Wearable technology; Shared virtual environments; Spatial awareness; Ubiquitous environments; Ubiquitous VR; VR technology; Ubiquitous computing",2-s2.0-85030841621

This technology now enables new forms of tracking and sharing outdoor adventures, that go beyond prosaic descriptions and photographs of the tour. Existing web mapping services and online tour diaries already allow mountaineers an improved preparation of tours but it remains still a time-consuming and cumbersome task. In this paper we introduce the concept of pioneers in outdoor activities. The proposed concept lets people define their pioneers, which are other ambitious athletes who are well known and trusted experts of the area. Using the segments of their tracks and other personal preferences (e.g. length, elevation and difficulty) a personalized route that is based on the pioneers' activities is generated and recommended to the user.

The cornea, which is encasing the iris and pupil, is protected by tear fluid, and thus is a highly reflective surface. Our eyes show a reflection of what we see in our current context. We present an attempt of using corneal imaging to extract contextual information - including objects in the field of view - and the user's attention focus. Our system uses a head-mounted eye-camera, for capturing corneal reflections, connected to a RaspberryPi, to record a humans' current view and estimate his focus of attention. We conducted a 2-day experiment, where we collected data in un-instrumented real-world settings. Based on the analysis of the recordings we illustrate what kind of information can be extracted out of the corneal image reflections and outline the possibilities for in-situ notifications.

With additional ontology information, the semantics behind the network structure can be further explored. Unfortunately, creating network visualizations with these datasets for presentation can inadvertently expose the private and sensitive information of individuals that reside in the data. To deal with this problem, we generalize conventional data anonymization models (originally designed for relational data) and formally apply them in the context of privacy preserving ontological network visualization. We use these models to identify the privacy leaks that exist in a visualization, provide graph modification actions that remove and/or perceptually minimize the effect of the identified leaks, and discuss strategies for what types of privacy actions to choose depending on the context of the leaks. We implement an ontological visualization interface with associated privacy preserving operations, and demonstrate with two case studies using real-world datasets to show that our approach can identify and solve potential privacy issues while balancing overall graph readability and utility. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Data visualization; Ontology; Semantics; Visualization; Data anonymization; Graph modifications; Network structures; Network visualization; Ontological networks; Privacy preserving; Real-world datasets; Sensitive informations; Data privacy",2-s2.0-85030680508
