As a result, interactive video lectures are increasingly being adopted in digital learning contexts for increasing interactivity. However, conventional video lecture lacks interactive learning activities (ILAs) that are an indispensable component of interactivity. Interactive video lectures can provide learners opportunities to obtain timely constructive support to produce effective learning outcomes because of ILAs. In order to carefully design and create ILAs for effective learning, instructors need to invest substantial efforts for conceiving the content and interactions of ILAs. This study proposed an approach to design the content of ILAs by leveraging collective intelligence (CI) gathered from the discussion forums specifically related to the content of video lectures. When learners exercised ILAs, meaningful interactions by speaking and gesturing worked as learning support to improve comprehension of learning materials. To evaluate the effects of the CI-based ILAs, an experiment was conducted with 90 university students, who were randomly and equally assigned to three different groups (i.e., embodied interactive, non-embodied interactive, and conventional video lectures). The results show that learners who learned with the embodied interactive video lecture performed better in comprehension and retention of learning contents than the other two counter groups. The findings also revealed that this approach does not impose any additional cognitive load on learners. The design guidelines derived in this study can serve as reference for instructors to create interactive video lectures with CI-based ILAs in digital learning contexts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Architectures for educational technology system; Human-computer interface; Interactive learning environments; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategies","Computer aided instruction; Computer graphics; E-learning; Educational technology; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Teaching; Architectures for educational technology system; Human computer interfaces; Interactive learning environment; Pedagogical issues; Teaching/learning strategy; Education",2-s2.0-85032475969

The primary advantage of this method over correlative methods is that it can tell us if a certain brain region is necessary for a given cognitive function. In addition, lesion-based analyses provide unique insights into clinical deficits. In the last decade, statistical voxel-based lesion behavior mapping (VLBM) emerged as a powerful method for understanding the architecture of the human brain. This review illustrates how VLBM improves our knowledge of functional brain architecture, as well as how it is inherently limited by its mass-univariate approach. A wide array of recently developed methods appear to supplement traditional VLBM. This paper provides an overview of these new methods, including the use of specialized imaging modalities, the combination of structural imaging with normative connectome data, as well as multivariate analyses of structural imaging data. We see these new methods as complementing rather than replacing traditional VLBM, providing synergistic tools to answer related questions. Finally, we discuss the potential for these methods to become established in cognitive neuroscience and in clinical applications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive neurology; Human; Lesion analysis; Machine learning; Mass-univariate; MLBM; Multivariate lesion behavior mapping; Network; Neuroanatomy; Neuropsychology; Non-parametric mapping; Stroke; VLBM; VLSM; Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping","gadolinium; BOLD signal; brain blood flow; brain mapping; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; connectome; diagnostic accuracy; diffusion weighted imaging; emotion; episodic memory; functional magnetic resonance imaging; glioblastoma; human; machine learning; perfusion weighted imaging; population research; priority journal; Review; temporal lobe epilepsy; voxel based lesion behavior mapping; voxel based morphometry",2-s2.0-85032203415

Existing TIA techniques and algorithms perform limited cognitive processing because they lack fundamental characteristics of Situation Management (SM). In consequence, a dramatic reduction of situation awareness, information and decision superiority of the operators and the overall tactical system has emerged. Considerable attention in applying computational cognitive architectures and processing and SM within TIA has been gaining momentum. This paper discusses the Cognitive Architecture for Tactical Information Assessment (CATIA), a proposed Multi-Agent System (MAS)-based cognitive architecture. CATIA employs cognitive architecture design principles and the Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) framework to facilitate recognition and reasoning to deliberate in tactical situations and events.

But how can the effort—or cognitive costs—associated with a strategy be conceptualized and measured? We propose an approach that decomposes the effort a strategy requires into the time costs associated with the demands for using specific cognitive resources. We refer to this approach as resource demand decomposition analysis (RDDA) and instantiate it in the cognitive architecture Adaptive Control of Thought–Rational (ACT-R). ACT-R provides the means to develop computer simulations of the strategies. These simulations take into account how strategies interact with quantitative implementations of cognitive resources and incorporate the possibility of parallel processing. Using this approach, we quantified, decomposed, and compared the time costs of two prominent strategies for decision making, take-the-best and tallying. Because take-the-best often ignores information and foregoes information integration, it has been considered simpler than strategies like tallying. However, in both ACT-R simulations and an empirical study we found that under increasing cognitive demands the response times (i.e., time costs) of take-the-best sometimes exceeded those of tallying. The RDDA suggested that this pattern is driven by greater requirements for working memory updates, memory retrievals, and the coordination of mental actions when using take-the-best compared to tallying. The results illustrate that assessing the relative simplicity of strategies requires consideration of the overall cognitive system in which the strategies are embedded. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","ACT-R; Cognitive costs; Computational modeling; Decision making; Strategy; Working memory","accuracy; adult; Article; cognition; controlled study; coordination; cost; decision making; decomposition; empiricism; female; hearing; human; human experiment; male; motor performance; normal human; priority journal; response time; simulation; vision; working memory",2-s2.0-85030460927

A contemporary idea can be based on appropriate modeling of the human mind using the available psychological knowledge. One of the main reasons for developing such projects is the lack of available and effective top-down approaches resulting from the known research on autonomous robotics. On the other hand, there is no system that models human psychology sufficiently well for the purpose of constructing autonomous systems. Nevertheless, to combat this lack, several ideas have been proposed for embodying human intelligence. We review recent progress in our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive computations underlying decision-making and discuss some of the pertinent challenges identified and implemented in several systemic solutions founded on cognitive ideas (like LIDA, CLARION, SOAR, MANIC, DUAL, OpenCog). In particular, we highlight the idea of an Intelligent System of Decision-making (ISD) based on the achievements of cognitive psychology (using the aspect of ‘information path’), motivation theory (where the needs and emotions serve as the main drives, or motivations, in the mechanism of governing autonomous systems), and several other detailed theories, which concern memory, categorization, perception, and decision-making. In the ISD system, in particular, an xEmotion subsystem covers the psychological theories on emotions, including the appraisal, evolutionary and somatic theories. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Cognitive architecture; Cognitive development; Decision-making; Human-computer interaction; Intelligent agents; Perception",,2-s2.0-85030123266

The primary task of cognitive radio lies in the spectrum sensing and identification of holes. But the presence of a single CR and multiple secondary users in the network can lead to delay and collision. Therefore, the algorithm named “multiple CRs single-hop (MCSH) secondary user cognitive radio network architecture” has been formulated and proposed in which multiple CRs can coordinate with each other via single hop as well as with unlicensed users in order to diminish the delay, jitter, and packet loss. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Cognitive radio; Multi-hop; Multiple CRs; Secondary user; Sensing","Network architecture; Radio systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio technologies; Multihop; Network structures; Secondary users; Sensing; Spectral efficiencies; Wireless communications; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85031721294

Do these practices reflect the learners’ cognitive metamorphoses? Do formative and summative evaluations aim at accessing knowledge acquisition at the expense of understanding? Is the content of the evaluation approaches and instruments part of the learners’ previous knowledge? What is the relation between this content and the learners’ specific knowledge base? Does the structure of evaluation instruments give access to knowledge construction? Is this structure more oriented towards the evaluation of low-level cognitive skills than to the assessment of high-level cognitive skills? Does the context of the assessment introduce affective variables that may negatively influence learners’ results? Do the used instruments allow systematically determining the learners’ strengths and weaknesses? Do the correction criteria respect the value of each of the learner’s responses to construct a particular knowledge? Are these criteria more influenced by objectivity requirements than by the cognitive value of the responses? All these questions show the complexity and the importance of the evaluation problem in the school environment and in the cognitive progress of the learners. The questions mentioned are rather related to the content of the evaluation instruments, their structure, their objectives and the context in which the evaluation takes place than to the correction criteria. In this paper, we introduce a personalized evaluation environment for mobile learning. We first introduce m-evaluation scenario. Then, we describe this personalization as well as the architecture of the evaluation environment composed of Web services and based on communication between these services carried out via Semantic web technologies. The proposed environment allows implementing an assessment of the learners’ knowledge about a specific teaching content by researching, selecting and generating a test adapted to their level of knowledge. Once the evaluation is performed, a new course will be proposed. We also conducted an experiment based on determining the degree of student’s satisfaction. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Context; Mobile evaluation; Mobile technology; Semantic web","Interactive computer systems; Knowledge based systems; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Semantic Web; Teaching; Context; Educational assessment; Educational institutions; Evaluation problems; Knowledge construction; Mobile evaluation; Mobile Technology; Semantic Web technology; Web services",2-s2.0-85020413237

Based on cognitive load theory, there are theoretical reasons to hypothesize that exposure to new content in a foreign language without any foreign language instructional support may interfere with rather than facilitate learning compared to learning language and content separately. In three experiments conducted in higher education, a text was presented to 294 students in three different conditions: native language, foreign language, and foreign language with a translation into the native language. We varied the foreign language (English, German) and the domain (Law, Computer Science).

Alpha frequencies are modulated by working memory load and are used to process information during task switching, however we do not know how this oscillatory network communication is modulated. In order to understand the mechanisms that drive cognitive flexibility, ERPs, oscillatory power and how the communication within these networks is organized are of importance. The EEG data show that during phases reflecting preparatory processes to pre-activate task sets, alpha oscillatory power but not the small world properties of the alpha network architecture was modulated. During the switching only the N2 ERP component showed clear modulations. After the response, alpha oscillatory power reinstates and therefore seems to be important to deactivate or maintain the previous task set. For these reactive control processes the network architecture in terms of small-world properties is modulated. Effects of memory load on small-world aspects were seen in repetition trials, where small-world properties were higher when memory processes were relevant. These results suggest that the alpha oscillatory network becomes more small-world-like when reactive control processes during task switching are less complex. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"behavior; electroencephalogram; evoked response; modulation; oscillation; working memory",2-s2.0-85032186177

The second is the skill to express in turn its own emotional state, so that it can affect the customer buying decision, refining in the user the sense of interacting with a human-like companion.

The aim of present study was to explore the association between cognitive functions and cerebral functional connectivity, in default mode network, in migraine patients without and with aura, during interictal episodic attack. Methods: Twenty-eight migraine patients (14 without and 14 with aura) and 14 matched normal controls, were consecutively recruited. A battery of standardized neuropsychological test was administered to evaluate cognitive functions and all subjects underwent a resting state with high field fMRI examination. Results: Migraine patients did not show abnormalities in neuropsychological evaluation, while, we found a specific alteration in cortical network, if we compared migraine with and without aura. We observed, in migraine with aura, an increased connectivity in left angular gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, right insular cortex.

To probe this issue, we used resting state (N = 586) and behavioural (N = 255) data from a lifespan sample and tested the interactions among ten intrinsic neural systems, derived from a well-established whole-brain parcellation. Our results revealed three distinguishable profiles, whose expression strengthened with increasing age and which characterized developmental differences in connectivity within the ten systems, between networks thought to underlie cognitive control and non-control systems, and among the non-control networks. The within-network connectivity profile was typified by decreased connectivity within two external processing networks (auditory/language and ventral attention). The non-control-to-non-control connectivity profile was typified by increased separation between networks involved in external processing, including language (dorsal attention, auditory) and those linked to internally generated cognitions and category learning (default mode, subcortical). Finally, the third connectivity profile was characterized by increased coupling of the three control networks (frontoparietal, salience, cingulo-opercular) with one another and with the remaining systems, particularly the subcortical and the two networks showing declining segregation with age. All three profiles showed significant associations with behavior during young adulthood, although these effects were less discernible during early development (before the age of 21) and degraded during late middle age and older adulthood. An exception to this trend was observed with respect to the within-network connectivity profile, whose “precocious” expression during early development predicted superior cognitive functioning. These findings thus help explain lifespan changes in the quality of mental processes, while also pointing to distinguishable mechanisms, which aid behavioural performance during different life stages. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive flexibility; Development; Emotion processing; Functional networks; Verbal reasoning","adolescent; adult; adulthood; age distribution; aged; aging; anterior insula; Article; behavior; brain function; brain mapping; brain maturation; brain region; child; cognition; controlled study; dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; hearing; human; language processing; learning; lifespan; male; mental function; middle aged; nerve cell network; neuroimaging; operculum (brain); priority journal; resting state network; salience network; subcortex; thalamus; very elderly",2-s2.0-85029810661

Previous task-driven fMRI studies have suggested that psychopathic traits are associated with dysfunction of several brain areas involved in different cognitive functions (e.g., empathy, reward, and response inhibition etc.), but the relationship between psychopathic traits and intrinsic brain functional architecture has not yet been explored in CD. Using a holistic brain-wide functional connectivity analysis, this study delineated the alterations in brain functional networks in patients with conduct disorder. Compared with matched healthy controls, we found decreased anti-synchronization between the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and default mode network (DMN), and increased intra-network synchronization within the frontothalamic-basal ganglia, right frontoparietal, and temporal/limbic/visual networks in CD patients. Correlation analysis showed that the weakened FPN-DMN interaction was associated with CU traits, while the heightened intra-network functional connectivity was related to impulsivity traits in CD patients. Our findings suggest that decoupling of cognitive control (FPN) with social understanding of others (DMN) is associated with the CU traits, and hyper-functions of the reward and motor inhibition systems elevate impulsiveness in CD. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85029362180

The combination of such methods in an operational system is a technical challenge that requires efficient architectural solutions. In a robotic engineering context, where productivity is important, it is also important to minimize the effort for the development of new systems. As a response to these needs, this paper presents Aerostack, an open-source software framework for the development of aerial robotic systems. This framework facilitates the creation of UAS by providing a set of reusable components specialized in functional tasks of aerial robotics (trajectory planning, self localization, etc.) together with an integration method in a multi-layered cognitive architecture based on five layers: reactive, executive, deliberative, reflective and social. Compared to other software frameworks for UAS, Aerostack can provide higher degrees of autonomy and it is more versatile to be applied to different types of hardware (aerial platforms and sensors) and different types of missions (e.g. multi robot swarm systems). Aerostack has been validated during four years (since February 2013) by its successful use on many research projects, international competitions and public exhibitions. As a representative example of system development, this paper also presents how Aerostack was used to develop a system for a (fictional) fully autonomous indoors search and rescue mission. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Aerial robotics; Autonomous behavior; Distributed robot systems; MAV; Mobile robots; Multi-robot coordination; Quadrotor; Remotely operated vehicles; Robot architecture","Competition; Computer control systems; Computer programming; Industrial robots; Mobile robots; Multipurpose robots; Open source software; Remotely operated vehicles; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Software engineering; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial robotics; Autonomous behaviors; Distributed robot systems; Multi-robot coordination; Quad rotors; Robot architecture; Open systems",2-s2.0-85018431818

Disruption of orexin signaling leads to sleep disturbances and increased body mass index, but recent studies also indicate that orexin neuron activation improves learning and memory. We hypothesized that hippocampal orexin receptor activation improves memory. To test this idea, we obtained orexin/ataxin-3 (O/A3) mice, which become deficient in orexin neurons by about 12 weeks of age. We first measured hippocampal orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) gene expression and protein levels, then tested acquisition and consolidation of two-way active avoidance (TWAA) memory, a hippocampal-dependent learning and memory task. Finally, we determined if exogenous intra-hippocampal OXA treatment could reverse cognitive impairment (as determined by TWAA) in OA/3 mice. We showed that OX1R mRNA expression and protein levels were significantly elevated in O/A3 mice, indicating the potential for preserved orexin responsiveness. The O/A3 mice were significantly impaired in TWAA memory vs. control mice, but OXA treatment (both acute and chronic) reversed these memory deficits. These results demonstrate that orexin plays an important role in hippocampal-dependent consolidation of two-way active avoidance memory, and orexin replacement can rescue the cognitive impairment. © 2017","Hypocretin; Orexin 1 receptor; Orexin ataxin-3",,2-s2.0-85032817641

The participants had a Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score ≤7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≤14 and a Jin Fan's Attention Network Test alertness score of 50 ± 20 ms. The interventional product (placebo, A galanga proprietary extract [E-AG-01], caffeine, and a combination of E-AG-01 with caffeine) was administered to the participants, followed by sequential administration of the remaining interventions on the consecutive study visits; the effects on mental alertness, sustained attention, and sleep architecture, along with safety and tolerability, were analyzed by validated methods. Results: In the E-AG-01 group, the alertness score was increased by 11.65 ± 23.94, 12.50 ± 19.73, and 12.62 ± 0.68 ms from baseline at 1, 3 (p = 0.042), and 5 hours, respectively, indicating its efficacy to enhance mental alertness and the increase in alertness score as compared to placebo. In the composite group (E-AG-01 with caffeine), mean response time was significantly reduced, by 15.55 ms (p = 0.026) at 3 hours. Conclusions:A galanga (E-AG-01) induces a beneficial effect in mental alertness and the combination of A galanga with caffeine impedes the caffeine crash and improves sustained attention at 3 hours. Thus, these stimulant effects might yield a new usage for A galanga as a key ingredient in energy drinks or similar products. © 2017 American College of Nutrition.","Alertness; Alpinia galanga; attention; caffeine crash; energy drink; response time",,2-s2.0-85029532478

Three issues, namely uncertainty, temporal behaviour, unknown system order, are however uncharted by any existing McSLMs and all McSLMs in the literature are designed for classification problems. This paper proposes a novel McSLM, called Recurrent Interval-Valued Metacognitive Scaffolding Fuzzy Neural Network (RIVMcSFNN) and used to solve regression and time-series modelling problems from data streams. RIVMcSFNN presents a novel recurrent network architecture as a cognitive constituent, which features double local recurrent connections at both the hidden layer and the consequent layer. The new recurrent network architecture is driven by the interval-valued multivariate Gaussian function in the hidden node and the nonlinear Wavelet function in the consequent node. As with its predecessors, the RIVMcSFNN characterises an open structure, where it can automatically grow, prune, adjust, merge, recall its hidden node and can select relevant data samples on the fly using an online active learning methodology. The RIVMcSFNN is also equipped with the online dimensionality reduction technique to cope with the curse of dimensionality. All learning mechanisms are carried out in the single-pass and local learning mode and actualise the plug-and-play learning principle, which aims to minimise the use of pre-and/or post-training steps. The efficacy of our algorithm was tested using numerous data-driven modelling problems and comprehensive comparisons with its counterparts. The RIVMcSFNN demonstrated substantial improvements in both accuracy and complexity against existing variants of the McSLMs and EISs. © 2017","Evolving fuzzy system; Fuzzy neural network; Metacognitive learning; Online learning; Type-2 fuzzy system","Complex networks; Data communication systems; E-learning; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Network architecture; Scaffolds; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Evolving Fuzzy Systems; Evolving intelligent systems; Meta-cognitive learning; Metacognitive scaffoldings; Multivariate Gaussian functions; Online learning; Type-2 fuzzy systems; Education; accuracy; algorithm; Article; calculation; data analysis; fuzzy system; geometry; kernel method; linear system; machine learning; nonlinear system; prediction; priority journal; probability; recurrent interval valued metacognitive scaffolding fuzzy neural network; uncertainty; wavelet analysis",2-s2.0-85021191119

In this pilot study, we aimed to determine whether pre-treatment sleep spindle density predicts treatment response to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. Methods Twenty-four participants with chronic primary insomnia participated in a 6-week cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia performed in groups of 4–6 participants. Treatment response was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index measured at pre- and post-treatment, and at 3- and 12-months′ follow-up assessments. Secondary outcome measures were extracted from sleep diaries over 7 days and overnight polysomnography, obtained at pre- and post-treatment. Spindle density during stage N2–N3 sleep was extracted from polysomnography at pre-treatment. Hierarchical linear modeling analysis assessed whether sleep spindle density predicted response to cognitive-behavioral therapy. Results After adjusting for age, sex, and education level, lower spindle density at pre-treatment predicted poorer response over the 12-month follow-up, as reflected by a smaller reduction in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index over time. Reduced spindle density also predicted lower improvements in sleep diary sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset immediately after treatment. There were no significant associations between spindle density and changes in the Insomnia Severity Index or polysomnography variables over time. Conclusion These preliminary results suggest that inter-individual differences in sleep spindle density in insomnia may represent an endogenous biomarker predicting responsiveness to cognitive-behavioral therapy. Insomnia with altered spindle activity might constitute an insomnia subtype characterized by a neurophysiological vulnerability to sleep disruption associated with impaired responsiveness to cognitive-behavioral therapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarkers; Electroencephalography; Insomnia; Neural oscillations; Sleep spindles",,2-s2.0-85032800901

In silico studies showed similar binding interactions with acetylcholinisterase like Donepezil (DONO). In vitro DPPH assay, AchE activity inhibition assay and cell viability assay on SH-SY5Y cell line confirmed that OZ has good free radical scavenging and cholinesterase inhibitory activity as well as safety profile. OZ was evaluated in vivo for its effect in streptozotocin (STZ) induced sporadic Alzheimer's disease in rats. Maze tests reflected improvement in spatial cognitive behavior indicated by reduction in working memory and reference memory error. OZ showed anti-AchE, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. OZ showed effective anti-proinflammatory effects in cerebral milieu as indicated by significant reduction in active glial cells and found to improve synaptic connectivity. Thereby OZ reflected protection of the cerebral architecture against STZ induced damage.

Anger coordinates facial expressions, vocal changes, verbal arguments, the withholding of benefits, the deployment of aggression, and a suite of other cognitive and physiological variables in the service of leveraging bargaining position into better outcomes. The prototypical trigger of anger is an indication that the offender places too little weight on the angry individual's welfare when making decisions, i.e. the offender has too low a welfare tradeoff ratio (WTR) toward the angry individual. Twenty-three experiments in six cultures, including a group of foragers in the Ecuadorian Amazon, tested six predictions about the computational structure of anger derived from the recalibrational theory. Subjects judged that anger would intensify when: (i) the cost was large, (ii) the benefit the offender received from imposing the cost was small, or (iii) the offender imposed the cost despite knowing that the angered individual was the person to be harmed. Additionally, anger-based arguments conformed to a conceptual grammar of anger, such that offenders were inclined to argue that they held a high WTR toward the victim, e.g., “the cost I imposed on you was small”, “the benefit I gained was large”, or “I didn't know it was you I was harming.” These results replicated across all six tested cultures: the US, Australia, Turkey, Romania, India, and Shuar hunter-horticulturalists in Ecuador.

To fill this role, the heart demonstrates an impressive capacity to tightly regulate energy generation and consumption. Energy production and transfer within cardiac myocytes primarily relies on the process of oxidative phosphorylation. In the failing heart, there is an imbalance between the work of the cardiac system and the energy required to generate this work. This presence of this mismatch has given rise to the concept known as the energy starvation theory. This concept encapsulates observations such as perturbed substrate consumption, insufficient energy transfer and ingestion, reduced substrate and oxygen availability, and diminished energy production in the failing heart. Diminished available cellular energy may further result from a reduction in the biosynthesis of mitochondria and their protein synthesis and from global cellular architectural disarray. In essence, the energy starvation theory posits that cardiac pump function declines due to a reduction in oxygen and substrate availability, and thus leads to a total body starvation of systemic energy. This novel cognitive framework has led to encouraging new directions in a “metabolic therapeutic approach” for the failing heart. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bioenergetics; Cardiac myocyte architecture; Creatine kinase; Energy metabolism; Heart failure; Mitochondria architecture","adenosine triphosphate; creatine phosphate; fatty acid; glucose; hexosamine; mitochondrial protein; oxygen; reactive oxygen metabolite; autophagy; bioenergy; cell differentiation; cell energy; cytoarchitecture; energy consumption; energy transfer; energy yield; fatty acid metabolism; glucose metabolism; heart failure; heart function; high energy phosphate; human; ingestion; mitochondrial biogenesis; mitochondrial DNA disorder; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrion; nonhuman; oxidative phosphorylation; pentose phosphate cycle; phospholipid synthesis; protein expression; protein synthesis; reduction (chemistry); regulatory mechanism; Review; starvation",2-s2.0-85019833574

This possibility has traditionally been dismissed by many as emotions are frequently defined with reference to human subjective experience, and invertebrates are often not considered to have the neural requirements for such sophisticated abilities. However, emotions are understood in humans and other vertebrates to be multifaceted brain states, comprising dissociable subjective, cognitive, behavioural and physiological components. In addition, accumulating literature is providing evidence of the impressive cognitive capacities and behavioural flexibility of invertebrates. Alongside these, within the past few years, a number of studies have adapted methods for assessing emotions in humans and other animals, to invertebrates, with intriguing results. Sea slugs, bees, crayfish, snails, crabs, flies and ants have all been shown to display various cognitive, behavioural and/ or physiological phenomena that indicate internal states reminiscent of what we consider to be emotions. Given the limited neural architecture of many invertebrates, and the powerful tools available within invertebrate research, these results provide new opportunities for unveiling the neural mechanisms behind emotions and open new avenues towards the pharmacological manipulation of emotion and its genetic dissection, with advantages for disease research and therapeutic drug discovery. Here, we review the increasing evidence that invertebrates display some form of emotion, discuss the various methods used for assessing emotions in invertebrates and consider what can be garnered fromfurtheremotion research on invertebrates in terms of the evolution and underlying neural basis of emotion in a comparative context. © 2017 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.","Affective neuroscience; Biogenic amines; Cognitive bias; Computational modelling; Emotional states; Insects",,2-s2.0-85032659493

General intelligence represents a critical cognitive ability that has been well characterized by cognitive neuroscientists and psychologists alike, but the extent to which a driver of brain health, namely nutritional status, impacts the neural mechanisms that underlie general intelligence is not understood. This study therefore examined the relationship between the intrinsic connectivity networks supporting general intelligence and nutritional status, focusing on nutrients known to impact the metabolic processes that drive brain function. We measured general intelligence, favorable connective architecture of seven intrinsic connectivity networks, and seventeen plasma phospholipid monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids in a sample of 99 healthy, older adults. A mediation analysis was implemented to investigate the relationship between empirically derived patterns of fatty acids, general intelligence, and underlying intrinsic connectivity networks. The mediation analysis revealed that small world propensity within one intrinsic connectivity network supporting general intelligence, the dorsal attention network, was promoted by a pattern of monounsaturated fatty acids. These results suggest that the efficiency of functional organization within a core network underlying general intelligence is influenced by nutritional status. This report provides a novel connection between nutritional status and functional network efficiency, and further supports the promise and utility of functional connectivity metrics in studying the impact of nutrition on cognitive and brain health. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Functional connectivity; General intelligence; Monounsaturated fatty acids; Nutritional cognitive neuroscience; Saturated fatty acids","monounsaturated fatty acid; saturated fatty acid; adult; aged; Article; brain size; decision making; dorsal attention network; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; intelligence; male; Mediterranean diet; mental performance; neuropsychological test; normal human; nutrient; nutritional status; priority journal",2-s2.0-85028974953

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these symptoms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate extended pathological changes in the rat brain following mmTBI. Using the lateral fluid percussion (LFP) technique we exposed adult male Wistar rats to a mild TBI (mTBI) once a week for four weeks and compared them to surgical shams. At 90 days following the last TBI or sham procedure the animals were cognitively tested in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), euthanized, and the brains removed for immunohistochemistry. At 90 days following the last mTBI, NRF-2 staining was significantly decreased in the hilus of the hippocampus and cortex on the injured side, but did not significantly differ from shams on the un-injured side. CD68 positive microglia were significantly increased in the ipsilateral corpus callosum, cortex, and internal capsule of injured animals. Reactive astrocytosis, determined by increased GFAP staining, was also evident in the corpus callosum, cortex, internal capsule and thalamus on the injured side. Interestingly, the corpus callosum thickness at the midline was decreased in injured animals and had evident demyelination when compared to sham animals. Despite these findings, there were no significant differences in neurological assessments at 90 days following the last injury. In MWM testing there were not significant differences in the training phase, the time spent in the thigmotaxia zone, or the target quadrant during the probe trial. However, there were significant differences between shams and injured animals in platform zone crossings during the probe trial.

The work addresses the need for a consistent methodology to support solution-neutral function-based system decomposition analysis, facilitating the design, modeling, and analysis of complex systems architectures. A rigorous basis for the SSFD is established by defining conventions for states and function definitions and a representation scheme, underpinned by a critical review of existing literature. A set of heuristics are introduced to support the function decomposition analysis and to facilitate the deployment of the methodology with strong practitioner guidelines. The SSFD heuristics extend the existing framework of Otto and Wood (2001) by introducing a conditional fork node heuristic, to facilitate analysis and aggregation of function models across multiple modes of operation of the system. The empirical validation of the SSFD function modeling framework is discussed in relation to its application to two case studies: a benchmark problem (glue gun) set for the engineering design community; and an industrial case study of an electric vehicle powertrain. Based on the evidence from the two case studies presented in the paper, a critical evaluation of the SSFD function modeling methodology is discussed based on the function benchmarking framework established by Summers et al. (2013), considering the representation, modeling, cognitive, and reasoning characteristics. The significance of this paper is that it establishes a rigorous reference framework for the SSFD function representation and a consistent methodology to guide the practitioner with its deployment, facilitating its impact to industrial practice. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2017.","Function Modeling; Functional Architecture; Functional Requirements; State Diagrams; Systems Engineering","Benchmarking; Flowcharting; Large scale systems; Network function virtualization; Systems engineering; Function decomposition; Function modeling; Function representations; Functional architecture; Functional requirement; Multi-disciplinary systems; Multiple modes of operation; State diagram; Heuristic methods",2-s2.0-85029887714

The original model consisted of arrays of Wilson-Cowan type of neuronal populations representing primary and secondary visual cortices, inferotemporal (IT) cortex, and pFC. We added a module representing entorhinal cortex, which functions as a gating module. We successfully implemented multiple working memory tasks using the same model and produced neuronal patterns in visual cortex, IT cortex, and pFC that match experimental findings. These working memory tasks can include distractor stimuli or can require that multiple items be retained in mind during a delay period (Sternberg’s task). Besides electrophysiology data and behavioral data, we also generated fMRI BOLD time series from our simulation. Our results support the involvement of IT cortex in working memory maintenance and suggest the cortical architecture underlying the neural mechanisms mediating particular working memory tasks.

To fully exploit the capabilities of such vehicles, we propose a V-CCHN architecture where CR router enabled vehicles are employed to connect end devices to the V-CCHN and transport data to intended locations via storage of on-board CR routers and spectrum resources harvested from various systems. Considering the abundant storage of on-board CR routers and a wide range of under-utilized spectrum, the V-CCHN is expected to effectively transport substantial amounts of data between end devices and data networks, which offers an effective solution to handling the explosive wireless data traffic and well complements existing telecommunications networks.

Proponents of this view disagree, however, over the extent to which perception is direct on the predictive approach. I argue that we can resolve these disagreements by identifying three distinct notions of perceptual directness: psychological, metaphysical, and epistemological. I propose that perception is plausibly construed as psychologically indirect on the predictive approach, in the sense of being constructivist or inferential. It would be wrong to conclude from this, however, that perception is therefore indirect in a metaphysical or epistemological sense on the predictive approach. In the metaphysical case, claims about the inferential properties of constructivist perceptual mechanisms are consistent with both direct and indirect solutions to the metaphysical problem of perception (e.g. naïve realism, representationalism, sense datum theory). In the epistemological case, claims about the inferential properties of constructivist perceptual mechanisms are consistent with both direct and indirect approaches to the justification of perceptual belief. In this paper, I demonstrate how proponents of the predictive approach have conflated these distinct notions of perceptual directness and indirectness, and I propose alternative strategies for developing the philosophical consequences of the approach. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bayesian computation; Cognitive architecture; Direct perception; Indirect perception; Perceptual inference; Predictive coding",,2-s2.0-85032012304

This rule applies both on inter- and intraspecific comparisons. Only 1 species, the extremely small parasitic wasp Trichogramma evanescens, is known as an exception and shows an isometric brain-body size relation in an intraspecific comparison between differently sized individuals. Here, we investigated if such an isometric brain-body size relationship also occurs in an intraspecific comparison with a slightly larger parasitic wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, a species that may vary 10-fold in body weight upon differences in levels of scramble competition during larval development. We show that Nasonia exhibits diphasic brain-body size scaling: larger wasps scale allometrically, following Haller's rule, whereas the smallest wasps show isometric scaling. Brains of smaller wasps are, therefore, smaller than expected and we hypothesized that this may lead to adaptations in brain architecture. Volumetric analysis of neuropil composition revealed that wasps of different sizes differed in relative volume of multiple neuropils. The optic lobes and mushroom bodies in particular were smaller in the smallest wasps. Furthermore, smaller brains had a relatively smaller total neuropil volume and larger cellular rind than large brains. These changes in relative brain size and brain architecture suggest that the energetic constraints on brain tissue outweigh specific cognitive requirements in small Nasonia wasps. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

Astaxanthin (AST), a naturally occurring carotenoid, is reputable for its outstanding antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective and memory-enhancing effects of AST against DOX-induced behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities. Briefly, AST treatment (25 mg/kg) significantly protected against DOX-induced memory impairment. Furthermore, AST restored hippocampal histopathological architecture, halted DOX-induced oxidative and inflammatory insults, mitigated the increase in acetylcholinesterase activity, and consistently downregulated the overactive apoptotic machineries.

CHMI2 represents a new approach to aviation human factors engineering that introduces adaptive functionalities in the design of operators’ command, control and display functions. A CHMI2 system assesses human cognitive states based on measurement of key psycho-physiological observables. The cognitive states are used to predict and enhance operator performance in the accomplishment of aviation tasks, with the objective of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall human-machine teaming. The CHMI2 system presented in this paper employs a four-layer architecture comprising sensing, extraction, classification and adaptation functionalities. An overview of each layer is provided along with the layer’s metrics, algorithms and functions. Two relevant case studies are presented to illustrate the interactions between the different layers, and the conceptual design of the associated display formats is described. The results indicate that specific eye tracking variables provide discrimination between different modes of control. Furthermore, results indicate that the higher levels of automation supported by the CHMI2 are beneficial in Separation Assurance and Collision Avoidance (SA&amp;CA) scenarios involving low-detectability obstacles and stringent time constraints to implement recovery manoeuvres.

Participants completed a predictive-inference task designed to identify how action and confidence evolve in response to surprising changes in the environment. While OCD patients (like controls) correctly updated their confidence according to changes in the environment, their actions (unlike those of controls) mostly disregarded this knowledge.

Therefore, we can extract diverse information from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data by processing it at multiple resolutions. We propose a framework, called Hierarchical Multi-resolution Mesh Networks (HMMNs), which establishes a set of brain networks at multiple resolutions of fMRI signal to represent the underlying cognitive process. Our framework, first, decomposes the fMRI signal into various frequency subbands using wavelet transform. Then, a brain network is formed at each subband by ensembling a set of local meshes. Arc weights of each local mesh are estimated by ridge regression. Finally, adjacency matrices of mesh networks obtained at different subbands are used to train classifiers in an ensemble learning architecture, called fuzzy stacked generalization (FSG). Our decoding performances on Human Connectome Project task-fMRI dataset reflect that HMMNs can successfully discriminate tasks with 99% accuracy, across 808 subjects. Diversity of information embedded in mesh networks of multiple subbands enables the ensemble of classifiers to collaborate with each other for brain decoding. The suggested HMMNs decode the cognitive tasks better than a single classifier applied to any subband. Also mesh networks have a better representation power compared to pairwise correlations or average voxel time series. Moreover, fusion of diverse information using FSG outperforms fusion with majority voting. We conclude that, fMRI data, recorded during a cognitive task, provide diverse information in multi-resolution mesh networks. Our framework fuses this complementary information and boosts the brain decoding performances obtained at individual subbands. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Brain decoding; Ensemble models; fMRI data analysis; Hierarchical models; Mesh networks; Wavelet decomposition",,2-s2.0-85030529804

With respect to the former, we invoke the affordance competition hypothesis, according to which human behavior is produced by resolving the competition between action affordances that are simultaneously instantiated in response to the environment. From the theory of optimal control, we deploy motor primitives based on minimum jerk as the potential suite of actions. Furthermore, we invoke a layered control architecture, which carries out action priming and action selection sequentially, to model the biological affordance competition process. Motor output may be directed to distinct motor channels, which may be partially inhibited, e.g., to model gas pedal release saturation. Within this architecture, two types of motor units--''deceleration'' acting on a gas pedal channel and ''brake'' acting on a brake pedal channel--are sufficient to model, with remarkable accuracy, the various phases that can be observed in human maneuvers in stopping a car, namely: gas release, gas chocked, brake, and final brake release at stop. The model is validated using experimental data collected in 16 different stop locations, from roundabouts to traffic lights. We also carry out a comparison with the well-known Intelligent Driver Model, discuss the scaling of this framework to more general driving scenarios and finally give an example application where the driver model is used, within a mirroring process, to infer the human driver intentions.

The outcomes of the interplay can either be aligned or misaligned with ICT, which explains why certain aligned applications are rapidly adopted, whereas other applications are not.

A solution jointly addressing security, efficiency, privacy, and scalability is needed to support continued expansion. We propose a solution modeled on human use of context and cognition, leveraging cloud resources to facilitate IoT on constrained devices. We present an architecture applying process knowledge to provide security through abstraction and privacy through remote data fusion. We outline five architectural elements and consider the key concepts of the &#x201C;Data Proxy&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Cognitive Layer.&#x201D; The Data Proxy uses system models to digitally mirror objects with minimal input data, while the Cognitive Layer applies these models to monitor the system&#x2019;s evolution and to simulate the impact of commands prior to execution. The Data Proxy allows a system&#x2019;s sensors to be sampled to meet a specified &#x201C;Quality of Data&#x201D; (QoD) target with minimal resource use. The efficiency improvement of this architecture is shown with an example vehicle tracking application.

Such ascriptions are commonly associated with art objects, from narratives and texts to dramas and architecture. Consideration of anthropology and ethology of art reveals a relationship between skill and the sacred, which clarifies the origin and function of 'sacrality' as a cognitive experience characteristic of, but not exclusive to, religious behaviour. The same trait is operative in other behaviours, such as art and sport, but it is less restricted in art and less comprehensive sport. Nonetheless, art and sport (and other secular behaviours) do have an affinity with religious behaviour.

In this paper, we present the formal logical structure that is presupposed in a specific class of these processes: fast and frugal heuristics. We review the structure of these heuristics and show that they make a number of implicit assumptions resulting from the formal classical logic that underpins their structure. These assumptions lead to a number of predictions that are inconsistent with existing empirical data, but they follow primarily from the classical logic structure of heuristics and not from the rule-based cue processing approach itself. We introduce an alternative logic based on quantum theory that proposes a different and potentially more accurate set of underlying assumptions, and show that this framework addresses many of the issues arising from classical logic. We then demonstrate how heuristics can be reconstructed by integrating them with a quantum logic structure, examine the benefits that heuristics and quantum logic provide to one another, and outline the new questions and predictions that their integration yields. We contend that the integration of heuristics with quantum logic enhances both frameworks, improving heuristics as descriptive models by bringing them closer to the empirical data and grounding quantum logic in a psychological theory by giving it concrete processing rules to implement. ©2016 American Psychological Association.","Decision-making; Heuristics; Information theory; Logic; Quantum cognition",,2-s2.0-85030624361

Epilepsy is present in 70–75% of Patients and an age-dependent electroclinical pattern has been described. Up to date, there are studies with overnight sleep EEGs, probably because of the severe intellectual disability (ID) and hyperactivity of these Patients. Our purpose was to verify the hypothesis that MWS Patients might have electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES pattern). Methods A retrospective analysis of anamnestic and electrographic data was performed on 7 consecutive MWS Patients followed between 2007 and 2016. Only Patients with at least one overnight sleep EEG were included in the study. Results Five out of 7 Patients had overnight sleep EEG studies and were included in this study. All of them had an anterior ESES pattern with spike-and-wave index > 85%. The architecture of sleep was abnormal. An ESES related regression of cognitive and motor functions with impact on daily activities (ESES-related syndrome) was demonstrated in 3 out of 5 (60%) Patients. In two Patients marked improvement of cognitive and motor performances was observed when the epileptiform activity during sleep was successfully controlled or it was spontaneously reduced. Conclusions The clinical significance of the ESES pattern is hard to assess in MWS Patients due to severe ID, but changing in behaviour or in motor and cognitive functions should mandate sleep EEG investigation and, if ESES is present, an appropriate treatment should be tried. Furthermore, overnight sleep EEG recordings, if regularly performed in the follow up, might help to understand if ESES pattern hampers the cognitive and communicative profile in MWS. © 2017 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology","Epilepsy; Epileptic encephalopathy; ESES; Mowat–Wilson syndrome; Sleep","adolescent; adult; Article; child; clinical article; cognitive defect; daily life activity; disease severity; electroencephalogram; electrography; epileptic state; female; genetic disorder; human; male; motor dysfunction; Mowat Wilson syndrome; multiple malformation syndrome; rare disease; retrospective study; school child; sleep; slow wave sleep; spike wave",2-s2.0-85019124792

However, the effects of a single exercise session on cognitive functions are controversial. To address this issue, we measured hemodynamic changes in the brain during physical exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and investigated related effects on memory consolidation processes. Healthy young participants underwent two experimental visits. During each visit, they performed an associative memory task in which they first encoded a series of pictures, then spent 30-min exercising or resting, and finally were asked to recall the picture associations. We used NIRS to track changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration over the prefrontal cortex during exercise and rest. To characterize local tissue oxygenation and perfusion, we focused on low frequency oscillations in NIRS, also called vasomotion. We report a significant increase in associative memory consolidation after exercise, as compared to after rest, along with an overall increase in vasomotion. Additionally, performance improvement after exercise correlated positively with power in the neurogenic component (0.02 to 0.04 Hz) and negatively with power in the endothelial component (0.003 to 0.02 Hz). Overall, these results suggest that changes in vasomotion over the prefrontal cortex during exercise may promote memory consolidation processes. © 2014 The Authors.

These regions are old in phylogeny and have widespread connections with eulaminate neocortices, intricately linking areas associated with emotion and cognition. The ACC and pOFC have distinct cortical and subcortical connections and are also interlinked, but the pattern of their connections - which may be used to infer the flow of information between them - is not well understood. Here we found that pathways from ACC area 32 innervated all pOFC areas with a significant proportion of large and efficient terminals, seen at the level of the system and the synapse. The pathway from area 32 targeted overwhelmingly elements of excitatory neurons in pOFC, with few postsynaptic sites found on presumed inhibitory neurons. Moreover, pathways from area 32 originated mostly in the upper layers and innervated preferentially the middle-deep layers of the least differentiated pOFC areas, in a pattern reminiscent of feedforward communication. Pathway terminations from area 32 overlapped in the deep layers of pOFC with output pathways that project to the thalamus and the amygdala, and may have cascading downstream effects on emotional and cognitive processes and their disruption in psychiatric disorders. © The Author 2016.

Some inferential strategies, like take-the-best, assume that people consider relevant cues sequentially in order of decreasing validity. This assumption has been deemed cognitively implausible by some, who suggest memory retrieval principles to guide cue order. We test whether memory-based inferences are better described by a model considering cues in order of validity or in order of memory retrieval. In an experiment, we manipulated the frequency with which cues appeared in a learning phase, increasing retrieval fluency of cue values related to the more frequently appearing cue. In a subsequent decision phase, participants made a series of two-alternative decisions based on the learned cue values. We compared two sequential sampling models, which differed in whether cues are sampled in order of subjective cue validity or in order of retrieval fluency. To model retrieval order of cues in the fluency sampling model, we used the declarative memory theory embedded in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. Most participants' decisions were best described by the model sampling cues in order of memory retrieval. Only a minority of participants were classified as sampling cues by validity. Our result suggests that retrieval fluency is the primary driver of cue order in inferences from memory, irrespective of the cues' validities. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It has been argued that personal decisions are the leading cause of death, and 80% of healthcare expenditures result from physicians' decisions. Therefore, improving healthcare necessitates improving medical decisions, ie, making decisions (more) rational. Drawing on writings from The Great Rationality Debate from the fields of philosophy, economics, and psychology, we identify core ingredients of rationality commonly encountered across various theoretical models. Rationality is typically classified under umbrella of normative (addressing the question how people “should” or “ought to” make their decisions) and descriptive theories of decision-making (which portray how people actually make their decisions). Normative theories of rational thought of relevance to medicine include epistemic theories that direct practice of evidence-based medicine and expected utility theory, which provides the basis for widely used clinical decision analyses. Descriptive theories of rationality of direct relevance to medical decision-making include bounded rationality, argumentative theory of reasoning, adaptive rationality, dual processing model of rationality, regret-based rationality, pragmatic/substantive rationality, and meta-rationality. For the first time, we provide a review of wide range of theories and models of rationality. We showed that what is “rational” behaviour under one rationality theory may be irrational under the other theory. We also showed that context is of paramount importance to rationality and that no one model of rationality can possibly fit all contexts. We suggest that in context-poor situations, such as policy decision-making, normative theories based on expected utility informed by best research evidence may provide the optimal approach to medical decision-making, whereas in the context-rich circumstances other types of rationality, informed by human cognitive architecture and driven by intuition and emotions such as the aim to minimize regret, may provide better solution to the problem at hand. The choice of theory under which we operate is important as it determines both policy and our individual decision-making. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,2-s2.0-85031906678

Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), which examines the low-frequency component of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the absence of an explicit task, provides an efficient and powerful mechanism for studying functional brain networks even in low-functioning and young subjects. Studies using independent component analysis (ICA) have identified a set of resting-state networks (RSNs) that have been linked to distinct domains of cognitive and perceptual function, which are believed to reflect the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain. This study is the first to examine resting-state functional connectivity within these RSNs in FASD. Rs-fMRI scans were performed on 38 children with FASD (19 with either full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS), 19 nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE)), and 19 controls, mean age 11.3 ± 0.9 years, from the Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort. Nine resting-state networks were generated by ICA. Voxelwise group comparison between a combined FAS/PFAS group and controls revealed localized dose-dependent functional connectivity reductions in five regions in separate networks: anterior default mode, salience, ventral and dorsal attention, and R executive control. The former three also showed lower connectivity in the HE group. Gray matter connectivity deficits in four of the five networks appear to be related to deficits in white matter tracts that provide intra-RSN connections.

Several studies have shown that in healthy individuals sleep promotes memory consolidation. Notwithstanding this, the consequences of sleep disorders on offline memory consolidation remain poorly investigated. Research studies indicate that patients with insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and narcolepsy often exhibit sleep-related impairment in the consolidation of declarative and procedural information. On the other hand, patients with parasomnias, such as sleep-walking, night terrors and rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder, do not present any memory impairment. These studies suggest that only sleep disorders characterized by increased post-learning arousal and disrupted sleep architecture seem to be associated with offline memory consolidation issues. Such impairments, arising already in childhood, may potentially affect the development and maintenance of an individual's cognitive abilities, reducing their quality of life and increasing the risk of accidents. However, promising findings suggest that successfully treating sleep symptoms can result in the restoration of memory functions and marked reduction of direct and indirect societal costs of sleep disorders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Arousal; Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); Insomnia; Memory consolidation; Motor skills; Narcolepsy; Obstructive sleep apnea; Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; Sleepwalking","accident; disease predisposition; health care cost; human; insomnia; memory consolidation; narcolepsy; neurofeedback; nonREM sleep; population research; positive end expiratory pressure; quality of life; REM sleep; Review; risk factor; sleep disordered breathing; sleep quality; task performance",2-s2.0-85005822686

Today, ITSs are generally developed to support desktop training applications, with the most common domains involving cognitive problem solving tasks (e.g., mathematics and physics). In recent years, implementations of game-based tutors authored using the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open-source tutoring architecture, provided tailored training experiences for military tasks through desktop applications (e.g., games including Virtual Battlespace and Virtual Medic). However, these game-based desktop tutors have also been limited to adaptive instruction for cognitive tasks (e.g., problem solving and decision-making). The military requires adaptive instruction to extend beyond the desktop to be compatible with the physical nature of many tasks performed by soldiers, sailors, and airmen. This article examines how commercial sensor technologies might be adapted to work with GIFT and support tailored computer-guided instruction in the psychomotor domain for a military medical training task, specifically hemorrhage control. Toward this goal, we evaluated the usability and system features of commercial smart glasses and pressure-sensing technologies. Smart glasses were selected as the focus of this study over handheld mobile devices in order to promote a hands-free experience during the training of hemorrhage-control tasks on a mannequin. Pressure sensors were selected to provide direct measures of effectiveness during the application of tourniquets and pressure bandages. Each set of technologies (smart glasses and pressure sensors) was evaluated not with respect to each other, but with respect to their capabilities to support adaptive instruction in the wild at the learner’s point-of-need and criteria based on established usability heuristics. Instruction in the wild is training provided in an environment outside the classroom and areas where tracking and sensing infrastructure are available (e.g., deployed areas of operation). We examined a wide range of features and capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question: what system design features (e.g., usability and interaction) are needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual psychomotor task at the point-of-need in locations where no formal training infrastructure is available? © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Adaptive instruction; hemorrhage control; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; pressure-sensing technologies; psychomotor domain; smart glasses","Computer aided instruction; Decision making; Education computing; Glass; mHealth; Military applications; Mobile telecommunication systems; Personnel training; Pressure sensors; Problem solving; Teaching; Adaptive instruction; Intelligent tutoring system; Pressure sensing; Psychomotor domain; Smart glass; Adaptive control systems",2-s2.0-85031093002

Volumetric and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest a preferential involvement of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), particularly the hippocampus, in episodic and spatial memory processing. The present study examined how these two memory types were related in terms of their associated resting-state functional architecture. 3T multiband resting state fMRI scans from 497 participants (60–82 years old) of the cross-sectional Whitehall II Imaging sub-study were analysed using an unbiased, data-driven network-modelling technique (FSLNets). Factor analysis was performed on the cognitive battery; the Hopkins Verbal Learning test and Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure test factors were used to assess verbal and visuospatial memory respectively. We present a map of the macroscopic functional connectome for the Whitehall II Imaging sub-study, comprising 58 functionally distinct nodes clustered into five major resting-state networks. Within this map we identified distinct functional connections associated with verbal and visuospatial memory. Functional anticorrelation between the hippocampal formation and the frontal pole was significantly associated with better verbal memory in an age-dependent manner. In contrast, hippocampus–motor and parietal–motor functional connections were associated with visuospatial memory independently of age. These relationships were not driven by grey matter volume and were unique to the respective memory domain. Our findings provide new insights into current models of brain-behaviour interactions, and suggest that while both episodic and visuospatial memory engage MTL nodes of the default mode network, the two memory domains differ in terms of the associated functional connections between the MTL and other resting-state brain networks. © 2017 The Authors","Connectomics; Hippocampus; Network modelling; Resting-state fMRI; Verbal memory; Visuospatial memory","adult; aged; aging; Article; brain size; cognition; cross-sectional study; episodic memory; factor analysis; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gray matter; hippocampus; human; male; memory assessment; motor cortex; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; parietal cortex; priority journal; resting state network; spatial memory; verbal memory; very elderly; visuospatial memory",2-s2.0-85026380547

Performance of a group of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and taking dopaminergic medication was compared with that of matched healthy control (HC) participants. Behavioral results indicated that response latencies to the initial go signal did not distinguish between the 2 groups, but that stopping latencies were prolonged in PD patients. In addition, the change response was delayed in the clinical group, indicating difficulties in flexibly changing to alternative motor actions upon external cues. The change deficit in PD related to the inhibition deficit. This dependence points to a serial processing architecture in PD according to which the stopping process has to finish before the change process can be initiated. In contrast, the HC group showed parallel stop and change processing. Analyses of sequential trial effects suggest that both HC and PD patients are susceptible to aftereffects of action override, due to the consequences of the automatic retrieval of recent associations between action and goal representations. Interestingly, postchange performance of the clinical group was hampered disproportionately, suggesting that PD is associated with an impairment in overriding previously formed action-goal associations. These findings support the notion that both higher-order cognitive control processes, such as inhibiting and changing actions, as well as lower-order feature binding mechanisms rely on basal ganglia functioning and are compromised by the basal ganglia dysfunction caused by PD. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Aftereffects of action override; Inhibitory motor control; Parkinson's disease; SSRT; Stop-change task","dopamine receptor stimulating agent; aged; Article; basal ganglion; behavior assessment; brain function; clinical article; controlled study; executive function; female; goal attainment; human; latent period; male; motor control; motor function test; Parkinson disease; response time; stimulus response; stop change task; stop signal reaction time; Stroop test; task performance",2-s2.0-85027318485

Two experiments were carried out on the spacing effect that occurs when learning that is spaced by temporal gaps between learning episodes is superior to identical, massed learning with no gaps between learning episodes. Using primary school students learning mathematics, it was found that students obtained lower scores on a working memory capacity test (Experiments 1 and 2) and higher ratings of cognitive load (Experiment 2) after massed than after spaced practice. The reduction in working memory capacity may be attributed to working memory resource depletion following the relatively prolonged mental effort associated with massed compared to spaced practice.

Neural injury and associated neurocognitive disorders are common among persons living with HIV disease, who might therefore be susceptible to impairment in PM. Method: This literature review utilized a structured qualitative approach to summarize and evaluate our current understanding of PM functioning in people living with HIV disease. 33 studies of PM in HIV+ persons met criteria for inclusion. Results: Findings showed that HIV is associated with moderate deficits in PM, which appear to be largely independent of commonly observed comorbid factors. The pattern of PM deficits reveals dysregulation of strategic processes that is consistent with the frontal systems pathology and associated executive dysfunction that characterizes HIV-associated neural injury. The literature also suggests that HIV-associated PM deficits present a strong risk of concurrent problems in a wide range of health behaviors (e.g. medication non-adherence) and activities of daily living (e.g. employment). Early attempts to improve PM in HIV disease have revealed that supporting strategic processes might be effective for some individuals. Conclusions: HIV-associated PM deficits are common and exert a significant adverse effect on the daily lives and health of infected persons.

We sought to characterize brain functional topology in mid-stage PD patients under chronic antiparkinson treatment and explore the presence of correlation between reorganization of brain architecture and specific cognitive deficits. We explored networks topology and functional connectivity in 16 patients with PD and 16 matched controls through a graph theoretical analysis of resting state-functional MRI data, and evaluated the relationships between network metrics and cognitive performance. PD patients showed a preserved small-world network topology but a lower clustering coefficient in comparison with healthy controls. Locally, PD patients showed lower degree of connectivity and local efficiency in many hubs corresponding to functionally relevant areas. Four disconnected subnetworks were also identified in regions responsible for executive control, sensory-motor control and planning, motor coordination and visual elaboration. Executive functions and information processing speed were directly correlated with degree of connectivity and local efficiency in frontal, parietal and occipital areas. While functional reorganization appears in both motor and cognitive areas, the clinical expression of network imbalance seems to be partially compensated by the chronic levodopa treatment with regards to the motor but not to the cognitive performance.

When compared to correct responses, shorter reaction times are commonly observed behavioural feature of errors committed in typical conflict tasks. Yet, little is known about the origins of this phenomenon. In this study, EEG and fMRI experiments were conducted using the numerical version of the Stroop paradigm, which yielded unique behavioural outcomes. Particularly, errors in numerical comparison had shorter reaction times than correct trials, whereas physical comparison resulted in the opposite pattern. This criss–crossing interaction effect was used as a marker when exploring time-courses of brain activity. Group independent component analysis was applied to neurophysiological data and event-related analysis was conducted on the components’ time-courses. Results revealed one centro-parietal EEG component and one temporo-parietal fMRI neural network, which exhibited significant task and accuracy interactions. Showing linear increase that peaked right after the response onset, the activity of centro-parietal EEG component was linked to the decision variable signal, which reflects a process of accumulating evidence until reaching an action-triggering threshold. Both amplitude measurements and linear fits to the signal provided evidence for distinctive characteristics between numerical and physical comparisons, thereby explaining the behavioural outcomes: errors are committed due to accumulation of evidence in favour of the other (wrong) task instruction.

In the area of situation awareness, the observer is typically overwhelmed by information overload and by intrinsic difficulties of making sense of spatially distributed and temporal-ordered sensor observations. Thus, it is desirable to design effective decision-support systems and develop efficient methods to handle sensor data streams. The proposed work is for the comprehension of the situations evolving along the timeline and the projection of recognized situations in the near future. The system analyzes semantic sensor streams, it extracts temporal pattern describing events flow and provides useful insights with respect to the operators’ goals. We implement a hybrid solution for situation comprehension and projection that combines data-driven approach, by using temporal extension of Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis, and goal-driven approach, by using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. The cloud-based architecture integrates a distributed algorithm to perform Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis enabling to deal with deluge of sensor data stream acquired through a sensor-cloud architecture.

Therefore, each patient may carry an individual structural variant of DNA sequence (SV) with small insertions and deletions (INDELs) sometimes less than 10 bp. The transposable elements of the Tc1/mariner superfamily are often associated with hotspots for homologous recombination involved in human genetic disorders, such as Williams Beuren Syndromes (WBS) with LIM-kinase 1-dependent cognitive defects. The Drosophila melanogaster mutant agnts3 has unusual architecture of the agnostic locus harboring LIMK1: it is a hotspot of chromosome breaks, ectopic contacts, underreplication, and recombination. Here, we present the analysis of LIMK1-containing locus sequencing data in agnts3 and three D. melanogaster wild-type strains-Canton-S, Berlin, and Oregon-R. We found multiple strain-specific SVs, namely, single base changes and small INDEls. The specific feature of agnts3 is 28 bp A/T-rich insertion in intron 1 of LIMK1 and the insertion of mobile S-element from Tc1/mariner superfamily residing ~460 bp downstream LIMK1 3'UTR. Neither of SVs leads to amino acid substitutions in agnts3 LIMK1. However, they apparently affect the nucleosome distribution, non-canonical DNA structure formation and transcriptional factors binding. Interestingly, the overall expression of miRNAs including the biomarkers for human neurological diseases, is drastically reduced in agnts3 relative to the wild-type strains. Thus, LIMK1 DNA structure per se, as well as the pronounced changes in total miRNAs profile, probably lead to LIMK1 dysregulation and complex behavioral dysfunctions observed in agnts3 making this mutant a simple plausible Drosophila model for WBS. © 2017 Savvateeva-Popova, Zhuravlev, Brázda, Zakharov, Kaminskaya, Medvedeva, Nikitina, Tokmatcheva, Dolgaya, Kulikova, Zatsepina, Funikov, Ryazansky and Evgen'ev.","Drosophila; LIM-kinase 1; MicroRNA; Non-canonical DNA structures; Nucleosome formation probability; Transposable elements","LIM kinase 1; microRNA; transcription factor; 3' untranslated region; adult; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; animal model; Article; binding site; bioinformatics; comparative study; computer model; controlled study; correlation analysis; DNA polymorphism; DNA sequence; DNA structure; Drosophila; gene; gene amplification; gene insertion; gene locus; heat shock; indel mutation; LIMK1 gene; male; nonhuman; nucleosome; phenotype; protein expression; RNA binding; sequence homology; tc1 mariner transposon; transposon; Williams Beuren syndrome",2-s2.0-85030096858

We examined the associations between sleep architecture and the prospective risk of incident dementia in the community-based Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Methods: Our sample comprised a subset of 321 FHS Offspring participants who participated in the Sleep Heart Health Study between 1995 and 1998 and who were aged over 60 years at the time of sleep assessment (mean age 67 ± 5 years, 50% male). Stages of sleep were quantified using home-based polysomnography. Participants were followed for a maximum of 19 years for incident dementia (mean follow-up 12 ± 5 years). Results: We observed 32 cases of incident dementia; 24 were consistent with Alzheimer disease dementia. After adjustments for age and sex, lower REM sleep percentage and longer REM sleep latency were both associated with a higher risk of incident dementia. Each percentage reduction in REM sleep was associated with approximately a 9% increase in the risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio 0.91; 95% confidence interval 0.86, 0.97). The magnitude of association between REM sleep percentage and dementia was similar following adjustments for multiple covariates including vascular risk factors, depressive symptoms, and medication use, following exclusions for persons with mild cognitive impairment at baseline and following exclusions for early converters to dementia. Stages of non-REM sleep were not associated with dementia risk.

The primary (SI) and the secondary somatosensory (SII) cortices are known to differ in their neuroanatomical connections to prefrontal areas, as well as in their involvement to encode cognitive aspects of tactile processing. Here, we ask whether the area-specific processing architecture or the structural neuroanatomical connections with prefrontal areas determine the efficacy of sensorimotor integration processes for motor control. In a system neurophysiological study including EEG signal decomposition (i.e., residue iteration decomposition, RIDE) and source localization, we investigated this question using vibrotactile stimuli optimized for SI or SII processing. The behavioral data show that when being triggered via the SI area, inhibitory control of motor processes is stronger as when being triggered via the SII area. On a neurophysiological level, these effects were reflected in the C-cluster as a result of a temporal decomposition of EEG data, indicating that the sensory processes affecting motor inhibition modulate the response selection level. These modulations were associated with a stronger activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus extending to the right middle frontal gyrus as parts of a network known to be involved in inhibitory motor control when response inhibition is triggered over SI. In addition, areas important for sensorimotor integration like the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal cortex showed activation differences. The data suggest that connection patterns are more important for sensorimotor integration and control than the more restricted area-specific processing architecture. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany","EEG; Motor control; Neurophysiology; Somatosensory system; Source localization",,2-s2.0-85029511796

In this context, we investigate the impact of imperfect CSI of both desired satellite link and harmful terrestrial interference link on the power control scheme in cognitive satellite terrestrial networks.

Although the redundant homogeneous networks are designed to increase the reliability, the common cause failures cannot be ignored caused by the similar deep fading features of channels due to the consistent deployment. As a result, an integrated architecture of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2I) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) is proposed in the paper which can reduce the probabilities of common cause failures.

A strong reading, which is compatible with many characterizations of penetration, posits a highly specific and directed influence on perception. According to this view, which I call the “internal effect view” (IEV) a cognitive state penetrates a perceptual process if the presence of the cognitive state causes a change to the computation performed by the process, with the result being a distinct output. I produce a novel argument that this strong reading is false. On one well-motivated way of drawing the distinction between perceptual states and cognitive states, cognitive representations cannot play the computational role posited for them by IEV, vis-à-vis perception. This does not mean, however, that there are not important causal relationships between cognitive and perceptual states. I introduce an alternative view of these relationships, the “external effect view” (EEV). EEV posits that each cognitive state is associated with a broad range of possible perceptual outcomes, and biases perception towards any of those perceptual outcomes without determining specific perceptual contents. I argue that EEV captures the kinds of cases philosophers have thought to be evidence for IEV, and a wide range of other cases as well. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cognition; Cognitive architecture; Cognitive penetration; Perception",,2-s2.0-84966693502

Therefore, to exhibit the importance of spectral efficiency, a system model is proposed for cooperative centralized and distributed spectrum sensing in vehicular networks. The proposed architecture is used to minimize both the spectral scarcity and high mobility issues. Furthermore, we analyze the decision fusion techniques in cooperative spectrum sensing for vehicular networks. In addition, a system model is designed for decision fusion techniques using renewal theory, and then, we analyze the probability of detection of primary channel and the average waiting time for CR user or secondary user in PU transmitter. Finally, mathematical analysis is performed to check the probability of detection and false alarm. The results show that the cooperative cognitive model is more suitable for vehicular networks that minimize interference and hidden PU problem. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Centralized spectrum sensing; cognitive radio (CR); decision fusion controller (DFC); distributed spectrum sensing","Decision theory; Efficiency; Wireless telecommunication systems; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Cognitive intelligence; Decision fusion; Mathematical analysis; Probability of detection; Proposed architectures; Spectrum sensing; Vehicular communications; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85028952955

However, the effects of experimental fasting cannot be generalized to fasting during Ramadan due to its unique characteristics. Therefore, there has been increased interest in studying the effects of fasting during Ramadan on sleep patterns, daytime sleepiness, cognitive function, sleep architecture, and circadian rhythm. Method: In this review, we critically discuss the current research findings in those areas during the month of Ramadan. Results: Available data that controlled for sleep/wake schedule, sleep duration, light exposure, and energy expenditure do not support the notion that Ramadan intermittent fasting increases daytime sleepiness and alters cognitive function. Additionally, recent well-designed studies showed no effect of fasting on circadian rhythms. However, in non-constrained environments that do not control for lifestyle changes, studies have demonstrated sudden and significant delays in bedtime and wake time. Conclusions: Studies that controlled for environmental factors and sleep/wake schedule reported no significant disturbances in sleep architecture. Nevertheless, several studies have consistently reported that the main change in sleep architecture during fasting is a reduction in the proportion of REM sleep. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alertness; Caloric intake; Chronotype; Cognitive function; Food; Light; Sleep architecture","circadian rhythm; cognition; daytime somnolence; diet restriction; energy expenditure; environmental factor; human; Islam; light exposure; Muslim; polysomnography; priority journal; Ramadan; Review; sleep; sleep pattern; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; somnolence; systematic review",2-s2.0-85012117838

Network models of ASD address core symptoms but not comorbid executive dysfunction. Following recent demonstrations in healthy adults that, with increasing executive demands, hubs embedded within frontoparietal-insular control networks interact with a more diverse set of networks, we hypothesized that the capability of hubs to do so is perturbed in ASD and predicts executive behavior. Methods Seventy-five 7- to 13-year-old children with ASD (n = 35) and age- and IQ-matched typically developing control subjects (n = 40) completed both a resting-state and a selective attention task functional magnetic resonance imaging session. We assessed changes in the participation coefficient, a graph theory metric indexing hubness, of 264 brain regions comprising 12 functional networks between the two sessions. Parent reported executive impairment in everyday life was measured using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Results The participation coefficient of the frontoparietal-insular cortex, including core nodes of the frontoparietal control and salience networks, significantly increased in typically developing children but not in children with ASD during the task relative to rest. Change in frontoparietal-insular participation coefficient predicted Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function scores indexing the ability to attend to task-oriented output, plan and organize, and sustain working memory. Conclusions Our results suggest that executive impairments in ASD emerge from a failure of frontoparietal-insular control regions to function as adaptive and integrative hubs in the brain's functional network architecture.

Here we discuss how epigenomic studies in human brain could guide animal work to test the impact of disease-associated alterations in chromatin structure and function on cognition and behavior. For example, transcription factors such as MYOCYTE-SPECIFIC ENHANCER FACTOR 2C (MEF2C), or multiple regulators of the open chromatin mark, methyl-histone H3-lysine 4, are associated with the genetic risk architectures of common psychiatric disease and alterations in chromatin structure and function in diseased brain tissue. Importantly, these molecules also affect cognition and behavior in genetically engineered mice, including virus-mediated expression changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and other key nodes in the circuitry underlying psychosis. Therefore, preclinical and small laboratory animal work could target genomic sequences affected by chromatin alterations in SCZ.

Yet, little is known about how those processes are modulated by hangover effects. Given that acute intoxication and hangover seem to be characterized by partly divergent effects and mechanisms, further research on this topic is needed. In the current study, we hence investigated this with a special focus on potentially differential effects of alcohol intoxication and subsequent hangover on sub-processes involved in the decision to select a response. We do so combining drift diffusion modeling of behavioral data with neurophysiological (EEG) data. Opposed to common sense, the results do not show an impairment of all assessed measures. Instead, they show specific effects of high dose alcohol intoxication and hangover on selective drift diffusion model and EEG parameters (as compared to a sober state). While the acute intoxication induced by binge-drinking decreased the drift rate, it was increased by the subsequent hangover, indicating more efficient information accumulation during hangover. Further, the non-decisional processes of information encoding decreased with intoxication, but not during hangover. These effects were reflected in modulations of the N2, P1 and N1 event-related potentials, which reflect conflict monitoring, perceptual gating and attentional selection processes, respectively. As regards the functional neuroanatomical architecture, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as occipital networks seem to be modulated.

Ants provide an informative system to study the relationship of neural architecture and development because worker tasks and sensory inputs may change with age. Additionally, tasks may be divided among morphologically and behaviorally differentiated worker groups (subcastes), reducing repertoire size through specialization and aligning brain structure with task-specific cognitive requirements. We hypothesized that division of labor may decrease developmental neuroplasticity in workers due to the apparently limited behavioral flexibility associated with task specialization. To test this hypothesis, we compared macroscopic and cellular neuroanatomy in two ant sister clades with striking contrasts in worker morphological differentiation and colony-level social organization: Oecophylla smaragdina, a socially complex species with large colonies and behaviorally distinct dimorphic workers, and Formica subsericea, a socially basic species with small colonies containing monomorphic workers. We quantified volumes of functionally distinct brain compartments in newly eclosed and mature workers and measured the effects of visual experience on synaptic complex (microglomeruli) organization in the mushroom bodies—regions of higher-order sensory integration—to determine the extent of experience-dependent neuroplasticity. We demonstrate that, contrary to our hypothesis, O. smaragdina workers have significant age-related volume increases and synaptic reorganization in the mushroom bodies, whereas F. subsericea workers have reduced age-related neuroplasticity. We also found no visual experience-dependent synaptic reorganization in either species. Our findings thus suggest that changes in the mushroom body with age are associated with division of labor, and therefore social complexity, in ants. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Previous studies suggest that not all neurons respond in the same way and that changes to neuronal architecture may be subtype specific. The current study aimed to characterize the response of interneurons to TBI. To model TBI in vitro, the neurites of primary cortical neurons were transected at 15 days in vitro. In response, calretinin+ interneurons underwent significant neurite remodeling around the injury site. By examining the response of pyramidal neurons, GAD67-GFP+ interneurons, and calretinin+ interneurons to the injury, we found that this response was specific to the calretinin+ cells. To determine whether calretinin+ interneurons respond in this way to a clinically relevant in vivo model of mild diffuse and focal injury, we subjected mice to the lateral fluid percussion injury model. We found that calretinin+ interneuron density was unaltered by this mild injury, but consistent with our in vitro data, these neurons underwent morphological alterations in their dendrites. These alterations evolved over a 28-day period, and calretinin+ interneurons in the injured mice had a reduction in mean dendrite length and reduced number of secondary dendrites than those in the sham-injured controls by 7 days post-injury. Further, these structural alterations were accompanied by a reduction in the frequency of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents in layer V pyramidal neurons. These data suggest that even a mild TBI can lead to an overall change in the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the cortex that may play an important role in the longer-term behavioral pathology associated with mild TBI. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","calretinin; cortex; GAD67; interneuron; mild traumatic brain injury; mouse",,2-s2.0-85028331120

As such, the DLPFC is commonly activated in experimental pain studies, and shows abnormally increased function in chronic pain populations. Furthermore, several studies have shown that some chronic pains are associated with decreased left DLPFC gray matter and that successful interventions can reverse this structural abnormality. In addition, studies have indicated that noninvasive stimulation of the left DLPFC effectively treats some chronic pains. In this article, we review the neuroimaging literature regarding the role of the DLPFC and its potential as a therapeutic target for chronic pain conditions, including studies showing the involvement of the DLPFC in encoding and modulating acute pain and studies demonstrating the reversal of DLPFC functional and structural abnormalities after successful interventions for chronic pain. We also review studies of noninvasive brain stimulation of the DLPFC showing acute pain modulation and some effectiveness as a treatment for certain chronic pain conditions. We further discuss the network architecture of the DLPFC, and postulate mechanisms by which DLPFC stimulation alleviates chronic pain. Future work testing these mechanisms will allow for more effective therapies. Perspective The structure and function of the DLPFC is abnormal in some chronic pain conditions.

Participants were classified into higher-income and lower-income groups based on family income, and performed a WM task with a parametric manipulation of WM load (N-back task) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behaviorally, the higher-income group had greater WM capacity and higher mathematics achievement scores. Neurally, the higher-income group showed greater activation as a function of WM load in bilateral prefrontal, parietal, and other regions, although the lower-income group exhibited greater activation at the lowest load. Both groups exhibited positive correlations between parietal activations and mathematics achievement scores, but only the higher-income group exhibited a positive correlation between prefrontal activations and mathematics scores. Most of these findings were maintained when higher- and lower-income groups were matched on WM task performance or nonverbal IQ. Findings indicate that the functional neural architecture of WM varies with family income and is associated with education measures of mathematics achievement. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,2-s2.0-84978646288

However, changes in dynamic FC (dFC) remain unknown. We aimed to identify altered dFC within the default mode network (DMN) associated with MHE. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI data were acquired from 20 cirrhotic patients with MHE and 24 healthy controls. DMN seed regions were defined using seed-based FC analysis (centered on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)). Dynamic FC architecture was calculated using a sliding time-window method. K-means clustering (number of clusters = 2–4) was applied to estimate FC states. Results: When the number of clusters was 2, MHE patients presented weaker connectivity strengths compared with controls in states 1 and 2. In state 1, decreased FC strength was found between the PCC/precuneus (PCUN) and right medial temporal lobe (MTL)/bilateral lateral temporal cortex (LTC); left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and right MTL/left LTC; right IPL and right MTL/bilateral LTC; right MTL and right LTC; and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and right MTL/bilateral LTC. In state 2, reduced FC strength was observed between the PCC/PCUN and bilateral MTL/bilateral LTC; left IPL and left MTL/bilateral LTC/MPFC; and left LTC and right LTC. Altered connectivities from state 1 were correlated with patient cognitive performance. Similar findings were observed when the number of clusters was set to 3 or 4. Conclusion: Aberrant dynamic DMN connectivity is an additional characteristic of MHE. Dynamic connectivity analysis offers a novel paradigm for understanding MHE-related mechanisms. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Cirrhosis; Default mode network; Dynamic functional connectivity; Minimal hepatic encephalopathy; Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging","adult; Article; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; default mode network; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; hepatic encephalopathy; human; image processing; liver cirrhosis; male; medial prefrontal cortex; medial temporal lobe; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; posterior cingulate; precuneus; priority journal",2-s2.0-85023765730

This Common EF factor is highly stable in adolescence through young adulthood, correlates with other important cognitive abilities, and is explained largely by genetic influences. However, little is known about Common EF beyond young adulthood. This study examines 3 hypotheses regarding the latent structure, genetic/environmental etiology, and cognitive correlates of Common EF in middle age. Method: We examined data from 1,284 middle-aged twins (51-60 years) in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging who completed 7 neuropsychological measures of EFs, as well as measures of general cognitive ability and processing speed. Results: Our confirmatory factor analysis indicated that Common EF explained variation across all 7 EF tasks. Inhibition and shifting were subsumed entirely under the Common EF factor, and there was an additional working memory span-specific factor. Common EF was heritable in midlife (a2 = .46), with additional evidence for both shared environmental influences (c2 = .41) and nonshared environmental influences (e2 = .13). Higher Common EF was moderately associated with higher general cognitive ability, measured both in early adulthood and midlife, and faster processing speed in midlife. These correlations were primarily driven by shared genetic influences. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that Common EF captures similar EF abilities in midlife as in adolescence and young adulthood. However, environmental influences may explain a larger portion of variance in this construct as individuals age.

In addition, the use of monitoring and data analytics help to maintain the required network performance, while reducing total cost of ownership. In this paper, an architecture to enable autonomic slice networking is presented. Extended nodes make local decisions close to network devices, whereas centralized domain systems collate and export metered data transparently to customer controllers, all of them leveraging customizable and isolated data analytics processes. Discovered knowledge can be applied for both proactive and reactive network slice reconfiguration, triggered either by service providers or customers, thanks to the interaction with state-of-the-art software-defined networking controllers and planning tools. The architecture is experimentally demonstrated by means of a complex use case for a multi-domain multilayer MPLS-over-optical network. In particular, the use case consists of the following Observe-Analyze-Act loops: i) proactive network slice rerouting after BER degradation detection in a lightpath supporting a virtual link (vlink); ii) reactive core network restoration after optical link failure; and iii) reactive network slice rerouting after the degraded lightpath is restored.

Within dynamic field theory, the DNFs have been used as building blocks in architectures to model sensorimotor embedding of cognitive processes. Typically, the parameters of a DNF in an architecture are manually tuned in order to achieve a specific dynamic behavior (e.g., decision making, selection, or working memory) for a given input pattern. This manual parameters search requires expert knowledge and time to find and verify a suited set of parameters. The DNF parametrizationmay be particular challenging if the input distribution is not known in advance, e.g., when processing sensory information. In this paper, we propose the autonomous adaptation of the DNF resting level and gain by a learning mechanism of intrinsic plasticity (IP). To enable this adaptation, an input and output measure for the DNF are introduced, together with a hyper parameter to define the desired output distribution. The online adaptation by IP gives the possibility to pre-define the DNF output statistics without knowledge of the input distribution and thus, also to compensate for changes in it. The capabilities and limitations of this approach are evaluated in a number of experiments. © 2017 Strub, Schöner, Wörgötter and Sandamirskaya.","Adaptation; Dynamic neural fields; Dynamics; Intrinsic plasticity","Decision making; Dynamical systems; Dynamics; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Neural networks; Adaptation; Dynamic field theories; Dynamic neural fields; Dynamical systems model; Input distributions; Intrinsic plasticity; Output distribution; Sensory information; Memory architecture; human; learning; nervous system; plasticity; statistics",2-s2.0-85032029127

To address these problems, ontologies are widely used in biomedical research to obtain common vocabularies and logical descriptions, but its application may suffer from scalability issues, domain bias, and loss of low-level data access. With the aim of improving the application of semantic models in biobanking systems, an incremental semantic framework that takes advantage of the latest advances in biomedical ontologies and the XNAT platform is designed and implemented.

This limit is thought to arise from the brain’s capacity to flexibly reconfigure interactions between spatially distributed networks. Recent work, however, has suggested that reconfigurations of task-related networks are modest when compared with intrinsic “resting-state” network architecture. Here we combined resting-state and task-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine how flexible, task-specific reconfigurations associated with increasing reasoning demands are integrated within a stable intrinsic brain topology. Human participants (21 males and 28 females) underwent an initial resting-states can, followed by a cognitive reasoning task involving different levels of complexity, followed by a second resting-state scan. The reasoning task required participants to deduce the identity of a missing element in a 4 = 4 matrix, and item difficulty was scaled parametrically as determined by relational complexity theory. Analyses revealed that external task engagement was characterized by a significant change in functional brain modules. Specifically, resting-state and null-task demand conditions were associated with more segregated brain-network topology, whereas increases in reasoning complexity resulted in merging of resting-state modules. Further increments in task complexity did not change the established modular architecture, but affected selective patterns of connectivity between frontoparietal, subcortical, cingulo-opercular, and default-mode networks. Larger increases in network efficiency within the newly established task modules were associated with higher reasoning accuracy. Our results shed light on the network architectures that underlie external task engagement, and highlight selective changes in brain connectivity supporting increases in task complexity. © 2017 the author.","Complexity; Connectivity; FMRI; Modularity; Network; Reasoning","adult; algorithm; architecture; Article; brain network architecture; brain topology; cognition; cognitive reasoning; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional brain module; functional connectivity; functional connectivity network construction; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; neuroimaging; normal human; priority journal; reasoning accuracy; resting state network; task complexity; task performance; young adult; adaptation; adolescent; biological model; brain; cognition; computer simulation; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; rest; statistical model; thinking; Adaptation, Physiological; Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Cognition; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Nerve Net; Neuronal Plasticity; Rest; Thinking; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85028651187

In power and cost limited applications, e.g., for sensor nodes in the Internet of Things, wideband RF feature extraction with conventional, Nyquist-rate analog-to-digital converters is infeasible. However, the structure of many RF features (such as signal sparsity) enables the use of compressive sensing (CS) techniques that acquire such signals at sub-Nyquist rates; while such CS-based analog-to-information (A2I) converters have the potential to enable low-cost and energy-efficient wideband RF sensing, they suffer from a variety of real-world limitations, such as noise folding, low sensitivity, aliasing, and limited flexibility. This paper proposes a novel CS-based A2I architecture called non-uniform wavelet sampling. Our solution extracts a carefully-selected subset of wavelet coefficients directly in the RF domain, which mitigates the main issues of existing A2I converter architectures. For multi-band RF signals, we propose a specialized variant called non-uniform wavelet bandpass sampling (NUWBS), which further improves sensitivity and reduces hardware complexity by leveraging the multi-band signal structure. We use simulations to demonstrate that NUWBS approaches the theoretical performance limits of &#x2113;&#x2081;-norm-based sparse signal recovery.

In what ways do these pathways differ? By originating and terminating in different laminae, and by selectively targeting specific populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, these “interareal” pathways can differentially control the timing and strength of synaptic inputs onto individual neurons, resulting in layer-specific computations.

A critical realist perspective was adopted and a systematic combining approach was employed to support data collection and analysis. Data were collected through a longitudinal case study of a large design–build project in Canada. The unit of analysis was the individual project team member. Five cognitive determinants identified from the analysis are seen to inform an individual’s framing of event patterns in the context of BIM-enabled collaboration: requirements, expectations, intentions, incentives and capabilities. From this perspective, the impact of BIM on collaboration is understood as a reshaping of an individual’s cognitive determinants, which influence a team member’s framing of event patterns enacted throughout project delivery.

Here, an antibody-mimetic self-assembling peptoid nanosheet containing surface-exposed Aβ42-recognizing loops is constructed, and a label-free sensor for the detection of AD serum is developed. The loop-displaying peptoid nanosheet is demonstrated to have high affinity to serum Aβ42, and to be able to identify AD sera with high sensitivity. The dense distribution of molecular recognition loops on the robust peptoid nanosheet scaffold not only mimics the architecture of antibodies, but also reduces the nonspecific binding in detecting multicomponent samples. This antibody-mimetic 2D material holds great potential toward the blood-based diagnosis of AD, and meanwhile provides novel insights into the antibody alternative engineering and the universal application in biological and chemical sensors. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although IDyOT is designed at a level more abstract than the neural, so it is a model of cognitive function, rather than neural processing, there are strong similarities between the composite structures developed in IDyOT and the NBA.

As a result, humans are almost continuously exposed to unintentional artificial light. We explored the independent and combined effects of two aspects of screen illumination, light wavelength, and intensity, on sleep, its biological regulation, and related functional outcomes. The 2 × 2 repeated-measure design included two independent variables: screen light intensity (low ([LI] versus high [HI]) and wavelength (short [SWL] versus long [LWL]). Nineteen participants (11F, 8M; mean age 24.3 [±2.8] years) underwent four light conditions, LI/SWL, HI/SWL, LI/LWL, and HI/LWL, in counterbalanced order. Each light exposure lasted for two hours (21:00–23:00), following which participants underwent an overnight polysomnography. On each experimental night, oral temperature and urine samples (for melatonin analysis) were collected at multiple time points. Each morning, participants filled out questionnaires and conducted a computerized attention task. Irrespective of light intensity, SWL illumination significantly disrupted sleep continuity and architecture and led to greater self-reported daytime sleepiness. SWL light also altered biological rhythms, subduing the normal nocturnal decline in body temperature and dampening nocturnal melatonin secretion. Light intensity seemed to independently affect sleep as well, but to a lesser degree. Both light intensity and wavelength negatively affected morning attention. In sum, light wavelength seems to have a greater influence than light intensity on sleep and a wide-range of biological and behavioral functions. Given the widespread use of electronic devices today, our findings suggest that screen light exposure at evening may have detrimental effects on human health and performance. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Chronobiology; cognitive function; digital media; intensity; light; melatonin; sleep; thermoregulation; wavelength",,2-s2.0-85019761999

The aim is to improve the quality of mobile learning services in term of information availability (hit rates and byte hit rates), learners’ average latency and the cognitive profiles of students.

In cognitive radio network (CRN), the secondary users (SUs) are connected under the leased spectrum of primary user (also called, licensed user) and hence often called opportunistic network. The emerging trend is to maximize the channel utilization in CRN. However, the computational activities performed by the SUs depend on the activity of primary user. Thus, in general, CRN is highly dynamic and network architectures are short lived. Many applications require a leader node to carry out better coordination among the participating nodes. The CRN being a highly dynamic network, the leader election is more challenging than in other networks. The leader node coordinates the activities of SUs and regulates the appropriate channel among them keeping in view the behavioral activities of PUs, which leads to enhanced channel utilization.

DB design is flexible and adaptive among frequencies, bandwidths, and interferences. In this work, we design a cognitive radio testbed for SATCOM for digital beamforming design and implementation. The testbed is capable of simultaneously capturing signals from multiple antennas. Considering the conditions of jamming or interference, the design implements spectrum detection and compressive sensing for channel condition monitoring in a real time. Using the analyzed jammer and interference information, the incoming signal can be moved into a different frequency where the channel is vacant or at least meets acceptable conditions. The beamforming design is also adaptive to the frequency where each beam is weighted differently for a given channel condition. In addition, the satellite antenna array is used to determine the signal direction of arrival (DoA), The DB is capable of forming the beam in the direction that avoids interference and jamming. Moreover, the detection of the jamming signal direction can help localize the jammer.

Current methods for communication and tracking of deep space probes use ground based systems such as the Deep Space Network (DSN). However, the increased communication demand will require radically new methods to ease communication congestion. Networks of communication relay satellites located at strategic locations such as geostationary orbit and Lagrange points are potential solutions. Instead of one large communication relay satellite, we could have scores of small satellites that utilize phase arrays to effectively operate as one large satellite. Excess payload capacity on rockets can be used to warehouse more small satellites in the communication network. The advantage of this network is that even if one or a few of the satellites are damaged or destroyed, the network still operates but with degraded performance. The satellite network would operate in a distributed architecture and some satellites maybe dynamically repurposed to split and communicate with multiple targets at once. The potential for this alternate communication architecture is significant, but this requires development of satellite formation flying and networking technologies.

Basic brain processes representing synaptic plasticity are first abstracted through asynchronous communication protocols and implemented as virtual microcircuits. These are used in turn to build mesoscale circuits embodying parallel cognitive processes. Encoding these circuits into symbolic expressions gives finally rise to neuro-inspired programs that are compiled into pseudo-code to be interpreted by a virtual machine. Quantitative evaluation measures are given by the modification of synapse weights over time. This approach is illustrated by models of simple forms of behaviors exhibiting cognition up to the third level of animal awareness. As a potential benefit, symbolic models of emergent psychological mechanisms could lead to the discovery of the learning processes involved in the development of cognition.

Participants were slower and less accurate when nonsymbolic dimensions of printed fractions were incongruent with the symbolic comparison decision.

However, recent field tests show that wireless links in smart grid environments have higher packet error rates and variable link capacity because of dynamic topology changes, obstructions, electromagnetic interference, equipment noise, multipath effects, and fading. To overcome these communication challenges, in this paper, we propose a data capacity-aware channel assignment (DCA) and fish bone routing (FBR) algorithm for WSN-based smart grid applications. The proposed DCA framework deals with the channel scarcities by dynamically switching between different spectrum bands and employs a network for organizing WSN into a highly stable connected hierarchy. In addition, the proposed FBR mechanism provides robust loop free data paths and avoids high transmission cost, excessive end-to-end delay and restricts unnecessary multi-hop data transmission from the source to destination in the network. Thus, it significantly reduces the probability of data packet loss and preserves stable link qualities among sensor nodes for load balancing and prolonging the lifetime of wireless sensor networks in harsh smart grid environments. Comparative performance evaluations show that our proposed schemes outperform the existing communication architectures in terms of data packet delivery, communication delay and energy consumption. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cognitive radio; Fish bone routing; Multi-channel; Smart grid; Wireless sensor network","Bone; Cognitive radio; Cost effectiveness; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electromagnetic field effects; Electromagnetic pulse; Energy utilization; Fading (radio); Fish; Grid computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Packet networks; Plasma diagnostics; Sensor nodes; Smart power grids; Communication architectures; Communication framework; Comparative performance; Fish bones; Multi channel; Multi-hop data transmissions; Smart grid; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-85015738913

Our solution is a largely autonomous system with the ability to determine when it is necessary to ask a human operator for guidance. We call this approach human-guided autonomy.

Full duplex CR works using two RF chain with employing the sensing by a dedicated RF chain and transmitting the data with other RF chain. The main challenge involved in full duplex sensing is the self-interference problem, particularly for energy detector based spectrum sensing. Energy detector based spectrum sensing is widely used because of less computational complexity and PU signal knowledge is not required which is an essential feature in wideband spectrum sensing. This work proposes an SDR implementation of full duplex CR using energy detector with self-interference cancellation using Wiener filter. The self-interference signal is predicted by Wiener filter and it is removed in the received signal before apply to the energy detector. The proposed scheme is simulated and validated through an experimental study on SDR platform. The results show the improvement in probability of detection of PU signal.

These driving forces slowing down due to power constraints. In fact, the clock frequency did not change significantly since the 65nm node. However, the basic underlying van Neumann architecture, shown in Fig 1, that binds the compute unit with the memory has not changed since its conception in the late 1940s. It served well as general computing platform for the traditional workloads like transaction processing, data bases, etc. However as more and more data is collected and the desire to extract value from this data is growing, a class of workloads is emerging that is ill fitted to run on von Neumann machines. These so called cognitive workloads will handle massive amounts (10s of PB) of data compared to 100GB in traditional workloads. They do not require the same digital accuracy and are more noise tolerant.

In the past few years, the organization of the human brain network has been studied extensively using concepts from graph theory, where the brain is represented as a set of nodes connected by edges. This representation of the brain as a connectome can be used to assess important measures that reflect its topological architecture. We have developed a freeware MatLab-based software (BRAPH–BRain Analysis using graPH theory) for connectivity analysis of brain networks derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. BRAPH allows building connectivity matrices, calculating global and local network measures, performing non-parametric permutations for group comparisons, assessing the modules in the network, and comparing the results to random networks. By contrast to other toolboxes, it allows performing longitudinal comparisons of the same patients across different points in time. Furthermore, even though a user-friendly interface is provided, the architecture of the program is modular (object-oriented) so that it can be easily expanded and customized. To demonstrate the abilities of BRAPH, we performed structural and functional graph theory analyses in two separate studies. In the first study, using MRI data, we assessed the differences in global and nodal network topology in healthy controls, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In the second study, using resting-state fMRI data, we compared healthy controls and Parkinson’s patients with mild cognitive impairment. © 2017 Mijalkov et al.

Re-framing the characteristics of concepts is considered crucial to overcoming settled beliefs and reinterpreting new understandings in artificial systems. The first part presents a review of concepts from cognitive sciences. Support is found for views on grounded and embodied cognition, describing concepts as dynamic, flexible, context-dependent, and distributedly coded. That is argued to contrast with many technical implementations assuming concepts as categories, whilst explains limitations when grounding amodal symbols, or in unifying learning, perception and reasoning. The characteristics of concepts are linked to methods of active inference, self-organization, and deep learning to address challenges posed and to reinterpret emerging techniques. In a second part, an architecture based on deep generative models is presented to illustrate arguments elaborated. It is evaluated in a navigation task, showing that sufficient representations are created regarding situated behaviours with no semantics imposed on data. Moreover, adequate behaviours are achieved through a dynamic integration of perception and action in a single representational domain and process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Concepts; Conceptual representations; Machine Learning; Robotics","Artificial intelligence; Robotics; Robots; Semantics; Cognition; Concepts; Conceptual processing; Conceptual representations; Embodied cognition; Perception and actions; Self organizations; Technical implementation; Learning systems; Article; behavior assessment; behavioral research; cognition; conceptual framework; dynamics; evaluation study; human; integration; learning; mental health; neuroimaging; prediction; proprioception; psychology; self concept; semantics; sensorimotor function; social belief; social support; systematic review (topic)",2-s2.0-85017450328

However, the mechanisms underlying their anesthetic, psychotic, cognitive, and emotional effects are still elusive. The basal ganglia (BG) integrate input from different cortical domains through their dopamine-modulated connections to achieve optimal behavior control. NMDA antagonists have been shown to induce gamma oscillations in human EEG recordings and in rodent cortical and BG networks. However, network relations and implications to the primate brain are still unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from the primary motor cortex (M1) and the external globus pallidus (GPe) of four vervet monkeys (26 sessions, 97 and 76 cortical and pallidal LFPs, respectively) before and after administration of ketamine (NMDA antagonist, 10 mg/kg im). Ketamine induced robust, spontaneous gamma (30–50 Hz) oscillations in M1 and GPe. These oscillations were initially modulated by ultraslow oscillations (~0.3 Hz) and were highly synchronized within and between M1 and the GPe (mean coherence magnitude = 0.76, 0.88, and 0.41 for M1-M1, GPe-GPe, and M1-GPe pairs). Phase differences were distributed evenly around zero with broad and very narrow distribution for the M1-M1 and GPe-GPe pairs (=3.5 = 31.8° and =0.4 = 6.0°), respectively. The distribution of M1-GPe phase shift was skewed to the left with a mean of =18.4 = 20.9°. The increased gamma coherence between M1 and GPe, two central stages in the cortico-BG loops, suggests a global abnormal network phenomenon with a unique spectral signature, which is enabled by the BG funneling architecture. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first to show spontaneous gamma oscillations under NMDA antagonist in nonhuman primates. These oscillations appear in synchrony in the cortex and the basal ganglia. Phase analysis refutes the confounding effects of volume conduction and supports the funneling and amplifying architecture of the cortico-basal ganglia loops. These results suggest an abnormal network phenomenon with a unique spectral signature that could account for pathological mental and neurological states. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","Basal ganglia; Gamma oscillations; Ketamine; NMDA antagonist; PCP","ketamine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor blocking agent; animal experiment; Article; basal ganglion; behavior; brain; Chlorocebus; dose response; electrode; electroencephalogram; female; gamma oscillation; gamma rhythm; globus pallidus; nonhuman; oscillation; primary motor cortex; primate; priority journal; slow brain wave",2-s2.0-85026654037

These disruptions exhibited independent incremental value in predicting the externalizing symptoms over and above the demographic variables. The reduction of functional segregation in HR subjects was significant across both the younger and older age groups and was proportional to the family loading of AUDs.

Recently, the system's control architecture (meaning the interplay between perception, planning and control) was overhauled. Our goals were to simplify the interaction between modules as well as to meet higher requirements for both smoothness and precision. The decoupling of modules helps with tackling more challenging scenarios and facilitates the development of each module. Since state machines struggle with scalability, its interactions with other modules were minimized. We now use a generalized planning layer rather than so-called maneuvers. This paper aims at showcasing the difference between our previous and current architecture. We focus on the improvements that were achieved even for very simple scenarios-in this case off-road platooning. Using the same control algorithms, we achieve both improvements in smoothness and precision, two classically ortHOGonal goals.

We all know that information management is becoming an important part of digital world, ranging from the management of personal collections to the construction of diversified, distributed, semantic databases. These semantic databases can be addressed or described, to some extent, using 'Semantic Web' technologies, allowing to create a machine understandable web of data. The BKOnto is a formal framework for dealing with information about biographical history on the semantic web, including biographical events, temporal and spatial relationships, related information of persons, and so on. We describe this ontology knowledge structure in detail, and explain how BKOnto can act as a basis for more domain-specific knowledge representation. In BKOnto, we use the OWL markup language to define the main structures of the biographical knowledge: The StoryLine of the biography and the historical Event of the biography. The so-called biography story line, StoryLine, is used as a superstructure to organize a number of biographical historical events, which can be used to describe biography for a specific character. The biographical historical event is the basic unit of our OWL ontology which is based on the historical data to create content description and related space-Time factor description. The design of BKOnto is to organize StoryLine and Event as the basis for the knowledge structure. In the ontology knowledge construction system design, we will follow this ontological architecture for development.In accordance with this ontology knowledge cognitive architecture design, we also developed an ontology knowledge construction system, StoryTeller, using BKOnto as the main body. The StoryTeller system can be used to organize pieces of knowledge in biographical history and to form a complete biographical story. A story line with multiple event units will be able to present rich historical event information with relevant temporal and spatial factor. In addition, based on the idea of supporting the digital library and digital archive systems, the StoryTeller system also provide the link capability for the event units to correlate to the contents of external digital library/archive systems so that more diverse digital collections can be presented in StoryTeller system. In this study, we use the Mackay Digital Collection Project Platform (http://dlm.csie.au.edu.tw/), which i s a digital library system of George Mackay's historical collections, as information source to demonstrate the ontology knowledge construction process of the Mackay biography. © 2017 IEEE.","Biographiocal knowledge; Ontology; Ontology composition system; OWL; Semantic web; Temporal event","Biographies; Birds; Digital libraries; Information management; Innovation; Knowledge representation; Markup languages; Ontology; Structural analysis; Biographiocal knowledge; Cognitive architectures; Composition systems; Digital library systems; Domain-specific knowledge; Knowledge construction; Knowledge construction process; Temporal event; Semantic Web",2-s2.0-85028523229

Therefore, such systems need to support not only the high performance capabilities at tight power/energy envelop, but also need to be intelligent/cognitive, self-learning, and robust. As a result, a hype in the artificial intelligence research (e.g., deep learning and other machine learning techniques) has surfaced in numerous communities. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities for building energy-efficient and adaptive architectures for machine learning. In particular, we focus on brain-inspired emerging computing paradigms, such as approximate computing; that can further reduce the energy requirements of the system. First, we guide through an approximate computing based methodology for development of energy-efficient accelerators, specifically for convolutional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We show that in-depth analysis of datapaths of a DNN allows better selection of Approximate Computing modules for energy-efficient accelerators. Further, we show that a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm can be used to develop an adaptive machine learning system in hardware. At the end, we summarize the challenges and the associated research roadmap that can aid in developing energy-efficient and adaptable hardware accelerators for machine learning. © 2017 IEEE.","accelerators; adaptive; approximate computing; architecture; CGRA; deep learning; energy efficiency; FPGA; low power; machine learning; memory; neural networks; performance; roadmap","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer hardware; Data handling; Data storage equipment; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Green computing; Hardware; Learning systems; Low power electronics; Network architecture; Neural networks; Particle accelerators; VLSI circuits; adaptive; approximate computing; CGRA; Low Power; performance; Roadmap; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-85027254355

This paper proposes a new methodology to analyse the indoor air quality with a cheap and third-age-dedicated device. A new prototype, called Home Pollution Embedded System (HOPES), was developed to give simple and understandable information, also comprehensible for people with cognitive problems or that are not familiar with new technologies. The device gathers pollutants data and displays to the user different air pollutants concentrations, from toxics gasses up to explosives. Moreover, an overall air quality index has been elaborated and is displayed by HOPES with lights and numerical information. HOPES is an Internet of things device that works in real time and that can be connected to the web and to a geographic information system platform to add spatial information of each pollutant. The hardware architecture employs a set of gas semiconductor sensors and an IR particulate matter sensor. Experimental results demonstrated that HOPES has an accurate sensor response and is suitable to be used with the proposed indices. In fact, despite of the poor-selective metal oxide sensors, the results highlighted how it is possible to get useful air quality information with a cheap device.

This paper reports the results of an investigation into how end users behave when faced with phishing websites and how this behaviour exposes them to attack. Specifically, the paper presents a proof of concept computer model for simulating human behaviour with respect to phishing website detection based on the ACT-R cognitive architecture, and draws conclusions as to the applicability of this architecture to human behaviour modelling within a phishing detection scenario. Following the development of a high-level conceptual model of the phishing website detection process, the study draws upon ACT-R to model and simulate the cognitive processes involved in judging the validity of a representative webpage based primarily around the characteristics of the HTTPS padlock security indicator. The study concludes that despite the low-level nature of the architecture and its very basic user interface support, ACT-R possesses strong capabilities which map well onto the phishing use case, and that further work to more fully represent the range of human security knowledge and behaviours in an ACT-R model could lead to improved insights into how best to combine technical and human defences to reduce the risk to end users from phishing attacks. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Computer crime; Cybernetics; Social sciences; User interfaces; Websites; Architecture modeling; Cognitive architectures; Cognitive process; Computer modeling; Detection process; Human behaviour modelling; Phishing detections; Phishing websites; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85027831316

This article proposes a methodology for artificially generating a bipedal humanoid gait pattern for the knee and hip leg joints in the sagittal plane. The lower limbs movement is divided into three complementary patterns of movement, each with a specific function, which can be modulated individually and superposed to compose a gait pattern. This strategy is based on the potential field navigation algorithm concept [1] and the architecture for its application is based on the AuRA cognitive architecture [2]. The methodology was validated using a MATLABTM implementation of a simplified kinematic model of the legs movements. The results show movement patterns close to the biomechanical ones at the joints. When applied to the kinematic model, those movement patterns generate feet trajectories that are consistent to the biomechanical gait both in shape and amplitude. The strategy was also embedded in a microcontrolled prototype, revealing low computational demands as well as another view for the generated movement. © 2017 IEEE.","Cognition; Control; Gait Generation; Kinematic Model; Robotics","Biodiversity; Biological organs; Biomechanics; Cognitive systems; Conservation; Control; Gait analysis; Intelligent systems; Joints (anatomy); Robotics; Robots; Biomechanical gait; Cognition; Cognitive architectures; Computational demands; Gait generation; ITS applications; Kinematic model; Potential field navigation; Kinematics",2-s2.0-85028558821

This improvement is demonstrated by training several deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models on data from six participants who each perform several Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) sessions on five separate days spread out over a month-long period.

This flourishing constellation of ideas is on its way to becoming the new paradigm of cognitive science. However, in my reading, enactivism, putting stress on the constitutive role of action when it comes to mind and perception, faces a serious philosophical challenge when attempting to account for the way we actually perceive our environments, most importantly for the fact that we perceive things or objects. Von Foester's eigenbehavior is understood here as a concept supposed to take on this challenge. Problem • In this article I tackle the following issues: (1) Enactivism must be able to account for the apparent stability of the perceived world: this is not a realm of a never-ending flux of stimuli; it is a realm of stable things. (2) Enactivism is committed to the anti-Cartesian endeavor seeking to bridge the gap between the inner and the outer; between the subjective and the objective. Now, these two points constrain each other so that one cannot address (1) simply by regarding the apparent stability of things as a projection that springs out of the internal machinery binding inputs with outputs. This is because the very idea of such an internal machinery opposes (2), i.e., it employs the Cartesian dichotomy. So, enactivism is in need of an account of (1) that would not oppose its anti-Cartesian commitment. Method • I introduce the ontology of location and niche theory, as it has been brought forth by Varzi, Casati, and Smith, and develop it so that it can be used in the philosophy of mind. This is a conceptual, semi-formal philosophical analysis. Results • I shall come up with the idea of object conceived of a product of action, and - drawing on von Foerster's central idea - as a product of coordination of perceptions. Yet, it is not coordination of stimuli but coordination of cognitive connections. The notion of connection is thus articulated in the article and cast as the central concept in my proposal. Implications • We are able to account for both (1) and (2). The apparent stability of the perceived world is due to the setting up and maintaining of connections between the perceiver and the things perceived, resulting in the establishment of what I call a cognitive niche. Constructivist content • Constructivism, broadly construed, takes, in my reading, a negative stance in the first place. Namely, it opposes what I call the metaphysics of the ready-made world. So, it holds that there is no ready-made reality; however it remains open when it comes to positive claims: a mind-independent reality does not exist at all or it does exist but it is not ready-made and as such it must be brought to completion, so to speak, or enacted, as Varela et al. would say, by a cognitive subject. In this article, I follow the latter and address one specific issue: how the enacted world gains its relatively stable architecture. © John Petersen 2017.","Cognition; Connection; Eigenbehavior; Enactivism; Location; Niche; Perception",,2-s2.0-85024480263

Here, within a sample of community-dwelling adults 19–78 years of age, we used diffusion reaction time (RT) modeling and multivariate functional connectivity to investigate the behavioral components and whole-brain functional networks, respectively, underlying bottom-up and top-down attentional processes during conjunction visual search. During functional MRI scanning, participants completed a conjunction visual search task in which each display contained one item that was larger than the other items (i.e., a size singleton) but was not informative regarding target identity. This design allowed us to examine in the RT components and functional network measures the influence of (a) additional bottom-up guidance when the target served as the size singleton, relative to when the distractor served as the size singleton (i.e., size singleton effect) and (b) top-down processes during target detection (i.e., target detection effect; target present vs. absent trials). We found that the size singleton effect (i.e., increased bottom-up guidance) was associated with RT components related to decision and nondecision processes, but these effects did not vary with age. Also, a modularity analysis revealed that frontoparietal module connectivity was important for both the size singleton and target detection effects, but this module became central to the networks through different mechanisms for each effect. Lastly, participants 42 years of age and older, in service of the target detection effect, relied more on between-frontoparietal module connections. Our results further elucidate mechanisms through which frontoparietal regions support attentional control and how these mechanisms vary in relation to adult age. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Aging; Attentional control; Diffusion modeling; Functional connectivity; Graph theory","adult; age distribution; aged; aging; Article; attention; attentional control; controlled study; decision making; female; human; human experiment; male; mental task; neuroimaging; neurophysiology; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; reaction time",2-s2.0-85018787017

This article uses a data driven, spectral reordering approach in order to understand the general axes of structural connectivity within the temporal lobe. Two important findings emerge from the study. Firstly, the temporal lobe's overarching patterns of connectivity are organised along two key structural axes: medial to lateral and anteroventral to posterodorsal, mirroring findings in the functional literature. Secondly, the connective organisation of the temporal lobe is graded and transitional; this is reminiscent of the original work of 19th Century neuroanatomists, who posited the existence of some regions which transitioned between one another in a graded fashion. While regions with unique connectivity exist, the boundaries between these are not always sharp. Instead there are zones of graded connectivity reflecting the influence and overlap of shared connectivity. © 2017 The Authors","Connectivity based parcellation; Diffusion MRI; Probabilistic tractography; Spectral reordering; Temporal lobe","adult; anatomical concepts; anatomical variation; anteroventral temporal lobe; Article; brain region; connectome; female; human; human experiment; image processing; lateral temporal lobe; male; medial temporal lobe; neuroanatomical tract tracing; neuroanatomy; normal human; posterodorsal temporal lobe; priority journal; spectral reordering; temporal lobe; tractography",2-s2.0-85017499314

Nowadays, graph-based methods are widely applied to saliency detection including manifold ranking(MR) method, which is shown to be fast and effective. However, because of only using a single feature and imperfect selection strategy for background seeds, MR has a poor performance in some circumstances. In order to complete more challenging saliency detection, an improved method based on manifold ranking algorithm is proposed in this paper. The adopted parallel architecture enables the final detection results generated with the combination of calculations from background seeds and foreground seeds.

Through this research a smaller number of gestures were created improving the user learning curve without affecting the usability. The following implementation uses a client-server architecture composed of 2 Raspberry Pi devices and a Smartphone acting as a server the communication between them was achieved by employing Bluetooth Low Energy technology. The immersive virtual experience is accomplished by using Unity 3D and Google VR tools that allowed the design and display of a playful virtual environment as an approach to promote physical and cognitive skills such as spatial thinking and hand-eye coordination.

This study investigates the stability aspects of one such aerial vehicle under engine failure condition. In the proposed architecture, a six degree of freedom vehicle dynamic simulation model is implemented through a set of coupled non-linear differential equations. The aerodynamic forces and moments encountered by the UAV during various phases of the flight are ascertained through empirical / non-empirical techniques. Non-linear constrained optimization technique is employed to evaluate the steady state values of the optimized trajectory for the complete flight regime. Results from dynamical systems theory are applied to investigate local stability characteristics of UAV around the steady state. Complete set of dynamic modes of UAV throughout the glide phase are evaluated and mode content in each of the motion variable is determined using modal decomposition technique.

The TV White spaces, the scarcely used bands of former analog TV broadcasting, could be a viable option to alleviate this problem. The concept of Cognitive Radio must be employed though, as primary users within the TV White Spaces must not be disturbed. While the idea of Cognitive Radio is nothing new to system engineers and a considerable amount of research has been done on high level aspects, it is the author's intention to shed some light on yet missed low level issues, physical implications and limitations that are major showstoppers for cognitive radio technology as it exists today. As well, this paper presents a low-cost, non-specialized and proven hardware architecture that solves these problems and enables experimental over-the-air cognitive radio research. The presented architecture takes its input from e.g. commercial LTE transceivers and shifts the center frequency towards the TV white spaces, while maintaining standard compliance towards LTE, thereby turning the commercial LTE transceiver into a Cognitive Radio transceiver, which is adhering to the LTE requirements. Transceivers that have been augmented this way gain flexibility in regard to center frequency without loosing anything. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the presented hardware is the first and only possibility, in which arbitrary center frequencies can be combined with standard compliant LTE signals, leaving e.g. spectrum mask, spurious emissions and EVM requirements undisturbed. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Color television; Hardware; Metropolitan area networks; Network architecture; Radio transceivers; Regulatory compliance; Television broadcasting; Transceivers; Center frequency; Cognitive radio technologies; Hardware architecture; High level aspects; Mobile Data Terminal; Spurious emissions; System engineers; Tv white spaces; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85027248772

The authors adopted a semi-structured interview approach and collected a series of rich insights into how design tutors and design students conceptualize creativity and how both perceive their role in developing creativity. The findings of the research indicate clear differences in the way that design tutors and design students assess their creative potential.

The results also show that the design students generally acknowledge the role that design tutors play in promoting cultures of creativity in the university design studio, but also stressed the importance of the wider socio-cultural system. Lastly, the research reveals that many aspects of creativity in the university design studio remain shrouded in mystery and this lack of knowledge of creativity and how it facilitates design may well be compromising the education of design students.

Therefore, the relationship between ToM and the executive functions needs to be clarified. Since the frontal lobe plays a critical role in the abilities of ToM and the executive functions, patients with frontal lobe damage were recruited for the present study. Assessments of ToM and the executive functions were performed on 23 patients with frontal lobe damage and 20 healthy controls.

However, distinguishing true surprises - from which useful information can be extracted to improve an agent's world model - from environmental noise is a fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a new and robust approach for actively learning a predictive model of discrete, stochastic, partially-observable environments based on a concept called the Stochastic Distinguishing Experiment (SDE). SDEs are conditional probability distributions over the next observation given a variable-length sequence of ordered actions and expected observations up to the present that partition the space of possible agent histories, thus forming an approximate predictive representation of state. We derive this SDE-based learning algorithm and present theoretical proofs of its convergence and computational complexity. Theoretical and experimental results in small environments with important theoretical properties demonstrate the algorithm's ability to build an accurate predictive model from one continuous interaction with its environment without requiring any prior knowledge of the underlying state space, the number of SDEs to use, or even a bound on SDE length. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

One pressing and fundamental problem is how to integrate cognitive radios into current wireless networks to enhance network capacity and improve users' experience. Unfortunately, existing solutions to cognitive radio networks (CRNs) suffer from many practical design issues. To foster further research activities in this direction, we attempt to provide a tutorial for CRN architecture design. Noticing that an effective architecture for CRNs is still lacking, in this tutorial, we systematically summarize the principles for CRN architecture design and present a novel flexible network architecture, termed cognitive capacity harvesting network (CCHN), to elaborate on how a CRN architecture can be designed. Unlike existing architectures, we introduce a new network entity, called secondary service provider, and deploy cognitive radio capability enabled routers, called cognitive radio routers, in order to effectively and efficiently manage resource harvesting and mobile traffic while enabling users without cognitive radios to access and enjoy CCHN services. Our analysis shows that our CCHN aligns well to industrial standardization activities and hence provides a viable approach to implementing future CRNs.

This overview and vision paper first reviews popular introductions to microservices to identify microservices tenets. It then compares two microservices definitions and contrasts them with SOA principles and patterns. This analysis confirms that microservices indeed can be seen as a development- and deployment-level variant of SOA; such microservices implementations have the potential to overcome the deficiencies of earlier approaches to SOA realizations by employing modern software engineering paradigms and Web technologies such as domain-driven design, RESTful HTTP, IDEAL cloud application architectures, polyglot persistence, lightweight containers, a continuous DevOps approach to service delivery, and comprehensive but lean fault management. However, these paradigms and technologies also cause a number of additional design choices to be made and create new options for many “distribution classics” type of architectural decisions.

While it is known that subliminally and consciously induced conflicts interact and conjointly modulate action control in healthy subjects, this has never been investigated for ADHD. Method We investigated the (potential) interaction of subliminally and consciously triggered response conflicts in children with ADHD and matched healthy controls using neuropsychological methods (event-related potentials; ERPs) to identify the involved cognitive sub-processes. Results Unlike healthy controls, ADHD patients showed no interaction of subliminally and consciously triggered response conflicts. Instead, they only showed additive effects as their behavioural performance (accuracy) was equally impaired by each conflict and they showed no signs of task-goal shielding even in cases of low conflict load. Of note, this difference between ADHD and controls was not rooted in early bottom-up attentional stimulus processing as reflected by the P1 and N1 ERPs. Instead, ADHD showed either no or reversed modulations of conflict-related processes and response selection as reflected by the N2 and P3 ERPs. Conclusion There are fundamental differences in the architecture of cognitive control which might be of use for future diagnostic procedures. Unlike healthy controls, ADHD patients do not seem to be endowed with a threshold which allows them to maintain high behavioural performance in the face of low conflict load. ADHD patients seem to lack sufficient top-down attentional resources to maintain correct response selection in the face of conflicts by shielding the response selection process from response tendencies evoked by any kind of distractor. © Cambridge University Press 2017.","cognitive control; conscious; EEG; Key words ADHD; subliminal",,2-s2.0-85016126798

Then we examine fundamental limitations of feature vectors and other distributed representations that, despite their recent successes on various practical problems, suggest that they are insufficient to capture many aspects of human cognition.

Through ethnographic research we aim to further develop the new notion of skilled intentionality by turning to the phenomenon of the tendency towards an optimal grip on a situation in real-life situations in the field of architecture. Tending towards an optimal grip is an inherently affective and dynamic phenomenon. It has been under explored in philosophy, despite its central place in Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology. When the architects experience discontent, attention is typically solicited by the affordances through which possible ways of continuing the improvement of the design can be explored. In various ways this tension or disequilibrium - fueling a tendency towards an optimal grip - is encountered in the complex architectural design practices that we observed. Based on our field material we distinguish between: a) grip in visual perception, b) grip on the design, and c) grip on ‘how to design’. The move towards an optimal grip takes shape by joining forces with a landscape of affordances. This landscape includes, for instance, affordances for grasping a cup of coffee, affordances provided by a cardboard model to improve it, as well as for engaging with a person who is not physically present. Because they are skilled, the architects can be responsive to these different affordances in similar ways. Furthermore, in practice the architects are responsive to multiple affordances simultaneously. Through our analysis of the tendency towards an optimal grip we show that our surroundings contribute to skillful action and cognition in a far more complex way than is currently acknowledged in philosophy and cognitive science. © 2016, The Author(s).","Affordances for ‘higher’ cognition; Enaction; Ethnography; Landscape of affordances; Philosophy of radical embodied cognitive science; Skilled intentionality; Social cognition; Sociomateral practices; Tendency towards an optimal grip",,2-s2.0-84977155342

The therapeutic standard of care for this condition is treatment with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor modulators, which promote sleep but are associated with a panoply of side effects, including cognitive and memory impairment. Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) have recently emerged as an alternative therapeutic approach that acts via a distinct and more selective wake-attenuating mechanism with the potential to be associated with milder side effects. Given their distinct mechanism of action, the current work tested the hypothesis that DORAs and GABAA receptor modulators differentially regulate neurochemical pathways associated with differences in sleep architecture and cognitive performance induced by these pharmacological mechanisms. Our findings showed that DORA-22 suppresses the release of the wake neurotransmitter histamine in the lateral hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus with no significant alterations in acetylcholine levels. In contrast, eszopiclone, commonly used as a GABAA modulator, inhibited acetylcholine secretion across brain regions with variable effects on histamine release depending on the extent of wakefulness induction. In normal waking rats, eszopiclone only transiently suppressed histamine secretion, whereas this suppression was more obvious under caffeine-induced wakefulness. Compared with the GABAA modulator eszopiclone, DORA-22 elicits a neurotransmitter profile consistent with wake reduction that does not impinge on neurotransmitter levels associated with cognition and rapid eye movement sleep.

We did this by measuring the performances of a RAM within the context of a discrimination task using different stimuli (i. e., letters and randomly generated stimuli) and fitting the obtained results with an accumulator model possessing a coactive architecture. The experimental conditions varied with regard to the correlation between the tested stimuli, the amount of redundancy of the stimuli used in a trial, and the number of total stimuli presented to the network in the learning phase. Results showed that high inter-stimulus correlation led to slower recall speed, and that low redundancy also resulted in slower recall speed. Results also indicated that an increased number of exemplars contained in the network's memory increased recall speed for the letter stimuli but randomly generated stimuli received no apparent benefits.

Minimization of CD is fundamentally equivalent of finding the self-similarity among the training data and the estimated data. However, this self-similarity is measured at single measurement scale. Using fractal dimension, self-similarity at multiple scales is obtained and is denoted by a noninteger value. Fractal dimension provides a way to extract complexity features of an object using multiscale probabilistic measures and represents self-similar relationship in terms of a loglog scale. Also, CD algorithm is based on temperature based Boltzmann distribution but it does not incorporate the effects of temperature in the calculations.

However, both the CMOS scaling and the classical computer architecture are approaching fundamental and practical limits, and new computing architectures based on emerging devices, such as non-volatile memories e.g. resistive memory (RRAM) devices, are expected to sustain the exponential growth of computing capability. Here we propose a novel memory-centric, reconfigurable, general purpose computing platform to handle the explosive amount of data in a fast and energy-efficient manner. The proposed computing architecture is based on a single physical resistive memory-centric fabric that can be optimally reconfigured and utilized to perform different computing and data storage tasks in a massively parallel approach. The system can be tailored to achieve maximal energy efficiency based on the data flow by dynamically allocating the basic computing fabric to storage, arithmetic, and analog computing including neuromorphic computing tasks.

In the first layer, called voxel layer, we model the connectivity among the voxel time series to represent the detailed information about the experiment. In the second layer, we cluster the voxel time series by using functional similarity measure, to partition the brain volume into homogeneous regions, called super-voxels. Each super-voxel is represented by the average voxel time series that resides in that region. The cognitive states are represented independently in two layers. A set of star meshes are established around each voxel in the first layer and around each super-voxel, in the second layer. The arc weights of the meshes at each layer are estimated by regularized Ridge regression model among the voxels/super-voxels. Mesh arc weights, estimated at voxel and super-voxel levels are used to train independent classifiers. The outputs of two classifiers are ensembled under a stacked generalization architecture.

Wireless networks demand more and more spectral resources to support the ever increasing numbers of users. According to network engineers, the current spectrum crunch can be addressed with the introduction of cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In half-duplex (HD) CRNs, the secondary users (SUs) can either only sense the spectrum or transmit at a given time. This HD operation limits the SU throughput because the SUs cannot transmit during the spectrum sensing. However, with the advances in self-interference suppression (SIS), full-duplex (FD) CRNs allow for simultaneous spectrum sensing and transmission on a given channel. This FD operation increases the throughput and reduces collisions as compared to HD-CRNs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of FD-CRN communications. We cover the supporting network architectures and the various transmit and receive antenna designs. We classify the different SIS approaches in FD-CRNs. We survey the spectrum sensing approaches, and security requirements for FD-CRNs.

A number of stressors relating to career, relationships and life events collide during this life phase, when young adults learn to be autonomous. A major developmental task is making appropriate life choices in the face of freedom and contradictory messages from a wide range of sources. Thus identifying individuals in distress and building means to promote resilience would be relevant to any college setting. Resilience building has been a major area of concern to educators across the world. The main reason is that it is impossible to conduct face to face counselling on several occasions in a large college setting. This present study aims to build a web-based multi-step cognitive restructuring program to help young adults identify and deal with maladaptive, negative thoughts, and emotions, thereby effectively attempting to promote resilience, and improve psychological health among college students. Considering the sensitivity of the data present in the system, it has been developed following the multitier architecture with an intention to block access by unauthorized users. The system is meant to be interactive and regular feedback should be taken from the subjects. The counsellor should be given access to the full information of the subjects for evaluation.

This paper introduces the first hybrid crowd-enabled event processing engine. The paper proposes a list of five event crowd operators that are domain and language independent and can be used by any event processing framework.

Q-learning is a form of reinforcement learning and it has been efficient in solving certain class of learning problems. However, embedded systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft rarely implement learning algorithms due to the constraints faced in the field, like processing power, chip size, convergence rate and costs due to the need for radiation hardening. These challenges present a compelling need for a portable, low-power, area efficient hardware accelerator to make learning algorithms practical onboard space hardware.

In the high-level planning, the physician establishes the parameters of the therapy such as the scheduling of the sessions, the therapeutic objectives to be achieved and certain constraints based on the medical records of the patient. This information is used to establish a customized therapy plan. The objective of the medium-level planning is to execute and monitor every previous planned session with the humanoid robot. Finally, the low-level planning involves the execution of path-planning actions by the robot to carry out different low-level instructions such as performing poses. The technical evaluation shows an accurate definition and monitoring of the therapies and sessions and a fluent interaction with the robot.

Using fMRI and dynamic causal modeling (DCM), this study aimed to identify the distinct neuronal architectures engaged by the cognitive processes of simple addition and subtraction. Our results revealed significantly greater activation during subtraction in regions along the dorsal pathway, including the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle portion of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (mDLPFC), and supplementary motor area (SMA), compared with addition. Subsequent analysis of the underlying changes in connectivity – with DCM – revealed a common circuit processing basic (numeric) attributes and the retrieval of arithmetic facts. However, DCM showed that addition was more likely to engage (numeric) retrieval-based circuits in the left hemisphere, while subtraction tended to draw on (magnitude) processing in bilateral parietal cortex, especially the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Our findings endorse previous hypotheses about the differences in strategic implementation, dominant hemisphere, and the neuronal circuits underlying addition and subtraction. Moreover, for simple arithmetic, our connectivity results suggest that subtraction calls on more complex processing than addition: auxiliary phonological, visual, and motor processes, for representing numbers, were engaged by subtraction, relative to addition.

The content providers rely on highly satisfied subscribers for revenue generation and there have been significant efforts in developing approaches to “estimate” the quality of experience (QoE) of VoD subscribers. However, a key issue is that QoE can be difficult to measure directly from residential and mobile user interactions with content. Hence, appropriate proxies need to be found for QoE, via the streaming metrics (the QoS metrics) that are largely based on initial startup time, buffering delays, average bit rate and average throughput and other relevant factors such as the video content and user behavior and other external factors. The ultimate objective of the content provider is to elevate the QoE of all the subscribers at the cost of minimal network resources, such as hardware resources and bandwidth. In this paper, first, we propose a cognitive video streaming strategy in order to ensure the QoE of subscribers, while utilizing minimal network resources.

Then, we demonstrate the prediction module of the cognitive video streaming architecture through a play time prediction tool.

Distinct from financial capital, cognitive capital represents investment in future human potential from interventions in nutrition, health, education, child protection, and social welfare systems that optimize brain development. The return on investment is significant given the plasticity of the developing brain in response to positive stimuli. Investment in brain development results in improved health and well-being, educational outcomes, skills, employment, and quality of life. The inverse is also true. Negative stimuli lead to depreciating cognitive capital, poorer mental and physical health and educational outcomes, and decreased life chances. Cognitive capital could be an organizing framework for China's next phase of development to ensure the building of a prosperous society. Through significant commitment from the government, China has seen remarkable improvements in under-five mortality, literacy rates, access to basic education, life expectancy, and gross domestic product in the past few decades as the result of an expansion of publicly funded social services. Yet, inequities remain within and across communities and regions. In 2015, China had a country ranking of 97 for gross national income per capita, highlighting remaining challenges across the whole population. Cognitive capital relies on a package of forward-looking policies that lead to equitable, efficient, and effective use of existing and future resources. This is consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

However, long-term effects on cognitive/affective head pain perception, headache intensity/frequency are lacking. We therefore investigated potential iVNS-induced effects in patients with drug-resistant focal seizure and daily headache/migraine. Materials and Methods: A clinical database was used to select 325 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy treated by either iVNS plus best medical treatment (BMT) or BMT alone, compared to a healthy control group (HC). We assessed headache intensity (VAS), headache frequency, affective/cognitive pain perception (PASS; FSVA), migraine disability scores (MIDAS), sleep architecture (PSQI), depressive symptoms (BDI), and body weight (BMI). Results: Nineteen patients with daily headache/migraine composed the clinical groups (10 iVNS and 9 BMT; iVNS mean age 49 years, range 36–61 years; BMT mean age 45 years, range 23–63 years; equally distributed gender). Cervical iVNS was applied from 5–13 years (mean 8 years) with following stimulation patterns: 1.3 mA (0.5–2 mA), 20 Hz, 250 μsec, 30 sec on/1.9 min off (0.5–5 min).

The precocity of this ability suggests that it might be based on rather simple motion properties, and it can be interpreted as an atomic building block of more complex perception tasks typical of interacting scenarios, as the understanding of non-verbal communication cues based on motion or the anticipation of others' action goals. In this article, we propose a novel perspective for video analysis, bridging cognitive science and machine vision, which leverages the use of computational models of the perceptual primitives that are at the basis of biological motion perception in humans. Our work offers different contributions. In a first part, we propose an empirical formulation for the Two-Thirds Power Law, a well-known invariant law of human movement, and thoroughly discuss its readability in experimental settings of increasing complexity. In particular, we consider unconstrained video analysis scenarios, where, to the best of our knowledge, the invariant law has not found application so far. The achievements of this analysis pave the way for the second part of the work, in which we propose and evaluate a general representation scheme for biological motion characterisation to discriminate biological movements with respect to non-biological dynamic events in video sequences. The method is proposed as the first layer of a more complex architecture for behaviour analysis and human-machine interaction, providing in particular a new way to approach the problem of human action understanding. © 2017 ACM.","Biological motion perception; Motion perception development; Two-Thirds Power Law","Vision; Biological motion; Complex architectures; Human machine interaction; Motion perception; Non-verbal communications; Representation schemes; Surrounding environment; Two-thirds power laws; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85024500022

The engineering literature proposing novel algorithms, protocols and architectures for managing and processing multimedia information is currently overwhelming. However, most of these results do not arrive to applications due to the lack of simple and usable APIs. Interestingly, in this context in which APIs are the critical ingredient for reaching wide developer audiences, the scientific literature about multimedia APIs and their usability is scarce. In this paper we try to contribute to fill this gap by proposing the RTC Media API: a novel type of API designed with the aim of making simple for developers the use of latest trends in RTC multimedia including WebRTC, Video Content Analysis or Augmented Reality. We provide a specification of such API and discuss how it satisfies a set of design requirements including programming-language agnosticism, adaptation to cloud environments, support to multisensory multimedia, etc. After that, we describe an implementation of such an API that has been created in the context of the Kurento open source software project, and present a study evaluating the API usability performed in a group of more than 40 professional developers distributed worldwide. In the light of the obtained results, we conclude that the usability of the API is adequate across the main development activities (i.e. API learning, code creation and code maintenance), with an average usability score of 3.39 over 5 in a Likert scale, and that this result is robust with respect to developers’ profiles, cultures, professional experiences and preferred programming languages. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Application Programming Interfaces; Cognitive dimensions of notations; Media server; Multimedia processing; Multimedia tools and applications; Real-time multimedia communications; WebRTC","Algorithms; Augmented reality; Computational linguistics; Computer systems programming; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Network architecture; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Usability engineering; Cognitive dimensions of notations; Media servers; Multimedia processing; Multimedia tool; Real-time multimedia communication; WebRTC; Application programming interfaces (API)",2-s2.0-84982108474

Therefore, the empirical study of these experiences requires conceptualization and measurement of aesthetic emotions. Despite the long-standing interest in such emotions, we still lack an assessment tool to capture the broad range of emotions that occur in response to the perceived aesthetic appeal of stimuli. Elicitors of aesthetic emotions are not limited to the arts in the strict sense, but extend to design, built environments, and nature. In this article, we describe the development of a questionnaire that is applicable across many of these domains: the Aesthetic Emotions Scale (AESTHEMOS). Drawing on theoretical accounts of aesthetic emotions and an extensive review of extant measures of aesthetic emotions within specific domains such as music, literature, film, painting, advertisements, design, and architecture, we propose a framework for studying aesthetic emotions. The AESTHEMOS, which is based on this framework, contains 21 subscales with two items each, that are designed to assess the emotional signature of responses to stimuli's perceived aesthetic appeal in a highly differentiated manner. These scales cover prototypical aesthetic emotions (e.g., the feeling of beauty, being moved, fascination, and awe), epistemic emotions (e.g., interest and insight), and emotions indicative of amusement (humor and joy). In addition, the AESTHEMOS subscales capture both the activating (energy and vitality) and the calming (relaxation) effects of aesthetic experiences, as well as negative emotions that may contribute to aesthetic displeasure (e.g., the feeling of ugliness, boredom, and confusion). © 2017 Schindler et al.

We build on the assumption that language acquisition is usage-driven and assume that there are different processes in language acquisition operating at different levels. Bottom-up processing allows a learner to identify regularities in the linguistic input received, while top-down processing exploits prior experience and previous knowledge to guide choices made during bottom-up processing. To shed light on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up processing in language acquisition, we present a computational model of language acquisition that is based on bootstrapping mechanisms and is usage-based in that it relies on discovered regularities to segment speech into word-like units. Based on this initial segmentation, our model induces a construction grammar that in turn acts as a top-down prior that guides the segmentation of new sentences into words. We spell out in detail these processes and their interplay, showing that top-down processing increases both understanding performance and segmentation accuracy. Our model thus contributes to a better understanding of the interplay between bottom-up and top-down processes in first language acquisition and thus to a better understanding of the mechanisms and architecture involved in language acquisition. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive modeling; language acquisition; language development; speech; top-down and bottom-up processes; word segmentation","Computation theory; Computational methods; Mergers and acquisitions; Speech; Bottom-up process; Cognitive model; Language acquisition; Language development; Word segmentation; Modeling languages",2-s2.0-85020860985

In the past decade, the combination of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques and graph theoretical approaches enable us to map human structural and functional connectivity patterns (i.e., connectome) at the macroscopic level. One of the most influential findings is that human brain networks exhibit prominent small-world organization. Such a network architecture in the human brain facilitates efficient information segregation and integration at low wiring and energy costs, which presumably results from natural selection under the pressure of a cost-efficiency balance. Moreover, the small-world organization undergoes continuous changes during normal development and ageing and exhibits dramatic alterations in neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we survey recent advances regarding the small-world architecture in human brain networks and highlight the potential implications and applications in multidisciplinary fields, including cognitive neuroscience, medicine and engineering.

Among other things, the FAS have a significant impact on spike-train encodings that propagate through the affected neurons, leading to compromised signal processing on a neuronal network level. This work merges, for the first time, three fields of study: (i) signal processing in excitatory-inhibitory (EI) networks of neurons via population codes, (ii) decision-making theory driven by the production of evidence from stimulus, and (iii) compromised spike-train propagation through FAS. As such, we demonstrate a mathematical architecture capable of characterizing compromised decision-making driven by cellular mechanisms.

However, to evaluate dynamic changes of brain functional connectivity, more sophisticated quantitative metrics characterizing temporal evolution of brain topological features are required. To simplify conversion of time-varying brain connectivity to a static graph representation is straightforward but the procedure loses temporal information that could be critical in understanding the brain functions. To extend the understandings of functional segregation and integration to a dynamic fashion, we recommend dynamic graph metrics to characterise temporal changes of topological features of brain networks. This study investigated functional segregation and integration of brain networks over time by dynamic graph metrics derived from EEG signals during an experimental protocol: performance of complex flight simulation tasks with multiple levels of difficulty. We modelled time-varying brain functional connectivity as multi-layer networks, in which each layer models brain connectivity at time window t + Δt. Dynamic graph metrics were calculated to quantify temporal and topological properties of the network. Results show that brain networks under the performance of complex tasks reveal a dynamic small-world architecture with a number of frequently connected nodes or hubs, which supports the balance of information segregation and integration in brain over time. The results also show that greater cognitive workloads caused by more difficult tasks induced a more globally efficient but less clustered dynamic small-world functional network. Our study illustrates that task-related changes of functional brain network segregation and integration can be characterized by dynamic graph metrics. © 2016 IEEE.","Brain connectivity; complex task; dynamic brain network; dynamic graph metrics; electroencephalography (EEG); segregation and integration; temporal network","Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Flight simulators; Graph theory; Integral equations; Integration; Network layers; Topology; Brain connectivity; Brain networks; Complex task; Dynamic graph; Temporal networks; Complex networks; adult; biological model; brain; cognition; computer simulation; connectome; electroencephalography; female; human; male; nerve cell network; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Adult; Brain; Cognition; Computer Simulation; Connectome; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-85026997745

Twin studies indicate SRH has a heritability of up to 60% and that its genetic architecture may overlap with that of personality and cognition.Methods: We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SRH on 111 749 members of the UK Biobank sample. Univariate genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA)-GREML analyses were used to estimate the proportion of variance explained by all common autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for SRH. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and polygenic risk scoring, two complementary methods, were used to investigate pleiotropy between SRH in the UK Biobank and up to 21 health-related and personality and cognitive traits from published GWAS consortia.Results: The GWAS identified 13 independent signals associated with SRH, including several in regions previously associated with diseases or disease-related traits. The strongest signal was on chromosome 2 (rs2360675, P = 1.77 x 10-10) close to KLF7. A second strong peak was identified on chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility region (rs76380179, P = 6.15 x 10-10). The proportion of variance in SRH that was explained by all common genetic variants was 13%. Polygenic scores for the following traits and disorders were associated with SRH: cognitive ability, education, neuroticism, body mass index (BMI), longevity, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, lung function, blood pressure, coronary artery disease, large vessel disease stroke and type 2 diabetes.Conclusions: Individual differences in how people respond to a single item on SRH are partly explained by their genetic propensity to many common psychiatric and physical disorders and psychological traits. © The Author 2017; all rights reserved.","Genetic correlation; Genome-wide association study; Heritability; Pleiotropy; Polygenic score; Self-rated health",,2-s2.0-85027692883

Neuroimaging studies have revealed overall decreases in cortical thickness (CT) and increases in fractional anisotropy (FA). Furthermore, previous studies have shown that certain cortical regions display coordinated growth during development. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the timing and speed of these developmental transformations, and it is still unclear whether white and grey matter changes are co-localized. In this multimodal neuroimaging study, we investigated the relationship between grey and white matter developmental changes and asynchronous maturation within brain regions in 249 normally developing children between the ages 7–14. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze CT and FA, respectively, as well as their covariance across development. Consistent with previous studies, we observed overall cortical thinning with age, which was accompanied by increased FA. We then compared the coordinated development of grey and white matter as indexed by covariance measures. Covariance between grey matter regions and the microstructure of white matter tracts connecting those regions were highly similar, suggesting that coordinated changes in the cortex were mirrored by coordinated changes in their respective tracts. Examining within-brain divergent trajectories, we found significant structural decoupling (decreased covariance) between several brain regions and tracts in the 9- to 11-year-old group, particularly involving the forceps minor and the regions that it connects to. We argue that this decoupling could reflect a developmental pattern within the prefrontal region in 9- and 11-year-old children, possibly related to the significant changes in cognitive control observed at this age. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Children; Connectivity; Frontopolar cortex; Neurodevelopment; Structural covariance","adolescent; Article; brain development; child; child growth; cortical thickness (brain); diffusion tensor imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; gray matter; groups by age; human; image analysis; image processing; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; white matter",2-s2.0-84966694400

Reduced sleep duration over multiple nights has similar behavioural effects to those observed following acute total sleep deprivation, suggesting that lack of sleep affects brain function cumulatively. A link between habitual sleep patterns and functional connectivity has previously been observed, and the effect of sleep duration on the brain's intrinsic functional architecture may provide a link between sleep status and cognition. However, it is currently not known whether differences in habitual sleep patterns across individuals are related to changes in the brain's white matter, which underlies structural connectivity. In the present study we use diffusion–weighted imaging and a group comparison application of tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) to investigate changes to fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in relation to sleep duration and quality, hypothesising that white matter metrics would be positively associated with sleep duration and quality. Diffusion weighted imaging data was acquired from a final cohort of 33 (23–29 years, 10 female, mean 25.4 years) participants. Sleep patterns were assessed for a 14 day period using wrist actigraphs and sleep diaries, and subjective sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Median splits based on total sleep time and PSQI were used to create groups of shorter/longer and poorer/better sleepers, whose imaging data was compared using TBSS followed by post-hoc correlation analysis in regions identified as significantly different between the groups. There were significant positive correlations between sleep duration and FA in the left orbito-frontal region and the right superior corona radiata, and significant negative correlations between sleep duration and MD in right orbito-frontal white matter and the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Improved sleep quality was positively correlated with FA in left caudate nucleus, white matter tracts to the left orbito-frontal region, the left anterior cingulum bundle and the white matter tracts associated with the right operculum and insula, and negatively correlated with MD in left orbito-frontal white matter and the left anterior cingulum bundle. Our findings suggest that reduced cumulative total sleep time (cTST) and poorer subjective sleep quality are associated with subtle white matter micro-architectural changes. The regions we identified as being related to habitual sleep patterns were restricted to the frontal and temporal lobes, and the functions they support are consistent with those which have previously been demonstrated as being affected by short sleep durations (e.g., attention, cognitive control, memory). Examining how inter-individual differences in brain structure are related to habitual sleep patterns could help to shed light on the mechanisms by which sleep habits are associated with brain function, behaviour and cognition, as well as potentially the networks and systems responsible for variations in sleep patterns themselves. © 2017 The Authors",,,2-s2.0-85026241810

Future WSNs systems demand that connected devices could be able to work autonomously, while surfing on-line generated data and process them for self-decision making. Accordingly, we propose a cognitive Information-Centric Sensor Network (ICSN) framework. The fundamentals of cognition in ICSN can be recognized as a promising direction in addressing opportunities and challenges posed by the needs of WSNs. Nevertheless, these fundamental concepts could be difficult to implement due to the wide spectrum of tasks to be covered from the perspective of each device in the WSN. Consequently, we propose the use of Cognitive Nodes (CNs) in typical sensor networks to provide intelligent information processing and knowledge-based services to the end-users. The CNs act on queries from the end-user, containing information about the nature of the request, without the need to modify and/or change any component at the end nodes from where data is collected. We present the detailed architecture and deployment strategy of the cognitive inspired framework that learns and exploits an expanded network information from relays and clustered sensors. Extensive simulation results show that in a network with randomly deployed sensor nodes, CNs can be strategically deployed at pre-determined positions, to ensure that end-user’s Quality of Information (QoI) requirements are met, even under heavy traffic conditions and extensive packets’ payloads. This shows the potential use of ICSN framework in producing the future cognitive applications, while catering to user-desired information quality. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Cognitive node; Deployment strategy; Information-centric sensor networks; Large-scale applications","Behavioral research; Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Network architecture; Sensor nodes; Cognitive nodes; Communication technologies; Deployment strategy; Information-centric; Intelligent information processing; Large-scale applications; Quality of informations (QoI); Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",2-s2.0-85019676312

One key reason is that the human cognitive processes and defense mechanisms in question can accomplish conflict detection functionalities, filter functionalities, and other system stabilizing tasks within artificial intelligence systems. Yet artificial cognitive architectures lack the capability to analyze complex situations as well as the universal competencies needed to orientate themselves in complex environments in various domains. Psychoanalytic Defense Mechanisms in Cognitive Multi-Agent Systems addresses this dilemma by exploring how to describe, model, and implement psychoanalytic defense mechanisms in the course of a project that provides a functional model of the human mind. With discussions focusing on the development of a mathematical description for the implementation of conflict detection, the activation and selection of defense mechanisms, and the processing of defense mechanisms, Psychoanalytic Defense Mechanisms in Cognitive Multi-Agent Systems describes the decisive points for the application of defense mechanisms in artificial intelligence. Formulae that treat defense mechanisms as transformations are also provided. Interdisciplinary cooperation between the scientific fields of psychoanalysis and artificial intelligence is highlighted as the foundation of new research findings throughout the book.

Not only are the brain's computational capabilities far beyond those of conventional computers, its energy efficiency is truly remarkable. This book, written from the perspective of a computer designer and targeted at computer researchers, is intended to give both background and lay out a course of action for studying the brain's computational paradigm. It contains a mix of concepts and ideas drawn from computational neuroscience, combined with those of the author. As background, relevant biological features are described in terms of their computational and communication properties. The brain's neocortex is constructed of massively interconnected neurons that compute and communicate via voltage spikes, and a strong argument can be made that precise spike timing is an essential element of the paradigm. Drawing from the biological features, a mathematics-based computational paradigm is constructed. The key feature is spiking neurons that perform communication and processing in space-time, with emphasis on time. In these paradigms, time is used as a freely available resource for both communication and computation. Neuron models are first discussed in general, and one is chosen for detailed development. Using the model, single-neuron computation is first explored. Neuron inputs are encoded as spike patterns, and the neuron is trained to identify input pattern similarities. Individual neurons are building blocks for constructing larger ensembles, referred to as ""columns"". These columns are trained in an unsupervised manner and operate collectively to perform the basic cognitive function of pattern clustering. Similar input patterns are mapped to a much smaller set of similar output patterns, thereby dividing the input patterns into identifiable clusters. Larger cognitive systems are formed by combining columns into a hierarchical architecture. These higher level architectures are the subject of ongoing study, and progress to date is described in detail in later chapters. Simulation plays a major role in model development, and the simulation infrastructure developed by the author is described.","Classification; Computing theory; Neuron models; Spiking neural networks; Temporal models; Unsupervised learning","Classification (of information); Cognitive systems; Computation theory; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Hierarchical systems; Network architecture; Neurons; Unsupervised learning; Computational neuroscience; Computing theory; Hierarchical architectures; Higher level architectures; Neuron model; Spiking neural networks; Temporal models; Temporal neural networks; Neural networks",2-s2.0-85027186224

Central to those applications is the requirement to understand the meaning of complex situations happening in dynamic environments, and to act based upon those situations so that certain goal situations will be reached. Often actions of situation control face hardly definable goal situations and lack of control optimality. Although the importance of theories such as situation awareness has been well recognized, we are still away from a broadly accepted understanding of the mechanisms of situation control. We argue that augmenting situation control with capabilities exhibited by human cognition provides more effective mechanisms for organizing goal-directed behavior of complex systems.

An essential aspect of collaboration is trust and in order to establish it there is need for human-machine mutual understanding (HMMU). We argue that achieving HMMU will require evolving from an approach that reduces human factors as uncontrollable environmental elements, to one that repositions human emotions not only as a central part of an integrated control paradigm, but also as interpretable and steerable through appropriate information flows and mutual learning cycles. On the strategic decision-making side, we argue conflict resolution will require anticipating multiple trade-off situations that include human factors. On the operational level, symbiotic human-machine cognitive architectures should embed detected human emotions as inputs in shared machine control models. Trust measurements will play the role of mediating task coordination by pinpointing and dynamically composing appropriate situation-aware interaction protocols. In addition to a vision for HMMU, this paper proposes a multidisciplinary research strategy that attempts to unify the isolated efforts of different communities.

However, these studies have mainly focused on group-level network modularity analyses using “static” functional connectivity approaches. How these extraordinary modular brain structures vary across individuals and spontaneously reconfigure over time remain largely unknown. Here, we employed multiband resting-state functional MRI data (N=105) from the Human Connectome Project and a graph-based modularity analysis to systematically investigate individual variability and dynamic properties in modular brain networks. We showed that the modular structures of brain networks dramatically vary across individuals, with higher modular variability primarily in the association cortex (e.g., fronto-parietal and attention systems) and lower variability in the primary systems. Moreover, brain regions spontaneously changed their module affiliations on a temporal scale of seconds, which cannot be simply attributable to head motion and sampling error. Interestingly, the spatial pattern of intra-subject dynamic modular variability largely overlapped with that of inter-subject modular variability, both of which were highly reproducible across repeated scanning sessions. Finally, the regions with remarkable individual/temporal modular variability were closely associated with network connectors and the number of cognitive components, suggesting a potential contribution to information integration and flexible cognitive function. Collectively, our findings highlight individual modular variability and the notable dynamic characteristics in large-scale brain networks, which enhance our understanding of the neural substrates underlying individual differences in a variety of cognition and behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Association cortex; Connectomics; Connector; Dynamics; Graph theory; Modularity","adult; Article; association cortex; behavior; biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism; brain; brain region; cognition; connectome; controlled study; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; head movement; human; human experiment; individual variability; male; nerve cell network; neuroanatomy; normal human; reproducibility; resting state network; sampling error",2-s2.0-85014501596

Prior neuroimaging studies have confirmed that a close correlation exists between functional connectivity and cognitive impairment. Based on this observation, in this study we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to study the relationship between whole brain functional connectivity and cognitive function in CID. Methods: We included 39 patients with CID and 28 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls (HC). Abnormalities in functional connectivity were identified by comparing the correlation coefficients for each pair of 116 brain regions between CID and HC. Results: Cognitive impairment was associated with reduced subjective insomnia scores after controlling for age, gender, and educational effects. Compared with HC, patients with CID had larger negative correlations within the task-negative network [medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, and superior parietal gyrus], and between two intrinsic anti-correlation networks (mPFC and middle temporal gyrus; supplementary motor area and cerebellum). Patients with CID also had decreased positive correlations within the default mode network (DMN), and between the cerebellum and DMN, which mainly comprises the mPFC and posterior cingulated cortex. There were positive correlations of decreased positive connectivity with subjective sleep scores and MMSE scores, and increased negative correlations between the task-negative-network and MMSE scores in CID. Conclusions: Using rs-fMRI, our results support previous observations of cortical disconnection in CID in the prefrontal and DMN networks. Moreover, abnormal correlations within the task-negative network, and between two intrinsically anti-correlation networks, might be important neurobiological indicators of CID and associated cognitive impairment. © 2017 Pang, Zhan, Zhang, Guo, Wang, Guo, Liu, Wang and Li.","Chronic insomnia disorder; Cognitive impairment; Functional connectivity; Resting-state fMRI","adult; age; Article; cerebellum; chronic insomnia disorder; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; correlation coefficient; default mode network; educational status; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; inferior temporal gyrus; insomnia; male; medial prefrontal cortex; middle temporal gyrus; parietal gyrus; posterior cingulate; precuneus; sex difference; supplementary motor area",2-s2.0-85019591956

It learns and retrieves memories as humans brain does, i.e., changing the strengths of plastic synapses (weights) based on inputs and retrieving information by information itself. One of the key challenges in designing AM is to extend memory capacity (i.e., memories that a neural AM can learn) while minimizing power and hardware overhead. However, prior arts show that memory capacity scales slowly, often logarithmically or in squire root with the total bits of synaptic weights. This makes it prohibitive in hardware and power to achieve large memory capacity for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a synaptic model called recursive synaptic bit reuse, which enables near-linear scaling of memory capacity with total synaptic bits. Also, our model can handle input data that are correlated, more robustly than the conventional model. We experiment our proposed model in Hopfield Neural Networks (HNN) which contains the total synaptic bits of 5kB to 327kB and find that our model can increase the memory capacity as large as 30X over conventional models. We also study hardware cost via VLSI implementation of HNNs in a 65nm CMOS, confirming that our proposed model can achieve up to 10X area savings at the same capacity over conventional synaptic model. © 2017 IEEE.","Associative memory; Hopfield neural network; Memory capacity; Synaptic model","Associative processing; Associative storage; Hardware; Memory architecture; Scales (weighing instruments); Associative memory; Classification and recognition; Cognitive workloads; Conventional modeling; Conventional models; Hopfield neural networks (HNN); Memory capacity; Neural associative memory; Hopfield neural networks",2-s2.0-85020183264

The network formed by this coordination comprises two variedly operating ad hoc units. One such coordinating network is formed between the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the ground nodes. Such network formations require highly sensitive and fault-tolerant data transfer over the secure channels. A secure channel is required that can ensure the secure connectivity between nodes of the two networks. This secure channel can be realized using a teredo tunneling approach. Using this approach, a service-oriented security framework is developed. The proposed framework focuses over security in terms of cognitive, corridor, and localization of the multi-UAV guided system based on the estimation of teredo units using Gauss–Markov-based α − β − γ filter. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated, with significant improvements in terms of system fairness, data delivery ratio, network throughput, and average delays in comparison with the baseline and Hubenko architecture. The proposed model provides 16.25% better fairness, 12% better data rate, 15.7% better throughput, and 10.3% lesser delays than the baseline and 12.9% better fairness, 10% better data rate, 8% better throughput, and 7.9% lesser delays than the Hubenko architecture.

However, the scope of that control remains unknown: it remains unclear whether the PFC can modulate basic reflexes. One canonical example of a central reflex is the pupil light reflex (PLR): the automatic constriction of the pupil in response to luminance increments. Unlike pupil size, which depends on the interaction of multiple physiological and neuromodulatory influences, the PLR reflects the action of a simple brainstem circuit. However, emerging behavioral evidence suggests that the PLR may be modulated by cognitive processes. Although the neural basis of these modulations remains unknown, one possible source is the PFC, particularly the frontal eye field (FEF), an area of the PFC implicated in the control of attention. We show that microstimulation of the rhesus macaque FEF alters the magnitude of the PLR in a spatially specific manner. FEF microstimulation enhanced the PLR to probes presented within the stimulated visual field, but suppressed the PLR to probes at nonoverlapping locations. The spatial specificity of this effect parallels the effect of FEF stimulation on attention and suggests that FEF is capable of modulating visuomotor transformations performed at a lower level than was previously known. These results provide evidence of the selective regulation of a basic brainstem reflex by the PFC. © 2017 the authors.","Frontal eye field; Prefrontal cortex; Pupil constriction; Pupil light reflex; Reflex control; Subsumption architecture","animal experiment; Article; controlled study; craniotomy; eye position; frontal eye field; male; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oculomotor nerve; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; pupil; pupil reflex; rhesus monkey; visual field; visuomotor coordination; animal; electrostimulation; light; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; photostimulation; physiology; prefrontal cortex; procedures; pupil reflex; radiation response; visual adaptation; Adaptation, Ocular; Animals; Electric Stimulation; Light; Macaca mulatta; Male; Nerve Net; Neuronal Plasticity; Photic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Reflex, Pupillary",2-s2.0-85018879633

As these impairments may have direct implications on patient support and care, such studies are urgently necessary. Aim of the study: The aim of the study was to determine whether the recognition of meaningful environmental sounds is impaired in patients with mild or early stage neurodegenerative dementia. Patients and methods: We developed a test of non-verbal sound recognition consisting of 16 sound sequences from the familiar and unfamiliar environments. We included 18 patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia, as well as 20 cognitively healthy controls. Results: Patients and controls were given the test of recognizing 16 meaningful sounds from the familiar and unfamiliar environments. Patients with dementia performed significantly worse in comparison to cognitively healthy controls. Whilst healthy controls correctly recognized on average 12.1 ± 2.2 out of 16 sounds, cognitively impaired patients recognized 9.2 ± 2.5. Correlation analysis showed that the mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores were positively correlated with the number of correctly recognized sounds (MMSE: r = 0.556, p = 0.017). Discussion: The fact that even in mild stages of Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal dementia patients either do not recognize or misinterpret environmental sounds must be taken into consideration not only in everyday life but in particular when patients need to leave their familiar living environment, whether temporarily (e. g. hospitalization) or permanently (e. g. nursing home admission). © 2017 Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH","Architecture; Central auditory agnosia; Dementia; Environmental sounds; Hearing deficiency",,2-s2.0-85019074852

However, the challenge of increasingly high signal frequency and wide bandwidth requires an extremely high sampling rate which may exceed today’s best analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) front-end bandwidth. Recently, the newly proposed architecture called modulated wideband converter (MWC), is an attractive analog compressed sensing technique that can highly reduce the sampling rate. However, the MWC has high hardware complexity owing to its parallel channel structure especially when the number of signals increases. In this paper, we propose a single channel modulated wideband converter (SCMWC) scheme for spectrum sensing of band-limited wide-sense stationary (WSS) signals. With one antenna or sensor, this scheme can save not only sampling rate but also hardware complexity. We then present a new, SCMWC based, single node CR prototype System, on which the spectrum sensing algorithm was tested. Experiments on our hardware prototype show that the proposed architecture leads to successful spectrum sensing. And the total sampling rate as well as hardware size is only one channel’s consumption of MWC. © 2017 by the authors.

It potentially worsens the cognitive dysfunction and inhibits their functional recovery. However, whether OSA independently damages the cognitive function in stroke patients is unclear. A simple method for evaluating OSA-induced cognitive impairment is also missing. Methods Forty-four stroke patients six weeks after onset and 24 non-stroke patients with snoring were recruited for the polysomnographic study of OSA and sleep architecture. Their cognitive status was evaluated with a validated Chinese version of Cambridge Prospective Memory Test. The relationship between memory deficits and respiratory, sleeping, and dementia-related clinical variables were analyzed with correlation and multiple linear regression tests. Results OSA significantly and independently damaged time- and event-based prospective memory in stroke patients, although it had less power than the stroke itself. The impairment of prospective memory was correlated with increased apnea–hypopnea index, decreased minimal and mean levels of peripheral oxygen saturation, and disrupted sleeping continuity (reduced sleep efficiency and increased microarousal index). The further regression analysis identified minimal levels of peripheral oxygen saturation and sleep efficiency to be the two most important predictors for the decreased time-based prospective memory in stroke patients. Conclusions OSA independently contributes to the cognitive dysfunction in stroke patients, potentially through OSA-caused hypoxemia and sleeping discontinuity. The prospective memory test is a simple but sensitive method to detect OSA-induced cognitive impairment in stroke patients. Proper therapies of OSA might improve the cognitive function and increase the life quality of stroke patients. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cognition; Obstructive sleep apnea; Prospective memory; Sleep and stroke","adult; aged; amnesia; apnea hypopnea index; arousal; Article; Cambridge Prospective Memory Test; Chinese (language); clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; disease association; disease duration; female; human; hypoxemia; male; memory test; oxygen saturation; polysomnography; prospective memory; quality of life; sensitivity analysis; sleep disordered breathing; sleep quality; snoring; stroke patient",2-s2.0-85014748838

In this paper, we explore the existence of similar information on vector representations of images. For that purpose we define a methodology to obtain large, sparse vector representations of image classes, and generate vectors through the state-of-the-art deep learning architecture GoogLeNet for 20 K images obtained from ImageNet. We first evaluate the resultant vector-space semantics through its correlation with WordNet distances, and find vector distances to be strongly correlated with linguistic semantics. We then explore the location of images within the vector space, finding elements close in WordNet to be clustered together, regardless of significant visual variances (e.g., 118 dog types). More surprisingly, we find that the space unsupervisedly separates complex classes without prior knowledge (e.g., living things). Afterwards, we consider vector arithmetics. Although we are unable to obtain meaningful results on this regard, we discuss the various problem we encountered, and how we consider to solve them.

Here, we used network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical analyses to study structural changes in the brain as a function of cognitive training. Fifty-six young women were divided in two groups (experimental and control). We assessed their cognitive function before and after completing a working memory intervention using a comprehensive battery that included fluid and crystallized abilities, working memory and attention control, and we also obtained structural MRI images. We acquired and analyzed diffusion-weighted images to reconstruct the anatomical connectome and we computed standardized changes in connectivity as well as group differences across time using NBS. We also compared group differences relying on a variety of graph-theory indices (clustering, characteristic path length, global and local efficiency and strength) for the whole network as well as for the sub-network derived from NBS analyses. Finally, we calculated correlations between these graph indices and training performance as well as the behavioral changes in cognitive function. Our results revealed enhanced connectivity for the training group within one specific network comprised of nodes/regions supporting cognitive processes required by the training (working memory, interference resolution, inhibition, and task engagement). Significant group differences were also observed for strength and global efficiency indices in the sub-network detected by NBS. Therefore, the connectome approach is a valuable method for tracking the effects of cognitive training interventions across specific sub-networks. Moreover, this approach allows for the computation of graph theoretical network metrics to quantify the topological architecture of the brain network detected.

An attention system is used to prioritise the processing of visual information by (1) localising candidate objects, and (2) integrating an inhibition of return (IOR) mechanism grounded in spatial coordinates. This spatial IOR mechanism naturally copes with camera motions and inhibits objects that have already been the target of attention. Our approach provides object candidates which can be processed by higher cognitive modules such as object recognition. Since objects are basic elements for many higher level tasks, our architecture can be used as a first layer in any cognitive system that aims at interpreting a stream of images.

Results obtained by placing seeds in early sensory cortices revealed novel hierarchical patterns of adult brain organization ultimately converging in limbic, paralimbic, basal ganglia, and frontoparietal brain regions. These findings are remarkably consistent with predictive coding accounts of neural processing that place these regions at the top of predictive coding hierarchies. Infants gradually developed toward this architecture in a region- and step-dependent manner, and displayed many of the same regions as adults in top hierarchical positions, starting from 1 year of age. The findings further revealed patterns of inter-sensory connectivity likely reflecting the emergence and development of multisensory processing strategies during infancy, the strengths of which were correlated with early cognitive development scores.

However, although studies concerning the involvement of the left ventral route in verbal semantics are proficient, the potential implication of the right ventral pathway in non-verbal semantics has been to date unexplored. To gain insights on this matter, we used an intraoperative direct electrostimulation to map the structures mediating the non-verbal semantic system in the right hemisphere. Thirteen patients presenting with a right low-grade glioma located within or close to the ventral stream were included. During the ‘awake’ procedure, patients performed both a visual non-verbal semantic task and a verbal (control) task. At the cortical level, in the right hemisphere, we found non-verbal semantic-related sites (n = 7 in 6 patients) in structures commonly associated with verbal semantic processes in the left hemisphere, including the superior temporal gyrus, the pars triangularis, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. At the subcortical level, we found non-verbal semantic-related sites in all but one patient (n = 15 sites in 12 patients). Importantly, all these responsive stimulation points were located on the spatial course of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). These findings provide direct support for a critical role of the right IFOF in non-verbal semantic processing. Based upon these original data, and in connection with previous findings showing the involvement of the left IFOF in non-verbal semantic processing, we hypothesize the existence of a bilateral network underpinning the non-verbal semantic system, with a homotopic connectional architecture. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Electrostimulation mapping; Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus; Naming; Non-verbal semantic processing; Right hemisphere; Ventral stream","adult; aged; Article; brain mapping; clinical article; cognition; cognitive defect; craniotomy; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; electrostimulation; female; glioma; human; left hemisphere; male; mental task; neuroanatomy; non verbal semantic cognition; occipitofrontal fasciculus; pars triangularis; priority journal; right hemisphere; superior temporal gyrus; surgical technique; task performance",2-s2.0-84983802165

These factors include early management of respiratory dysfunction with non-invasive ventilation, maintenance of weight and nutritional status, as well as instigation of a multidisciplinary team including neurologists, general practitioners and allied health professionals.

A dynamic system capable of monitoring and detecting decreased physiologic states due to the onset of hypoxia has the potential to prevent adverse outcomes. In this study, we develop a real-time hypoxia monitoring system based on a parallel M-ary decision fusion architecture. Blood oxygen saturation levels and altitude readings are the inputs and estimates of the level of hypoxia are the outputs. We develop new temporal evolution models for blood oxygen saturation and functional impairment with respect to varying altitude.

Several open-loop DBS control strategies have been developed for clinical experiments, but they are limited by short battery life and inefficient therapy. Therefore, many closed-loop DBS control systems have been designed to tackle these problems by automatically adjusting the stimulation parameters via feedback from neural signals, which has been reported to reduce the power consumption. However, when the association between the biomarkers of the model and stimulation is unclear, it is difficult to develop an optimal control scheme for other DBS applications, i.e., DBS-enhanced instrumental learning. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the effect of closed-loop DBS control for cognition function, such as instrumental skill learning, and have been implemented in simulation environments. In this paper, we proposed a proof-of-principle design for a closed-loop DBS system, cognitive-enhancing DBS (ceDBS), which enhanced skill learning based on in vivo experimental data. The ceDBS acquired local field potential (LFP) signal from the thalamic central lateral (CL) nuclei of animals through a neural signal processing system. A strong coupling of the theta oscillation (4–7 Hz) and the learning period was found in the water reward-related lever-pressing learning task. Therefore, the theta-band power ratio, which was the averaged theta band to averaged total band (1–55 Hz) power ratio, could be used as a physiological marker for enhancement of instrumental skill learning. The on-line extraction of the theta-band power ratio was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). An autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictor was designed to construct a CL-thalamic DBS model and forecast the future physiological marker according to the past physiological marker and applied DBS. The prediction could further assist the design of a closed-loop DBS controller. A DBS controller based on a fuzzy expert system was devised to automatically control DBS according to the predicted physiological marker via a set of rules. The simulated experimental results demonstrate that the ceDBS based on the closed-loop control architecture not only reduced power consumption using the predictive physiological marker, but also achieved a desired level of physiological marker through the DBS controller. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Autoregressive exogenous; Closed-loop system; Deep brain stimulation; Fuzzy expert system; Instrumental skill learning; Local field potential","adult; animal experiment; Article; brain depth stimulation; cognition; computer system; control system; controlled study; fuzzy system; in vivo study; information processing; instrumental conditioning; learning; learning test; male; nerve stimulator; nonhuman; personal computer; priority journal; rat; reward; signal processing; simulation; skill; software; task performance; thalamus; theta rhythm",2-s2.0-85014775240

One important feature of VSWM is that it has a limited capacity such that only few items can be actively stored and manipulated simultaneously. Given the limited capacity, it is important to determine the conditions that affect memory performance as this will improve our understanding of the architecture and function of VSWM. Previous studies have shown that VSWM is disrupted when task-irrelevant eye movements are performed during the maintenance phase; however, relatively fewer studies examined the role of eye movements performed during the encoding phase. On one hand, performing eye movements during the encoding phase could result in a stronger memory trace because the memory formation is reinforced by the activation of the motor system. On the other hand, performing eye movements to each target could disrupt the configural processing of the spatial array because the spatial representation has to be updated with each movement to maintain perceptual stability. Therefore, this work was conducted to examine whether task-relevant saccadic eye movements performed during the encoding phase of a visuospatial working memory task affect the recall of serially presented targets. Results from two experiments showed that average recall accuracy was significantly higher when the spatial array (set size ≥ 7) was encoded using a covert strategy—that is, while participants fixated on a central target, in comparison to an overt strategy—that is, while participants moved their eyes to fixate on each target. Furthermore, the improvement in accuracy was evident only for targets presented in the first half of the sequence, suggesting that the primacy effect is modulated by the presence of eye movements. We propose that executing saccades during encoding could interfere with the ability to use a chunking strategy or disrupt active visualization of the configuration. In conclusion, this is the first study to show that task-relevant saccadic eye movements performed during encoding may actually reduce the spatial span of VSWM. These results extend the current knowledge about the role of eye movements in VSWM, and have implications for future studies investigating the VSWM. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Attention; Corsi block task; Eye movements; Spatial; Visual; Working memory","accuracy; adult; Article; cognition; Corsi block tapping test; eye movement; eye movement monitor; female; human; human experiment; male; monitor; motor system; normal human; outcome assessment; priority journal; recall; saccadic eye movement; software; task performance; visuospatial working memory; working memory; young adult; analysis of variance; depth perception; learning; neuropsychological test; photostimulation; physiology; saccadic eye movement; short term memory; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Mental Recall; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Saccades; Serial Learning; Space Perception; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85014074136

Often, people do not make the decisions that game theory would prescribe. We present a logic that can play a key role in understanding how people make their decisions, by delineating all plausible reasoning strategies in a systematic manner. This in turn makes it possible to construct a corresponding set of computational models in a cognitive architecture. These models can be run and fitted to the participants’ data in terms of decisions, response times, and answers to questions. We validate these claims on the basis of an earlier game-theoretic experiment about the turn-taking game “Marble Drop with Surprising Opponent”, in which the opponent often starts with a seemingly irrational move. We explore two ways of segregating the participants into reasonable “player types”. The first way is based on latent class analysis, which divides the players into three classes according to their first decisions in the game: Random players, Learners, and Expected players, who make decisions consistent with forward induction. The second way is based on participants’ answers to a question about their opponent, classified according to levels of theory of mind: zero-order, first-order and second-order. It turns out that increasing levels of decisions and theory of mind both correspond to increasing success as measured by monetary awards and increasing decision times. Next, we use the logical language to express different kinds of strategies that people apply when reasoning about their opponent and making decisions in turn-taking games, as well as the ‘reasoning types’ reflected in their behavior. Then, we translate the logical formulas into computational cognitive models in the PRIMs architecture. Finally, we run two of the resulting models, corresponding to the strategy of only being interested in one’s own payoff and to the myopic strategy, in which one can only look ahead to a limited number of nodes.

Concurrently, advances in digital technology and signal processing have drastically reduced digital beamforming complexity. Recently, a novel on-site coding receiver (OSCR) architecture was proposed to significantly reduce hardware requirement for digital beamforming. Using OSCR, the signal from each antenna element is encoded, then several of these signals are grouped and digitized using a single analog-to-digital converter. Doing so, hardware requirements are drastically reduced. At the digital back-end, field programmable gate arrays are used to decorrelate and recover the signals associated with each array element for beamforming. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the OSCR concept by building and testing a multichannel receiver using commercial-off-the-shelf components. Various test bench measurements are performed in an anechoic chamber using an UWB antenna array operating from 200 MHz-2.5 GHz, and data were collected at multiple frequencies. Results show an accurate estimate of the angle of arrival for incidence angles of θs = 0°, 15°, 30°, and 45° away from broadside.

Fluid intellectual abilities decline while crystalized abilities remain stable or increase. This shift has a profound impact across myriad cognitive and functional domains, yet the neural mechanisms remain under-specified. We have proposed that greater connectivity between the default network and executive control regions in lateral prefrontal cortex may underlie this shift, as older adults increasingly rely upon accumulated knowledge to support goal-directed behavior. Here we provide direct evidence for this mechanism within the domain of autobiographical memory. In a large sample of healthy adult participants (n = 103 Young; n = 80 Old) the strength of default - executive coupling reliably predicted more semanticized, or knowledge-based, recollection of autobiographical memories in the older adult cohort. The findings are consistent with the default - executive coupling hypothesis of aging and identify this shift in network dynamics as a candidate neural mechanism associated with crystalized cognition in later life that may signal adaptive capacity in the context of declining fluid cognitive abilities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.","Aging; Autobiographical memory; Default network","adult; aging; autobiographical memory; behavior; executive function; female; human; human tissue; lateral prefrontal cortex; liquid; major clinical study; male",2-s2.0-85020886617

Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in each of these tasks. However, as scene and objects are interrelated, the performance of both of these recognition tasks can be further improved by exploiting dependencies between scene and object deep networks. The advantages of considering the inter-dependency between these networks are the following: 1. improvement of accuracy in both scene and object classification, and 2. significant reduction of computational cost in object detection. In order to formulate our framework, we employ two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), scene-CNN and object-CNN. We utilize scene-CNN to generate object proposals which indicate the probable object locations in an image. Object proposals found in the process are semantically relevant to the object. More importantly, the number of object proposals is fewer in amount when compared to other existing methods which reduces the computational cost significantly. Thereafter, in scene classification, we train three hidden layers in order to combine the global (image as a whole) and local features (object information in an image). Features extracted from CNN architecture along with the features processed from object-CNN are combined to perform efficient classification. We perform rigorous experiments on five datasets to demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying scenes as well as recognizing objects. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Convolution; Cost reduction; Neural networks; Object recognition; Pattern recognition; Cognitive vision; Computational costs; Convolutional neural network; Inter-dependencies; Object classification; Object information; Scene classification; State-of-the-art methods; Object detection",2-s2.0-85019143990

In this approach cellular phone user is considered as primary user (PU) with the permission to utilize the license band and CRSN may be designed in underlay mode to operate in the emergency situation simultaneously with the PU to send sensory information about the presence of explosives to the nearest base station. In this application CRSN would act as secondary user (SU) and share power of its own PU to send the emergency information that in turn causes interference and minimizes the PU's quality of service (QoS). The challenging issue is to share the allocated power of the PU with SU sustaining the link connection of the PU with the base station. We have used Nash Bargaining Power Control (NBPC) technique to search optimal powers at different distances from the base station for both the PU and SU of the proposed integrated cellular phone system and ultimately control the power of both PU and SU in the emergency environment.

This finding has been attributed to gradual dissipation of the response automatically activated by the task-irrelevant location information. The Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks (DMC, Ulrich, Schröter, Leuthold, & Birngruber, Cognitive Psychology 78:148–174, 2015) formally specifies the time-course of this automatic activation process as a pulse-like function. In contrast to alternative views, DMC is consistent with the notion that this time-course is unaffected by the presentation duration of the target stimulus. Therefore, we expected that delta functions are invariant against changes of stimulus duration. This prediction was verified in two Simon task experiments. Consistent with this general result, DMC’s parameter τ which defines the time-course of the automatic response activation was estimated to not meaningfully differ between short and long durations. We argue that our results are coherent with processing architectures that assume a transient automatic process that is virtually unaffected by stimulus duration. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",,,2-s2.0-85017191807

In recall phase, the output attractor of the network ranges from fixed point which results in a prototype facial image, to chaotic attractors which lead to generating exemplar faces. The generative model is applied to enrich a facial image dataset in terms of variability by generating various virtual patterns, in case that only one image per subject is provided.

This paper delves into the workings of online trust systems under user bias and analyses the user behaviour through biases defined by Prospect theory. By performing empirical study on an existing system, we are able to demonstrate that there is a huge discrepancy between the aim of implementation of the online trust models and the users’ perception of those models. Understanding of this relation by the system designers can reduce complexity and improve the user experience and the system performance. The results imply that the tendency of the users to exhibit cognitive biases is not only the cause, but also the effect from the trust system design.

SEMLINCS models the development of an embodied cognitive agent that learns discrete production rule-like structures from its own, autonomously gathered, continuous sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, the agent uses the developing knowledge to plan and control environmental interactions in a versatile, goal-directed, and self-motivated manner. Thus, in contrast to several well-known symbolic cognitive architectures, SEMLINCS is not provided with production rules and the involved symbols, but it learns them. In this paper, the actual implementation of SEMLINCS causes learning and self-motivated, autonomous behavioral control of the game figure Mario in a clone of the computer game Super Mario Bros. Our evaluations highlight the successful development of behavioral versatility as well as the learning of suitable production rules and the involved symbols from sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, knowledge- and motivation-dependent individualizations of the agents’ behavioral tendencies are shown. Finally, interaction sequences can be planned on the sensorimotor-grounded production rule level. Current limitations directly point toward the need for several further enhancements, which may be integrated into SEMLINCS in the near future. Overall, SEMLINCS may be viewed as an architecture that allows the functional and computational modeling of embodied cognitive development, whereby the current main focus lies on the development of production rules from sensorimotor experiences.

In addition, not enough attention was paid to the strategies used by participants, and there was a lack of theories implemented as computer models offering sufficient precision for being tested rigorously. He proposed a three-headed research program: to develop computational models able to carry out the task they aimed to explain; to study one complex task in detail, such as chess; and to build computational models that can account for multiple tasks. This article assesses the extent to which the papers in this issue advance Newell's program. While half of the papers devote much attention to strategies, several papers still average across them, a capital sin according to Newell. The three courses of action he proposed were not popular in these papers: Only two papers used computational models, with no model being both able to carry out the task and to account for human data; there was no systematic analysis of a specific video game; and no paper proposed a computational model accounting for human data in several tasks. It is concluded that, while they use sophisticated methods of analysis and discuss interesting results, overall these papers contribute only little to Newell's program of research. In this respect, they reflect the current state of psychology and cognitive science. This is a shame, as Newell's ideas might help address the current crisis of lack of replication and fraud in psychology. Copyright © 2017 The Author.

Generally, there are no changes in the available spectrum, thus static spectrum allocation policies were adopted. However, these allocation policies lead to spectrum under-utilization. In this regard, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have received great attention due to their potential to improve the spectrum utilization. In general, efficient spectrum management and resource allocation are essential and very crucial for CRNs. This is due to the fact that unlicensed users should attain the most benefit from accessing the licensed spectrum without causing adverse interference to the licensed ones. The cognitive users or called secondary users have to effectively capture the arising spectrum opportunities in time, frequency, and space to transmit their data. Mainly, two aspects characterize the resource allocation for CRNs: 1) primary (licensed) network protection and 2) secondary (unlicensed) network performance enhancement in terms of quality-of-service, throughput, fairness, energy efficiency, etc. CRNs can operate in one of three known operation modes: 1) interweave; 2) overlay; and 3) underlay. Among which the underlay cognitive radio mode is known to be highly efficient in terms of spectrum utilization. This is because the unlicensed users are allowed to share the same channels with the active licensed users under some conditions. In this paper, we provide a survey for resource allocation in underlay CRNs. In particular, we first define the RA process and its components for underlay CRNs. Second, we provide a taxonomy that categorizes the RA algorithms proposed in literature based on the approaches, criteria, common techniques, and network architecture. Then, the state-of-the-art resource allocation algorithms are reviewed according to the provided taxonomy. Additionally, comparisons among different proposals are provided. Finally, directions for future research are outlined. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; dynamic resource allocation; underlay spectrum sharing","Copyrights; Energy efficiency; Network architecture; Network performance; Quality of service; Radio systems; Resource allocation; Surveys; Taxonomies; Wireless networks; Allocation policies; Cognitive radio networks (CRNs); Dynamic resource allocations; Performance enhancements; Resource allocation algorithms; Spectrum utilization; Underlay cognitive radios; Underlay spectrum sharing; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85020410223

In all cases, the links between input stimuli, output actions, reinforcements and punishments are strengthened depending on the stability of the delays between them. To account for the parallel processing nature of neural networks, the SNN is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and the neural delays are extracted via an adaptation of the synapto-dendritic kernel adapting neuron (SKAN) model, for a low resource demanding FPGA implementation of the SNN.

It is non-convex optimal to optimize the fractional form EE under multiple coupling constraints. The maximization problem is transmitted into an equivalent problem in subtractive form which can be solved from the iterative point of view.

Inspired by the brain, we propose a significantly different architecture characterized by a large number of highly interconnected simple processors intertwined with very large amounts of low-latency memory. We contend that this memory-centric architecture can be realized using 3D wafer scale integration for which the technology is nearing readiness, combined with current CMOS device technologies. The natural fault tolerance and lower power requirements of neuromorphic processing make 3D wafer stacking particularly attractive. In order to assess the performance of this architecture, we propose a specific embodiment of a neuronal system using 3D wafer scale integration; formulate a simple model of brain connectivity including short-and long-range connections; and estimate the memory, bandwidth, latency, and power requirements of the system using the connectivity model.

Theories of bilingualism suggests that exposure to two languages may yield a functional and neuroanatomical adaptation to support the learning of two languages (Klein et al., 2014). To test the hypothesis that this neural adaptation may vary as a function of structural and orthographic characteristics of bilinguals’ two languages, we compared Spanish-English and French-English bilingual children, and English monolingual children, using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy neuroimaging (fNIRS, ages 6–10, N =26). Spanish offers consistent sound-to-print correspondences (“phonologically transparent” or “shallow”); such correspondences are more opaque in French and even more opaque in English (which has both transparent and “phonologically opaque” or “deep” correspondences). Consistent with our hypothesis, both French- and Spanish-English bilinguals showed hyperactivation in left posterior temporal regions associated with direct sound-to-print phonological analyses and hypoactivation in left frontal regions associated with assembled phonology analyses.

Neuroimaging studies of the functional architecture of the brain suggest common neural substrates underlying MDD and SUDs. Intrinsic brain activity is organized into a set of functional networks, of which two are particularly relevant to psychiatry. The salience network (SN) is crucial for cognitive control and response inhibition, and deficits in SN function are implicated across a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, including MDD and SUDs. The ventromedial network (VMN) corresponds to the classic reward circuit, and pathological VMN activity for drug cues/negative stimuli is seen in SUDs/MDD. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including rTMS and tDCS, have been used to enhance cortico–striatal–thalamic activity through the core SN nodes in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior insula. Improvements in both MDD and SUD symptoms ensue, including in comorbid cases, via enhanced cognitive control. Inhibition of the VMN also appears promising in preclinical studies for quenching the pathological incentive salience underlying SUDs and MDD. Evolving techniques may further enhance the efficacy of NIBS for MDD and SUD cases that are unresponsive to conventional treatments. © 2016 The Authors.

Recent work has shown that topological properties of functional brain networks are associated with individual and group differences in cognitive performance, including in episodic memory. After constructing functional whole-brain networks derived from an event-related fMRI study of memory retrieval, we examined differences in functional brain network architecture between forgotten and remembered words. This study yielded three main findings. First, graph theory analyses showed that successfully remembering compared to forgetting was associated with significant changes in the connectivity profile of the left hippocampus and a corresponding increase in efficient communication with the rest of the brain. Second, bivariate functional connectivity analyses indicated stronger interactions between the left hippocampus and a retrieval assembly for remembered versus forgotten items. This assembly included the left precuneus, left caudate, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and the bilateral dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus. Integrative properties of the retrieval assembly were greater for remembered than forgotten items. Third, whole-brain modularity analyses revealed that successful memory retrieval was marginally significantly associated with a less segregated modular architecture in the network. The magnitude of the decreases in modularity between remembered and forgotten conditions was related to memory performance. These findings indicate that increases in integrative properties at the nodal, retrieval assembly, and whole-brain topological levels facilitate memory retrieval, while also underscoring the potential of multivariate brain connectivity approaches for providing valuable new insights into the neural bases of memory processes. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Graph theory; Medial temporal lobes; Modularity; Recall","adult; Article; caudate nucleus; episodic memory; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; hippocampus; human; human experiment; inferior temporal gyrus; left hippocampus; male; middle frontal gyrus; middle occipital gyrus; normal human; parietal cortex; postcentral gyrus; precuneus; prefrontal cortex; primary motor cortex; priority journal; right hippocampus; superior frontal gyrus; supramarginal gyrus; ventral parietal cortex",2-s2.0-85010756938

The gaze heuristic is an interception heuristic that utilizes a single input (deviation from a constant angle of approach) repeatedly as a task is performed. Its architecture, advantages, and limitations are described in detail. A history of the gaze heuristic is then presented. In natural history, the gaze heuristic is the only known technique used by predators to intercept prey. In human history the gaze heuristic was discovered accidentally by Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter command just prior to World War II. As it was never discovered by the Luftwaffe, the technique conferred a decisive advantage upon the RAF throughout the war. After the end of the war in America, German technology was combined with the British heuristic to create the Sidewinder AIM9 missile, the most successful autonomous weapon ever built. There are no plans to withdraw it or replace its guiding gaze heuristic. The case study demonstrates that the gaze heuristic is a specific heuristic type that takes a single best input at the best time (take the best2). Its use is an adaptively rational response to specific, rapidly evolving decision environments that has allowed those animals/humans/machines who use it to survive, prosper, and multiply relative to those who do not.

Moreover, neuronal activity-dependent DNA double-strand break formation in the promoter of immediate early genes appears to overcome topological constraints on transcription.

For brain-machine interfaces (BMI) to be used in activities of daily living by paralyzed individuals, the BMI should be as autonomous as possible. One of the challenges is how the feedback is extracted and utilized in the BMI. Our long-term goal is to create autonomous BMIs that can utilize an evaluative feedback from the brain to update the decoding algorithm and use it intelligently in order to adapt the decoder. In this study, we show how to extract the necessary evaluative feedback from a biologically realistic (synthetic) source, use both the quantity and the quality of the feedback, and how that feedback information can be incorporated into a reinforcement learning (RL) controller architecture to maximize its performance. Approach. Motivated by the perception-action-reward cycle (PARC) in the brain which links reward for cognitive decision making and goal-directed behavior, we used a reward-based RL architecture named Actor-Critic RL as the model. Instead of using an error signal towards building an autonomous BMI, we envision to use a reward signal from the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) which plays a key role in the linking of reward to motor behaviors. To deal with the complexity and non-stationarity of biological reward signals, we used a confidence metric which was used to indicate the degree of feedback accuracy. This confidence was added to the Actor's weight update equation in the RL controller architecture. If the confidence was high (>0.2), the BMI decoder used this feedback to update its parameters. However, when the confidence was low, the BMI decoder ignored the feedback and did not update its parameters. The range between high confidence and low confidence was termed as the 'ambiguous' region. When the feedback was within this region, the BMI decoder updated its weight at a lower rate than when fully confident, which was decided by the confidence. We used two biologically realistic models to generate synthetic data for MI (Izhikevich model) and NAcc (Humphries model) to validate proposed controller architecture. Main results. In this work, we show how the overall performance of the BMI was improved by using a threshold close to the decision boundary to reject erroneous feedback. Additionally, we show the stability of the system improved when the feedback was used with a threshold. Significance: The result of this study is a step towards making BMIs autonomous. While our method is not fully autonomous, the results demonstrate that extensive training times necessary at the beginning of each BMI session can be significantly decreased. In our approach, decoder training time was only limited to 10 trials in the first BMI session. Subsequent sessions used previous session weights to initialize the decoder. We also present a method where the use of a threshold can be applied to any decoder with a feedback signal that is less than perfect so that erroneous feedback can be avoided and the stability of the system can be increased. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","biological feedback; brain machine interface; confidence; decoder; nucleus Accumbens; reinforcement learning","Brain; Controllers; Decision making; Decoding; Feedback; Reinforcement learning; System stability; Activities of Daily Living; Brain machine interface; Cognitive decision makings; confidence; Controller architectures; decoder; Goal-directed behavior; Nucleus accumbens; Brain computer interface; Article; Bayesian learning; brain computer interface; classification algorithm; cognition; decision making; discriminant analysis; feedback system; human; k nearest neighbor; locomotion; machine learning; membrane potential; motivation; nucleus accumbens; perception; principal component analysis; priority journal; reinforcement; reward; simulation; support vector machine; tree bagging",2-s2.0-85020472961

The resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the bilateral dorsal and ventral AI was calculated for twenty congenitally blind (CB), 27 early blind (EB), 44 late blind (LB) individuals and 50 sighted controls (SCs).

Our model, called Darwinian Neurodynamics, assumes that the unconscious mechanism of problem solving during insight tasks is a Darwinian process. It is based on the evolution of patterns that represent candidate solutions to a problem, and are stored and reproduced by a population of attractor networks. In our first experiment, we used human data as a benchmark and showed that the model behaves comparably to humans: it shows an improvement in performance if it is pretrained and primed appropriately, just like human participants in Kershaw et al. (2013)'s experiment. In the second experiment, we further investigated the effects of pretraining and priming in a two-by-two design and found a beginner's luck type of effect: solution rate was highest in the condition that was primed, but not pretrained with patterns relevant for the task. In the third experiment, we showed that deficits in computational capacity and learning abilities decreased the performance of the model, as expected. We conclude that Darwinian Neurodynamics is a promising model of human problem solving that deserves further investigation. © 2017 Fedor, Zachar, Szilágyi, öllinger, de Vladar and Szathmáry.","Attractor networks; Darwinian Neurodynamics; Evolutionary search; Four-tree problem; Insight",,2-s2.0-85016321230

People with ABI demand solutions in research that offer them with a relearning process such that they can recover not only their physical skills but also their cognitive abilities. In this context, the inherent characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), transparency and intelligence, have turned it into one of the best approaches to square up to the impairment that ABI can cause. As AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly, these systems can react promptly to the needs of people with ABI while they carry out their rehabilitation process. Moreover, the exploitation of a Multi-Agent architecture emerges as a natural solution to develop AmI systems, since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. Therefore, in this paper, a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) for healthcare AmI systems is presented. It contributes to treat people with ABI by using specific devices to control the patient's movements and some physiological responses, such as the variation of the heart rate, during her rehabilitation process. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is exploited.

Alterations in the circadian patterns of activity and rest are strongly linked to cognitive and emotional dysfunctions in severe mental illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depression (MDD). The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been prominently associated with the pathogenesis of AD and MDD. However, the potential involvement of IL-6 in the modulation of the diurnal rhythms of activity and rest has not been investigated. Here, we set out to study the role of IL-6 in circadian rhythmicity through the characterization of patterns of behavioral locomotor activity in IL-6 knockout (IL-6 KO) mice and wild-type littermate controls. Deletion of IL-6 did not alter the length of the circadian period or the amount of locomotor activity under either light-entrained or free-running conditions. IL-6 KO mice also presented a normal phase shift in response to light exposure at night. However, the temporal architecture of the behavioral rhythmicity throughout the day, as characterized by the quantity of ultradian activity bouts, was significantly impaired under light-entrained and free-running conditions in IL-6 KO. Moreover, the assessment of clock gene expression in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in AD and depression, revealed altered levels of cry1, dec2, and rev-erb-beta in IL-6 KO mice. These data propose that IL-6 participates in the regulation of ultradian activity/rest rhythmicity and clock gene expression in the mammalian brain. Furthermore, we propose IL-6-dependent circadian misalignment as a common pathogenetic principle in some neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2017 Monje, Cicvaric, Acevedo Aguilar, Elbau, Horvath, Diao, Glat and Pollak.","Behavior; Circadian activity; Clock gene; Hippocampus; Interleukin 6; Mouse","cryptochrome 1; interleukin 6; adult; animal tissue; Article; circadian rhythm; clock gene; controlled study; dbp gene; e4bp4 gene; gene; gene expression; hippocampus; id2 gene; light exposure; locomotion; male; mouse; neuroD1 gene; nonhuman; protein function",2-s2.0-85016154359

Interestingly, these processes are strongly affected by organizational principles of the cerebral cortex and related functional asymmetries, but the neurobiological foundations are elusive. We ask whether neurobiological mechanisms that affect functional cerebral asymmetries will also modulate effects of top-down control processes on functional cerebral asymmetries. To this end, we examined potential effects of the imprinted gene leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 1 (LRRTM1) on attentional biasing processes in a forced attention dichotic listening task in 983 healthy adult participants of Caucasian descent using the “iDichotic smartphone app.” The results show that functional cerebral asymmetries in the language domain are associated with the rs6733871 LRRTM1 polymorphism when cognitive control and top-down attentional mechanisms modulate processes in bottom-up attentional selection processes that are dependent on functional cerebral asymmetries. There is no evidence for an effect of LRRTM1 on functional cerebral asymmetries in the language domain unrelated to cognitive control processes. The results suggest that cognitive control processes are an important factor to consider when being interested in the molecular genetic basis of functional cerebral architecture. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Cerebral asymmetries; Cognitive control; Dichotic listening; Genetics; LRRTM1; Smartphone",,2-s2.0-85015631790

This is a key feature of hybrid categorization systems, which selectively weight the use of exemplar- and rule-based processes. In contrast, Hahn et al. (2010) have shown that people cannot help but pay attention to exemplar similarity, even when doing so leads to classification errors. This paper tests, through a series of computer simulations, whether a hybrid categorization model developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture (by Anderson and Betz, 2001) can account for the Hahn et al. dataset. This model implements Nosofsky and Palmeri's (1997) exemplar-based random walk model as its exemplar route, and combines it with an implementation of Nosofsky et al. (1994) rule-based model RULEX. A thorough search of the model's parameter space showed that while the presence of an exemplar-similarity effect on response times was associated with classification errors it was possible to fit both measures to the observed data for an unsupervised version of the task (i.e., in which no feedback on accuracy was given). Difficulties arose when the model was applied to a supervised version of the task in which explicit feedback on accuracy was given. Modeling results show that the exemplar-similarity effect is diminished by feedback as the model learns to avoid the error-prone exemplar-route, taking instead the accurate rule-route. In contrast to the model, Hahn et al. found that people continue to exhibit robust exemplar-similarity effects even when given feedback. This work highlights a challenge for understanding how and why people combine rules and exemplars when making categorization decisions. © 2017 Brumby and Hahn.","Categorization; Computational model; Hybrid models; Rules; Similarity",,2-s2.0-85016315280

Notably, promising computing approaches have proposed to leverage the complex dynamics emerging in networks of coupled oscillators based on nanotechnologies. The physical implementation of such architectures remains a true challenge, however, as most proposed ideas are not robust to nanotechnology devices' non-idealities. In this work, we propose and investigate the implementation of an oscillator-based architecture, which can be used to carry out pattern recognition tasks, and which is tailored to the specificities of nanotechnologies. This scheme relies on a weak coupling between oscillators, and does not require a fine tuning of the coupling values. After evaluating its reliability under the severe constraints associated to nanotechnologies, we explore the scalability of such an architecture, suggesting its potential to realize pattern recognition tasks using limited resources. We show that it is robust to issues like noise, variability and oscillator non-linearity.

Clinically, MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) resembles PD in the manifestation of prominent parkinsonism. Whether the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia could be a potential marker for differentiating MSA-P from PD has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to examine whether sleep parameters could provide a method for differentiating MSA-P from PD. Methods: This study comprised 24 MSA-P patients and 30 PD patients, and they were of similar age, gender, and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) prevalence. All patients underwent clinical evaluation and one night of video-polysomnography recording. The tonic and phasic chin electromyogram (EMG) activity was manually quantified during REM sleep of each patient. We divided both groups in terms of whether they had RBD to make subgroup analysis. Results: No significant difference between MSA-P group and PD group had been found in clinical characteristics and sleep architecture. However, MSA-P patients had higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; 1.15 [0.00, 8.73]/h vs. 0.00 [0.00, 0.55]/h, P = 0.024) and higher tonic chin EMG density (34.02 [18.48, 57.18]% vs. 8.40 [3.11, 13.06]%, P < 0.001) as compared to PD patients. Subgroup analysis found that tonic EMG density in MSA + RBD subgroup was higher than that in PD + RBD subgroup (55.04 [26.81, 69.62]% vs. 11.40 [8.51, 20.41]%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, no evidence of any difference in tonic EMG density emerged between PD + RBD and MSA - RBD subgroups (P > 0.05). Both disease duration (P = 0.056) and AHI (P = 0.051) showed no significant differences during subgroup analysis although there was a trend toward longer disease duration in PD + RBD subgroup and higher AHI in MSA - RBD subgroup. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis identified the presence of MSA-P (β = 0.552, P < 0.001) and RBD (β = 0.433, P < 0.001) as predictors of higher tonic EMG density. Conclusion: Tonic chin EMG density could be a potential marker for differentiating MSA-P from PD. © 2017 Chinese Medical Journal.","Multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism; Parkinson’s disease; Polysomnography; Tonic chin electromyogram density","levodopa; adult; aged; apnea hypopnea index; Article; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; disease course; electromyography; Epworth sleepiness scale; female; Hoehn and Yahr scale; human; male; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; oxygen saturation; parasomnia; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; polysomnography; REM sleep; retrospective study; Shy Drager syndrome; sleep parameters; sleep pattern; sleep quality; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; electromyography; middle aged; Multiple System Atrophy; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; pathophysiology; procedures; Aged; Body Mass Index; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple System Atrophy; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Polysomnography; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85014584924

The Interactive Social Engagement Architecture (ISEA) is designed to integrate behavior-based robotics, human behavior models, cognitive architectures, and expert user input to increase social engagement between a human and system (e.g., robot, avatar, etc.). ISEA provides for the autonomous generation of robot behaviors for self-preservation and to convey social intelligence. The framework is designed to be modular and adaptable to different applications and domains; however for this project, the focus is on social engagement for information gathering. The interactive user interface provides interviewers with the ability to use a robot as an intermediary for gathering this information. The interface and framework have been iteratively improved through observations from user studies conducted to date with 186 children ages 8-12. This project compares the effectiveness of robot versus human interviewers to gather sensitive information from children using situations in which this would commonly occur - cases of child eyewitness memory and child reports of bullying.

Among them is poor energy efficiency. This situation motivates the investigation of different processing information paradigms, such as the use of spiking neural networks (SNNs), which also introduce cognitive characteristics. As applications at very high scale are addressed, the energy dissipation needs to be minimized. This effort starts from the neuron cell. In this context, this paper presents the design of an original artificial neuron, in standard 65 nm CMOS technology with optimized energy efficiency. The neuron circuit response is designed as an approximation of the Morris-Lecar theoretical model. In order to implement the non-linear gating variables, which control the ionic channel currents, transistors operating in deep subthreshold are employed. Two different circuit variants describing the neuron model equations have been developed. The first one features spike characteristics, which correlate well with a biological neuron model. The second one is a simplification of the first, designed to exhibit higher spiking frequencies, targeting large scale bio-inspired information processing applications. The most important feature of the fabricated circuits is the energy efficiency of a few femtojoules per spike, which improves prior state-of-the-art by two to three orders of magnitude. This performance is achieved by minimizing two key parameters: the supply voltage and the related membrane capacitance. Meanwhile, the obtained standby power at a resting output does not exceed tens of picowatts. The two variants were sized to 200 and 35 μm2 with the latter reaching a spiking output frequency of 26 kHz. This performance level could address various contexts, such as highly integrated neuro-processors for robotics, neuroscience or medical . © 2017 Sourikopoulos, Hedayat, Loyez, Danneville, Hoel, Mercier and Cappy.","Analog VLSI; Artificial neuron; CMOS; Morris-Lecar neuron; Spiking neural network; Subthreshold","Article; artificial neural network; connectome; electric potential; information processing; mathematical computing; mathematical model; membrane potential; nerve cell network; practice guideline; spiking neural network; theoretical model",2-s2.0-85017092079

It has been suggested that a virtual partner able to play the game with human subjects can be an effective tool to affect the underlying neural processes needed to establish the necessary connections between the players, and also to provide new clinical interventions for rehabilitation of patients suffering from social disorders. Inspired by the motor processes of the central nervous system (CNS) and the musculoskeletal system in the human body, in this paper we develop a novel interactive cognitive architecture based on nonlinear control theory to drive a virtual player (VP) to play the mirror game with a human player (HP) in different configurations. Specifically, we consider two cases: 1) the VP acts as leader and 2) the VP acts as follower. The crucial problem is to design a feedback control architecture capable of imitating and following or leading an HP in a joint action task. The movement of the end-effector of the VP is modeled by means of a feedback controlled Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) oscillator, which is coupled with the observed motion of the HP measured in real time. To this aim, two types of control algorithms (adaptive control and optimal control) are used and implemented on the HKB model so that the VP can generate a human-like motion while satisfying certain kinematic constraints.

The battery of 10 tests was administered online to 1,367 twin pairs (age 19-21) from the UK-representative Twins Early Development Study (TEDS). We show that spatial abilities constitute a single factor, both phenotypically and genetically, even after controlling for g. This spatial ability factor is highly heritable (69%).

While in coexistence, network of multiple users, competing for the same idle spectrum, ends up causing intolerable interferences to the primary receiver. Since PU is of prior importance, any kind of interruption to its transmission is not desirable. Most of the works, tries to employ the same interference management technique in both primary and secondary network. An improved interference alignment technique is proposed which can be implemented in the secondary network itself to reduce the effect of interference created at primary receiver. This will eliminate the burden of having variable filter coefficients at the primary according to the changing number of users in the secondary network. Also, by making use of the orthogonality property of interference alignment filters of SUs, SINR at each secondary receiver is maximized. Since the idle spectrum of PU is a valuable commodity and many users are competing for the same time, there arises conflict among them in taking decisions. The spectrum allocation problem is formulated under Stackelberg game framework. The equilibrium point is found through proposed game theoretic search algorithm using backward induction process and optimal strategies are obtained. The system model is implemented through the proposed block architecture in Matlab. Simulations are carried out to study the proposed system and the performances are verified under various network conditions. An improvement in performance of utility is observed for the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio; Game Theory; Interference Alignment; Spectrum leasing; Stackelberg game","Cognitive radio; Computation theory; MATLAB; Dynamic spectrum leasings; Interference alignment; Interference management; Interference reduction; Orthogonality properties; Spectrum allocation; Spectrum leasings; Stackelberg Games; Game theory",2-s2.0-85017267039

The pivotal role of trust warrants careful analysis regarding its formation in these financial institutions. Using the case of Cameroon, the paper interrogates trust development between formal financial institutions and their clients, and between IFIs and their members. Trust formation occurs via certain cognitive trust-building processes: calculative, prediction, intentionality, capability, and transference processes. The paper argues that trust formation through these processes is predicated upon cultural values and beliefs. It is precisely because of cultural norms that traditional leaders play a role in ensuring that loans granted by formal financial institutions are repaid, thereby serving as principal actors in the functioning of financial capitalism in rural areas. The interplay between culture and financial institutions reconfigures the financial architecture in rural zones.

A growth mindset, i.e., the belief that success comes from effort and perseverance, is a better indicator of higher achievements as compared to a fixed mindset, i.e., the belief that things are set and cannot be changed. Interventions aimed at promoting a growth mindset in children range from teaching about the brain's ability to learn and change, to playing computer games that grant brain points for effort rather than success. This work explores a novel paradigm to foster a growth mindset in young children where they play a puzzle solving game with a peer-like social robot. The social robot is fully autonomous and programmed with behaviors suggestive of it having either a growth mindset or a neutral mindset as it plays puzzle games with the child. We measure the mindset of children before and after interacting with the peer-like robot, in addition to measuring their problem solving behavior when faced with a challenging puzzle. We found that children who played with a growth-mindset robot 1) self-reported having a stronger growth mindset and 2) tried harder during a challenging task, as compared to children who played with the neutral-mindset robot. These results suggest that interacting with peer-like social robot with a growth mindset can promote the same mindset in children. © 2017 ACM.","child-robot interaction; cognitive architecture; early childhood education; grit; mindset; perseverance; social robots","Computer games; Education; Man machine systems; Robots; Child-robot interactions; Cognitive architectures; Early childhood educations; grit; mindset; perseverance; Social robots; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85021811383

The framework is based on two main principles: on the one hand, we propose an architecture inspired by current knowledge in human memory organisation; on the other hand, we integrate such an architecture with the notion of context, which is used to modulate the knowledge acquisition process when consolidating memories and forming new ones, as well as with the notion of familiarity, which is employed to retrieve proper memories given relevant cues. Although much research has been carried out, which exploits Machine Learning approaches to provide robots with internal models of their environment (including objects and occurring events therein), we argue that such approaches may not be the right direction to follow if a long-term, continuous knowledge acquisition is to be achieved. As a case study scenario, we focus on both robot–environment and human–robot interaction processes. In case of robot–environment interaction, a robot performs pick and place movements using the objects in the workspace, at the same time observing their displacement on a table in front of it, and progressively forms memories defined as relevant cues (e.g. colour, shape or relative position) in a context-aware fashion. As far as human–robot interaction is concerned, the robot can recall specific snapshots representing past events using both sensory information and contextual cues upon request by humans. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","context-based memory retrieval; developmental learning; long-term knowledge acquisition; Robot cognitive architectures","Artificial intelligence; Information use; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Mergers and acquisitions; Robots; Cognitive architectures; Cognitive frameworks; Contextual information; Developmental learning; Machine learning approaches; Memory retrieval; Robot interactions; Sensory information; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-84958038865

It combines different sorts of common-sense categorization (prototypical and exemplars-based categorization) with standard monotonic categorization procedures. These different types of inferential procedures are reconciled according to the tenets coming from the dual process theory of reasoning. On the other hand, from a representational perspective, the system relies on the hypothesis of conceptual structures represented as heterogeneous proxytypes. Dual-PECCS has been experimentally assessed in a task of conceptual categorization where a target concept illustrated by a simple common-sense linguistic description had to be identified by resorting to a mix of categorization strategies, and its output has been compared to human responses. The obtained results suggest that our approach can be beneficial to improve the representational and reasoning conceptual capabilities of standard cognitive artificial systems, and–in addition–that it may be plausibly applied to different general computational models of cognition. The current version of the system, in fact, extends our previous work, in that Dual- PECCS is now integrated and tested into two cognitive architectures, ACT-R and CLARION, implementing different assumptions on the underlying invariant structures governing human cognition.

The method of metric judgments (e.g., on a centimetre scale) that has typically been used in such tasks may reflect a genuine perceptual effect or it may reflect a cognitively mediated impression. We employed a height-matching method in which perceived ceiling height had to be matched with an adjustable pillar, thus obtaining psychometric functions that allowed for an estimation of the point of subjective equality (PSE) and the difference limen (DL). The height-matching method developed in this paper allows for a direct visual match and does not require metric judgment. It has the added advantage of providing superior precision. Experiment 1 used ceiling heights between 2.90 m and 3.00 m. The PSE proved sensitive to slight changes in perceived ceiling height. The DL was about 3% of the physical ceiling height. Experiment 2 found similar results for lower (2.30 m to 2.50 m) and higher (3.30 m to 3.50 m) ceilings. In Experiment 3, we additionally varied ceiling lightness (light grey vs. dark grey). The height matches showed that the light ceiling appeared significantly higher than the darker ceiling. We therefore attribute the influence of ceiling lightness on perceived ceiling height to a direct perceptual rather than a cognitive effect. © 2016 The Experimental Psychology Society.","Architectural psychology; Architecture; Ceiling height; Distance; Interior design; Interior space; Perceived size; Psychophysics; Virtual reality; Visual perception","adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; decision making; depth perception; distance perception; female; human; male; middle aged; photostimulation; physiology; psychometry; psychophysics; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Distance Perception; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Psychometrics; Psychophysics; Space Perception; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84961203356

Although in a centralized cognitive radio network architecture most components and factors tend to contribute to its high energy consumption, but the radio base stations is seen to make up a very high percentage of the overall energy consumed in the network. In this regard, an effective measure needs to be employed to better the energy efficiency of the network. In this paper, a base station sleeping mechanism is proposed to put unnecessary and idle base stations to sleep during low traffic conditions and also to decide which base stations in the network goes into sleep mode. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is evaluated through simulation and the results reveal that the energy efficiency of the network can be significantly enhanced by adequately putting idle or unnecessary base stations in the network into sleep mode. © 2017 IEEE.","cognitive radio networks; energy consumption; energy efficiency; secondary users","Base stations; Cognitive radio; Energy utilization; Network architecture; Radio; Radio systems; Sleep research; Cognitive radio network; Effective measures; Environmental and economic impacts; High energy consumption; Radio base station; Secondary users; SLEEP mode; Traffic conditions; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-85016782973

The first cognitive solution designs a codebook free cognitive hybrid pre-coder by maximizing the mutual information between its two ends subject to interference, power and hardware constraints related to the analog counterpart. The second solution is codebook based and exhibits less complexity than the first one at the cost of inferior spectral efficiency.

In the proposed approach, the execution of structured tasks is guided by top-down (task-oriented) and bottom-up (stimuli-driven) attentional processes that affect behavior selection and activation, while resolving conflicts and decisional impasses. Specifically, attention is here deployed to stimulate the activations of multiple hierarchical behaviors orienting them toward the execution of finalized and interactive activities. On the other hand, this framework allows a human to indirectly and smoothly influence the robotic task execution exploiting attention manipulation. We provide an overview of the overall system architecture discussing the framework at work in different case studies.

We used experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster to test for the presence of genetic variation for slowed cognitive aging, and assess its independence from that responsible for other traits’ decline with age. Replicate experimental populations experienced either joint selection on learning and reproduction at old age (Old + Learning), selection on late-life reproduction alone (Old), or a standard two-week culture regime (Young). Within 20 generations, the Old + Learning populations evolved a slower decline in learning with age than both the Old and Young populations, revealing genetic variation for cognitive aging. We found little evidence for a genetic correlation between cognitive and demographic aging: although the Old + Learning populations tended to show higher late-life fecundity than Old populations, they did not live longer. Likewise, selection for late reproduction alone did not result in improved late-life learning. Our results demonstrate that Drosophila harbor genetic variation for cognitive aging that is largely independent from genetic variation for demographic aging and suggest that these two aspects of aging may not necessarily follow the same trajectories. © 2016 The Author(s).

This paper is an investigation of how one's creativity, spatial ability, and visual cognitive styles relate to design studio performance, measured by grade. Identifying students' cognitive abilities and their relation to design studio performance is important for the development of meaningful pedagogy and the holistic understanding of student capacities. Fifty-nine freshman architecture and interior design majors' creativity, spatial ability, and visual cognitive style were measured using the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, Mental Rotation Test, Paper Folding Test, the Architectural Spatial Ability Test, and the Object-Spatial Imagery Questionnaire, and compared with one another and with final grades in their design studio course. The effect of gender and academic major was investigated through a two-way ANOVA. The analysis revealed no correlations between studio course grade and the observed scores; but a positive correlation existed between general spatial abilities and visual cognitive styles. It also revealed males' outperformance in general spatial ability tasks and tendency of spatial visualizers. The results show that design studio performance cannot be measured and predicted directly by creativity, spatial ability, and visual cognitive style.

Compare *a person whoi everyone who talks to ti likes Chris, which shows an illicit extraction from a relative clause, and a person whoi everyone who talks to pgi likes ti, which shows a parasitic gap in the relative clause. Languages differ in terms of the range of configurations in which they allow parasitic gaps; these configurations appear to form a hierarchy. These observations raise some fundamental questions: Why do parasitic gaps exist at all? Why are different syntactic configurations possible for P-gaps and why just these configurations? Why is there a parasitic gap hierarchy?.

However, no research has been carried out on how ‘reflective talk’ is structured in the classroom. This paper describes how tutors and residents organise group reflection sessions in situ by describing an example of group reflection in medical education. Our aim is to provide an evidence base that can be used by medical educators to think about the way reflection should be included in their curriculum. Methods: We video-recorded 47 group reflection sessions of the general practice postgraduate training course at Erasmus University Medical School, Rotterdam. We used conversation analysis to unravel their overall structural organisation: the way participants organise and structure a conversation. Through micro-analysis of the moment-to-moment unfolding of group reflection, we distinguished the main building blocks that form the architecture of these sessions. Results: We found that participants consistently oriented towards the following activity types: significant event, reason for sharing, learning issue and learning uptake. There was variation in the order of the activity types, the amount of time spent on each of them, and how they were accomplished. By studying reflection in its messy social context, we found order, commonalities and patterns that were typical of the architecture of group reflection in this setting, even if no formal structure is prescribed. Conclusions: In ‘Exchange of Experience’, the overall structural organisation consisted of activity types through which a case becomes shared, reflectable, learnable and valuable. There are essential discrepancies between cognitive reflection models and the reality of the classroom. Being conscious of this overall structural organisation can be a tool for tutors of these groups to help them navigate from one activity to another or to diagnose what is not working in the group discussion. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education",,"controlled study; conversation; curriculum; diagnosis; general practice; human; human experiment; learning; medical school; microanalysis; model; postgraduate education; resident; social environment; structure activity relation; videorecording; interpersonal communication; medical education; Netherlands; thinking; Communication; Education, Medical, Graduate; Humans; Learning; Netherlands; Social Environment; Thinking",2-s2.0-85013026957

This conceptual change in network structure aims to meet the rapid increase in mobile data traffic and connected devices. However, limited free spectrum and dynamic assignment of resources are main concerns when considering the cognitive small cells solution. Therefore, there is a need to map traffic patterns with the number of cognitive small cells to provide an optimized network architecture operating with adequate spectrum resources. This article investigates the case when network densification exceeds the radio resource capacity, causing a large scale overlapping in cell coverage area and used channels. Taking into consideration cognitive network performance characteristics, we identify two spectrum coexistence frameworks, Space Filling and Time Filling, to improve spectrum utilization and scalability for moderately large networks. Simulations show that there is a turning point when network performance starts to decline as the number of cognitive small cells exceeds the shared resources in a site area, subject to a certain load profile.

Using this architecture we are able to outperform our prior results in accuracy vs signal to noise ratio against an identical system without attention, however we believe such an attention model has implication far beyond the task of modulation recognition. © 2016 IEEE.","Attention Models; Cognitive Radio; Con-volutional Autoencoders; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Radio communications; Radio Transformer Networks; RadioML; Signal Processing; Software Radio; Spatial Transformer Networks; Synchronization","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Electric transformers; Learning systems; Modulation; Neural networks; Radio communication; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Software radio; Structural optimization; Synchronization; Attention model; Autoencoders; Classification accuracy; Identical systems; Modulation recognition; RadioML; Sparse representation; Wireless systems; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85016274803

I argue that such theories are crucial in any mental domain, not just for their own sake, but to guide experimental inquiry, as well as to integrate the domain into the mind as a whole. To illustrate the criteria of adequacy for theories of mental representation, I compare two theoretical approaches to language: classical generative grammar (Chomsky, 1965, 1981, 1995) and the parallel architecture (Jackendoff, 1997, 2002). The grounds for comparison include (a) the internal coherence of the theory across phonology, syntax, and semantics; (b) the relation of language to other mental faculties; (c) the relationship between grammar and lexicon; (d) relevance to theories of language processing; and (e) the possibility of languages with little or no syntax.

We compare highly conventionalized systematic metonymy (producer-for-product: “All freshmen read O'Connell”) to lesser-conventionalized circumstantial metonymy (“[a waitress says to another:] ‘Table 2 asked for more coffee.”’). Whereas these two metonymy types differ in terms of contextual demands, they each reveal a similar dependency between the named and intended conceptual entities (e.g., Jackendoff, 1997; Nunberg, 1979, 1995). We reason that if each metonymy yields a distinct processing time course and substantially non-overlapping preferential localization pattern, it would not only support a two-mechanism view (one lexical, one pragmatic) but would suggest that conventionalization acts as a linguistic categorizer. By contrast, a similar behavior in time course and localization would support a one-mechanism view and the inference that conventionalization acts instead as a modulator of contextual felicitousness, and that differences in interpretation introduced by conventionalization are of degree, not of kind. Results from three paradigms: self-paced reading (SPR), event-related potentials (ERP), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), reveal the following: no main effect by condition (metonymy vs. matched literal control) for either metonymy type immediately after the metonymy trigger, and a main effect for only the Circumstantial metonymy one word post-trigger (SPR); a N400 effect across metonymy types and a late positivity for Circumstantial metonymy (ERP); and a highly overlapping activation connecting the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (fMRI). Altogether, the pattern observed does not reach the threshold required to justify a two-mechanism system. Instead, the pattern is more naturally (and conservatively) understood as resulting from the implementation of a generalized referential dependency mechanism, modulated by degree of context dependence/conventionalization, thus supporting architectures of language whereby “lexical” and “pragmatic” meaning relations are encoded along a cline of contextual underspecification.

Although many previous studies have proposed different parcellation schemes for the LIPL, the detailed functional organization of the LIPL and the exact correspondence between the DMN and LIPL subregions remain unclear. Mounting evidence indicates that spontaneous fluctuations in the brain are strongly associated with cognitive performance at the behavioral level. However, whether a consistent functional topographic organization of the LIPL during rest and under task can be revealed remains unknown. Here, they used resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and task-related coactivation patterns separately to parcellate the LIPL and identified seven subregions. Four subregions were located in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and three subregions were located in the angular gyrus (AG). The subregion-specific networks and functional characterization revealed that the four anterior subregions were found to be primarily involved in sensorimotor processing, movement imagination and inhibitory control, audition perception and speech processing, and social cognition, whereas the three posterior subregions were mainly involved in episodic memory, semantic processing, and spatial cognition. The results revealed a detailed functional organization of the LIPL and suggested that the LIPL is a functionally heterogeneous area. In addition, the present study demonstrated that the functional architecture of the LIPL during rest corresponds with that found in task processing.

This relocates the referent of ontological security from the self to the social arrangements where action takes place. It implies that actors seek not to secure the coherence and stability of self in particular, but rather of their broader social context. By taking this relational approach, international relations scholars may avoid methodological difficulties in accessing or defining the cognitive or affective processes shaping certain actors, while honing in on the social embeddedness of action. I outline three causal mechanisms for theorizing ontological security in particular cases: refereeing, performative deference, and obstructive resistance. I do so with reference to prominent methodological frameworks in relational sociology- namely, those based on fields and on figurations, respectively. Finally, I connect this new approach to theorizing ontological security to existing trends in relational international relations research. I argue that it provides a theoretical architecture more sensitive to action and agency than is offered by many existing relational approaches, and is especially well suited to the study of precarious forms of transnational life. © The Author (2017).

In this modern era, with increasing life expectancy, women are spending one-third of their life with menopause related disorders. It has been shown that, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) could be protective against the menopause induced cognitive decline. However, ERT is also known to increase the incidence of uterine and breast cancer and other side effects. Thus, ERT has limited clinical use. Alternatively, fenugreek seeds (which are rich in phytoestrogens) may be the alternative strategy to treat the above mentioned menopause induced deficits. This study was designed to evaluate the role of fenugreek seed extract on menopause induced impaired memory and hippocampal damage using ovariectomized rat model. Female Wistar rats were divided into groups (n =6)—(1) control, (2) ovariectomized and (3) ovariectomized rats treated with hydro-alcoholic extract of fenugreek seeds for 21 days. After treatment period, the memory and learning was analyzed by passive avoidance test and alteration in the histology of the hippocampal neurons were analyzed by cresyl violet staining technique. Ovariectomized rats showed decreased ability in memory and learning and showed neuronal shrinkage and death in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 region. Treating these ovariectomized rats with fenugreek seed extract significantly improved the memory and learning and also protected the hippocampal neuronal architecture and survival. Therefore, the result of the present study may be attributed to the phytoestrogens in the fenugreek seeds and it may be a therapeutic agent for treating the menopause induced neurocognitive deficit. However, further study is warranted to understand the exact cellular and molecular mechanism involved in fenugreek mediated health benefits. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

Specifically, increased spatial area use is correlated with increased hippocampal attributes, such as volume and neurogenesis. In the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana), males demonstrate alternative reproductive tactics and are either territorial-defending large, clearly defined spatial boundaries-or non-territorial-traversing home ranges that are smaller than the territorial males' territories. Our previous work demonstrated cortical volume (reptilian hippocampal homolog) correlates with these spatial niches. We found that territorial holders have larger medial cortices than non-territory holders, yet these differences in the neural architecture demonstrated some degree of plasticity as well. Although we have demonstrated a link among territoriality, spatial use, and brain plasticity, the mechanisms that underlie this relationship are unclear. Previous studies found that higher testosterone levels can induce increased use of the spatial area and can cause an upregulation in hippocampal attributes. Thus, testosterone may be the mechanistic link between spatial area use and the brain. What remains unclear, however, is if testosterone can affect the cortices independent of spatial experiences and whether testosterone differentially interacts with territorial status to produce the resultant cortical phenotype. In this study, we compared neurogenesis as measured by the total number of doublecortin-positive cells and cortical volume between territorial and non-territorial males supplemented with testosterone. We found no significant differences in the number of doublecortin-positive cells or cortical volume among control territorial, control non-territorial, and testosterone-supplemented non-territorial males, while testosterone-supplemented territorial males had smaller medial cortices containing fewer doublecortin-positive cells. These results demonstrate that testosterone can modulate medial cortical attributes outside of differential spatial processing experiences but that territorial males appear to be more sensitive to alterations in testosterone levels compared with non-territorial males. © 2017 LaDage, Roth II, Downs, Sinervo and Pravosudov.","Dorsal cortex; Lizards; Medial cortex; Neurogenesis; Testosterone; Uta stansburiana","doublecortin; testosterone; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; body weight; brain cortex; brain size; controlled study; correlational study; down regulation; female; left hemisphere; lizard; male; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; nonhuman; right hemisphere; telencephalon; territoriality; testosterone blood level; Uta stansburiana",2-s2.0-85017118308

The underlying nervous system structures, however, are largely unknown. Here, we explore and describe the anatomy of the brain in the jumping spider Marpissa muscosa (Clerck, 1757) by means of paraffin histology, X-ray microCT analysis and immunohistochemistry as well as three-dimensional reconstruction. In the prosoma, the CNS is a clearly demarcated mass that surrounds the esophagus. The anteriormost neuromere, the protocerebrum, comprises nine bilaterally paired neuropils, including the mushroom bodies and one unpaired midline neuropil, the arcuate body. Further ventrally, the synganglion comprises the cheliceral (deutocerebrum) and pedipalpal neuropils (tritocerebrum). Synapsin-immunoreactivity in all neuropils is generally strong, while allatostatin-immunoreactivity is mostly present in association with the arcuate body and the stomodeal bridge. The most prominent neuropils in the spider brain, the mushroom bodies and the arcuate body, were suggested to be higher integrating centers of the arthropod brain. The mushroom body in M. muscosa is connected to first and second order visual neuropils of the lateral eyes, and the arcuate body to the second order neuropils of the anterior median eyes (primary eyes) through a visual tract. The connection of both, visual neuropils and eyes and arcuate body, as well as their large size corroborates the hypothesis that these neuropils play an important role in cognition and locomotion control of jumping spiders. In addition, we show that the architecture of the brain of M. muscosa and some previously investigated salticids differs significantly from that of the wandering spider Cupiennius salei, especially with regard to structure and arrangement of visual neuropils and mushroom body. Thus, we need to explore the anatomical conformities and specificities of the brains of different spider taxa in order to understand evolutionary transformations of the arthropod brain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Araneae; Brain; Central nervous system; Neuroanatomy; Visual neuropils","allatostatin; paraffin; synapsin; adult; animal structures; animal tissue; arcuate nucleus; Article; brain; central nervous system; deutocerebrum; esophagus; female; histology; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; Marpissa muscosa; micro-computed tomography; mushroom body; neuroanatomy; neuromere; neuropil; nonhuman; optic tract; prosoma; protocerebrum; spider; stomodeal bridge; synganglion; three dimensional imaging; tritocerebrum; anatomy and histology; animal; brain; confocal microscopy; cytology; ganglion; spider; Animals; Brain; Female; Ganglia; Histology; Immunohistochemistry; Microscopy, Confocal; Neuropil; Spiders; X-Ray Microtomography",2-s2.0-85008192210

This increases the amount of work required to develop robot software. In this paper we propose Complex Events Processing (CEP) with Procedural Parameters as an alternative solution. CEP allows a developer to use various operators besides subscribe to define the communication between components. These operators for example allow mapping, filtering and sampling of messages. To be able to provide a generic set of operators which can be used in any robot application, we allow developers to define procedures as parameters to the operators. The procedures act as a strategy for the computation to be performed, the operator defining what should be done and the procedural parameter defining how to do it.

Here, we evaluate the theory that pride evolved to guide decisions relevant to pursuing actions that enhance valuation and respect for a person in the minds of others. By hypothesis, pride is a neurocomputational program tailored by selection to orchestrate cognition and behavior in the service of: (i) motivating the costeffective pursuit of courses of action that would increase others' valuations and respect of the individual, (ii) motivating the advertisement of acts or characteristics whose recognition by others would lead them to enhance their evaluations of the individual, and (iii) mobilizing the individual to take advantage of the resulting enhanced social landscape. To modulate how much to invest in actions that might lead to enhanced evaluations by others, the pride system must forecast the magnitude of the evaluations the action would evoke in the audience and calibrate its activation proportionally. We tested this prediction in 16 countries across 4 continents (n = 2,085), for 25 acts and traits. As predicted, the pride intensity for a given act or trait closely tracks the valuations of audiences, local (mean r = +0.82) and foreign (mean r = +0.75).

These radiation-induced cognitive impairments are accompanied by functional and structural changes including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and degradation of neuronal architecture. The molecular mechanisms that dictate CNS function are multifaceted and it is unclear how irradiation induces persistent alterations in the brain. Among those determinants of cognitive function are neuroepigenetic mechanisms that translate radiation responses into altered gene expression and cellular phenotype. In this study, we have demonstrated a correlation between epigenetic aberrations and adverse effects of space relevant irradiation on cognition. In cognitively impaired irradiated mice we observed increased 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels in the hippocampus that coincided with increased levels of the DNA methylating enzymes DNMT3a, TET1 and TET3. By inhibiting methylation using 5-iodotubercidin, we demonstrated amelioration of the epigenetic effects of irradiation. In addition to protecting against those molecular effects of irradiation, 5-iodotubercidin restored behavioral performance to that of unirradiated animals. The findings of this study establish the possibility that neuroepigenetic mechanisms significantly contribute to the functional and structural changes that affect the irradiated brain and cognition. © The Author(s) 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85013460546

Previously, we demonstrated hepatoprotective effects of genistein in d-galactosamine (d-GalN)-induced fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). In this study, we evaluated behavioural and neuroprotective effects of genistein in rat model of HE. HE was induced by intraperitonial administration of d-GalN (250 mg/kg BW) twice a week for 30 days Genistein was given as co-treatment through oral gavage daily at dose of 5 mg/kg BW. d-GalN administration significantly resulted in acute liver failure which was further associated with hyperammonemia, neurological dysfunction, as evident from behavioural and functional impairment and reduced learning ability in Morris water maze. Genistein significantly alleviated behavioural and functional impairment and restored learning ability in Morris water maze. Considerable histopathological changes, including portal inflammation, sinusoidal dilation, necrotic lesions and swelled astrocytes with pale nuclei, were seen in the liver and brain sections of d-GalN-challenged rats while genistein co-treated rats revealed normal cellular and morphological architecture as no pathological features were seen. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, IL-1β and TNF-α) and membrane expression of subunits α1 of GABAA receptor and GluR2 of AMPA marked significant increase, while subunits GluR1 of AMPA receptors showed reduced expression in d-GalN-challenged rats leading to neuroinflammation and dysregulated neurotransmission. Genistein significantly normalized altered expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and membrane receptor of GABA and GluR.

Big data uses statistical methods to discover latent structures that emerge from the co-occurrences of relevant features when sampling over enormous quantities of data. The cognitive informatics methods design computer vision systems to mimic human cognition. Though some visual latent features that emerge from deep learning networks, mimic mammalian visual detectors, as of yet the information processing mechanisms (analogous to human psychophysical mechanisms) remain hidden within the complexity of the deep nets. Furthermore, the sampling requirements of big data systems require limiting samples to pre-processed sets, such as SHIFT (shift invariant feature transform (Lowe 1999)). Techniques, such as the ones introduced in this paper, provide fast cognitively relevant methods for selecting samples and reducing the number of candidate features. The approach described in this paper live squarely in the camp of designing computer vision A.I. to mimics human cognitive processes. I introduce a novel definition of edges, based on human hierarchical scene perception. Hierarchical scene perception views vision within the 5 dimensions of horizontal & vertical position, depth, time and scene abstraction level (spatial-taxon). Fuzzy inference selects candidate edge elements using the Gestalt psychology principal of good curvilinear continuation, proximity and edges attachment. Spatial-taxon inference infers an edge outline for each level of abstraction within the scene architecture. The system was tested on 60 natural images and the results provide edges more aligned with human intuition of what edges should look like. ROC plots indicate solid performance, with the majority of human subjects rating the edge detection as high quality. The inferred edges are consistent with the finding of neurons responsive to proto-object boundaries in the visual cortex. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive informatics; Cognitive systems; Edge detection; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy perceptual inference; Graph partitioning; Image processing; Image segmentation; Image segmentation; Scene perception; Spatial-taxon","Abstracting; Big data; Cognitive systems; Computer vision; Edge detection; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Image processing; Learning systems; Mammals; Sampling; Cognitive informatics; Computer vision system; Fuzzy perceptual inference; Gestalt psychologies; Graph Partitioning; Human visual perception; Level of abstraction; Spatial-taxon; Image segmentation",2-s2.0-85016169346

In this study, we propose a new architecture, called Sparse Temporal Mesh Model (STMM), which reduces the dimension of the feature space by combining the voxel selection methods with the mesh learning method. We, first, select the 'most discriminative' voxels using the state-of-the-art feature selection methods, namely, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), one way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Mutual Information (MI). After we select the most informative voxels, we form a star mesh around each selected voxel with their functional neighbors. Then, we estimate the mesh arc weights, which represent the relationship among the voxels within a neighborhood. We further prune the estimated arc weights using ANOVA to get rid of redundant relationships among the voxels. By doing so, we obtain a sparse representation of information in the brain to discriminate cognitive states. Finally, we train k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers by the feature vectors of sparse mesh arc weights. We test STMM architecture on a visual object recognition experiment. Our results show that forming meshes around the selected voxels leads to a substantial increase in the classification accuracy, compared to forming meshes around all the voxels in the brain. Furthermore, pruning the mesh arc weights by ANOVA solves the dimensionality curse problem and leads to a slight increase in the classification performance. We also discover that, the resulting network of sparse temporal meshes are quite similar in all three voxel selection methods, namely, RFE, ANOVA or MI. © 2016 IEEE.","Brain decoding; Classification; FMRI; Object recognition; Voxel selection","Classification (of information); Decoding; Feature extraction; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mesh generation; Nearest neighbor search; Network architecture; Object recognition; Support vector machines; Brain decoding; Classification performance; Feature selection methods; FMRI; Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI); Recursive feature elimination; Visual object recognition; Voxel selections; Analysis of variance (ANOVA)",2-s2.0-85016197246

Examining targeted prefrontal regions, we found that pairs of voxels with similar context preferences exhibited spontaneous correlations that were approximately twice as large as those between pairs with opposite context preferences.

They provide quantitative instantiations of theories that seek to explain the functioning of the human mind. In this paper, we focus on identifying deep theoretical similarities between two very different models. Both models are concerned with how fatigue from sleep loss impacts cognitive processing. The first is based on the diffusion model and posits that fatigue decreases the drift rate of the diffusion process. The second is based on the Adaptive Control of Thought – Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture and posits that fatigue decreases the utility of candidate actions leading to microlapses in cognitive processing. A biomathematical model of fatigue is used to control drift rate in the first account and utility in the second. We investigated the predicted response time distributions of these two integrated computational cognitive models for performance on a psychomotor vigilance test under conditions of total sleep deprivation, simulated shift work, and sustained sleep restriction. The models generated equivalent predictions of response time distributions with excellent goodness-of-fit to the human data. More importantly, although the accounts involve different modeling approaches and levels of abstraction, they represent the effects of fatigue in a functionally equivalent way: in both, fatigue decreases the signal-to-noise ratio in decision processes and decreases response inhibition. This convergence suggests that sleep loss impairs psychomotor vigilance performance through degradation of the quality of cognitive processing, which provides a foundation for systematic investigation of the effects of sleep loss on other aspects of cognition. Our findings illustrate the value of treating different modeling formalisms as vehicles for discovery. © 2017 Psychonomic Society, Inc.","ACT-R; Biomathematical fatigue models; Cognitive architecture; Diffusion model; Leaky accumulator; Local sleep; Psychomotor vigilance test (PVT)",,2-s2.0-85013137976

In particular, reduced RSFC coupling between occipital (visual) and temporal (auditory) regions has been reliably observed in early blind individuals (EB) at rest. In contrast, task-dependent activation studies have repeatedly demonstrated enhanced co-activation and connectivity of occipital and temporal regions during auditory processing in EB. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, the functional coupling between temporal and occipital networks at rest was directly compared to that of an auditory task in both EB and sighted controls (SC). Functional brain clusters shared across groups and cognitive states (rest and auditory task) were defined. In EBs, we observed higher occipito-temporal correlations in activity during the task than at rest. The reverse pattern was observed in SC. We also observed higher temporal variability of occipito-temporal RSFC in EB suggesting that occipital regions in this population may play the role of a multiple demand system.

Next, artificial intelligence techniques such as neural network and support vector machine are exploited to learn and predict the channel dynamics from past channel sensing data. Such characterization enables optimizing waveforms through combinations of coding, encryption, and modulation before the short communication window becomes available, thereby saving valuable resources (e.g. time).

Meanwhile, to harness the power of LBSN, this chapter presents solutions to identify functional regions of modern cities and discovery urban patterns, which enable us to better understand complex cities and activity behaviors. © 2017 All rights reserved.","Activity patterns; Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Functional regions; Location-based social networks; Smart cities","Big data; Deep learning; Information management; Network architecture; Pattern recognition; Quality of service; Sensor networks; Activity patterns; Anomaly detection; Big data applications; Cognitive architectures; Functional regions; Institutional aspects; Location-based social networks; Resource management; Smart city",2-s2.0-85020786959

Motor babbling and goal babbling are two common approaches to generate training samples used to acquire a sensory-motor mapping. Motor babbling typically needs a considerable amount of training data and time to acquire a sufficient mapping, while goal babbling poses difficulties on how to select appropriate goals. In this paper, we propose a neurobiologically-inspired system to progressively learn a sensory-motor mapping bootstrapped from a simple constrained DOF exploration, which generates much less training data than motor babbling. Our proposed system is designed according to two neurobiologically-inspired paradigms: Spatiotemporal prediction and uniformity. The spatiotemporal prediction capability facilitates the acquisition of sensory-motor mappings with less amount of training data on the one hand, and facilitates robust behaviour on the other hand. The uniform system design structure is the foundation for building a scalable architecture for cognitive development. We use an improved version of our predictive action selector (PAS) as building block of our system. We validate a PAS on a 2 DOF robot head where the robot learns object tracking and evading. Then we validate a second PAS on a 5 DOF arm where it learns reaching. © 2016 IEEE.","behaviour bootstrapping; development of motor and cognitive skills; neurorobotics","Image recognition; Inverse kinematics; Mapping; Object recognition; Robotics; behaviour bootstrapping; Cognitive skill; Developmental robotics; Forward and inverse kinematics; Neurobiologically-inspired; Neurorobotics; Scalable architectures; Spatio-temporal prediction; Personnel training",2-s2.0-85015331576

Biological agents start with a flexible cognitive architecture but limited abilities, and acquire competences by different combinations of maturation, growth and experience (both social and individual), and some designers of artificial systems try to emulate such processes. By examining the processes leading to the construction of competence in biological agents we hope to inspire and support ideas relevant to the design of intelligent agents in the future. Here we report a study of the emergence of physical problem-solving in human infants aged 15 to 24 months and in both tool-using and non-tool-using corvids. One goal is to examine whether tool-using competence was indicative of general physical intelligence, in which case tool using agents should show greater competence both in tool-related and non-tool related tasks. Another is to test whether in these disparate organisms, experience with combining objects in contexts other than functional tool use (e.g. play) can causally facilitate the emergence of tool use competence. We used a battery of tasks including tool vs. non-tool dependent extractions of target objects. All subjects were initially exposed to a mixture of objects and allowed to interact freely with them. Preliminary results show that while there are strong inter-species differences in tool-related competence, we found no major differences in tasks where tools were not involved. There were strong individual differences within each species, but age effects were only found in human infants, reflecting differences in life-history: Although crows can live for several decades, they reach adulthood (including asymptotic competence in many indices) much faster than humans. From a robotics perspective, the differences reveal available choices regarding the tradeoff of learning vs. performing, or exploration vs. exploitation of skills. The relation between object combinations and individual performance at the tool tasks is still under analysis. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive; Communication Skills in Biological Systems and Robots; Development of Perceptual; Emotional; Exploration and Play; Interaction of Development and Evolution; Intrinsic Motivations; Motor; Social","Biology; Cognitive systems; Intelligent agents; Motors; Robotics; Cognitive; Communication skills; Development of Perceptual; Emotional; Interaction of Development and Evolution; Intrinsic motivation; Social; Problem solving",2-s2.0-85015326627

ACT-R can be used in combination with fMRI data in two different ways: (1) fMRI data can be used to evaluate and constrain models in ACT-R by means of predefined Region-of-Interest (ROI) analysis, and (2) predictions from ACT-R models can be used to locate neural correlates of model processes and representations by means of model-based fMRI analysis. In this paper we provide a step-by-step tutorial on both approaches. Note that this tutorial neither teaches the ACT-R theory in any detail, nor fMRI analysis, but explains how ACT-R can be used in combination with fMRI data. To this end, we provide all data and computer code necessary to run the ACT-R model, carry out the analyses, and recreate the figures in the paper. As an example dataset we use a relatively simple algebra task. In the first section, we develop an ACT-R model of this task and fit it to behavioral data. In the second section, we apply a predefined ROI-analysis to evaluate the model using fMRI data. In the third section, we use model-based fMRI analysis to locate the following processes in the brain: retrieval of mathematical facts from memory, working memory updates, motor responses, and visually encoding the problems. After working through this tutorial, the reader will have learned what can be achieved with the two different analysis methods and how they are conducted; the example code can then be adapted to a new dataset. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","ACT-R; Cognitive architecture; fMRI; Model-based analysis; Tutorial",,2-s2.0-85006508018

A large number of users and their dynamic connections make DNAs highly adaptive to variations in the network and suitable for low-cost ubiquitous Internet connectivity. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative cognitive DNA (CDNA) that incorporates cognitive capabilities to exploit underutilized spectrum in a more flexible and intelligent way.

A case study with a new resource allocation problem enabled by CDNA is conducted using matching theory with pricing to illustrate the potential benefits of CDNA for users and operators, tackle user associations for data and spectrum trading with low complexity, and enable self-organizing capabilities.

We recorded EEG data while participants performed a task that involved deciding whether a probe word triple matched any previously studied triple. We varied the similarity between probes and studied triples. According to a model of associative recognition developed in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational cognitive architecture, probe similarity affects the duration of the retrieval stage: Retrieval is fastest when the probe is similar to a studied triple. This effect may be obscured, however, by the duration of the comparison stage, which is fastest when the probe is not similar to the retrieved triple. Owing to the opposing effects of probe similarity on retrieval and comparison, overall RTs provide little information about each stage’s duration. As such, we evaluated the model using a novel approach that decomposes the EEG signal into a sequence of latent states and provides information about the durations of the underlying information processing stages. The approach uses a hidden semi-Markov model to identify brief sinusoidal peaks (called bumps) that mark the onsets of distinct cognitive stages. The analysis confirmed that probe type has opposite effects on retrieval and comparison stages. © 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"Associative processing; Information science; Markov processes; Signal processing; Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational; Cognitive architectures; Eeg datum; EEG signals; Hidden semi-Markov modeling; Latent state; Probes; adult; Article; associative memory; attention; controlled study; electroencephalogram; female; human; information processing; information retrieval; latent period; male; neuroimaging; priority journal; stimulus",2-s2.0-85007525377

Models that do span multiple developmental stages typically have parameters to “switch” between stages. We argue that by taking an embodied view, the interaction between learning mechanisms, the resulting behavior of the agent, and the opportunities for learning that the environment provides can account for the stage-wise development of cognitive abilities. We summarize work relevant to this hypothesis and suggest two simple mechanisms that account for some developmental transitions: neural readiness focuses on changes in the neural substrate resulting from ongoing learning, and perceptual readiness focuses on the perceptual requirements for learning new tasks. Previous work has demonstrated these mechanisms in replications of a wide variety of infant language experiments, spanning multiple developmental stages. Here we piece this work together as a single model of ongoing learning with no parameter changes at all.

However, efficient resource management mechanisms should be proposed to provide a complete system analysis for this promising architecture. Towards this direction, this article focuses on the problem of power management in cognitive satellite terrestrial systems, where the satellite system has the role of the cognitive system, while the terrestrial represents the primary one. Particularly, a power control scheme for the satellite terminal is proposed. Taking into account the peculiarities of both systems and considering the uplink case, the goal of the proposed scheme is to optimise the performance of the satellite link without deteriorating the communication quality of the terrestrial link. To safeguard the communication of the terrestrial system, we introduce a novel interference-based constraint, which ensures a specific level for the inverse signal-to-interference plus noise ratio of the terrestrial link. Both the cases of perfect and imperfect channel estimation of terrestrial link are considered in order to study a more realistic scenario. Furthermore, for the imperfect case, a protection mechanism is proposed to guarantee the communication quality of the primary link that offsets the uncertainty of channel estimation. Simulation results evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme for various system parameters and verify its superiority compared with the well-known water-filling based power control scheme for both cases of perfect and imperfect channel estimation.

HCDTs are characterized by a hierarchical architecture composed of a detection layer and a validation layer. The detection layer steadily analyzes the input datastream by means of an online, sequential CDT, which operates as a low-complexity trigger that promptly detects possible changes in the process generating the data. The validation layer is activated when the detection one reveals a change, and performs an offline, more sophisticated analysis on recently acquired data to reduce false alarms. Our experiments show that, when the process generating the datastream is unknown, as it is mostly the case in the real world, HCDTs achieve a far more advantageous tradeoff between false-positive rate and detection delay than their single-layered, more traditional counterpart. Moreover, the successful interplay between the two layers permits HCDTs to automatically reconfigure after having detected and validated a change.

Here, we attempt to bridge this divide by formalizing an integrative cognitive neuroscience approach using dynamic field theory (DFT). We begin by providing an overview of how DFT seeks to understand the neural population dynamics that underlie cognitive processes through previous applications and comparisons to other modeling approaches. We then use previously published behavioral and neural data from a response selection Go/Nogo task as a case study for model simulations. Results from this study served as the ‘standard’ for comparisons with a model-based fMRI approach using dynamic neural fields (DNF). The tutorial explains the rationale and hypotheses involved in the process of creating the DNF architecture and fitting model parameters. Two DNF models, with similar structure and parameter sets, are then compared. Both models effectively simulated reaction times from the task as we varied the number of stimulus–response mappings and the proportion of Go trials. Next, we directly simulated hemodynamic predictions from the neural activation patterns from each model. These predictions were tested using general linear models (GLMs). Results showed that the DNF model that was created by tuning parameters to capture simultaneously trends in neural activation and behavioral data quantitatively outperformed a Standard GLM analysis of the same dataset. Further, by using the GLM results to assign functional roles to particular clusters in the brain, we illustrate how DNF models shed new light on the neural populations’ dynamics within particular brain regions. Thus, the present study illustrates how an interactive cognitive neuroscience model can be used in practice to bridge the gap between brain and behavior. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Dynamic field theory modeling; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Integrative cognitive neuroscience; Response selection",,2-s2.0-85008156900

But, to date, few studies adopted the network model to reveal topological changes in brain structural networks in PD patients. Additionally, although the concept of rich club organization has been widely used to study brain networks in various brain disorders, there is no study to report the changed rich club organization of brain networks in PD patients. Thus, we collected diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 35 PD patients and 26 healthy controls and adopted deterministic tractography to construct brain structural networks. During the network analysis, we calculated their topological properties, and built the rich club organization of brain structural networks for both subject groups. By comparing the between-group differences in topological properties and rich club organizations, we found that the connectivity strength of the feeder and local connections are lower in PD patients compared to those of the healthy controls. Furthermore, using a network-based statistic (NBS) approach, we identified uniformly significantly decreased connections in two modules, the limbic/paralimbic/subcortical module and the cognitive control/attention module, in patients compared to controls. In addition, for the topological properties of brain network topology in the PD patients, we found statistically increased shortest path length and decreased global efficiency. Statistical comparisons of nodal properties were also widespread in the frontal and parietal regions for the PD patients.

The high affinity and selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist idalopirdine (Lu AE58054) is currently in development for mild-moderate AD as adjunct therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). We studied the effects of idalopirdine alone and in combination with the AChEI donepezil on cortical function using two in vivo electrophysiological methods. Neuronal network oscillations in the frontal cortex were measured during electrical stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis (nPO) in the anesthetized rat and by an electroencephalogram (EEG) in the awake, freely moving rat. In conjunction with the EEG study, we investigated the effects of idalopirdine and donepezil on sleep-wake architecture using telemetric polysomnography. Idalopirdine (2 mg/kg i.v.) increased gamma power in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during nPO stimulation. Donepezil (0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.v.) also increased cortical gamma power and pretreatment with idalopirdine (2 mg/kg i.v.) potentiated and prolonged the effects of donepezil. Similarly, donepezil (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently increased frontal cortical gamma power in the freely moving rat and pretreatment with idalopirdine (10 mg/kg p.o.) augmented the effect of donepezil 1 mg/kg. Analysis of the sleep-wake architecture showed that donepezil (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently delayed sleep onset and decreased the time spent in both REM and non REM sleep stages. In contrast, idalopirdine (10 mg/kg p.o.) did not affect sleep-wake architecture nor the effects of donepezil. In summary, we show that idalopirdine potentiates the effects of donepezil on frontal cortical gamma oscillations, a pharmacodynamic biomarker associated with cognition, without modifying the effects of donepezil on sleep. The increased cortical excitability may contribute to the procognitive effects of idalopirdine in donepezil-treated AD patients. © 2016 The Authors","5-HT6 receptor; Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; Alzheimer's disease; EEG; Idalopirdine; sleep","donepezil; idalopirdine; serotonin 6 antagonist; (2-(6-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl)-(3-(2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropoxy)benzyl)amine; benzylamine derivative; cholinesterase inhibitor; donepezil; indan derivative; indole derivative; piperidine derivative; serotonin 6 receptor; serotonin antagonist; serotonin receptor; animal experiment; Article; controlled study; dose response; drug blood level; drug brain level; drug potentiation; electrostimulation; frontal cortex; gamma rhythm; male; medial prefrontal cortex; nonhuman; nonREM sleep; nucleus pontis oralis; polysomnography; pontine nucleus; priority journal; rat; REM sleep; sleep waking cycle; wakefulness; Alzheimer disease; animal; brain stem; drug effects; electroencephalography; frontal lobe; gamma rhythm; pathophysiology; physiology; sleep stage; Sprague Dawley rat; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Benzylamines; Brain Stem; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Electric Stimulation; Electroencephalography; Frontal Lobe; Gamma Rhythm; Indans; Indoles; Male; Piperidines; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Serotonin; Serotonin Antagonists; Sleep Stages; Wakefulness",2-s2.0-84988934530

Each language, an instantiation of LC, consists of a generative procedure that yields a discrete infinity of hierarchically structured expressions with semantic interpretations, hence a kind of “language of thought” (LOT), along with an operation of externalization (EXT) to some sensory-motor system, typically sound. There is mounting evidence that generation of LOT observes language-independent principles of computational efficiency and is based on the simplest computational operations, and that EXT is an ancillary process not entering into the core semantic properties of LOT and is the primary locus of the apparent complexity, diversity, and mutability of language. These conclusions are not surprising, since the internal system is acquired virtually without evidence in fundamental respects, and EXT relates it to sensory-motor systems that are unrelated to it. Even such properties as the linear order of words appear to be reflexes of the sensory motor system, not available to generation of LOT. The limited evidence from the evolutionary record lends support to these conclusions, suggesting that LC emerged with Homo sapiens or not long after, and has not evolved since human groups dispersed. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Language capacity; Language comprehension",,2-s2.0-84976477704

The epileptic encephalopathies can be loosely divided into two related groups of named syndromes. The first comprises epilepsies where continuous EEG changes directly result in cognitive and developmental dysfunction. The second includes patients where cognitive impairment is present at seizure onset and is due to the underlying etiology but the epileptic activity may then worsen the cognitive abilities over time. Recent, large-scale exome studies have begun to establish the genetic architecture of the epileptic encephalopathies, resulting in a re-consideration of the boundaries of these named syndromes. The emergence of this genetic architecture has lead to three main pathophysiological concepts to provide a mechanistic framework for these disorders.

Traditional electroencephalographic studies investigating sleep architecture have found reduced deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, or slow wave sleep (SWS), and increased REM density. However, these findings have been inconsistently observed, and have not survived meta-analysis. By contrast, several recent EEG studies exploring brain activity during sleep have established marked deficits in sleep spindles in schizophrenia, including first-episode and early-onset patients, compared to both healthy and psychiatric comparison subjects. Spindles are waxing and waning, 12–16 Hz NREM sleep oscillations that are generated within the thalamus by the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and are then synchronized and sustained in the cortex. While the functional role of sleep spindles still needs to be fully established, increasing evidence has shown that sleep spindles are implicated in learning and memory, including sleep dependent memory consolidation, and spindle parameters have been associated to general cognitive ability and IQ. In this article we will review the EEG studies demonstrating sleep spindle deficits in patients with schizophrenia, and show that spindle deficits can predict their reduced cognitive performance.

Such patterns have been attributed to the brain's functional architecture, e.g. selective long-range connections. Here, we directly investigate the contribution of selective connections between hemispheres to spontaneous and evoked maps in cat area 18 close to the 17/18 border. We recorded voltage-sensitive dye imaging maps and spiking activity while manipulating interhemispheric input by reversibly deactivating corresponding contralateral areas. During deactivation, spontaneous maps continued to be generated with similar frequency and quality as in the intact network but a baseline cardinal bias disappeared. Consistently, neurons preferring either horizontal (HN) or vertical (VN), as opposed to oblique contours, decreased their resting state activity. HN decreased their rates also when stimulated visually. We conclude that structured spontaneous maps are primarily generated by thalamo- and/or intracortical connectivity. However, selective long-range connections through the corpus callosum – in perpetuation of the long-range intracortical network – contribute to a cardinal bias, possibly, because they are stronger or more frequent between neurons preferring horizontal and/or cardinal contours. As those contours are easier perceived and appear more frequently in natural environment, long-range connections might provide visual cortex with a grid for probabilistic grouping operations in a larger visual scene. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Corpus callosum; Orientation preference; Resting state; Transition zone; VSD imaging","adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; cardinal bias; cognitive bias; connectome; controlled study; corpus callosum; craniotomy; electrophysiology; female; limit of quantitation; male; nonhuman; resting state network; task performance; visual cortex; visual stimulation; voltage sensitive dye imaging",2-s2.0-85006120530

From an initial search, 16,675 papers were identified, of which 21 met inclusion/exclusion criteria. The preliminary evidence suggests that self-reported sleep disturbances are prevalent in early psychosis and may be associated with symptom severity, as well as elevated rates of both help-seeking and suicidality. Abnormalities in sleep architecture and sleep spindles are also commonly observed and may correlate with symptom severity and neurocognitive deficits.

Although the underlying mechanisms of this selective impairment remain poorly understood, animal and human data suggest that dopaminergic modulation may be particularly relevant for associative binding. We investigated the influence of dopamine (DA) receptor genes on item and associative memory in a population-based sample of older adults (n = 525, aged 60 years), assessed with a face–scene item associative memory task. The effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of DA D1 (DRD1; rs4532), D2 (DRD2/ANKK1/Taq1A; rs1800497), and D3 (DRD3/Ser9Gly; rs6280) receptor genes were examined and combined into a single genetic score. Individuals carrying more beneficial alleles, presumably associated with higher DA receptor efficacy (DRD1 C allele; DRD2 A2 allele; DRD3 T allele), performed better on associative memory than persons with less beneficial genotypes. There were no effects of these genes on item memory or other cognitive measures, such as working memory, executive functioning, fluency, and perceptual speed, indicating a selective association between DA genes and associative memory. By contrast, genetic risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) was associated with worse item and associative memory, indicating adverse effects of APOE ε4 and a genetic risk score for AD (PICALM, BIN1, CLU) on episodic memory in general.

Excessive, intermittent exposure to alcohol produces an allostatic dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis along with heightened forebrain glucocorticoid signaling that can damage PFC architecture and function. Negative affective states intimately associated with the transition to alcohol dependence result not only from a dysregulated HPA axis, but also from the inability of a damaged PFC to regulate subcortical stress and reinforcement centers, including the ventral striatum and amygdala. Several cognitive symptoms commonly associated with severe AUD, ranging from poor risk management to the cognitive/affective dimension of pain, are probably mediated by altered function of key anatomical elements that modulate PFC executive function, including contributions from the cingulate cortex and insula. Future therapeutic strategies for severe AUD should focus on attenuating the deleterious effects of excessive stress hormone activity on cognitive/affective and motivational behaviors gated by the PFC. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,"alcohol; stress hormone; affect; alcoholism; brain function; chronic pain; cingulate gyrus; clinical feature; insula; motivation; negative affect; nerve cell network; nociception; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; Review",2-s2.0-85006802600

We identified 126 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in regulation of neurotransmitter systems, nerve growth/death and gene expression, and subsequently investigated their associations with changes in behaviour and/or brain weights in our sample.

Our results showed that the two subdimensions of the perfectionism, concern over mistakes (CM) and doubts about actions (DA), were both positively correlated with the self-reported anxiety and depression as well as the gray matter volume (GMV) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a pivotal brain region in cognitive control, affective state, and regulation.

While this attentional bias is adaptive in healthy situations, it is maladaptive in disorders such as drug addiction or PTSD. In both these disorders, the ability to exert control over this attentional bias is associated with drug abstinence rates or reduced PTSD symptoms, indicating the interaction of visual attention, cognitive control, and stimulus association. The inferior parietal lobule (IPL) is central to attention, while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for reward, cognitive control, and attention. Importantly, regions of the IPL and PFC commonly project to the rostral dorsal caudate (rdCaud) of the striatum. We propose an anatomical network architecture in which IPL projections converge with PFC projections in a connectional hub in the rdCaud, providing an anatomical substrate for the interaction of these projections and their competitive influence on striatal processing. To investigate this, we mapped the dense projections from the caudal IPL and prefrontal (dlPFC, vlPFC, OFC, dACC, and dmPFC) regions that project to the medial rdCaud with anatomical tract-tracing tracer injections in monkeys. These inputs converge in a precise site in the medial rdCaud, rostral to the anterior commissure. Small retrograde tracer injections confirmed these inputs to the medial rdCaud and showed that a proximal ventral striatal location has a very different pattern of cortical inputs. We next used human resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to examine whether a striatal hub exists in the human medial rdCaud. Seed regions in the human medial rdCaud revealed cortical correlation maps similar to the monkey retrograde injection results. A subsequent analysis of these correlated cortical regions showed that their peak correlation within the striatum is in the medial rdCaud, indicating that this is a connectional hub. In contrast, this peak striatal correlation was not found in the ventral striatal location, suggesting that this site is not a connectional hub of cortical regions. Taken together, this work uses the precision of monkey anatomy to identify a connectional hub of IPL and PFC projections in the medial rdCaud. It also translates this anatomical precision to humans, demonstrating that, guided by anatomy, connectional hubs can be identified in humans with fcMRI. These connectional hubs provide more specific treatment targets for drug addiction, PTSD, and other neurological and psychiatric disorders involving the striatum. © 2016","Corticostriatal connectivity; Monkey anatomy; Parietal; Prefrontal; Resting-state functional connectivity; Striatum","adult; Article; controlled study; corpus striatum; dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; inferior parietal lobule; limit of quantitation; male; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; orbital cortex; resting state network; ventrolateral prefrontal cortex",2-s2.0-85006717060

Many attempts have been made to mitigate these interferences in a CR receiver by applying baseband processing or phasing techniques. This paper tries to improve the selectivity by rejecting undesired frequencies and interferences. A feedback or feed forward technique can be applied to detect, estimate and reject undesirable frequency bands. Thus an architecture has been proposed in this paper to reject image and mitigate interference frequencies. The said architecture consists of a modified Weaver architecture for interference mitigation cascaded to a Hartley image rejection mixer. The proposed architecture has been simulated on an EDA tool compelling into the performance metrics such as conversion gain of -3 dB, noise figure of >3 dB, IIP3 of 30 dBm, P1dB of 10 dBm and isolation metrics of the available standard wideband active mixers.

The complexity of the problem increases proportionally with the number of agents, due to the fact that all robots must act in cooperation to complete the task. The proposed model employs a combination of different natural swarm behavior techniques to control a team of robots. It was named robot probabilistic cellular automata ant memory (RPCAAM). Our inspiration came from the possibility to mimic the cognitive behaviors of foraging ants with those of pedestrians in a building evacuation. The proposed probabilistic homing can avoid inertial behavior near the nests, which improves team performance. Furthermore, some investigations into robot-robot and robot-obstacles conflicts were improved to make the model more adequate to real-world applications. The probabilistic model was contrasted with deterministic homing. Moreover, the proposed method was implemented in a robotics simulation environment called Webots.

Recently several authors investigated how AD clinical trials can be made more efficient using predictive measures from such computational methods. For instance, identifying Mild Cognitive Impaired who are most likely to decline during a trial, and thus most likely to benefit from the treatment, will improve trial efficiency and power to detect treatment effects. To this end, using multi-modal, imaging-derived, inclusion criteria may be especially beneficial. In this paper, we explain why predictive measures given by ROI-based summaries or SVM type objectives may be less than ideal for use in the setting described above. We give a solution based on novel deep learning models referred to as a randomized neural networks. We show that our proposed models trained on multiple imaging modalities correspond to a minimum variance unbiased estimator of the decline and are ideal for clinical trial enrichment and design. The resulting predictions appear to more accurately correlate to the disease stages, and extensive evaluations on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) indicate strong improvements in sample size estimates over existing strategies including those based on multi-kernel learning. From the modeling perspective, we evaluate several architectural choices including denoising autoencoders and dropout learning. Separately, our formulation empirically shows how deep architectures can be applied in the large d, small n regime - the default situation in medical imaging and bioinformatics.

However, the principles governing interareal functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) remain elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that human executive functions arise from the dynamic interplay of multiple networks. To do so, we investigated FCD mediating a key executing function, known as arbitrary visuomotor mapping, using brain connectivity analyses of high-gamma activity recorded using MEG and intracranial EEG. Visuomotor mapping was found to arise from the dynamic interplay of three partly overlapping cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical functional connectivity (FC) networks. First, visual and parietal regions coordinated with sensorimotor and premotor areas. Second, the dorsal frontoparietal circuit together with the sensorimotor and associative frontostriatal networks took the lead. Finally, cortico-cortical interhemispheric coordination among bilateral sensorimotor regions coupled with the left frontoparietal network and visual areas. We suggest that these networks reflect the processing of visual information, the emergence of visuomotor plans, and the processing of somatosensory reafference or action’s outcomes, respectively. We thus demonstrated that visuomotor integration resides in the dynamic reconfiguration of multiple cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical FC networks. More generally, we showed that visuomotor-related FC is nonstationary and displays switching dynamics and areal flexibility over timescales relevant for task performance. In addition, visuomotor-related FC is characterized by sparse connectivity with density <10%. To conclude, our results elucidate the relation between dynamic network reconfiguration and executive functions over short timescales and provide a candidate entry point toward a better understanding of cognitive architectures. © 2017 the authors.","Dynamic reconfiguration; Executive functions; Functional connectivity dynamics; High-gamma activity; MEG; SEEG","Article; clinical article; connectome; controlled study; dorsal region; dorsomedial striatum; electroencephalogram; electromagnetism; epilepsy; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional connectivity; human; male; motor cortex; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; premotor cortex; priority journal; sensorimotor function; somatosensory cortex; spectrometry; task performance; visual information; visuomotor coordination; adult; brain mapping; electroencephalography; executive function; magnetoencephalography; movement (physiology); nerve cell network; parietal lobe; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; randomization; visual cortex; young adult; Adult; Brain Mapping; Electroencephalography; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Motor Cortex; Movement; Nerve Net; Parietal Lobe; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Random Allocation; Visual Cortex; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85010850297

Chromatin profiling at base-pair resolution in neuronal nucleosomes extracted from prefrontal cortex of 34 subjects, including 17 cases diagnosed with schizophrenia, revealed MEF2C motif enrichment within cis-regulatory sequences, including neuron-specific promoters and superenhancers, affected by histone H3K4 hypermethylation in disease cases.

Wnt5a expression in hippocampal neurons begins postnatally, and its deletion attenuated CaMKII and Rac1 activity, reduced GluN1 glutamate receptor expression, and impaired synaptic plasticity and spatial learning and memory in 3-mo-old mice. With increased age, Wnt5a loss caused progressive attrition of dendrite arbors and spines in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 pyramidal neurons and exacerbated behavioral defects. Wnt5a functions cell-autonomously to maintain CA1 dendrites, and exogenous Wnt5a expression corrected structural anomalies even at late-adult stages. These findings reveal a maintenance factor in the adult brain, and highlight a trophic pathway that can be targeted to ameliorate dendrite loss in pathological conditions.","Adult hippocampus; Autocrine Wnt signaling; Dendrite arbors","glutamate receptor 1; nestin; Rac1 protein; Wnt5a protein; adult; adult animal; animal cell; animal experiment; behavior disorder; brain cortex; cognition; Conference Paper; controlled study; dendrite; dentate gyrus; disease exacerbation; hippocampal CA1 region; memory; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; pyramidal nerve cell; signal transduction; spatial learning; synaptic transmission",2-s2.0-85010952116

Accordingly, we explored inter-individual variations of functional connectivity dynamics, subnetwork patterns and modular architecture while subjects watched identical video clips designed to induce different arousal levels. How inter-individual variations are manifested in the functional brain networks was examined with respect to four contrasting divisions: Edges within the anterior versus posterior part of the brain, edges with versus without corresponding anatomically-defined structural pathways, inter- versus intra-module connections, and rich club edge types. Inter-subject variation in dynamic functional connectivity occurred to a greater degree within edges localized to anterior rather than posterior brain regions, without adhering to structural connectivity, between modules as opposed to within modules, and in weak-tie local edges rather than strong-tie rich-club edges. Arousal level significantly modulates inter-subject variability in functional connectivity, edge patterns, and modularity, and particularly enhances the synchrony of rich-club edges.

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder of the motor circuit characterized by tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus pars interna provides an efficient treatment to reduce symptoms and levodopa-induced side effects in Parkinson’s disease patients. While the underlying mechanism of action of DBS is still unknown, the potential modulation of white matter tracts connecting the surgical targets has become an active area of research. With the introduction of advanced diffusion MRI acquisition sequences and sophisticated post-processing techniques, the architecture of the human brain white matter can be explored in vivo. The goal of this study is to investigate the white matter connectivity between the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus. Two multi-fiber tractography methods were used to reconstruct pallido-subthalamic, subthalamo-pallidal and pyramidal fibers in five healthy subjects datasets of the Human Connectome Project. The anatomical accuracy of the tracts was assessed by four judges with expertise in neuroanatomy, functional neurosurgery, and diffusion MRI. The variability among subjects was evaluated based on the fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of the tracts. Both multi-fiber approaches enabled the detection of complex fiber architecture in the basal ganglia. The qualitative evaluation by experts showed that the identified tracts were in agreement with the expected anatomy. Tract-derived measurements demonstrated relatively low variability among subjects. False-negative tracts demonstrated the current limitations of both methods for clinical decision-making.

Spectral responses in the high beta- and gamma-band have been observed to be generally stronger to familiar stimuli than to unfamiliar ones. These differences have been hypothesized to be caused by the activation of distributed neuronal circuits or cell assemblies, which act as long-term memory traces for learned familiar items only. Here, we simulated word learning using a biologically constrained neurocomputational model of the left-hemispheric cortical areas known to be relevant for language and conceptual processing. The 12-area spiking neural-network architecture implemented replicates physiological and connectivity features of primary, secondary, and higher-association cortices in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes of the human brain. We simulated elementary aspects of word learning in it, focussing specifically on semantic grounding in action and perception. As a result of spike-driven Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanisms, distributed, stimulus-specific cell-assembly (CA) circuits spontaneously emerged in the network. After training, presentation of one of the learned “word” forms to the model correlate of primary auditory cortex induced periodic bursts of activity within the corresponding CA, leading to oscillatory phenomena in the entire network and spontaneous across-area neural synchronization. Crucially, Morlet wavelet analysis of the network’s responses recorded during presentation of learned meaningful “word” and novel, senseless “pseudoword” patterns revealed stronger induced spectral power in the gamma-band for the former than the latter, closely mirroring differences found in neurophysiological data.

Different cognitive models have explained the speed and accuracy of search based either on the dynamics of attention or on similarity of item representations. Here, we examined the extent to which performance on a visual search task can be predicted from the stable representational architecture of the visual system, independent of attentional dynamics. Participants performed a visual search task with 28 conditions reflecting different pairs of categories (e.g., searching for a face among cars, body among hammers, etc.). The time it took participants to find the target item varied as a function of category combination. In a separate group of participants, we measured the neural responses to these object categories when items were presented in isolation. Using representational similarity analysis, we then examined whether the similarity of neural responses across different subdivisions of the visual system had the requisite structure needed to predict visual search performance. Overall, we found strong brain/behavior correlations across most of the higher-level visual system, including both the ventral and dorsal pathways when considering both macroscale sectors as well as smaller mesoscale regions. These results suggest that visual search for real-world object categories is well predicted by the stable, task-independent architecture of the visual system. New & Noteworthy Here, we ask which neural regions have neural response patterns that correlate with behavioral performance in a visual processing task. We found that the representational structure across all of high-level visual cortex has the requisite structure to predict behavior. Furthermore, when directly comparing different neural regions, we found that they all had highly similar categorylevel representational structures. These results point to a ubiquitous and uniform representational structure in high-level visual cortex underlying visual object processing. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.","Brain/behavior correlations; Cognition; FMRI; Representational similarity analysis; Vision","adult; Article; brain region; car; cognition; face; female; functional neuroimaging; human; male; nerve potential; object relation; priority journal; selective attention; task performance; visual cortex; visual memory; visual system; visual system function; working memory; adolescent; attention; blood; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; image processing; nerve cell network; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photostimulation; physiology; reaction time; statistical model; visual cortex; young adult; oxygen; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Oxygen; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Visual Cortex; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85010280780

More abstract models are refined into more concrete models by model transformations that ensure that the information from higher-level models is retained in lower-level models. This reduces the effort required to build lower-level models. The quality of lower-level models is also improved because they are partly based on well-tested model transformations. A key prerequisite for MDE is the definition of formal modeling languages, for which metamodeling is typically used. Formally defined modeling languages capture an ever-growing number of aspects of the software development process from requirements to architecture, design, and implementation details. A commonly held sentiment in the requirements modeling community is that requirements elicitation techniques have received less attention in terms of MDE. We perform a systematic literature review to either refute or confirm this sentiment by exploring the use of metamodels in papers on five well-known elicitation techniques: Cognitive Work Analysis, Complex Adaptive Systems Theory, Contextual Inquiry and Design, Distributed Cognition, and Emergent Knowledge Process design.

For example, simple visual stimuli like stripes on the floor can alleviate freezing whereas complex stimuli like narrow doorways can trigger it. We present a computational model of the cognitive and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops that explains the effects of sensory and cognitive processes on FOG. The model simulates strong causative factors of FOG including decision conflict (a disagreement of various sensory stimuli in their association with a response) and cognitive load (complexity of coupling a stimulus with downstream mechanisms that control gait execution). Specifically, the model simulates gait of PD patients (freezers and non-freezers) as they navigate a series of doorways while simultaneously responding to several Stroop word cues in a virtual reality setup. The model is based on an actor-critic architecture of Reinforcement Learning involving Utility-based decision making, where Utility is a weighted sum of Value and Risk functions. The model accounts for the following experimental data: (a) the increased foot-step latency seen in relation to high conflict cues, (b) the high number of motor arrests seen in PD freezers when faced with a complex cue compared to the simple cue, and (c) the effect of dopamine medication on these motor arrests. The freezing behavior arises as a result of addition of task parameters (doorways and cues) and not due to inherent differences in the subject group. The model predicts a differential role of risk sensitivity in PD freezers and non-freezers in the cognitive and motor loops. Additionally this first-of-its-kind model provides a plausible framework for understanding the influence of cognition on automatic motor actions in controls and Parkinson’s Disease. © 2017 Muralidharan, Balasubramani, Chakravarthy, Gilat, Lewis and Moustafa.","Basal ganglia; Cognitive; Cognitive load; Conflict; Freezing of gait; Motor; Parkinson’s disease; Utility","dopamine; Article; artificial neural network; association; clinical article; cognition; cognitive load; computer simulation; controlled study; decision making; footstep latency; freezing of gait; gait; human; mathematical model; motor activity; Parkinson disease; reinforcement; risk; Stroop test; task performance; uncertainty; utility based decision making; virtual reality",2-s2.0-85010876717

We offer two distinct theoretical scenarios: according to the first scenario, co-activated knowledge representations interact with the help of an interface established between them via congruent activation in a mediating third-party general cognitive mechanism, e.g., attention. According to the second scenario, co-activated knowledge representations interact due to an overlap between their features, for example when they share a magnitude component. First, we make a case for cross-representational interplay based on grounded and situated theories of cognition. Second, we discuss interface-based interactions between distinct (i.e., non-overlapping) knowledge representations.

It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-peptides and abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins that are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Much has been learned about the genomics of AD from linkage analyses and more recently, genome-wide association studies. Several but not all aspects of the genomic landscape are involved in amyloid-metabolism. The moderate concordance of disease among twins suggests that other factors, potentially epigenomic factors, are related to AD. We are still at the early stages of examining the relation of the epigenome to the clinical and pathologic phenotypes that characterize AD. Our literature review finds evidence of age-related changes in human brain methylation and that aberrant alteration of brain methylation is implicated in AD. Unfortunately, the investigation of the epigenomic component of AD remains a nascent field with limited coverage of the methylation sites and of microRNAs, let alone the many other epigenomic marks. We recently completed two large studies of human brains including coverage with more than 420,000 autosomal cytosine-guanine dinucleotides using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray and with histone acetylation (H3K9ac) with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing.

The activities of the cognitive architecture as indicator of cognitive workload increased with increasing difficulty of the n-back task. To relate model workload to human driver workload, we compared it with neurophysiological workload measures based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain activation as a complementary measure. © 2016 IEEE.","cognitive architecture; cognitive workload; driving; fNIRS; n-back task; physiological measure","Accident prevention; Automation; Functional neuroimaging; Infrared devices; Near infrared spectroscopy; Safety engineering; Cognitive architectures; Cognitive workloads; driving; fNIRS; N-back task; Physiological measures; Psychophysiology",2-s2.0-85011106013

The basic question addressed in this work is whether, given a sequence of steady patterns, it is possible by applying classical learning rules to build a matrix of connections between neurons in the network, such that a heteroclinic dynamics links these patterns. It has been shown previously that the answer is positive in the case where the sequence is a so-called simple consecutive cycle.

The main objective of cognitive science is understanding the nature of the human mind to develop a model that predicts and explains human behavior. These models are useful to Human- Computer Interaction (HCI) by predicting task performance and times, assisting users, finding error patterns, and by acting as surrogate users. In the future these models will be able to watch users, correct the discrepancy between model and user, better predicting human performance for interactive design, and also useful for AI interface agents. To be fully integrated into HCI design these models need to interact with interfaces. The two main requirements for a cognitive model to interact with the interface are (a) the ability to access the information on the screen, and (b) the ability to pass commands. To hook models to interfaces in the general way we work within a cognitive architecture. Cognitive architectures are computational frameworks to execute cognition theories - they are essentially programming languages designed for modeling. Prominent examples of these architectures are Soar [1] and ACT-R [2]. ACT-R models could access the world interacting directly with the Emacs text editor [3]. We present an initial model of eyes and hands within the ACT-R cognitive architecture that can interact with Emacs.","Cognitive Architecture; Cognitive Model; Human Computer Interface; Interaction","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Computation theory; Modeling languages; User interfaces; Cognitive architectures; Cognitive model; Cognitive science; Computational framework; Human computer interaction (HCI); Human computer interfaces; Interaction; Interactive design; Human computer interaction",2-s2.0-85031277768

Some of them (e.g. SOAR (Laird, 2012)) adopt a classical symbolic approach, some (e.g. LEABRA O'Reilly and Munakata (2000)) are based on a purely connectionist model, while others (e.g. CLARION (Sun, 2006)) adopt a hybrid approach combining connectionist and symbolic representational levels. Additionally, some attempts (e.g. biSOAR) trying to extend the representational capacities of CAs by integrating diagrammatical representations and reasoning are also available (Kurup & Chandrasekaran, 2007). In this paper we propose a reflection on the role that Conceptual Spaces, a framework developed by Gärdenfors (2000) more than fifteen years ago, can play in the current development of the Knowledge Level in Cognitive Systems and Architectures. In particular, we claim that Conceptual Spaces offer a lingua franca that allows to unify and generalize many aspects of the symbolic, sub-symbolic and diagrammatic approaches (by overcoming some of their typical problems) and to integrate them on a common ground. In doing so we extend and detail some of the arguments explored by Gärdenfors (1997) for defending the need of a conceptual, intermediate, representation level between the symbolic and the sub-symbolic one. In particular we focus on the advantages offered by Conceptual Spaces (with respect to symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches) in dealing with the problem of compositionality of representations based on typicality traits. Additionally, we argue that Conceptual Spaces could offer a unifying framework for interpreting many kinds of diagrammatic and analogical representations. As a consequence, their adoption could also favor the integration of diagrammatical representation and reasoning in CAs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Two sub-symbolic quantities called valuation and arousal are learned for each declarative memory element based on usage statistics and the reward it generates. As a result, each memory element can be characterized as positive or negative and having a certain degree of affective intensity. In turn, these characteristics affect the latency and probability of retrieval for that memory element. Two global accumulators called core-affect-valuation and core-affect-arousal are computed as weighted sums of all retrievable valuations and arousals, respectively. The weights reflect usage history, context relevance, and reward accrual for all retrievable memory elements. These accumulators describe the general disposition or mood of the system. Core affect dynamics are used as reward signals to learn valuation and arousal values for new objects or events. The new architectural mechanism is used to develop two models that demonstrate the impact of affective valence and arousal on memory and decision-making. The models are fit to datasets from the literature and make novel predictions.

SEMLINCS is a predictive, self-motivated control architecture that learns conceptual, event-oriented schema rules. We show how the developing, general schema rules yield cooperative behavior, taking into account individual beliefs and environmental context. The implemented agents are able to recognize other agents as individual actors, learning about their respective abilities from observation, and considering them in their plans. As a consequence, they are able to simulate changes in their contextdependent scope of action with respect to their own interactions with the environment, interactions of other agents with the environment, as well as interactions between agents, yielding coordinated multi-agent plans. The plans are communicated between the agents and establish a common ground to initiate cooperation. In sum, our results show how cooperative behavior can be planned and coordinated, developing from sensorimotor experience and predictive, event-based structures.",,"Behavioral research; Multi agent systems; Co-operative behaviors; Cognitive architectures; Context dependent; Control architecture; Environmental contexts; Game environment; Multi agent cooperation; Multiagent plans; Cognitive systems",2-s2.0-85022084318

This prediction follows from the contingency of evolution: we, as already present intelligent forms of life, are in a position to exert selective pressures onto the emerging new ones. As a result, it is foreseen that the cognitive architecture of the GB will include human beings and such technologies, which will best prove to advance our collective wellbeing. This paper aims to nuance and problematize this forecast by offering a novel combination of several existing theories: Kauffmann's theory of adjacent possible, Lotman's concept of the semiosphere, Luhmann's theory of social systems, and Heylighen's theory of intelligence. The resulting framework allows for a reinterpretation of the history of the human species in a way which suggests that it may not be individual humans, but our social systems, who are the most advanced intelligence currently operating on Earth. Our unique social systems, emerging from as early as the Neolithic out of mutual interrelations of the occurrences of symbolic communication of humans, are argued to be capable of individuating into autonomous, intelligent agents. The resulting distributedness of the currently dominating form of intelligence might challenge the predicted cognitive architecture of the Global Brain, as it is likely to introduce additional powerful sources of selective pressures. Since the rapid evolution of interconnecting technologies appears to open up immense emancipatory possibilities not only for humans, but also for the intelligently evolving ‘creatures of the semiosphere’, it is concluded that in the context of the rapidly self-organizing Global Brain, a close watch needs to be kept over the dynamics of the latter. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Distributed intelligence; Emancipation; Foragers; Global brain; Luhmann; Social systems; Superintelligence","Intelligent agents; Distributed intelligence; Emancipation; Foragers; Luhmann; Social systems; Superintelligence; Architecture; cognition; social theory; technology",2-s2.0-84978901254

Second, an internal model that would make BI adaptive is expressed in an independent task that involves no threat. The existence of such internal model is a necessary condition to conclude that BI is under model-based control.

The other one, being free of noise, is responsible for memorization and processing the well-known information. Emotions could be interpreted as the noise-amplitude variation and incorporated into the system by coupling the noise amplitude with the additional variable representing the aggregated value of neurotransmitter composition, which reflects the influence of subcortical brain structures.

Based on their inputs, parietal and frontal areas were grouped into different clusters, including a variable number of areas that in most instances occupied contiguous architectonic fields. Connectivity tended to be stronger locally: that is, within areas of the same cluster. Distant frontal and parietal areas were targeted through connections that in most instances were reciprocal and often of different strength. These connections linked parietal and frontal clusters formed by areas sharing basic functional properties. This led to five different medio-laterally oriented pillar domains spanning the entire extent of the parieto-frontal system, in the posterior parietal, anterior parietal, cingulate, frontal, and prefrontal cortex. Different information processing streams could be identified thanks to inter-domain connectivity. These streams encode fast hand reaching and its control, complex visuomotor action spaces, hand grasping, action/intention recognition, oculomotor intention and visual attention, behavioral goals and strategies, and reward and decision value outcome.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of age and cognitive versus social-affective context on the stable and time-varying neural architecture of inhibition, the putative corecognitive control component, in a subsample (N = 359, 22–36 years, 174 men) of the Human Connectome Project. Among younger individuals, a neural signature of superior inhibition emerged in both stable and dynamic connectivity analyses. Dynamically, a context-free signature emerged as stronger segregation of internal cognition(default mode)and environmentally driven control (salience, cingulo-opercular)systems. Adynamic social-affective context-specific signature was observed most clearly in the visual system. Stable connectivity analyses revealed both context-free (greater default mode segregation) and context-specific (greater fron to parietal segregation for higher cognitive load; greater attentional and environmentally driven control system segregation for greater reward value) signatures of inhibition. Superior inhibition in more mature adulthood was typified by reduced segregation in the default network with increasing reward value and increased ventral attention but reduced cingulo-opercular and subcortical system segregation with increasing cognitive load. Failure to evidence this neural profile after the age of 30 predicted poorer life functioning. Our results suggest that distinguishable neural mechanisms underlie individual differences in cognitive control during different young adult stages and across tasks, thereby underscoring the importance of better understanding the interplay among dispositional, developmental, and contextual factors in shaping adaptive versus maladaptive patterns of thought and behavior. © 2017 the authors.","Default mode network; Functional networks; Inhibitory control; Motivation; Working memory","adult; Article; behavioral science; connectome; control system; default mode network; disease predisposition; female; human; major clinical study; male; metacognitive control; priority journal; social cognition; ventral attention network; working memory; brain; cognition; connectome; growth, development and aging; nerve cell inhibition; nerve cell network; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; self report; short term memory; young adult; Adult; Brain; Cognition; Connectome; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Nerve Net; Neural Inhibition; Neural Pathways; Photic Stimulation; Self Report; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85027287282

Abductive inference makes it possible to find missing links that explain a given knack in achieving a skillful task. We introduced meta level abduction to realize rule abduction which is mandatory in finding intermediate missing links to be added in knack explanation. Analogical abduction can be achieved by adding analogical inference rules to causality rules within meta level abduction. We have applied our analogical abduction method to the problem of explaining the difficult cello playing techniques of spiccato and rapid cross strings of the bow movement. Our method has constructed persuasive analogical explanations about how to play them. We have used a model of forced vibration mechanics as the analogy base world for spiccato, and the specification of the skeletal structure of the hand as the basis for the cross string bowing technique. We also have applied analogical abduction to show the effectiveness of a metaphorical expression of “eating pancake on the sly” to achieve forte-piano dynamics, and successfully identified an analogical explanation of how it works. Through these examples, we show the effectiveness of analogical abduction in skill acquisition. Furthermore we discuss the importance of meta level representation as a basis for providing rich human cognitive paradigm such as causality, analogy and metaphor. Finally we propose a cognitive architecture which gives a possible structure for realizing accommodation on our analogical abduction schema. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Accommodation; Analogical abduction; Cello playing; Cognitive architecture; Rule abduction","Artificial intelligence; Musical instruments; Accommodation; Analogical abduction; Cello playing; Cognitive architectures; Rule abduction; Mergers and acquisitions",2-s2.0-85018404209

Many classifiers (including cognitive models of categorization) perform well at the task of associating features with objects. Underlying their performance is an effective selection of the features used during classification. This Feature Selection (FS) process is usually performed outside the boundaries of the model that learns and performs the classification task, often by a human expert. In contrast, the cognitive model we describe simultaneously learns which features to use, as it learns the associations between features and classes. This integration of FS and class learning in one model makes it complementary to other Machine-Learning (ML) techniques that automate the FS process (e.g., deep learning methods). But their integration in a cognitive architecture also provides a means for creating a dynamic context that includes disparate sources of information (e.g., environmental observations, task knowledge, commands from humans); this richer context, in turn, provides a means for making semantic perception goal-directed. We demonstrate automated FS, integrated with an Instance-Based Learning (IBL) approach to classification, in an ACT-R model of categorization by labeling facial expressions of emotion (e.g., happy, sad) from a set of relevant, irrelevant, distinct, and overlapping facial action features. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","ACT-R; Autonomous systems; Categorization; Classification; Cognitive architectures; Feature selection; Instance-based learning; Machine-learning","Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Deep learning; Education; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Semantics; ACT-R; Autonomous systems; Categorization; Cognitive architectures; Instance based learning; Classification (of information)",2-s2.0-85022323327

In this study, a mathematical model to quantitatively compute the multiple sources of workload with a cognitive architecture, Adaptive Control of Thought - Rationale (ACT-R), is proposed, which at the same time reflects the effect of time pressure. Specifically, mathematical equations were developed to quantify each subscale of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and the time pressure effect on information processing speed. The proposed method not only successfully estimates each subscale of NASA-TLX but also simulates the change of human performance and workload by time pressure, comparing the simulated values by the proposed method to performance time by the experiment and subjective ratings of NASA-TLX, as measured by participants on an experiment in the Kanfer-Ackerman Air Traffic Control (KA-ATC) task.

The study of different aspects of human perception currently contributes to machine vision applications. Humans estimate the size of objects to grasp them by perceptual mechanisms. However, the motor system is also able to influence the perception system. Here, we found modifications of object size perception after a reaching and a grasping action in different contextual information.

Beyond the action-modulation effect, the knowledge of subsequent action type modulates the perceptual responses shaping them according to relevant information required to recognize and interact with objects. Cognitive architectures can be improved on the basis of these processings in order to amplify relevant features of objects and allow to robot/agent an easy interaction with them.","Context information; Human functions; Motor output; Object recognition; Visual perception","Architecture; Bayesian networks; Object recognition; Vision; Advanced functions; Cognitive architectures; Context information; Contextual information; Forward dynamic model; Modulation effects; Perceptual mechanism; Visual perception; Cognitive systems",2-s2.0-85021939520

A brief evaluation of the agent is provided. Findings: The paper clearly states that it is possible to use cognitive architectures to help, but there is a lack of architectures that address the problem of combining cognition and emotion in agents in a unified, simplified way. A cognitive-affective architecture is useful to make believable intelligent agents in an easier way. Research limitations/implications: The paper does not explore a lot of possible future work that can be done to extend the emotional expressions of the agent, as well as including direct emotional-sensing capabilities in real time.

Consequently, concurrency control becomes challenging, because the complex data-dependent behavior in these workloads exhibits a range of plausible algorithmic and architectural choices. This article addresses the question of how to efficiently harness the multidimensional search space of such choices for graph analytic workloads in a real-time execution environment. A key insight is that architectural choices are sufficient to yield a concurrency control setting that is comparable to the optimal setup that optimizes both algorithmic and architectural choices.

The structure of consciousness has long been a cornerstone problem in the cognitive sciences. Recently it took on applied significance in the design of computer agents and mobile robots. This problem can thus be examined from perspectives of philosophy, neuropsychology, and computer modeling. Objective. In the present paper, we address the problem of the computational model of consciousness by designing computer agents aimed at simulating ""speech understanding"" and irony. Further, we look for a ""minimal architecture"" that is able to mimic the effects of consciousness in computing systems. Method. For the base architecture, we used a software agent, which was programmed to operate with scripts (productions or inferences), to process incoming texts (or events) by extracting their semantic representations, and to select relevant reactions. Results. It is shown that the agent can simulate speech irony by replacing a direct aggressive behavior with a positive sarcastic utterance. This is achieved by balancing between several scripts available to the agent. We suggest that the extension of this scheme may serve as a minimal architecture of consciousness, wherein the agent distinguishes own representations and potential cognitive representations of other agents. Within this architecture, there are two stages of processing. First, the agent activates several scripts by placing their if-statements or actions (inferences) within a processing scope. Second, the agent differentiates the scripts depending on their activation by another script. This multilevel scheme allows the agent to simulate imaginary situations, one's own imaginary actions, and imaginary actions of other agents, i.e. the agent demonstrates features considered essential for conscious agents in the philosophy of mind and cognitive psychology. Conclusion. Our computer systems for understanding speech and simulation of irony can serve as a basis for further modeling of the effects of consciousness. © Russian Psychological Society, 2017.","Cognitive architectures; Emotional computer agents; Machine humor; Psychophysiological problem; Simulation of irony; Text comprehension; Theory of consciousness",,2-s2.0-85031994397

Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions on the Earth caused by power industries put a high pressure on the existing power grids. Consequently, smart grid (SG) has emerged to address these challenges. The SG can achieve improved load balancing through accessing instantaneous electricity demand information via two-way communication and power flows, which help power plants match their output to the demand precisely. To this end, SG works based on the exchanges of a large amount of information generated from metering, sensing, and monitoring. Hence, the choice of communication infrastructure for SG is critical to provide secure, reliable, and efficient data delivery between various SG components. Cognitive radio (CR) network has been recognized as a promising technology to address communication requirements, standardization, and security problems of SG. Moreover, possible solutions in CR-based SG communications are also identified.

This synthesis could form an interface layer between deliberative/symbolic and reactive/sub-symbolic layers in hybrid cognitive architectures. Design/methodology/approach: A CFS conceptual framework, specifying an arrangement of AMs, was presented. The framework was executed using sparse distributed memory. Experiments were performed to investigate CFS autonomous extraction, consciousness and imagination. Findings: Autonomous extraction was achieved using data from a Wi-Fi camera with the CFS auto-associative AM handling “Sensor Data”. However, noise reduction degraded the extracted image. An environment, simulated in V-REP 3.3.1, was used to investigate consciousness and imagination. CFS displayed consciousness by successfully tracking/anticipating the object position with over 90 per cent congruence. CFS imagination was seen by its predicting two time steps into the future.

The model presented here replicates the functionality of these neurons in their hardware and software counterparts. By using data structures and computational logic that best utilizes currently available processing architectures, a cognitive map is created using a unique multimodal source model for place cell activation. Path planning is performed by using a combination of Euclidean distance path checking, goal memory, and the A* algorithm. Localization is accomplished using simple, low power sensors, such as a camera, ultrasonic sensors, motor encoders and a gyroscope. The place code data structures are initialized as the mobile robot finds goal locations and other unique locations, and are then linked as paths between goal locations, as goals are found during exploration. The place code creates a hybrid cognitive map of metric and topological data. In doing so, much less memory is needed to represent the robot's roaming environment, as compared to traditional mapping methods, such as occupancy grids.

To avoid these issues, and for proper spectrum allocation, a new technique is proposed, known as QoS improvement proper scheduling (QIPS). QIPS is used to increase the basic QoS parameters. This proposed technique divides the network into two regions, and each of these regions is allocated its own cognitive radio base station, which allocates proper scheduling on each node under its control. The spectrum is also allocated on a priority basis according to real-time and non-real-time data, and due to this, the network performance is increased.

By using certain experimental designs and analyses, researchers can assess whether features are processed in serial, in parallel, or coactively. Current practice is to categorize each individual as displaying one of these three architectures. We argue this approach implicitly assumes heterogeneity of processing strategies across participants. A more scientifically meaningful approach may be to first ask whether all people are serial or parallel or coactive before assuming heterogeneity. We develop a series of Bayesian hierarchical models that captures both situations where everyone follows a common architecture and, alternatively, where there is heterogeneity in architecture. These models use g-prior structures that make computation of Bayes factors convenient. We report an application to investigate Miller's (1956) notion of chunking. We asked participants to compare objects that are composed of separable features simultaneously, a perception task, and sequentially, a memory task. We assessed whether processing changed across the perception and memory tasks with the notion that participants might have to chunk features to store them, and that this chunking might make processing more efficient. The answer is ""no."" We find a serial architecture for processing for highly separable features (size of circle and the orientation of its diameter) in both the perception and memory tasks. We also find parallel processing for less separable features (first and second digits in a two-digit number) in both perception and memory tasks. Taken together, while processing may depend on the separability of features, it does not vary across perception and memory. As importantly, we find that all people had the same processing strategy; that is models that stated no heterogeneity outperformed those with heterogeneity. This result indicates that architecture may be universal in this setting and not under strategic control. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian analysis; Cognitive architecture; Hierarchical models; Individual differences; Systems factorial designs",,2-s2.0-85031809524

In three experiments, we show that these knowledge bases only capture a subset of human associations, while irrelevant information introduces noise and makes efficient modeling difficult.

Long term spatial memory relates merely to the spatial information; and is studied through such concepts as schema, schemata, mental map or cognitive map in various disciplines. Many theories indicate that cognitive maps are the representations of real space ensuring the individual a total understanding of his/her environment. They are not reciprocal to real space and they constantly develop a multidimensional structure over topological relations where every point is connected to the other points like a net. Moreover, autobiographical memory researches revealed that recalling performance of an individual is dependent on the factors of age, life period and the elapsed time after the recalled experience. On the basis of these facts, two basic questions are asked: (1) if age and/or time are significant factors over the ongoing restructuring of the cognitive maps, and (2) how can we investigate and reveal the effect of these factors analytically? In this paper, the time factor on the structuring of cognitive maps is investigated through the participant's age and the spatial configuration of the represented space. Inspired from Kim and Penn's (2004) study, a methodology is designed over the spatial syntax analysis of the cognitive maps. The research group is composed of 52 male graduated students of a prominent secondary school, whom belong to three age ranges (23-39, 40-65 and 65-75) that regard to the three adulthood life periods. In order to collect the cognitive data, every participant is asked to draw a sketch of the ground floor of his school building in two successive sessions. Each cognitive map is analysed through its convex map (1) to define the number of recalled spatial units in each session, and (2) to calculate the syntactic values of depth, mean depth and syntactic step. The correlations show strong negative relations between the age and syntactic values, and between the age and contents of spatial units. These results approve the memory theories and show that age and time are significant factors over the restructuring of cognitive maps. In addition to that, this study presents that space syntax analyses are adaptive tools for spatial memory and autobiographical memory researches, most particularly for the one's that focuses on the time factor.","Architecture; Cognition; Cognitive map; Spatial configuration; Spatial memory","Architecture; Drawing (graphics); Floors; Syntactics; Autobiographical memory; Cognition; Cognitive maps; Environmental contexts; Multi-dimensional structure; Spatial configuration; Spatial memory; Topological relations; Cognitive systems",2-s2.0-85031098114

In facilitated face-to-face settings, inquiry skills were improved successfully by using a “question-based dialog” and its resulting visual representation. However, groups that work without a facilitator, or in which members collaborate asynchronously or in different geographical regions, such as Communities of Practice (CoP), cannot schedule face-to-face inquiry meetings. This paper summarizes the unmet requirements of CoPs for a collaborative inquiry tool found by previous research on the Noracle model and proposes a distributed Web architecture as a solution. It mitigates the need for a common infrastructure, central coordination or facilitation, addresses the evolutionary nature of communities of practice and reduces the cognitive load for the individual by filtering and organizing the representational artifacts with respect to the social network of the community.

It is one of the potential technologies adopted for Internet of Things (IoT) and other futuristic machine-to-machine-based applications. Many of these applications are power constrained and delay sensitive. Therefore, CRSN architecture must be coupled with different adaptive and robust communication schemes to take care of the delay and energy efficiency at the same time. Considering the tradeoff that exists in terms of energy efficiency and overhead delay for a given data packet length, it is proposed to transmit the physical layer payload with an optimal packet size (OPS) depending on the network condition. Furthermore, due to the cognitive feature of CRSN architecture overhead energy consumption due to channel sensing and channel handoff plays a critical role. Based on the above premises, in this paper, we propose a heuristic exhaustive search-based Algorithm-1 and a computationally efficient suboptimal low complexity Karuh-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition-based Algorithm-2 to determine the OPS in CRSN architecture using variable rate m-QAM modulation. The proposed algorithms are implemented along with two main cognitive radio assisted channel access strategies based on distributed time slotted-cognitive medium access control (DTS-CMAC) and centralized common control channel-based cognitive medium access control (CC-CMAC) and their performances are compared. The simulation results reveal that proposed Algorithm-2 outperforms Algorithm-1 by a significant margin in terms of its implementation time. For the exhaustive search-based Algorithm-1 the average time consumed to determine OPS for a given number of cognitive users is 1.2 s, while for KKT-based Algorithm-2, it is of the order of 5-10 ms. CC-CMAC with OPS is most efficient in terms of overall energy consumption but incurs more delay as compared to DTS-CMAC with OPS scheme. © 2013 IEEE.","cognitive radio sensor networks; convex optimization; energy-efficiency; medium access control; Optimal packet size; quadrature amplitude modulation","Access control; Convex optimization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Medium access control; Mobile telecommunication systems; Modulation; Network architecture; Network layers; Optimization; Packet networks; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Radio systems; Sensor networks; Common control channels; Communication paradigm; Computationally efficient; Internet of Things (IOT); Optimal packet sizes; Potential technologies; Search-based algorithms; Short range data communication; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85028034490

State of the art in this area describes various complex techniques to determine OPS for CRSNs. However, it is observed that under high interference from the surrounding users, it is not possible to determine a feasible OPS of data transmission under the simple point-to-point CRSN topology. This is contributed primarily to the peak transmit power constraint of the cognitive nodes. To address this specific challenge, this paper proposes a multiple-input multiple output-based CRSNs (MIMO-CRSNs) architecture for futuristic technologies, such as Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communications. A joint optimization problem is formulated, considering network constraints, such as the overall end-to-end latency, interference duration caused to the non-cognitive users, average BER, and transmit power. We propose our Algorithm 1 based on the generic exhaustive search technique to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, a low complexity suboptimal Algorithm 2 based on solving classical Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions is proposed. These algorithms for MIMO-CRSNs are implemented in conjunction with two different channel access schemes. These channel access schemes are time-slotted distributed cognitive medium access control denoted as MIMO-DTS-CMAC and CSMA/CA-assisted centralized common control channel-based cognitive medium access control denoted as MIMO-CC-CMAC. Simulations reveal that the proposed MIMO-CRSN outperforms the conventional point-to-point CRSN in terms of overall energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 show a perfect match, and the implementation complexity of Algorithm 2 is less than Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 takes almost 680 ms to execute and provides OPS value for a given number of users, whereas Algorithm 2 takes 4-5 ms on average to find the OPS for the proposed MIMO-CRSN framework. © 2013 IEEE.","cognitive radio sensor networks; convex optimization; energy-efficiency; medium access control; Optimal packet size; quadrature amplitude modulation","Access control; Automation; Codes (symbols); Cognitive radio; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Convex optimization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Feedback control; Internet of things; Machine-to-machine communication; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Optimization; Packet networks; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Radio systems; Sensor networks; Telecommunication repeaters; Common control channels; End to end latencies; Implementation complexity; Karush Kuhn tucker condition; Optimal packet sizes; Optimization problems; Peak transmit power; Sub-optimal algorithms; Medium access control",2-s2.0-85029597367

Mitola in 1999 to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity for wireless communication. A Cognitive Radio Ad hoc Network (CRAHN) is one of the cognitive radio-based architectures in which wireless unlicensed nodes communicate in infrastructureless environment. Each node in CRAHN has the cognitive capability of sensing the surrounding radio environment for accessing the underutilized licensed spectrum in an opportunistic manner. But those unlicensed users (secondary users) should not make any interference to the communication of licensed users (primary users). In CRAHNs, each node operates as an end system and also as a router to forward packets for multi-hop communication. Due to the dynamic topology, time and space-varying spectrum availability and lack of centralized system, CRAHNs are vulnerable to various security attacks. Hello flood attack is a network layer attack in CRAHNs which can drain off the limited resources of CRAHN nodes by making excessive flooding of hello messages in the network.

It has been recently proposed that ToM can be decomposed into automatic and controlled neurocognitive components, where only the latter engage executive functions (e.g., working memory, inhibitory control and task switching). Critical here is the notion that such dual processes are expected to follow different developmental dynamics. In this work, we provide novel experimental evidence for this notion. We report data gathered from about thirty thousand participants of a massive web poll of people's cognitive skills, which included ToM and executive functions. We show that although the maturation of executive functions occurs in synchrony (around 20 years of age), this is not the case for different mentalizing competences, which either mature before (for elementary ToM constituents) or after (for higher-level ToM). In addition, we show that inter-individual differences in executive functions predict variability in higher-level ToM skills from the onset of adulthood onwards, i.e., after the complete maturation of executive functions. Taken together, these results indicate that the relative contribution of ToM's controlled component significantly changes with age. In particular, this implies that, over the lifespan, people may rely upon distinct cognitive architectures when reading others’ minds. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive control; Cognitive decline; Cognitive development; Dual process theory; Executive functions; Theory of mind","adolescent; adult; adulthood; age; aged; Article; child; childhood; cognitive development; cognitive function test; controlled study; deterioration; educational status; executive function; female; functional dissociation; human; human experiment; infant; lifespan; male; maturation; memory test; mental capacity; mental development; middle aged; newborn; normal human; predictive validity; preschool child; school child; task performance; test retest reliability; theory of mind; very elderly; young adult; cognition; executive function; neuropsychological test; physiology; theory of mind; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Cognition; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Theory of Mind; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84995387510

Thereby, the performance analysis and optimization for CRAHNs become so intricate that pure divide-and-conquer strategies by layered principles strand. Focusing on the five-layer involved performance analysis of CRAHNs, we set up a cross-layer design framework mathematically and solve it through vertical decomposition approaches. After the convex relaxation, a partial Lagrangian formula, which captures network objective and constraints from the physical layer to application layer, is devised. Then, a cross-layer optimization scheme through a vertical decomposition method (COVD) is proposed, which leads to a novel cross-layer architecture. Through the dual decomposition and primal decomposition, the complex joint optimization problem is decoupled into three subproblems with control parameters flowing back and forth. Although COVD achieves the optimal solution for the joint optimization issue, it incurs high cost in terms of overhead and complexity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-layer optimization design by heuristic algorithm, which reduces the computation complexity by a step-by-step division approach. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.

Adaptive Control of Thought - Rational (ACT-R) is a rule-based cognitive architecture that offers a widely employed framework to build such models. There is a sound and complete embedding of ACT-R in Constraint Handling Rules (CHR). Therefore analysis techniques from CHR can be used to reason about computational properties of ACT-R models. For example, confluence is the property that a program yields the same result for the same input regardless of the rules that are applied. In ACT-R models, there are often cognitive processes that should always yield the same result while others e.g. implement strategies to solve a problem that could yield different results. In this paper, a decidable confluence criterion for ACT-R is presented. It allows to identify ACT-R rules that are not confluent. Thereby, the modeler can check if his model has the desired behavior. The sound and complete translation of ACT-R to CHR from prior work is used to come up with a suitable invariant-based confluence criterion from the CHR literature. Proper invariants for translated ACT-R models are identified and proven to be decidable.

As a result of research into the WRAN environment control architecture using a neural network, a flow chart of the environment control algorithm has been developed. Its special feature is that a neural network is located at each base station and interacts with other WRANs according to the IEEE 802.22 standard. The cognitive radio environment control architecture has been improved using a PNN network. This is achieved by applying a special case of radial basis networks - a probabilistic neural network and a hybrid learning system, as well as a hybrid form of error correction and accumulating the experience of past iterations. To simulate a PNN neural network, the MATLAB software package was selected using standard functions of ""Neural"" and ""Simulink"" sections. To determine the two measurable vectors of the input set, four domains of input vectors with a normal distribution law with arbitrary values have been created. As a result of the network simulation, a connectivity matrix corresponding to the input vector has been generated. A PNN neural network simulation showed statistically confirmed results. The network has one competing layer and a layer for receiving and splitting the attributes of the input vector. This ensures the use of a small number of network neurons and, accordingly, the fast learning ability of the network - 1200 ms, which is 1.67 times faster than the required value, which is achieved by employing parallel processing of information. Moreover, the improved method provides the ability to work in the presence of a large number of uninformative, noise input signals, as well as the adaptation to environmental changes. © Y.

Background: Mental fatigue has been recognized as one of the most important factors influencing individual performance. Subjective and physiological measures are popular methods for analyzing fatigue, but they are restricted to physical experiments. Computational cognitive models are useful for predicting operator performance and can be used for analyzing fatigue in the design phase, particularly in industrial operations and inspections where cognitive tasks are frequent and the effects of mental fatigue are crucial. Method: A cyclic mental task is modeled by the ACT-R architecture, and the effect of mental fatigue on response time and error rate is studied. The task includes visual inspections in a production line or control workstation where an operator has to check products' conformity to specifications. Initially, simulated and experimental results are compared using correlation coefficients and paired t test statistics. After validation of the model, the effects are studied by human and simulated results, which are obtained by running 50-minute tests. Results: It is revealed that during the last 20 minutes of the tests, the response time increased by 20%, and during the last 12.5 minutes, the error rate increased by 7% on average. Conclusion: The proper start time for the rest period can be identified by setting a limit on the error rate or response time. Application: The proposed model can be applied early in production planning to decrease the negative effects of mental fatigue by predicting the operator performance. It can also be used for determining the rest breaks in the design phase without an operator in the loop.","ACT-R architecture; Cognitive task; Mental fatigue; Rest breaks","Errors; Production control; Statistical tests; Cognitive task; Correlation coefficient; Individual performance; Industrial operations; Mental fatigue; Operator-in-the-loop; Physiological measures; Rest breaks; Diseases; adult; dysthymia; human; job performance; pathophysiology; physiology; psychomotor performance; theoretical model; Adult; Humans; Mental Fatigue; Models, Theoretical; Psychomotor Performance; Work Performance",2-s2.0-85018176854

Dynamic spectrum access allows effective use of radio frequency and prevents its underutilization in many real-world networks. It enables unlicensed users to temporarily ""borrow"" unused spectrum while ensuring that the rights of the incumbent license holders are respected. Problems of optimization of joint access of primary and secondary users can be effectively solved by means of queueing theory. In this paper, the analysis of a novel queueing model suitable for the optimization of access is implemented under quite general assumptions about the system parameters. There are several types of primary customers having different requirements for the service time and preemptive priority over secondary customers. Secondary customers can share a server, while primary customers occupy the whole server. The arrival flow is described by the marked Markovian arrival process. The service time distribution is of phase-type. Effect of retrials of secondary customers is taken into account. An effective way for the analysis of multi-server queues with many types of customers and heterogeneous requirements to the service process is provided and applied. © 2016 IEEE.","channel reservation; Cognitive radio; heterogeneous traffic; queueing","Human computer interaction; Markov processes; Network architecture; Queueing theory; Radio systems; Radio transmission; Sales; Spectrum analysis; Channel reservations; Dynamic spectrum access; Heterogeneous traffic; Information transmission; Markovian arrival process; queueing; Service time distribution; Wireless network capacity; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85027416346

Recent progress in combining Reinforcement Learning objective functions and Deep Learning architectures has achieved promising results for such tasks. An important aspect of such sequential decision making problems, which has largely been neglected, is for the agent to decide on the duration of time for which to commit to actions. Such action repetition is important for computational efficiency, which is necessary for the agent to respond in real-time to events (in applications such as self-driving cars). Action Repetition arises naturally in real life as well as simulated environments. The time scale of executing an action enables an agent (both humans and AI) to decide the granularity of control during task execution. Current state of the art Deep Reinforcement Learning models, whether they are off-policy (Mnih et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015) or on-policy (Mnih et al. 2016), consist of a framework with a static action repetition paradigm, wherein the action decided by the agent is repeated for a fixed number of time steps regardless of the contextual state while executing the task. In this paper, we propose a new framework-Dynamic Action Repetition which changes Action Repetition Rate (the time scale of repeating an action) from a hyper-parameter of an algorithm to a dynamically learnable quantity. At every decision-making step, our models allow the agent to commit to an action and the time scale of executing the action. We show empirically that such a dynamic time scale mechanism improves the performance on relatively harder games in the Atari 2600 domain, independent of the underlying Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm used. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

This paper proposes a multi-passband complex filter (MPCF) architecture and the related circuit design for a multiband cognitive radar system. By operating under the 5.8GHz UNII band, the sensing part detects the current usage of frequency bands from 5.15GHz to 5.825GHz and provides the information of unused channels. The multiband cognitive radar system uses the whole unused channels and eliminates the used channels by using an on-chip MPCF in order to be coexistent with the Wi-Fi standard. The MPCF filters out the unwanted channels and leave the wanted channels. It dynamically changes the bandwidth of frequency from 20MHz to 80MHz using the 0.18μm CMOS technology. The MPCF is composed of the combination of 5th-order Chebyshev low-pass filters and high-pass filters, and the overall inband ripple of the MPCF is 1.2dB. The consuming current is 21.7mA at 1.8V power supply and the 20MHz bandwidth noise is 55.5nV. The total harmonic distortion (THD) is 45dB at 25MHz and the adjacent channel rejection is 24dB.

In the first framework, AMC is modelled as a traditional classification problem with the aim to maximize the probability of correct classification. The second framework seeks to optimize the throughput as opposed to simply maximizing the probability of the correct classification. To model the second framework, we developed a hybrid cognitive engine (CE) architecture by integrating an RNN based learning algorithm with genetic algorithm (GA) based reasoning. RNN inherent properties help CE to comply with the essential CE design requirement (i.e. concurrent long-term-learning, low computational complexity, and fast decision making). The performance of RNN is compared with artificial neural networks (ANN) and state-of-the-art effective exponential SINR mapping (EESM) algorithm. A comprehensive analysis of the proposed RNN based AMC scheme is presented by jointly incorporating the effect of different schedulers, feedback delays, and multi-antenna diversity on the throughput of an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system. The critical analysis of the first framework revealed that RNN based CE can achieve comparable results with faster adaptation, even in severe environment changes without the need of retraining compared to ANN. The analysis of the second approach demonstrated RNNs faster adaptation as compared to ANN and showed upto 253% gain in user throughput. RNN based CE efficiently exploited the channel quality information feedback delay to improve system throughput and helped cell-edge and cell-centre users to experience much better services in terms of achieved throughput as compared to EESM. © 2016","Adaptive modulation and coding; Context-aware decision making; Genetic algorithm; Hybrid cognitive engine; Long-term evolution; Random neural network","Adaptive modulation; Codes (symbols); Cognitive systems; Complex networks; Decision making; Engines; Evolutionary algorithms; Frequency division multiple access; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Mobile telecommunication systems; Modulation; Neural networks; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adaptive modulation and coding; Channel quality informations; Cognitive engines; Context-aware decision makings; Long Term Evolution (LTE) downlink; Orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems; Probability of correct classifications; Random neural network; Long Term Evolution (LTE)",2-s2.0-85006757981

The Army is developing one such technology known as the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT). GIFT is an open-source, domain-independent intelligent tutoring framework that facilitates reuse of components in an effort to reduce the expense of developing and delivering adaptive training. Adaptive training offers the promise of higher levels of proficiency, but another important benefit is that it is more efficient than one-size-fits-all training. Put another way, intelligent, adaptive training should require less time to train a population of learners to a given level of proficiency than non-adaptive training. The gains in efficiency should be a function of several factors including learner characteristics (e.g., aptitude, reading ability, prior knowledge), learning methods employed by the adaptive training system, course content (e.g., difficulty and length, adaptability), and test characteristics (e.g., difficulty, number of items). Optimizing training efficiency requires one to tune the instructional design and course content to the characteristics of the learners. GIFT currently lacks the ability to model or predict the efficiency with which training can be delivered based on these factors.

Regarding the hypothesis testing problem concerned, first, the proposed system behavior is thoroughly analyzed and its associated likelihood-ratio test is provided. Next, based on a general linear fusion rule, the statistics of the global test summary are derived and the sensing quality is characterized in terms of the probability of false alarm and probability of detection. Then, the optimization of the overall detection performance is formulated according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion (NPC) and it is discussed that the optimization required is indeed a decision-making process with uncertainty which incurs prohibitive computational complexity. The NPC is then modified to achieve a good affordable solution by using semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques and it is shown that this new solution is nearly optimal according to the deflection criterion.

These pauses, moments or breaks are termed as blocks and fixations based on their characteristics. The paper elaborates on the identified blocks and fixations in the architecture studio design process in context to the student’s experience. The fixation or the blocks are specific to Students domain which varies according to the content and Pedagogical approach. Hence the typology of fixation is kept constant and mapped according to the three years of architecture and in three zones for different pedagogical approach. Thus the interesting patterns obtained are inferred. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cognition; Creativity; Design fixation; Mental blocks; Visualization","Architecture; Flow visualization; Problem solving; Architecture designs; Architecture studios; Cognition; Creativity; Design fixations; Design projects; Mental blocks; Pedagogical approach; Design",2-s2.0-85018434787

The goal is to create a theoretical framework to determine an optimal NN architecture to achieve a Probability of Detection (PD) of 95% or higher and a Probability of False Alarm (PFA) of 1.5% or lower at 5 dB Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Literature research reveals that the frequency-domain power spectral densities characterize a signal more efficiently than its time-domain counterparts. Therefore, the input data is preprocessed by calculating the magnitude square of the Discrete Fourier Transform of the digitally sampled bandlimited AWGN and linear FM signals to populate a matrix containing N number of samples and M number of spectra. This matrix is used as input for the NN, and the spectra are divided as follows: 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. The study begins by experimentally deducing the optimal number of hidden neurons (1-40 neurons), then the optimal number of hidden layers (1-5 layers), and lastly, the most efficient learning algorithm. The training algorithms examined are: Resilient Backpropagation, Scaled Conjugate Gradient, Conjugate Gradient with Powell/Beale Restarts, Polak-Ribiére Conjugate Gradient, and Variable Learning Rate Backpropagation.

Gombrich’s “Reflections on Main Project”, Rudolf Arnheim’s “Vision is Thinking”, Michel Foucault’s “The Eyes of Power”, and Heinrich Wolfflin’s “Reflections on Form”, among others. In the long-term design practice and research, from the “Complementary Perspective”, the author finds that the cognitive intention is rooted in the Chinese traditional thoughts and culture, and perceives the objective world with a unique way.

Previously, we have shown that lack of Abca1 significantly increases amyloid deposition and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease model mice expressing human amyloid-β protein precursor (APP). The goal of this study was to determine if ABCA1 plays a role in memory deficits caused by amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers and examine neurite architecture of pyramidal hippocampal neurons. Our results confirm previous findings that Abca1 deficiency significantly impairs spatial memory acquisition and retention in the Morris water maze and long-term memory in novel object recognition of APP transgenic mice at a stage of early amyloid pathology. Neither test demonstrated a significant difference between Abca1ko and wild-type (WT) mice. We also examined the effect of intra-hippocampal infused Aβ oligomers on cognitive performance of Abca1ko mice, compared to control infusion of scrambled Aβ peptide. Age-matched WT mice undergoing the same infusions were also used as controls. In this model system, we found a statistically significant difference between WT and Abca1ko mice infused with scrambled Aβ, suggesting that Abca1ko mice are vulnerable to the effect of mild stresses. Moreover, examination of neurite architecture in the hippocampi revealed a significant decrease in neurite length, number of neurite segments, and branches in Abca1ko mice when compared to WT mice. We conclude that mice lacking ABCA1 have basal cognitive deficits that prevent them from coping with additional stressors, which is in part due to impairment of neurite morphology in the hippocampus. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

We particularly investigate the effect of tactical breathing during a psychomotor task of golf putting. In general, learners are instructed to perform proper breathing while executing actions. However, it is not well understood that how the corresponding mechanisms of attentional control interact with the physiological factors as the learner progresses to the learning stage. In addition the instruction and feedback policy in a training system need to deal with the changing attentional capacity in the learning stage. One of the advantages using an adaptive training system (e.g., Generalized Intelligent Framework for Training: GIFT) is to provide tailored feedback to the leaner.

The green symbiotic cloud communications (GSCCs) paradigm created on this concept facilitates the use of multiple communication mediums concomitantly creating a first of its kind communication cloud. This paper specifically corroborates a virtualized transport layer and network ports and an abstracted Internet protocol scheme in defining the GSCC architecture. We further address the issue of formulating a cognitive decision function based on utility theory, which allows users with GSCC enabled devices to intelligently distribute its bandwidth requirement amongst the available communication mediums. Considering the multiple criteria associated with different networks, we formulate an optimization problem to find the solution for this resource allocation problem for single user. We further address the multi-user scenario and formulate and solve the multi-objective optimization problem using goal attainment technique. Results in single and multiple user scenarios, demonstrate that by utilizing multiple mediums as per GSCC paradigm coupled with our proposed decision function improves the functionality of the communication cloud.

This article reviews the text within the methodological framework based on the deep-seated theoretical studies on ""rhetoric"" (the art of discourse) and re-reads of Usûl-i Mi'mârî-i Osmanî published in 1873 as the first attempt to develop a discourse on architecture writing and architectural theory. The primary objective of the study is to present a textual section of architecture in a specific period of Ottoman history. The study sheds light onto the cognitive world of Ottomans, which usually remains incomprehensible in texts concerning identity, politics, power relations, institutional constructions, culture, art and identity. However, it not only reveals the intellectual stance of the Ottoman Empire in 19th century, but also provides a reinterpretation en masse, of Ottoman writings. In this analysis of architectural discourse, which takes rhetoric as understanding, differentiating and disclosing meaning, the study makes use of important canons of rhetoric. To expound on Usûl-i Mi'mârî-i Osmanî necessitates to be immersed in a history-writing venture, which outstretches from political history to art history, from architecture to architectural history. Usûl-i Mi'mârî-i Osmanî deserves to be read, re-read and produced for being the first text on identity discourses, a first and experimental search on Ottoman order styles, a trial on coupling cultural identity and architecture and for its revelations on architectural writing.","Ottoman architecture; Re-reading; Rhetoric; Theory; Usûl-i Mi'mârî-i Osmanî",,2-s2.0-85025128540

Three key elements of the proposed framework (rehabilitation module, workspace and rehabilitation scenarios) have been described in detail. In the rehabilitation sessions, the users and the robot are asked to work together to place cubes so as to form a predefined shape. The robot and the user hold the same object in order to move it to a particular destination according to a rehabilitation scenario. If the robot detects a force from the user directed in the wrong direction during the navigation then it resists and corrects the movement in order to assist the user towards the right direction. The assistive support scenarios were designed to evaluate the achieved enhancement of precision, efficiency and dexterity of arm movements.

The DAC serves as the data converter for the adaptive waveform transmitter therein, largely to reduce its power dissipation and hardware complexity. For reasons of low power dissipation and low-cost CUWB application, the resolution of the DAC is 4 bits, its realization is in standard 65-nm CMOS, and the architecture is a single core. The binary current-steering DAC includes critical building blocks such as current sources and a novel deglitcher circuit. The current sources are designed for small area with high linearity based on our derived relationship between current-source output resistance and linearity parameters [integral nonlinearity (INL) and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR)]. The deglitcher design includes high-speed source followers as high-speed low voltage swing buffers to improve the linearity by decreasing the output glitch energy. The DAC embodies an in situ hardware efficient (small integrated-circuit area and reduced input/output pinout) tester that generates 4 × 10-Gb/s test-data pattern to facilitate functional verification. The designed DAC achieves ≤ 0.16-least significant bit INL/differential nonlinearity and > 23-dBc SFDR over the Nyquist bandwidth up to 4.53 GHz, and features the most competitive figures-of-merit of all similar DACs reported to date. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; current steering; digital-analog conversion; impulse radio; pulse generator; Ultrawideband (UWB)","Cognitive radio; Complex networks; Digital radio; Electric losses; Electric resistance; Hardware; Integrated circuit design; Pulse generators; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Current steering; Functional verification; Impulse Radio; Integral nonlinearity; Least significant bits; Low-power dissipation; Spectrum utilization; Spurious free dynamic range; Digital to analog conversion",2-s2.0-85008506436

Google promotes a new form of “infrastructural intelligence,” which excels by constantly reassessing its cognitive architecture in exchange with a cloud of data that surrounds it, and exhibits putatively human capacities such as intuition. I argue that such (re)alignments of biological and artificial intelligence have been enabled by a paradigmatic infrastructuralization of the brain in contemporary neuroscience. This infrastructuralization is based in methodologies that epistemically liken the brain to complex systems of an entirely different scale (i.e., global logistics) and has given rise to diverse research efforts that target the neuronal infrastructures of higher cognitive functions such as empathy and creativity.

This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer's cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Decision making; Digital factory; Industry 4.0","Computer aided engineering; Condition monitoring; Decision making; Systems analysis; Customer requirements; Digital factories; Knowledge based tools; Knowledge-based decision making; Product requirements; Production system designs; Semi structured interviews; System architectures; Knowledge based systems",2-s2.0-84994156501

State of the art solutions use the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to provide basic data plane abstractions and programming interfaces for control and management of these abstractions; however, SDN technologies are currently limited to wired networks and do not provide the appropriate abstractions to support ever changing wireless protocols. On the other hand, the Software Defined Radio (SDR) paradigm enables complex signal processing functionality to be implemented efficiently in software, instead of on specialized hardware; however, SDR does not cater to the demand for adaptive radio network management with respect to changing channel conditions and policies.

Although gradual behavioral improvements from practice have been modeled in spiking neural networks, few such models have attempted to explain cognitive development of a task as complex as addition. In this work, we model the progression from a counting-based strategy for addition to a recall-based strategy. The model consists of two networks working in parallel: a slower basal ganglia loop and a faster cortical network. The slow network methodically computes the count from one digit given another, corresponding to the addition of two digits, whereas the fast network gradually “memorizes” the output from the slow network. The faster network eventually learns how to add the same digits that initially drove the behavior of the slower network. Performance of this model is demonstrated by simulating a fully spiking neural network that includes basal ganglia, thalamus, and various cortical areas. Consequently, the model incorporates various neuroanatomical data, in terms of brain areas used for calculation and makes psychologically testable predictions related to frequency of rehearsal. Furthermore, the model replicates developmental progression through addition strategies in terms of reaction times and accuracy, and naturally explains observed symptoms of dyscalculia.

Changes in satisfaction with one's body might serve to motivate healthier eating by mediating treatments’ effect on psychological factors previously suggested to be associated with weight loss. Methods Women with obesity (age 48.6 ± 7.1 years; BMI 35.4 ± 3.3 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to social cognitive theory-based weight-management treatments that were either group sessions emphasizing physical activity-derived self-regulation (experimental; n = 53) or review of a written manual and phone support (comparison; n = 54). Changes in weight, physical activity, body satisfaction, negative mood, and self-efficacy and self-regulation for controlled eating were assessed over 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Results The experimental treatment was associated with significantly more favourable changes across variables. Over 6, 12, and 24 months, body satisfaction change mediated relationships between treatment type and changes in each of the psychological predictors of healthier eating (mood, self-efficacy, self-regulation). Reciprocal, mutually reinforcing, relationships between changes in body satisfaction and those psychological predictors were also found. Increased physical activity was associated with improved body satisfaction, even after controlling for weight changes. Conclusion Findings increased understandings of the role of body satisfaction in improving psychological predictors of healthier eating over both the short- and longer-term. Results also suggested that body satisfaction could be improved through increased physical activity, irrespective of change in weight. Although results were limited to women with class 1 and 2 obesity, findings on interactions of psychological factors associated with eating changes have implications for the architecture of improved behavioural treatments. © 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity","Behavioural; Body image; Psychosocial; Treatment; Weight loss","adult; Article; autoregulation; behavior change; behavior contracting; behavior modification; body image; body mass; comparative study; controlled study; feeding behavior; female; healthy diet; human; kinesiotherapy; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; middle aged; mood; obesity; patient satisfaction; physical activity; physical inactivity; priority journal; psychological aspect; randomized controlled trial; reinforcement; self concept; self report; Social Cognitive Theory; social cognitive theory based weight management; treatment duration; weight change; weight loss program; affect; body mass; cognitive therapy; diet; feeding behavior; obesity; psychology; self control; weight loss program; weight reduction; Adult; Affect; Body Image; Body Mass Index; Cognitive Therapy; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Self Efficacy; Self-Control; Weight Loss; Weight Reduction Programs",2-s2.0-84964329147

Evidently, general cognitive competences are a product of a prolonged and complex process of cognitive development. Therefore, the process of cognitive development is a primary key to understanding the emergence of intelligent behavior. This paper develops the theoretical foundations for a model that generalizes the process of cognitive development. The model aims to provide a realistic scheme for the synthesis of scalable cognitive systems with an open-ended range of capabilities. Major concepts and theories of human cognitive development are introduced and briefly explored, focusing on the enactive approach to cognition and the concept of sense-making. The initial scheme of human cognitive development is then generalized by introducing the philosophy of individuation and the abstract mechanism of transduction. The theory of individuation provides the ground for the necessary paradigmatic shift from cognitive systems as given products to cognitive development as a formative process of self-organization. Next, the conceptual model is specified as a scalable scheme of networks of agents. The mechanisms of individuation are formulated in context-independent information theoretical terms. Finally, the paper discusses two concrete aspects of the generative model – mechanisms of transduction and value modulating systems. These are topics of further research towards an implementable architecture. © 2016, EDP Sciences and Springer.",,,2-s2.0-84973622865

In coordination with multiple devices, long range data transmission is achieved. The advantage of multiple network utilization has brought out the significance of higher service applications for any network device with the advantage of using multiple networks for communication. In this network, the demand for proper resource utilization arises due to a shift to multiple networks. As the network switches from one network to another, and observed issues like fairness, power, spectrum utilization in the resources are varied, which impacts the flow of data. Hence it is required to optimize the resource utilization to achieve a fair and efficient communication. Towards achieving the objective of fairness in an heterogeneous network with cognitive devices, a multi objective coordination approach for optimal resource utilization is proposed. The resource utilization problem is defined by an effective spectrum utilization among the network users.

Current techniques for the evaluation of chromosomal structure have revealed that genomes are arranged at several hierarchical levels in three-dimensional space. The spatial organization of genomes involves the formation of chromatin loops that bypass a wide range of genomic distances, providing a connection between enhancers and chromosomal domains. Furthermore, they form chromatin domains that are arranged into chromosome territories in the three-dimensional space of the cell nucleus. Recent studies have shown that the spatial organization of the genome is essential for normal brain development and function. Activity-dependent alterations in the spatial organization of the genome can regulate transcriptional activity related to neuronal plasticity. Disruptions in the higher-order chromatin architecture have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as cognitive dysfunction and anxiety.

As such, the psychology of ship architecture/design refers to how ships are designed to support the physiological processes and the associated cognitive functions of their users. Ships are however almost exclusively designed by members of the engineering discipline. We advocate that there is room for improvement in the psychology of ship design by incorporating psychological factors into the shared knowledge base, design practice, individual and social characteristics and behaviour of these designers. The chapter goes on to suggest that in order to improve on the psychology of ship design, the required knowledge and methodology made available to ship designers needs to be reworked-translated-to more convincingly and operationally be relevant to this target group. Thus transformed, this knowledge may help to provide an enhanced working environment for seafarers, in terms of work safety, effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, cognitive workload and other crucial factors that exist in the interplay between humans and their working environment. Considering that seafaring is one of the few professions living in their working environment for extended periods of time, such transformed knowledge, and the subsequent skilful application of the psychology of ship design, could positively impact on the interaction between the crew and their living quarters. The ship designer has a decisive impact on such qualities as comfort, privacy, noise, vibration and heat, factors which eventually have a significant bearing on the performance of the individual crew members as well as team performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Engineering knowledge; Human-centred design; Naval architect; Ship design; Ship psychology",,2-s2.0-85028848234

The aim of this study was to measure the potential of global metrics of network architecture derived from resting state functional MRI to capture the impact of epilepsy on the developing brain. Methods Pediatric patients were retrospectively identified with: 1. Focal epilepsy; 2. Brain MRI at 3 Tesla, including resting state functional MRI; 3. Full scale IQ measured by a pediatric neuropsychologist. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into approximately 700 gray matter network nodes. The strength of a connection between two nodes was defined as the correlation between their resting BOLD signal time series. The following global network metrics were then calculated: clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity, path length, and global efficiency. Epilepsy duration was used as an index for the cumulative impact of epilepsy on the brain. Results 45 patients met criteria (age: 4–19 years). After accounting for age of epilepsy onset, epilepsy duration was inversely related to IQ (p: 0.01). Epilepsy duration predicted by a machine learning algorithm on the basis of the five global network metrics was highly correlated with actual epilepsy duration (r: 0.95; p: 0.0001). Specifically, modularity and to a lesser extent path length and global efficiency were independently associated with epilepsy duration. Conclusions We observed that a machine learning algorithm accurately predicted epilepsy duration based on global metrics of network architecture derived from resting state fMRI. These findings suggest that network metrics have the potential to form the basis for statistical models that translate quantitative imaging data into patient-level markers of cognitive deterioration. © 2016 The Authors","Brain; Epilepsy; Graph theory; Intelligence; Network","adolescent; adult; Article; benign childhood epilepsy; BOLD signal; brain cortex; child; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; gray matter; human; intelligence quotient; machine learning; male; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; resting state network; retrospective study",2-s2.0-85003864881

Although functional abnormalities in the loops involving the orbitofronto-striato-thalamic (OFST) circuitry in patients with OCD have been reported, our understanding of a link between disruptions in the architecture of the intrinsic functional network of the OFST circuit and their symptoms remain incomplete. Using resting-state functional MRI in conjunction with unsupervised clustering and multilevel functional connectivity (FC) techniques, FC of the OFST network and its topological organization in 61 OCD patients versus 61 matched controls were characterized. Patients exhibited disruptions in small-world properties of the OFST circuit, which indicates an imbalance between functional integration and segregation. Patients also showed decreased FC between the central orbitofrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum but increased FC between the medial thalamus and striatal areas. Using one of the largest samples of unmedicated OCD patients to date, our findings provide evidence supporting the OFST dysconnection hypothesis in OCD as a basic pathophysiological mechanism underlying the disorder, showing the disruption of FC between specific cortical, striatal, and thalamic clusters and aberrant topological patterns of the OFST circuit.

Secure Intelligent Radio for Trains (SIRT) is an intelligent radio that is customized to train operations with the aim of improving the reliability and security of the radio communication network. SIRT has two tiers. The upper tier has the Master Cognitive Engine (MCE) which communicates with other SIRT nodes to obtain signaling and wayside device information. To do so, the MCE communicates with cognitive engines at the lower tier of SIRT; namely the Cryptographic Cognitive Engine (CCE) (that provide cryptographic security and threat detection) and the Spectrum Management Cognitive Engine (SCE) (that uses spectrum monitoring, frequency hopping and adaptive modulation to ensure the reliability of the radio communication medium).

Without negating the importance of the universality assumption for the development of cognitive neuroscience, or the importance of single-case studies, here we aim at stressing the potential dangers of interpreting the pattern of performance of single patients as conclusive evidence concerning the architecture of the intact neurocognitive system. We take example from the case of Leonardo Botallo, an Italian surgeon of the Renaissance period, who claimed to have discovered a new anatomical structure of the adult human heart. Unfortunately, Botallo's discovery was erroneous, because what he saw in the few samples he examined was in fact the anomalous persistence of a fetal structure. Botallo's error is a reminder of the necessity to always strive for replication, despite the major hindrance of a publication system heavily biased towards novelty. In the present paper, we briefly discuss variations and anomalies in human brain anatomy and introduce the issue of variability in cognitive neuroscience. We then review some examples of the impact on cognition of individual variations in (1) brain structure, (2) brain functional organization and (3) brain damage. We finally discuss the importance and limits of single case studies in the neuroimaging era, outline potential ways to deal with individual variability, and draw some general conclusions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Brain connections; Neuroanatomy; Neuroimaging; Neuropsychology; Single-case studies","attention; brain; brain damage; clinical research; cognition; cognitive neuroscience; frontoparietal cortex; functional connectivity; human; Italian (citizen); learning; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; neuropsychology; reading; reproducibility; Review; surgeon; universality assumption; visual deprivation; adult; brain; diagnostic imaging; physiology; procedures; Adult; Brain; Cognition; Humans; Neuroimaging",2-s2.0-85008221226

It combines deep logical/probabilistic reasoning tightly with natural language processing (NLP), and complements machine learning (ML). Rulelog interoperates and composes well with graph databases, relational databases, spreadsheets, XML, and expressively simpler rule/ontology systems and can orchestrate overall hybrid KRR. Developed mainly since 2005, Rulelog is much more expressively powerful than the previous state-of-the-art practical KRR approaches, yet is computationally affordable. It is fully semantic and has capable efficient implementations that leverage methods from logic programming and databases, including dependency-aware smart caching and a dynamic compilation stack architecture.","Cognitive computing; Declarative logic programs; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Natural language processing; Semantic rules","Computation theory; Computer programming languages; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logic programming; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Cognitive Computing; Declarative logic; Efficient implementation; Emerging applications; Expressive semantics; Fundamental concepts; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Semantic rules; Computer circuits",2-s2.0-85027893539

Current theories treat context as a highly dynamic representation of concepts and relationships that are interrelated at multiple levels of abstraction. The representational changes result from multiple independent reasoning elements, some of which are externally stimulated by changing perceptual information and others of which are internally stimulated by recognition of patterns of information that afford opportunities to evolve the representation to be more conformant to the perceived environment and more useful for current high level motivations and goals. This yields a picture of context that is both a snapshot - the current state of the representation - and a process that drives the ever-changing state of the snapshot. The Narratively-Integrated Multilevel framework (NIM) is a computational theory of context inspired by this body of cognitive theory. NIM consists of a declarative representation of context that is bound to specific domains and situations through semantics that are largely shared within a (human) community. It also includes of a self-organizing reasoning process that builds, maintains and deconstructs the context representation through a set of independent knowledge elements organized into a Pandemonium architecture. The Integrated Context Engine (ICE) is a computational implementation of the NIM framework that has been successfully applied to multiple domains including robotics and decision support. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The putative structural correlate for this functional reorganization, however, is largely unknown. Changes in gyrification, i.e. decreases of cortical folding were found to be a marker of atrophy of the brain in later decades of life. Therefore, the present study assessed local gyrification indices of the DMN in relation to age and cognitive performance in 749 older adults aged 55–85 years. Age-related decreases in local gyrification indices were found in the anterior part of the DMN [particularly; medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)] of the right hemisphere, and the medial posterior parts of the DMN [particularly; posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus] of both hemispheres. Positive correlations between cognitive performance and local gyrification indices were found for (1) selective attention and left PCC/precuneus, (2) visual/visual–spatial working memory and bilateral PCC/precuneus and right angular gyrus (AG), and (3) semantic verbal fluency and right AG and right mPFC. The more pronounced age-related decrease in local gyrification indices of the posterior parts of the DMN supports the functionally motivated PASA theory by correlated structural changes. Surprisingly, the prominent age-related decrease in local gyrification indices in right hemispheric ROIs provides evidence for a structural underpinning of the right hemi-aging hypothesis. Noticeably, the performance-related changes in local gyrification largely involved the same parts of the DMN that were subject to age-related local gyrification decreases. Thus, the present study lends support for a combined structural and functional theory of aging, in that the functional changes in the DMN during aging are accompanied by comparably localized structural alterations. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aging; Cognition; Default mode network; Gyrification","adult; age; aged; angular gyrus; Article; brain cortex; brain function; cognition; cognitive aging; controlled study; correlational study; cortical folding; default mode network; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; imaging software; left hemisphere; major clinical study; male; medial prefrontal cortex; nervous system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; posterior cingulate; precuneus; priority journal; right hemisphere; selective attention; semantic verbal fluency; spatial memory; verbal communication; visual memory; working memory; aging; anatomy and histology; brain cortex; cingulate gyrus; cognition; middle aged; neuropsychological test; parietal lobe; physiology; prefrontal cortex; psychology; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cerebral Cortex; Cognition; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Parietal Lobe; Prefrontal Cortex",2-s2.0-84960076310

Pattern recognition methods, applied to dementia diagnosis, improve either the feature extraction or the classifier stage. Particularly, deep learning machines have raised attention to clinical applications since they work in both stages to enhance the system performance. However, the architecture of these machines is highly complex, making hard their training procedures. In this work, we propose a deep supervised feature extraction approach using General Stochastic Networks through a supervised layerwise non-linear mapping learning. To this end, we maximize the centered kernel alignment function, which accounts for the provided discriminative information regarding the projection of each layer of the network. Our proposal improves the classifier performance by highlighting the class discrimination during the training stage. Besides, we provide a nonlinear relevance measure assessing the contribution of the input feature set to build each latent space which is related to the clinical knowledge. Comparison against other automated diagnosis approaches using different features and classification machines is presented for multi-class and bi-class scenarios on the widely-known ADNI database.

The use of geometry in the description of nature, beginning with the Platonic solids, has gone a long way up to modern string theory. It seems, it is no accident that geometry has always been a reliable tool for modeling complex phenomena. The aim of the article is to find such universal geometric images, which would allow to visually illustrate the well-known techniques of the theory of solving inventive problems. Materials and Methods. Based on the principle of minimum complexity, a combination of four identical figures is obtained as the basis for the method of creating geometric images. And by way of an elementary figure is chosen such a simple geometric object which contains asymmetry and curvature as a minimum of requirements for it as an elementary object. This choice of combination allowed to cover practically all methods of solving problems. The article provides examples the following techniques: the principles of subdivision, asymmetry, unification, taking, spheroidality, and local quality. Results. Heuristic methods of the Theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ), being supplemented and developed around the world, need a compact representation. The inventive experience of human beings has led to the fact that geometric shapes have become the most effective cognitive tools of practice. The article proposes a methodology of constructing visual images for TRIZ methods, which is illustrated by several examples. To assess the power of geometric images in solving complex problems in various areas of creative activity, examples are given from the field of mechanics and architecture. An example of the use of a chain line for the design of temple vaults is based on the same fundamental principle of a minimum of the functional (potential energy) as an effective use of the same principle with respect to kinetic energy in solving the problem of describing a turbulent flow where the geometrically formed images are organized circles. Conclusions. It is concluded that the correlation of appropriate geometric images at the very beginning of the scientific investigation seems to be underestimated when constructing effective mathematical models. © 2011-2017 NSPU Bulletin.","Cognitive semiotics; Geometric images; Modeling; Signs; Technical creativity; TRIZ methods; Turbulence; Visualization",,2-s2.0-85028747874

According to this architecture, language comprehension completely proceeds in a bottom-up fashion only driven by linear linguistic input thereby leaving no room for a predictive component which allows to make expectations about upcoming words. This is in stark contrast to neuro- physiological research in the past decades on online semantic processing which has provided ample evidence that prediction plays indeed an indispensable role in language comprehension (the brain as a prediction machine, [Ber10]). In this article, we present an extension of formal semantic theory that allows to make predictions of upcoming words. The basic intuition is: predictions are based on incomplete information. Drawing (defeasible) conclusions based on such information can be modeled by default reasoning.

Thus, understanding human cognition is closely related to understanding how the perceptible objects are classified in human mind. The perceptible objects include both physical and virtual experiences and thoughts, and it is important and necessary to analyze the types and the effective levels of those objects. With the emergence of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies in cultural heritage field, it is necessary to understand how and why different cognitive media such as real or visual reality including VR, are differently recognized by people. This study suggests the philosophical and theoretical frame for the usage of phenomenological classfication and analysis. By using this new classification with the case of Korean built heritage, the role of VR is explained in cultural discourse of the community. © UPV, SEAV, 2015.","3D reconstruction; Cultural heritage; Digital archaeology; Phenomenology; Virtual architecture; Virtual reality",,2-s2.0-85025097143

ACT-R currently serves as the most precise expression of the moment-by-moment working memory retrievals that support sentence comprehension. The ACT-R model of sentence comprehension is able to capture a range of linguistic phenomena, but there are cases where the model makes the wrong predictions, such as the over-prediction of retrieval interference effects during sentence comprehension. Here, we investigate one such case involving the processing of sentences with negative polarity items (NPIs) and consider how a dynamically structured holographic memory system might provide a cognitively plausible and principled explanation of some previously unexplained effects. Specifically, we show that by replacing ACT-R's declarative memory with a dynamically structured memory, we can explain a wider range of behavioral data involving reading times and judgments of grammaticality. We show that our integrated model provides a better fit to human error rates and response latencies than the original ACT-R model. These results provide proof-of-concept for the unification of two independent computational cognitive frameworks.

After a semi-formal description of Turing machines, I briefly present the mathematical meaning of Turing’s 1936 paper, showing that the soundness of Turing’s solution to the Entscheidungsproblem ultimately lies on some cognitive considerations, namely, the intuitive correctness of his analysis of the notion of effective procedure. Then, I discuss the historical and philosophical reasons that led to the widely accepted classic-computational interpretation of the Turing machine. Following Andrew Wells, I argue that this interpretation is wrong, because it treats the tape of a Turing machine as its internal memory, rather than as the external environment.

Here we investigated the shared genetic architecture between SCZ and educational attainment, which is regarded as a ""proxy phenotype"" for cognitive abilities, but may also reflect other traits. We applied a conditional false discovery rate (condFDR) method to GWAS of SCZ (n = 82 315), college completion (""College,"" n = 95 427), and years of education (""EduYears,"" n = 101 069). Variants associated with College or EduYears showed enrichment of association with SCZ, demonstrating polygenic overlap. This was confirmed by an increased replication rate in SCZ. By applying a condFDR threshold <0.01, we identified 18 genomic loci associated with SCZ after conditioning on College and 15 loci associated with SCZ after conditioning on EduYears. Ten of these loci overlapped. Using conjunctional FDR, we identified 10 loci shared between SCZ and College, and 29 loci shared between SCZ and EduYears. The majority of these loci had effects in opposite directions. Our results provide evidence for polygenic overlap between SCZ and educational attainment, and identify novel pleiotropic loci.

In the case of telework, most employees express willingness to telework, yet, few firms formally enable it during regular business hours. The status quo is a daily commute to the traditional workplace. The purpose of this paper is to test framing interventions designed to harness cognitive biases through choice architecture. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon behavioral strategy and prospect theory, this paper presents two studies: quasi-experiments with 146 senior business students and experiments in the field (replication using random assignment and extension) with 84 senior decision makers. Both studies use a one-way between-subjects design and chi-square analysis. Findings: Findings support the proposition that, although cognitive biases can act as barriers to transformation, they can be re-framed through strategic interventions. Specifically, in both studies, there was a drastic increase in adoption simply by changing the way the choice was presented. Findings in the lab were cross-validated in the field. Observed shifts in preferences provide evidence that embedding the right reference point within communications can frame a decision choice more favorably. Findings also support that a bias for an implicitly perceived status quo can be overruled through an explicitly stated reference point. Research limitations/implications: It is an assumption of behavioral strategy that most individuals simply respond to the gains/loss framing without being influenced by other psychological or contextual factors, and though these effects dissipate through aggregation, it is a limitation nonetheless. Indeed, using an individual construct to explain an organizational phenomenon is a well-debated topic in the field of strategy, with proponents on both sides. The distinguishing factor, here, is that behavioral strategists are only interested in results at the aggregated level. Practical implications: Practitioners attempting to roll out telework adoption, or any transformation, now have proven strategies for designing frames of reference that intervene against and harness the power of loss aversion and the status quo. Social implications: This paper measures micro processes that have an effect at the macro level. It explains systematic aversion to adoption as an aggregation of decision-making behavior that is seemingly subconscious. In doing so, it highlights the impact of bounded rationality perpetuated through social systems, while measuring effective interventions designed to make systematic behavior more predictable. Originality/value: A novel contribution is made in designing/testing a new frame for systematic resistance to change that frames the status quo as the losing prospect. In this frame, the perceived loss is in the choice not to change, and loss aversion proves to be an effective tool for facilitating systematic change. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioural strategy; Framing; Resistance to change; Status quo bias",,2-s2.0-85027071856

The time of its origin during the course of human evolution remains unclear. Here we investigate several markers of early human evolution and their relationship to the genetic risk of schizophrenia. We tested the schizophrenia evolutionary hypothesis by analyzing genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia and other human phenotypes in a statistical framework suited for polygenic architectures. We analyzed evolutionary proxy measures: human accelerated regions, segmental duplications, and ohnologs, representing various time periods of human evolution for overlap with the human genomic loci associated with schizophrenia. Polygenic enrichment plots suggest a higher prevalence of schizophrenia associations in human accelerated regions, segmental duplications and ohnologs. However, the enrichment is mostly accounted for by linkage disequilibrium, especially with functional elements like introns and untranslated regions. Our results did not provide clear evidence that markers of early human evolution are more likely associated with schizophrenia. While SNPs associated with schizophrenia are enriched in HAR, Ohno and SD regions, the enrichment seems to be mediated by affiliation to known genomic enrichment categories. Taken together with previous results, these findings suggest that schizophrenia risk may have mainly developed more recently in human evolution. © 2017 Srinivasan et al.

Still, the identification of functional units in the brain based on intrinsic functional connectivity and its dynamic variations between and within subjects remains challenging. Recently, the bootstrap analysis of stable clusters (BASC) framework was developed to quantify the stability of functional brain networks both across and within subjects. This multi-level approach utilizes bootstrap resampling for both individual and group-level clustering to delineate functional units based on their consistency across and within subjects, while providing a measure of their stability. Here, we optimized the BASC framework for functional parcellation of the basal ganglia by investigating a variety of clustering algorithms and similarity measures. Reproducibility and test-retest reliability were computed to validate this analytic framework as a tool to describe inter-individual differences in the stability of functional networks. The functional parcellation revealed by stable clusters replicated previous divisions found in the basal ganglia based on intrinsic functional connectivity. While we found moderate to high reproducibility, test-retest reliability was high at the boundaries of the functional units as well as within their cores. This is interesting because the boundaries between functional networks have been shown to explain most individual phenotypic variability. The current study provides evidence for the consistency of the parcellation of the basal ganglia, and provides the first group level parcellation built from individual-level cluster solutions. These novel results demonstrate the utility of BASC for quantifying inter-individual differences in the functional organization of brain regions, and encourage usage in future studies. © 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85029560892

This stands in contrast to asymmetrical voice systems, which exhibit unmarked and marked voices (e.g. active and passive in German). This article investigates the psycholinguistic processing consequences of the potential (a)symmetries in the voice systems of Tagalog and German by analyzing changes in cognitive load during sentence production. Tagalog and German native speakers’ pupil diameters were recorded while they produced sentences with different voice markings. Growth-curve analyses of the shape of taskevoked pupillary responses revealed that processing-load changes were similar for different voices in the symmetrical voice system of Tagalog. By contrast, actives and passives in the asymmetrical voice system of German exhibited different patterns of processing-load changes during sentence production. This is interpreted as supporting the notion of (relative) symmetry in the Tagalog voice system. Mental effort during sentence planning changes in different ways in the two languages because the grammatical architecture of their voice systems is different. Additionally, an anti-Patient bias in sentence production was found: linking patients to the subject function seems to be associated with greater cognitive effort.

Most AD cases are sporadic where age represents the greatest risk factor. Lack of understanding of the disease mechanism hinders the development of efficacious therapeutic approaches. The loss of synapses in the affected brain regions correlates best with cognitive impairment in AD patients and has been considered as the early mechanism that precedes neuronal loss. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a contributing factor in aging and in the progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with age- and disease-dependent loss of mitochondrial function, altered metal homeostasis, and reduced antioxidant defense directly affect synaptic activity and neurotransmission in neurons leading to cognitive dysfunction. In addition, molecular targets affected by ROS include nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, lipids, proteins, calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics and function, cellular architecture, receptor trafficking and endocytosis, and energy homeostasis. Abnormal cellular metabolism in turn could affect the production and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, which independently could exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle. While mounting evidence implicates ROS in the AD etiology, clinical trials with antioxidant therapies have not produced consistent results. In this review, we will discuss the role of oxidative stress in synaptic dysfunction in AD, innovative therapeutic strategies evolved based on a better understanding of the complexity of molecular mechanisms of AD, and the dual role ROS play in health and disease. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

The system applies Knowledge Space Theory to implement the knowledge representation in the domain and student modules and Fuzzy Logic to implement a new knowledge tracing algorithm, which is used to track student’s pedagogical and affective states. The Intelligent Learning Environment was implemented with two main components: an affective and intelligent tutoring system for elementary mathematics and an educational social network. The tutoring system generates math exercises by using a fuzzy system that is fed with cognitive and effective values. Emotion recognition was implemented by two methods: one for feature extraction of the face and one for feature classification using back-propagation neural networks. In addition to recognizing the emotional state of the user, our system gives emotional support through a pedagogical agent. Furthermore, an architecture of software is presented where the emotion recognizer collaborates with the affective and intelligent tutoring system inside a social network.

This architecture is a uniﬁed and consistent system with functional parts of sensory encoding, learning and decoding. This system is the ﬁrst attempt that helps to reveal the systematic neural mechanisms considering both the upstream and the downstream neurons together. The whole system is consistently combined in a temporal framework, where the precise timing of spikes is considered for information processing and cognitive computing. Experimental results show that our system can properly perform the sequence recognition task with the integration of all three functional parts. The recognition scheme is robust to noisy sensory inputs and it is also invariant to changes in the intervals between input stimuli within a certain range. The classiﬁcation ability of the temporal learning rule used in our system is investigated through two benchmark tasks including an XOR task and an optical character recognition (OCR) task. Our temporal learning rule outperforms other two benchmark rules that are widely used for classiﬁcation.

It embodies the notion of representing and understanding all connections within the brain as a network, while the subdivision of the brain into interacting functional units is inherent in its architecture. As a result, the definition of network nodes is one of the most critical steps in connectivity network analysis. Although brain atlases obtained from cytoarchitecture or anatomy have long been used for this task, connectivity-driven methods have arisen only recently, aiming to delineate more homogeneous and functionally coherent regions. This study provides a systematic comparison between anatomical, connectivity-driven and random parcellation methods proposed in the thriving field of brain parcellation. Using resting-state functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project and a plethora of quantitative evaluation techniques investigated in the literature, we evaluate 10 subject-level and 24 groupwise parcellation methods at different resolutions. We assess the accuracy of parcellations from four different aspects: (1) reproducibility across different acquisitions and groups, (2) fidelity to the underlying connectivity data, (3) agreement with fMRI task activation, myelin maps, and cytoarchitectural areas, and (4) network analysis. This extensive evaluation of different parcellations generated at the subject and group level highlights the strengths and shortcomings of the various methods and aims to provide a guideline for the choice of parcellation technique and resolution according to the task at hand.

STT-MTJs are nevertheless usually not considered as memristors as they feature only two stable memory states. Their specific stochastic behavior, however, can be particularly interesting for synaptic applications and can allow us reinterpreting STT-MTJs as “stochastic memristive devices.” In this chapter, we introduce basic concepts relating to STT-MTJs behavior and their possible use to implement learning-capable synapses. Using system-level simulations of an example of neuroinspired architecture, we highlight the potential of this technology for learning systems.

Because it was initially based on indirect evidence and findings in patients with established schizophrenia, it was unclear what role dopamine played in the onset of the disorder. However, recent studies in people at risk of schizophrenia have found elevated striatal dopamine synthesis capacity and increased dopamine release to stress. Furthermore, striatal dopamine changes have been linked to altered cortical function during cognitive tasks, in line with preclinical evidence that a circuit involving cortical projections to the striatum and midbrain may underlie the striatal dopamine changes. Other studies have shown that a number of environmental risk factors for schizophrenia, such as social isolation and childhood trauma, also affect presynaptic dopaminergic function. Advances in preclinical work and genetics have begun to unravel the molecular architecture linking dopamine, psychosis, and psychosocial stress. Included among the many genes associated with risk of schizophrenia are the gene encoding the dopamine D2 receptor and those involved in the upstream regulation of dopaminergic synthesis, through glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic pathways.

The organizational and structural specificity of integrating gender components was identified and their relational impact on the level of organizational maturity of project management of companies was highlighted. The conceptual model of integrating gender components in the architecture of the organizational capacity of companies was offered in the context of the mission, strategic planning; structure and management style; adaptability; partnership and cooperation; role in the sector; provision of services; financial viability and resource mobilization. Gender maturity assessment model was developed on the platform of the project management maturity model (PMMM). The need to use gender mainstreaming technology to improve organizational maturity, including at the level of ""benchmarking"" is emphasized. The gender maturity assessment model of organizational processes was developed as a result of integration of two dimensions: organizational capacity (seven system blocks) and gender sensitivity (five principles) of companies. It is noted that the responsibility for centralized coordination of integration of gender mainstreaming in the project and program management is assigned to Gender-responsible Project Management Office (G-PMO). Cognitive causal model of gender maturity of the project and program management system was proposed based on the principles of gender equality and maturity model of project management. The stages of gender maturity of the project management system were outlined: (""knowledge of gender terminology"", ""mastering specific techniques and tools by the project team"", ""gender mainstreaming technologies integration into a single project and program management system"", ""gender mainstreaming technologies benchmarking"", ""achieving more gender-sensitive values of projects and programs"".

The goal in this paper is to automate DDE. We briefly present DDE, and use a firstorder modal logic, the deontic cognitive event calculus, as our framework to formalize the doctrine. We present formalizations of increasingly stronger versions of the principle, including what is known as the doctrine of triple effect. We then use our framework to successfully simulate scenarios that have been used to test for the presence of the principle in human subjects. Our framework can be used in two different modes: One can use it to build DDE-compliant autonomous systems from scratch; or one can use it to verify that a given AI system is DDE-compliant, by applying a DDE layer on an existing system or model. For the latter mode, the underlying AI system can be built using any architecture (planners, deep neural networks, bayesian networks, knowledge-representation systems, or a hybrid); as long as the system exposes a few parameters in its model, such verification is possible. The role of the DDE layer here is akin to a (dynamic or static) software verifier that examines existing software modules. Finally, we end by sketching initial work on how one can apply our DDE layer to the STRIPS-style planning model, and to a modified POMDP model. This is preliminary work to illustrate the feasibility of the second mode, and we hope that our initial sketches can be useful for other researchers in incorporating DDE in their own frameworks.",,"Artificial intelligence; Calculations; Deep neural networks; Knowledge representation; Logic programming; Autonomous systems; Double effects; Ethical principles; Existing systems; Human subjects; Planning models; Positive and negative effect; Software modules; Bayesian networks",2-s2.0-85031928517

Most researchers approach this complexity by analysing context-dependency in seed dispersal and investigating extrinsic factors that might influence interactions between plants and seed dispersers. Intrinsic traits of seed dispersers provide an alternative way of making sense of the enormous variation in seed fates. I review causes of intraspecific variability in frugivorous and granivorous animals, discuss their effects on seed dispersal, and outline likely consequences for plant populations and communities. Sources of individual variation in seed-dispersing animals include sexual dimorphism, changes associated with growth and ageing, individual specialization, and animal personalities. Sexual dimorphism of seed-dispersing animals influences seed fate through diverse mechanisms that range from effects caused by sex-specific differences in body size, to influences of male versus female cognitive functions. These differences affect the type of seed treatment (e.g. dispersal versus predation), the number of dispersed seeds, distance of seed dispersal, and likelihood that seeds are left in favourable sites for seeds or seedlings. The best-documented consequences of individual differences associated with growth and ageing involve quantity of dispersed seeds and the quality of seed treatment in the mouth and gut. Individual specialization on different resources affects the number of dispersed plant species, and therefore the connectivity and architecture of seed-dispersal networks. Animal personalities might play an important role in shaping interactions between plants and dispersers of their seeds, yet their potential in this regard remains overlooked. In general, intraspecific variation in seed-dispersing animals often influences plants through effects of these individual differences on the movement ecology of the dispersers. Two conditions are necessary for individual variation to exert a strong influence on seed dispersal. First, the individual differences in traits should translate into differences in crucial characteristics of seed dispersal. Second, individual variation is more likely to be important when the proportions of particular types of individuals fluctuate strongly in a population or vary across space; when proportions are static, it is less likely that intraspecific differences will be responsible for changes in the dynamics and outcomes of plant-animal interactions. In conclusion, focusing on variation among foraging animals rather than on species averages might bring new, mechanistic insights to the phenomenon of seed dispersal. While this shift in perspective is unlikely to replace the traditional approach (based on the assumption that all important variation occurs among species), it provides a complementary alternative to decipher the enormous variation observed in animal-mediated seed dispersal. © 2017 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","Behavioural syndromes; Conditional mutualism; Ecology of individuals; Endozoochory; Frugivory; Granivory; Individual specialization; Scatterhoarding; Seed-dispersal effectiveness",,2-s2.0-85031127779

The resulting ecosystem in many ways resembles the human immune ecosystem. However, the cybersecurity community lacks insights into the stability, controllability and observability of the ecosystem, as well as being able to dynamically protect it so that it is immune to unknown vulnerabilities. Today's approach relies on security experts to identify new flaws, threats and remediate these issues by hand. This process takes time and provides advantage for malicious users to breach and compromise critical systems. Hence, this re-active and slow reaction cycle has created a permanent offensive advantage. CyberMix seeks to automate this cyber defence process, by fielding a system that discover, prove and fix threats and flaws in real-time with or without any assistance. The paper proposed CyberMix, an architecture that will provide an immune cybersecurity ecosystem by utilising two main principles: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and an immune agent based on how the Human Immune System (HIS) works against unknown viruses and disease like the Zika disease. This will be complemented by a dynamic automated cause of action (ACoA), allowing human input to enhance threat signature detection leading to a more secure ecosystem. The cyber research community especially lacks insight into networks that are very large and complex multi-genre in nature. It can also be stated that little is understood about the impact of social-cognitive links and informationelement links on the overall network complexity and the various elements that make-up the complex network. Hence, it is of paramount importance to have a solution that enables dynamic, on-demand segmentation of a potentially unstable network into subnets with limited and strictly controlled connectivity between subnets. To facilitate these new and future challenges, there is a need for a system that is self-evolving with the capabilities of the HIS, along with means to predict systems security properties and create self-signatures from known and unknown patterns and behaviours within individual network element within the ecosystem. The paper investigates and identifies suitable methods for creating self-learning/organisation/healing rules that lead to the desired emergent properties.","Agent based defence; Cybersecurity; Device security; Immune systems; Software define network","Complex networks; Computer crime; Ecology; Ecosystems; Immune system; Software agents; Viruses; Agent based; Controllability and observabilities; Cyber security; Device security; Human immune system (HIS); Networked components; Potentially unstable; Software defined networking (SDN); Network security",2-s2.0-85018946854

However, little is known about alterations of the nodal and edge efficiency in abnormal systems of MDD patients. We used two independent datasets and two different structural templates to investigate the alterations of the nodal and edge efficiency of whole-brain functional networks of MDD. Method: Forty-two MDD and forty-two age, education-matched controls were selected to investigate network efficiency abnormalities of the MDD patients' cortical and subcortical regions, as well as the disrupted functional connectivity between these regions, from the perspective of network topological architectures. In addition, another dataset, which included thirty MDD patients and thirty controls, was also investigated using the same method. Results: Results showed that MDD group demonstrated significant increase in the local efficiency, although not change of global efficiency. In addition, nodal efficiency was found to increase in affective processing regions (i.e., amygdale, thalamus, hippocampus), but decrease in cognitive control related regions, which included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. The edge efficiency was found to increase, involving both connectivity between thalamus and limbic system regions and connectivity between hippocampus and regions (i.e., amygdala, thalamus). More important, result was replicated within independent datasets for the first and different structural templates for another. Conclusions: Our results indicated that MDD was associated with disrupted functional connectivity networks between cognitive control and affective processing systems.

Communication systems built on the basis of the architecture of software-configurable radio with cognitive radio algorithms have good perspectives, especially in the age of 5G- systems development. However, the signals that are used in modern radio systems (the signals from the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing Ortogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM)) have a number of significant disadvantages, one of which is the high level of side lobes of certain subcarriers that does not allow to provide potential spectral efficiency of high-speed radio access systems. This article describes new method of signals formation which is based on application of the new baseline signal shaping functions, the main feature of which is the ability for adaptive change of the level of energy localization in frequency and time area of basis vector. The use of the given basis allows not only to generate signals with a low level of lateral lobes in a group signal spectrum, but also with the changing structure of the spectrum, which can adaptively adjust to the existing electromagnetic environment in the channel, thus formed, while the process of adaptation in empty areas of spectrum, there is low enough level of interference noise that cannot be achieved using signals with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing.

Approaches based on cognitive radio are also proposed since this allows tremendous increase in communication capacity and spectral efficiency. This requires high computational capability in airborne vehicles that can perform the complex filtering and masking, along with tasks associated with cognitive radio systems like spectrum sensing and baseband adaptation, while consuming very less power.

We tested three strategies based on predicted patterns of response times and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses: one strategy that relies solely on recognition memory, a second that retrieves additional knowledge, and a third, lexicographic (i.e., sequential) strategy, that considers knowledge conditionally on the evidence obtained from recognition memory. We implemented the strategies as computational models within the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture, which allowed us to derive behavioral and neural predictions that we then compared to the results of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which participants inferred which of two cities is larger. Overall, versions of the lexicographic strategy, according to which knowledge about many but not all alternatives is searched, provided the best account of the joint patterns of response times and BOLD responses.

The ability of HetNets to support high capacity makes it a significant driver for the success of 4G and indispensable in 5G. Small cells equipped with cognitive radio (CR) techniques could improve spectrum utilization by opportunistic spectrum access and intelligent interference mitigation. In this article, we propose an RF-CoHetNet, a novel heterogeneous cellular network system where small cells possess CR capabilities and are wirelessly powered by electromagnetic RF-energy. Under this system architecture, both energy efficiency and spectral efficiency can be achieved by properly switching small cells to harvesting mode or allocating channels/power to serve their users. We show that RF-energy harvesting can provide a promising solution to further improve the energy efficiency of the whole system. Through RF-energy harvesting, the unavoidable interference turns out to be a useful energy resource to support partial power consumption in the small cell. We further propose a heuristic algorithm to minimize the total system energy consumption under the system capacity constraint.

We advance an alternative hypothesis – consciousness is the hallmark of a fundamental way to organise causal interactions between an agent and its environment. Thus consciousness is not a special property or an addition to the cognitive processes, but rather the way in which the causal structure of the body of the agent is causally entangled with a world of physical causes. The advantage of this hypothesis is that it suggests how to exploit causal coupling to envisage tentative guidelines for designing conscious artificial agents. In this paper, we outline the key characteristics of these causal building blocks and then a set of standard technologies that may take advantage of such an approach. Consciousness is modelled as a kind of cognitive middle ground and experience is not an internal by-product of cognitive processes but the external world that is carved out by means of causal interaction.

We consider a practical scenario where secondary users (SUs) are able to access the idle spectrum by secondary user routers (SU_Rs). Managed by a fusion center (FC), SU_Rs can work together to capture the idle spectrum, and then assign to the SUs. Besides, it is imperative to guarantee the wireless communication quality between primary base station (P_BS) and SU_Rs. Therefore, a new cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) algorithm is suggested to recursively estimate the channel state information (CSI) while capturing the idle licensed band. The united mathematics model relies on a dynamic state-space model (DSM) and a Bernoulli filters (BF) algorithm. TVFF channels are modeled as finite-state Markov channel (FSMC). In order to reduce complexity of CSS, the particles are manipulated and reconstructed. Experimental simulations demonstrate that, by exploiting dynamic CSI, sensing performance of the new CSS algorithm will surpass the traditional schemes and this new architecture can be used in a realistic spectrum sharing system. © 2016, Nan et al.","Bernoulli filters; Cognitive radio network; Cooperative spectrum sharing; Dynamic state-space model; Time-variant flat fading","Channel state information; Complex networks; Fading (radio); Memory architecture; Network architecture; Radio; Radio systems; State space methods; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bernoulli filters; Cognitive radio network; Cooperative spectrum sharing; Flat fading; State - space models; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84961257340

Language is treated as a mental phenomenon and a cognitive faculty (in contrast to approaches that define language as a primarily social phenomenon). The analysis of language activity is based on the Chalmers' (1996) distinction between the two forms of consciousness: phenomenal (simply ""consciousness"") and psychological (""awareness""). The approach is seen as an alternative to phenomenological analyses typical for cognitive semiotics. Further, a cognitive model of the language faculty is described. The model is implemented in SNePS/GLAIR architecture and based on GATN grammar and semantic networks as a representation formalism. The model - reflecting traditionally distinguished linguistic structures (Jackendoff 2002:198) - consists of phonological, syntactic, and semantic modules.

The most popular way to represent common-sense knowledge is in the form of a semantic graph. Such type of knowledge, however, is known to be rather extensive: the more concepts added in the graph, the harder and slower it becomes to apply standard graph mining techniques. Methods: In this work, we propose a new fast subgraph matching approach to overcome these issues. Subgraph matching is the task of finding all matches of a query graph in a large data graph, which is known to be a non-deterministic polynomial time-complete problem. Many algorithms have been previously proposed to solve this problem using central processing units. Here, we present a new graphics processing unit-friendly method for common-sense subgraph matching, termed GpSense, which is designed for scalable massively parallel architectures, to enable next-generation Big Data sentiment analysis and natural language processing applications.

In an integrated network consisting of multiple heterogeneous CRNs, SUs with multiple interfaces may have to conduct inter-system or intra-system spectrum handoff due to the arrival of PUs or performance degradation on serving spectrum. In this case, designing an optimal spectrum handoff scheme which offers quality of service (QoS) guarantee and performance enhancement of the SUs is of particular importance. On the other hand, resource allocation strategy on target channel also plays an important role in affecting the transmission performance of handoff SUs. In this paper, we jointly design spectrum handoff and resource allocation strategy for handoff SUs in heterogeneously integrated CRNs. To achieve joint resource management among various CRNs, we propose a joint radio resource management architecture, based on which the proposed spectrum handoff and resource allocation scheme can be conducted. Jointly considering the transmission performance of the handoff SUs, we formulate the total energy efficiency of the SUs and design an optimization problem which maximizes the energy efficiency subject to spectrum handoff, QoS, and power constraints of the SUs. An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated nonlinear fractional optimization problem. Within each iteration, the optimization problem is transformed equivalently into two subproblems, i.e., power allocation subproblem of each SU-spectrum pair and spectrum handoff subproblem for all the SUs. The two subproblems are solved, respectively, through applying Lagrange dual method and the Kuhn-Munkres (K-M) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2016, The Author(s).","Cognitive radio networks; Energy efficiency; Kuhn-Munkres algorithm; Resource allocation; Spectrum handoff","Algorithms; Cognitive radio; Iterative methods; Natural resources management; Optimization; Quality of service; Radio; Resource allocation; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio networks (CRNs); Joint radio resource managements; Quality of service (QoS) guarantees; Resource allocation algorithms; Resource allocation schemes; Resource allocation strategies; Spectrum handoffs; Energy efficiency",2-s2.0-84986325838

Several aspects of human cognition are critical to instructional design. First, the theory assumes we have not specifically evolved to learn the topics taught in educational and training institutions. Second, these topics require learners to acquire domain-specific rather than generic–cognitive knowledge. Third, while generic–cognitive knowledge does not require explicit instruction because we have evolved to acquire it, domain-specific concepts and skills do require explicit instruction. These factors interact with the capacity and duration constraints of working memory to delineate a cognitive architecture relevant to instructional design. The working memory limits do not apply to biologically primary, generic–cognitive knowledge acquired without explicit instruction but do apply to biologically secondary, domain-specific knowledge that requires explicit instruction. Accordingly, cognitive load theory has been developed to provide techniques that reduce unnecessary working memory load when dealing with explicitly taught, biologically secondary, domain-specific knowledge. © 2015 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition","Cognitive load theory; Instructional design; Relations between working and long-term memory",,2-s2.0-84952334108

The next 5G mobile generation, based essentially on the heterogeneous network architecture—a macro tier overlayed with unplanned small cell tiers—is defined as a promising solution to meet those needs. Despite the considerable increase in data rates through the small cell concept and the shared spectrum access, the most crucial challenge is the interference management issue. To overcome this limitation and establish an economical and ecological design, the need for new spectrum management concepts is triggered. Unlike the classical cell association scheme, which requires cell tier cooperations, the contribution of this paper is to conceive an efficient cell association scheme in a non coordination 5G heterogeneous network architecture, based on a novel dynamic spectrum access (DSA) approach. The suggested DSA is based on the dynamic common cognitive monitor channel—with a cognitive monitor strategy using the maximum holding time distribution—and the highest signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio–based cell association. The coverage probability and the throughput for a typical user in a two-tier heterogeneous network (macro and small cell tiers) as well as the analytical expression of the energy efficiency are derived and analyzed using a stochastic geometry system model.

However, it is unclear whether these findings reflect the state of major depression or reflect trait neurobiological underpinnings of risk for major depression. Methods We compared resting-state functional connectivity, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, between unaffected children of parents who had documented histories of major depression (at-risk, n = 27; 8–14 years of age) and age-matched children of parents with no lifetime history of depression (control subjects, n = 16). Results At-risk children exhibited hyperconnectivity between the default mode network and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/orbital frontal cortex, and the magnitude of connectivity positively correlated with individual symptom scores. At-risk children also exhibited 1) hypoconnectivity within the cognitive control network, which also lacked the typical anticorrelation with the default mode network; 2) hypoconnectivity between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex; and 3) hyperconnectivity between the right amygdala and right inferior frontal gyrus, a key region for top-down modulation of emotion. Classification between at-risk children and control subjects based on resting-state connectivity yielded high accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity that was superior to clinical rating scales. Conclusions Children at familial risk for depression exhibited atypical functional connectivity in the default mode, cognitive control, and affective networks.

Reliable spectrum sensing is the premise for opportunistic access to sensor nodes.

Given the limitations of the widely-used adaptive interference cancellation (AIC) algorithm, this paper develops several details to avoid these limitations and form a new mitigation architecture to alleviate nonlinear distortions. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, verification tests for both simulations and actual RF front-end measurements are presented and discussed.

Handedness is generally considered to be an evolutionary byproduct of selection for manual dexterity and augmented visuo-cognitive capabilities within the context of complex stone tool manufacture/use. Testing this hypothesis requires an understanding of when appreciable levels of right dominant behavior entered the fossil record. Because bone remodels in vivo, skeletal asymmetries are thought to reflect greater mechanical loading on the dominant side, but incomplete preservation of external morphology and ambiguities about past loading environments complicate interpretations. We test if internal trabecular bone is capable of providing additional information by analyzing the thumb of Homo sapiens and Pan. Materials and methods: We assess trabecular structure at the distal head and proximal base of paired (left/right) first metacarpals using micro-CT scans of Homo sapiens (n = 14) and Pan (n = 9). Throughout each epiphysis we quantify average and local bone volume fraction (BV/TV), degree of anisotropy (DA), and elastic modulus (E) to address bone volume patterning and directional asymmetry. Results: We find a right directional asymmetry in H. sapiens consistent with population-level handedness, but also report a left directional asymmetry in Pan that may be the result of postural and/or locomotor loading.

Young adult female Wistar rats were subjected to either sham operation or ovariectomy. Ovariectomized animals were treated chronically with escitalopram (10 mg/kg/day, i.p) alone or with four doses of 17β-estradiol (40 μg/kg, s.c) given prior to the behavioral tests. Co-administration of 17β-estradiol improved escitalopram-induced antidepressant effect in forced swimming test verified as more prominent decrease in the immobility time without opposing its memory enhancing effect in Morris water maze. 17β-estradiol augmented the modulatory effects of escitalopram on the hippocampal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and serotonin reuptake transporter as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha without altering its effects on the gene expressions of serotonin receptor 1A, estrogen receptors alpha and beta, or acetylcholinestearase content. This combined therapy afforded synergistic protective effects on the brain histopathological architecture, particularly, the hippocampus. The antidepressant effect of 17β-estradiol was abolished by pretreatment with estrogen receptor antagonist, tamoxifen (10 mg/kg, p.o).

The proposed heterogeneous network overcomes the problems of sending packets over long paths, island nodes, and interference in WMNs and increases the overall capacity of the combined network by utilizing unlicensed frequency bands instead of buying more license frequency bands for LTE. The work is validated through extensive simulations that indicate that the proposed heterogeneous WMN outperforms the LTE and Wi-Fi networks when used individually.

Recent advances in software technology provide the necessary infrastructure for the development of a robust offering. We have developed a WMS task, built on the latest in multi-platform gaming technology, to act as a blueprint for how future tasks can be developed, tested, and distributed. Our implementation describes some of the fundamental principles necessary for cultivation of a rich ecosystem of health diagnostic and therapeutic software. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Health; Software engineering; Cognitive psychology; Device technologies; Digital interfaces; Fundamental principles; Gaming technology; Multi-platform; Software technology; Working memory; Mobile devices",2-s2.0-85011022919

Many neuroscience studies have explored the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying social conformity. Here we employed a coordinate-based meta-analysis on neuroimaging studies of social conformity with the purpose to reveal the convergence of the underlying neural architecture. We identified a convergence of reported activation foci in regions associated with normative decision-making, including ventral striatum (VS), dorsal posterior medial frontal cortex (dorsal pMFC), and anterior insula (AI). Specifically, consistent deactivation of VS and activation of dorsal pMFC and AI are identified when people's responses deviate from group opinions. In addition, the deviation-related responses in dorsal pMFC predict people's conforming behavioral adjustments. These are consistent with current models that disagreement with others might evoke “error” signals, cognitive imbalance, and/or aversive feelings, which are plausibly detected in these brain regions as control signals to facilitate subsequent conforming behaviors. Finally, group opinions result in altered neural correlates of valuation, manifested as stronger responses of VS to stimuli endorsed than disliked by others. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Activation likelihood estimation; AI (Anterior insula); Dorsal pMFC (dorsal posterior medial frontal cortex); Meta-analysis; Norm violations; Social conformity; Ultimatum game; VS (Ventral striatum)","activation likelihood estimation; adjustment; anterior insula; aversion; brain function; cognitive defect; decision making; evoked response; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; medial frontal cortex; neuropsychology; prediction; priority journal; public opinion; Review; signal detection; social norm; social psychology; statistical analysis; ventral striatum; brain; brain mapping; functional neuroimaging; meta analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; statistical model; Brain; Brain Mapping; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Social Conformity",2-s2.0-84984986897

Numerous studies have assessed changes in functional communities during different states of awareness, learning, information processing, and various behavioral patterns. The robustness of detected communities within a network has been an often-discussed topic in complex systems research. However, our knowledge regarding the intersubject stability of functional communities in the human brain while performing different tasks is still lacking. In this study, we examined the variability of functional communities in weighted undirected graphs based on fMRI recordings of healthy participants across three conditions: the resting state, syllable production as a simple vocal motor task, and meaningful speech production representing a complex behavioral pattern with cognitive involvement. On the basis of the constructed empirical networks, we simulated a large cohort of artificial graphs and performed a leave-one-out stability analysis to assess the sensitivity of communities in the group-averaged networks with respect to perturbations in the averaging cohort. We found that the stability of partitions derived from group-averaged networks depended on task complexity. The determined community architecture in mean networks reflected within-behavior network stability and between-behavior flexibility of the human functional connectome. The sensitivity of functional communities increased from rest to syllable production to speaking, which suggests that the approximation quality of the community structure in the average network to reflect individual per-participant partitions depends on task complexity. © 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"Complex networks; Stability; Approximation quality; Behavioral patterns; Community structures; Functional organization; Network communities; Speech production; Stability analysis; Weighted undirected graph; Network architecture; adult; Article; cohort analysis; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; male; middle aged; nerve cell network; normal human; priority journal; resting state network; speech",2-s2.0-84994165226

Standard neuropsychological methods rely upon face-to-face interactions between a patient and researcher, which creates geographic and logistical barriers that impede research progress and treatment advances. Introduction: To overcome these barriers, we created a flexible and integrated system for the remote acquisition of neuropsychological data (RAND). The system we developed has a secure architecture that permits collaborative videoconferencing. The system supports shared audiovisual feeds that can provide continuous virtual interaction between a participant and researcher throughout a testing session. Shared presentation and computing controls can be used to deliver auditory and visual test items adapted from standard face-to-face materials or execute computer-based assessments. Spoken and manual responses can be acquired, and the components of the session can be recorded for offline data analysis. Materials and Methods: To evaluate its feasibility, our RAND system was used to administer a speech-language test battery to 16 stroke survivors with a variety of communication, sensory, and motor impairments. The sessions were initiated virtually without prior face-to-face instruction in the RAND technology or test battery. Results: Neuropsychological data were successfully acquired from all participants, including those with limited technology experience, and those with a communication, sensory, or motor impairment. Furthermore, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the RAND system and the remote assessment that it permits. Conclusions: The results indicate the feasibility of using the RAND system for virtual home-based neuropsychological assessment without prior face-to-face contact between a participant and researcher. Because our RAND system architecture uses off-the-shelf technology and software, it can be duplicated without specialized expertise or equipment. In sum, our RAND system offers a readily available and promising alternative to face-to-face neuropsychological assessment in stroke research. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.","behavioral health; cardiology/cardiovascular disease; telemedicine; teleneurology; telepsychiatry","Diagnosis; Electric batteries; Integrated control; Patient treatment; Speech communication; Telemedicine; Video conferencing; Behavioral health; Cardiology/cardiovascular disease; Computer-based assessments; Face-to-face instruction; Neuropsychological assessment; Off-the-shelf technologies; teleneurology; Telepsychiatry; Computer architecture",2-s2.0-85002826642

This assumption has been undercut by findings of beat-matching in various species of parrots and, more recently, in a sea lion, several species of primates, and possibly horses. This throws open the question of how widespread beat-matching ability is in the animal kingdom. Here we reassess the arguments and evidence for an absence of beat-matching in animals, and conclude that in fact no convincing case against beat-matching in animals has been made. Instead, such evidence as there is suggests that this capacity could be quite widespread. Furthermore, mutual entrainment of oscillations is a general principle of physical systems, both biological and nonbiological, suggesting that entrainment of motor systems by sensory systems may be a default rather than an oddity. The question then becomes, not why a few privileged species are able to beat-match, but why species do not always do so—why they vary in both spontaneous and learned beat-matching. We propose that when entrainment is not driven by fixed, mandatory connections between input and output (as in the case of, e.g., fireflies entraining to each others’ flashes), it depends on voluntary control over, and voluntary or learned coupling of, sensory and motor systems, which can paradoxically lead to apparent failures of entrainment. Among the factors that affect whether an animal will entrain are sufficient control over the motor behavior to be entrained, sufficient perceptual sophistication to extract the entraining beat from the overall sensory environment, and the current cognitive state of the animal, including attention and motivation. The extent of entrainment in the animal kingdom potentially has widespread implications, not only for understanding the roots of human dance, but also for understanding the neural and cognitive architectures of animals. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Animal cognition; Entrainment",,2-s2.0-84975748653

As some allies may provide greater “leverage” than others during social conflict, the cognitive architecture that supports alliance formation in humans may be shaped by recent experience, for example in light of the outcomes of violent or non-violent forms intrasexual competition. Here we used experimental priming techniques to explore this issue. Consistent with our predictions, while men’s preferences for dominant allies strengthened following losses (compared to victories) in violent intrasexual contests, women’s preferences for dominant allies weakened following losses (compared to victories) in violent intrasexual contests. Our findings suggest that while men may prefer dominant (i.e. masculine) allies following losses in violent confrontation in order to facilitate successful resource competition, women may “tend and befriend” following this scenario and seek support from prosocial (i.e. feminine) allies and/or avoid the potential costs of dominant allies as long-term social partners. Moreover, they demonstrate facultative responses to signals related to dominance in allies, which may shape sex differences in sociality in light of recent experience and suggest that intrasexual selection has shaped social intelligence in humans. Significance statement: Although alliance formation is an important facet of social intelligence in political and biological systems, we know relatively little about the cognitive processes involved in social preferences for allies. As recent experience may alter the leverage provided by different social partners, here we tested whether preferences for facial cues to dominance-prosociality (masculinity-femininity) alter in light of recent experience of violent and economic contests for status. Our findings demonstrate sex-specific responses to these facial cues. While men’s preferences for facial cues related to dominance in allies strengthen following losses (compared to wins) in violent contests, women’s preferences for facial cues related to dominance in allies weaken following losses (compared to wins) in violent contests. These findings suggest that intrasexual selection, in part, has shaped the evolution of social intelligence in humans as revealed in flexibility in social preferences for allies. © 2016, The Author(s).","Alliances; Politics; Sex differences; Social brain hypothesis; Within-sex competition","cognition; contest competition; dominance; facultative behavior; human evolution; intrasexual interaction; politics; preference behavior; resource use; sex-related difference; social conflict; social organization; social theory; violence",2-s2.0-84990847975

Additionally, both similarities and differences between 47,XXY and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been reported in cognition, behavior and neural architecture. To further investigate these brain-behavior pathways, white matter microstructure in boys with 47,XXY was compared to that of boys with ASD. Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (Dr), axial diffusivity (Da), and mean diffusivity (MD) were assessed in 47,XXY (n = 9), ASD (n = 18), and controls (n = 14), using tract-based spatial statistics. Compared with controls, boys with 47,XXY have reduced FA, coupled with reduced Da, in the corpus callosum. Boys with 47,XXY also have reduced Dr. in the left anterior corona radiata and sagittal striatum compared with controls. Compared with boys with ASD, boys with 47,XXY show reduced Da in the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Although this study is preliminary considering the small sample size, reduced white matter integrity in the corpus callosum may be a contributing factor in the cognitive and behavioral problems associated with 47,XXY. In addition, the differences in white matter microstructure between 47,XXY and ASD may be important for our understanding of the mechanisms that are fundamental to behavioral outcome in social dysfunction, and may be targeted through intervention. © 2015, The Author(s).","Autism; Diffusion tensor imaging; Genetics; Klinefelter syndrome; Structural connectivity; White matter","47,XXY syndrome; adolescent; Article; autism; axial diffusivity; child; clinical article; cognition; comparative study; controlled study; corpus callosum; diffusion tensor imaging; exploratory research; female; fractional anisotropy; human; intelligence quotient; male; mean diffusivity; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; occipitofrontal fasciculus; physical parameters; priority journal; radial diffusivity; risk factor; white matter; analysis of variance; autism; diagnostic imaging; genetic predisposition; genetics; intelligence; intelligence test; Klinefelter syndrome; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; psychological rating scale; psychology; white matter; Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Autistic Disorder; Child; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Intelligence; Intelligence Tests; Klinefelter Syndrome; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; White Matter",2-s2.0-84951728096

Methods The current study assessed changes in DMN activation and architecture during the encoding of a functional magnetic resonance imaging task in 39 patients with T2DM and 41 healthy controls which were recruited from local communities in Beijing, China. Results We found that patients with T2DM and intact episodic memory performance exhibited reduced deactivation in the right precuneus and the middle temporal gyrus during the episodic memory task. Furthermore, an anterior-posterior disconnection phenotype and altered topological configuration of the DMN were observed in patients with T2DM using graph-theoretical approaches. Correlation analysis showed that altered deactivation during the episodic memory task was closely related to connectivity dysfunction and topological properties in the DMN.

However, the literature lacks of conclusive data regarding the structural macroscopic connectivity of the frontal CC. In this study, a novel microdissection approach was adopted, to expose the frontal fibers of CC from the dorsum to the lateral cortex in eight hemispheres and in one entire brain. Post-mortem results were then combined with data from advanced constrained spherical deconvolution in 130 healthy subjects. We demonstrated as the frontal CC provides dense inter-hemispheric connections. In particular, we found three types of fronto-callosal fibers, having a dorso-ventral organization. First, the dorso-medial CC fibers subserve homotopic connections between the homologous medial cortices of the superior frontal gyrus. Second, the ventro-lateral CC fibers subserve homotopic connections between lateral frontal cortices, including both the middle frontal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus, as well as heterotopic connections between the medial and lateral frontal cortices. Third, the ventro-striatal CC fibers connect the medial and lateral frontal cortices with the contralateral putamen and caudate nucleus. We also highlighted an intricate crossing of CC fibers with the main association pathways terminating in the lateral regions of the frontal lobes. This combined approach of ex vivo microdissection and in vivo diffusion tractography allowed demonstrating a previously unappreciated three-dimensional architecture of the anterior frontal CC, thus clarifying the functional role of the CC in mediating the inter-hemispheric connectivity.

We challenge this division of labor, by arguing that structural priming provides an implicit method of investigating linguistic representations that should end the current reliance on acceptability judgments. Moreover, structural priming has now reached sufficient methodological maturity to provide substantial evidence about such representations. We argue that evidence from speakers’ tendency to repeat their own and others’ structural choices supports a linguistic architecture involving a single ‘shallow’ level of syntax that is connected to a semantic level containing information about quantification, thematic relations, and information structure, as well as to a phonological level. Many of the linguistic distinctions that are often used to support complex (or multi-level) syntactic structure are instead captured by semantics; however, the syntactic level includes some specification of ‘missing’ elements that are not realized at the phonological level. We also show that structural priming provides evidence about the consistency of representations across languages and about language development. In sum, we propose that structural priming provides a new basis for understanding the nature of language.

This method has proved promising in understanding and investigating the neuronal tracts and structural connectivity between the brain regions in primates as well as rodents. The close evolutionary relationship between canines and humans may have spawned a unique bond in regard to social cognition rendering them useful as an animal model in translational research. In this study, we acquired diffusion data from anaesthetized dogs and created a DTI-based atlas for a canine model which could be used to investigate various white matter diseases. We illustrate the application of this atlas by calculating DTI tractography based structural connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) regions of the default mode network (DMN) in dogs. White matter connectivity was investigated to provide structural basis for the functional dissociation observed between the anterior and posterior parts of DMN. A comparison of the integrity of long range structural connections (such as in the DMN) between dogs and humans is likely to provide us with new perspectives on the neural basis of the evolution of cognitive functions. © The Author(s) 2016.",,,2-s2.0-84997327513

We have shown previously that neuronal S1P accumulation is toxic leading to ER-stress and an increase in intracellular calcium. To clarify the neuronal function of S1P, we generated brain-specific knockout mouse models in which S1P-lyase (SPL), the enzyme responsible for irreversible S1P cleavage was inactivated. Constitutive ablation of SPL in the brain (SPL fl/fl/Nes) but not postnatal neuronal forebrain-restricted SPL deletion (SPL fl/fl/CaMK) caused marked accumulation of S1P. Hence, altered presynaptic architecture including a significant decrease in number and density of synaptic vesicles, decreased expression of several presynaptic proteins, and impaired synaptic short term plasticity were observed in hippocampal neurons from SPL fl/fl/Nes mice. Accordingly, these mice displayed cognitive deficits. At the molecular level, an activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was detected which resulted in a decreased expression of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 and several presynaptic proteins. Upon inhibition of proteasomal activity, USP14 levels, expression of presynaptic proteins and synaptic function were restored.

A random signal is generated and it is modulated either by Binary shift phase keying (BPSK) or Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). The Modulated random signal is added with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and passed through Cyclostationary spectrum detector to check whether it crosses the threshold level to for the presence of primary user. The threshold of a signal is calculated by cyclic cross-periodogram matrix of the corresponding signal to determine the presence of signal or noise. The impediment in evaluating the targeted threshold is prevailed by training an artificial neural network by extracted cyclostationary feature vectors which are obtained by FFT accumulation method.

Despite these commonalities, researchers have also proposed a functional dissociation between the CeA and BNST, with the CeA promoting responses to discrete stimuli and the BNST promoting responses to diffuse threat. Intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) provides a means to investigate the functional architecture of the brain, unbiased by task demands. Using ultra-high field neuroimaging (7-Tesla fMRI), which provides increased spatial resolution, this study compared the iFC networks of the CeA and BNST in 27 healthy individuals. Both structures were coupled with areas of the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray matter. Compared to the BNST, the bilateral CeA was more strongly coupled with the insula and regions that support sensory processing, including thalamus and fusiform gyrus. In contrast, the bilateral BNST was more strongly coupled with regions involved in cognitive and motivational processes, including the dorsal paracingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and striatum.

Proponents of the information-processing approach to cognitive science have long been critical of connectionist or network approaches to (neuro-)cognitive architecture,pointing to the shortcomings of the associative psychology that underlies Hebbian learning as well as to the fact that synapses are practically unfit to implement symbols. Recent work on memory has been adding fuel to the fire and current findings in neuroscience now provide first tentative neurobiological evidence for the cognitive scientists’ doubts about the synapse as the (sole) locus of memory in the brain. This paper briefly considers the history and appeal of synaptic plasticity as a memory mechanism,followed by a summary of the cognitive scientists’ objections regarding these assertions. Next,a variety of tentative neuroscientific evidence that appears to substantiate questioning the idea of the synapse as the locus of memory is presented.

The Theory of Connectivity proposes that the origin of intelligence is rooted in a power-of-two-based permutation logic (N = 2i –1),producing specific-to-general cell-assembly architecture capable of generating specific perceptions and memories,as well as generalized knowledge and flexible actions. We show that this power-of-two-based permutation logic is widely used in cortical and subcortical circuits across animal species and is conserved for the processing of a variety of cognitive modalities including appetitive,emotional and social information. However,modulatory neurons,such as dopaminergic (DA) neurons,use a simpler logic despite their distinct subtypes. Interestingly,this specific-to-general permutation logic remained largely intact although NMDA receptors—the synaptic switch for learning and memory—were deleted throughout adulthood,suggesting that the logic is developmentally pre-configured. Moreover,this computational logic is implemented in the cortex via combining a random-connectivity strategy in superficial layers 2/3 with nonrandom organizations in deep layers 5/6. This randomness of layers 2/3 cliques—which preferentially encode specific and low-combinatorial features and project inter-cortically—is ideal for maximizing cross-modality novel pattern-extraction,pattern-discrimination and pattern-categorization using sparse code,consequently explaining why it requires hippocampal offline-consolidation. In contrast,the nonrandomness in layers 5/6—which consists of few specific cliques but a higher portion of more general cliques projecting mostly to subcortical systems—is ideal for feedback-control of motivation,emotion,consciousness and behaviors. These observations suggest that the brain’s basic computational algorithm is indeed organized by the power-of-two-based permutation logic. This simple mathematical logic can account for brain computation across the entire evolutionary spectrum,ranging from the simplest neural networks to the most complex. © 2016 Xie,Fox,Liu,Lyu,Lee,Kuang,Jacobs,Li,Liu,Song and Tsien.","Appetitive behavior; Cell assembly; Computational algorithms; Computational logic; Cortex; NMDA receptor; Social behavior; Wiring logic","n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; adaptive behavior; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; appetite; Article; brain depth stimulation; consciousness; controlled study; dopaminergic activity; emotionality; evolutionary algorithm; fear; female; functional connectivity; histogram; histology; information processing; male; memory consolidation; motivation; mouse; neuromodulation; nonhuman; social interaction; spike wave",2-s2.0-84996486164

In contrast to existing frameworks for robot ethics, our approach does not rely on the verification of logic statements. Rather, it utilises internal simulations which allow the robot to simulate actions and predict their consequences. Therefore, our method is a form of robotic imagery. To demonstrate the proposed architecture, we implement a version of this architecture on a humanoid NAO robot so that it behaves according to Asimov's laws of robotics. In a series of four experiments, using a second NAO robot as a proxy for the human, we demonstrate that the Ethical Layer enables the robot to prevent the human from coming to harm in simple test scenarios. © 2017 The Authors.","Ethical robots; Machine ethics; Machine Morality; Self-simulation; Simulation theory","Architecture; Cognitive systems; Philosophical aspects; Robotics; Robots; Asimov's Laws; Internal simulations; Logic statements; Proposed architectures; Robot ethics; Self-simulation; Simple tests; Simulation theory; Intelligent robots",2-s2.0-85020386786

It goes beyond the usual extraction of information from the measurements and requires the radar to get intelligence. Introduced by Haykin [1] and Guerci [2], it is attracting huge attention within the radar community during the last few years. The key concept is that radar system performance can be enhanced through a continuous and coordinated feedback between the transmitter and receiver which implies a dynamic adaptation of the sensor algorithms to the operational context and environmental replies.

In this paper, we demonstrate that multiple approximation techniques can be applied to applications in these domains and can be further combined together to compound their benefits. In assessing the potential of approximation in these applications, we took the liberty of changing multiple layers of the system stack: architecture, programming model, and algorithms. Across a set of applications spanning the domains of DSP, robotics, and machine learning, we show that hot loops in the applications can be perforated by an average of 50% with proportional reduction in execution time, while still producing acceptable quality of results. In addition, the width of the data used in the computation can be reduced to 10-16 bits from the currently common 32/64 bits with potential for significant performance and energy benefits. For parallel applications we reduced execution time by 50% using relaxed synchronization mechanisms. Finally, our results also demonstrate that benefits compounded when these techniques are applied concurrently. Our results across different applications demonstrate that approximate computing is a widely applicable paradigm with potential for compounded benefits from applying multiple techniques across the system stack. In order to exploit these benefits it is essential to re-think multiple layers of the system stack to embrace approximations ground-up and to design tightly integrated approximate accelerators. Doing so will enable moving the applications into a world in which the architecture, programming model, and even the algorithms used to implement the application are all fundamentally designed for approximate computing. © 2016 IEEE.","Approximate computing; perforation; reduced precision; relaxed synchronization","Approximation algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Learning systems; Well perforation; Approximate computing; Approximation techniques; Computing paradigm; Parallel application; Programming models; Quality of results; Reduced precision; Synchronization mechanisms; Computer systems programming",2-s2.0-85006039988

This paper explores the construction of classification methods based on deep learning architectures applied on brain regions defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL). Gray Matter (GM) images from each brain area have been split into 3D patches according to the regions defined by the AAL atlas and these patches are used to train different deep belief networks. An ensemble of deep belief networks is then composed where the final prediction is determined by a voting scheme. Two deep learning based structures and four different voting schemes are implemented and compared, giving as a result a potent classification architecture where discriminative features are computed in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting method has been evaluated using a large dataset from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification results assessed by cross-validation prove that the proposed method is not only valid for differentiate between controls (NC) and AD images, but it also provides good performances when tested for the more challenging case of classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Subjects. In particular, the classification architecture provides accuracy values up to 0.90 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/AD classification, 0.84 and AUC of 0.91 for stable MCI/AD classification and 0.83 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/MCI converters classification. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Alzheimer's disease classification; Deep learning; ensemble","Brain; Diagnosis; Network architecture; Neuroimaging; Classification methods; Classification results; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Deep learning; Discriminative features; Disease classification; ensemble; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Computer aided diagnosis; aged; Alzheimer disease; area under the curve; automated pattern recognition; brain; classification; cognitive defect; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; disease course; early diagnosis; female; gray matter; human; information processing; male; positron emission tomography; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; three dimensional imaging; unsupervised machine learning; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Area Under Curve; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Datasets as Topic; Disease Progression; Early Diagnosis; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Positron-Emission Tomography; ROC Curve; Unsupervised Machine Learning",2-s2.0-84980348164

This paradigm in radio communication has been successfully used in vehicular networks wherein communication can be established within vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle) or vehicles to static stations (vehicle-to-infrastructure) without allocating dedicated frequencies. However, the challenge in CR design lies in building intelligence that helps in efficiently sensing and transmitting data through available radio spectrum channels. This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based Proactive Medium Access Control protocol (ProMAC) for the SUs in a CR network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first proactive MAC reported in the literature for CR. Employing ProMAC in a architecture where the number of SUs and PUs were constant, we achieved 20%, 13.5% and 12% improvement in channel utilization, backoff rate and sensing delay respectively as compared to the recently proposed PO-MAC protocol, which is so far the best reported in the literature. In an architecture where the numbers of SUs varied with time, ProMAC achieved 21% and 13.17% improvement in channel utilization and backoff rate, respectively, as compared to PO-MAC. The proposed protocol is based on a self-learning engine that can evolve and improve its prediction accuracy even after deployment on field. © 2016","Cognitive radio (CR); Dynamic spectrum access; Medium access control (MAC); Model predictive control (MPC); Spectrum allocation; Spectrum sensing; Vehicular networks","Access control; Information dissemination; Intelligent buildings; Medium access control; Model predictive control; Network architecture; Predictive control systems; Radio communication; Radio systems; Radio transmission; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Dynamic spectrum access; Medium access control(MAC); Spectrum allocation; Spectrum sensing; Vehicular networks; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84976483165

Results suggest that using voice commands reduced the time spent looking at the device by half but yielded similar system usability and cognitive effort ratings as using buttons.

In everyday situations, response inhibition performance might be altered when irrelevant input is presented simultaneously with the information relevant for response inhibition. More specifically, irrelevant concurrent information may either brace or interfere with response-relevant information, depending on whether these inputs are redundant or conflicting. The aim of this study is to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms and the network underlying such modulations using EEG beamforming as method. The results show that in comparison to a baseline condition without concurrent information, response inhibition performance can be aggravated or facilitated by manipulating the extent of conflict via concurrent input. This depends on whether the requirement for cognitive control is high, as in conflicting trials, or whether it is low, as in redundant trials. In line with this, the total theta frequency power decreases in a right hemispheric orbitofrontal response inhibition network including the SFG, MFG, and SMA, when concurrent redundant information facilitates response inhibition processes.

How the disease alters the functional topological organization of the brain, however, remains poorly understood. Furthermore, how levodopa modulates network topology in PD is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to use resting-state functional MRI and graph theory to determine how small-world architecture is altered in PD and affected by levodopa administration. Methods: Twenty-one PD patients and 20 controls underwent functional MRI scanning. PD patients were scanned off medication and 1 hour after 200 mg levodopa. Imaging data were analyzed using 226 nodes comprising 10 intrinsic brain networks. Correlation matrices were generated for each subject and converted into cost-thresholded, binarized adjacency matrices. Cost-integrated whole-brain global and local efficiencies were compared across groups and tested for relationships with disease duration and severity. Results: Data from 2 patients and 4 controls were excluded because of excess motion. Patients off medication showed no significant changes in global efficiency and overall local efficiency, but in a subnetwork analysis did show increased local efficiency in executive (P = 0.006) and salience (P = 0.018) networks. Levodopa significantly decreased local efficiency (P = 0.039) in patients except within the subcortical network, in which it significantly increased local efficiency (P = 0.007). Conclusions: Levodopa modulates global and local efficiency measures of small-world topology in PD, suggesting that degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons in PD may be associated with a large-scale network reorganization and that levodopa tends to normalize the disrupted network topology in PD. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society","graph theory; levodopa; Parkinson disease; resting-state fMRI","amantadine; carbidopa plus levodopa; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; levodopa; monoamine oxidase B inhibitor; adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; disease severity; executive function; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; Montreal cognitive assessment; nerve cell network; Parkinson disease; priority journal; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale",2-s2.0-84989235553

Over the last four decades, a model of associative recognition has been developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. This model was first exclusively based on behavior, but was later evaluated and improved based on fMRI and EEG data. Unfortunately, the limited spatial resolution of EEG and the limited temporal resolution of fMRI have made it difficult to fully understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of associative recognition. We therefore conducted an associative recognition experiment with MEG, which combines excellent temporal resolution with reasonable spatial resolution. To analyze the data, we applied non-parametric cluster analyses and a multivariate classifier. This resulted in a detailed spatio-temporal model of associative recognition. After the visual encoding of the stimuli in occipital regions, three separable memory processes took place: a familiarity process (temporal cortex), a recollection process (temporal cortex and supramarginal gyrus), and a representational process (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). A late decision process (superior parietal cortex) then acted upon the recollected information represented in the prefrontal cortex, culminating in a late response process (motor cortex). We conclude that existing theories of associative recognition, including the ACT-R model, should be adapted to include these processes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","ACT-R; Associative recognition; Classification; MEG; Processing stages","adult; Article; association; associative memory; cognition; controlled study; decision making; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; female; human; human experiment; magnetoencephalography; male; mental task; motor cortex; occipital lobe; parietal cortex; priority journal; recall; recognition; spatiotemporal analysis; stimulus response; supramarginal gyrus; task performance; temporal cortex; visual stimulation; word recognition",2-s2.0-84981347719

Prior to any post hoc analysis, however, a natural issue is how to construct “ideal” brain networks given, for example, a set of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series associated with different brain regions. Although many methods have been developed, it is currently still an open field to estimate biologically meaningful and statistically robust brain networks due to our limited understanding of the human brain as well as complex noises in the observed data. Motivated by the fact that the brain is organized with modular structures, in this paper, we propose a novel functional brain network modeling scheme by encoding a modularity prior under a matrix-regularized network learning framework, and further formulate it as a sparse low-rank graph learning problem, which can be solved by an efficient optimization algorithm. Then, we apply the learned brain networks to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal controls. We achieved 89.01% classification accuracy even with a simple feature selection and classification pipeline, which significantly outperforms the conventional brain network construction methods. Moreover, we further explore brain network features that contributed to MCI identification, and discovered potential biomarkers for personalized diagnosis. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Brain network; Classification; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Low-rank representation; Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Modularity; Partial correlation; Pearson's correlation; Sparse representation","aged; algorithm; Article; classifier; clinical article; connectome; controlled study; female; functional brain network; human; intermethod comparison; male; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell network; network learning; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity",2-s2.0-84989917413

In this review, we investigate the applicability of graph theory to understand the impact of epilepsy on cognition compared with controls and, then, the patterns of cognitive development in normally developing children which would set the stage for prospective comparisons of children with epilepsy and controls. The overall goal is to examine the potential utility of this analytic tool and approach to conceptualize the cognitive comorbidities in epilepsy.

However existing agent-based simulation platforms (e.g., SWARM, Repast) provide limited support for the simulation of more complex cognitive agents required by such scenarios. We present a framework that allows Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive agents to be embedded in an ABM system. Architecturally, this means that the “brains” of an agent can be modelled in the BDI system in the usual way, while the “body” exists in the ABM system. The architecture is flexible in that the ABM can still have non-BDI agents in the simulation, and the BDI-side can have agents that do not have a physical counterpart (such as an organisation). The framework addresses a key integration challenge of coupling event-based BDI systems, with time-stepped ABM systems. Our framework is modular and supports integration of off-the-shelf BDI systems with off-the-shelf ABM systems. The framework is Open Source, and all integrations and applications are available for use by the modelling community.

For learning such saliency models, we introduce a neural network architecture, which has fully connected layers on top of CNNs responsible for feature extraction at three different scales. The penultimate layer of our neural network has been confirmed to be a discriminative high-level feature vector for saliency detection, which we call deep contrast feature.

Although generally interpreted to reflect memory or cognitive processes, simple MMN likely contains some activity from non-adapted sensory cells, clouding what process is affected in schizophrenia. Research in healthy participants has demonstrated that MMN can be elicited by deviations from abstract auditory patterns and complex rules that do not cause sensory adaptation. Whether persons with schizophrenia show abnormalities in the complex MMN is unknown. Fourteen schizophrenia participants and 16 matched healthy underwent EEG recording while listening to 400 groups of 6 tones 330 ms apart, separated by 800 ms. Occasional deviant groups were missing the 4th or 6th tone (50 groups each). Healthy participants generated a robust response to a missing but expected tone. The schizophrenia group was significantly impaired in activating the missing stimulus MMN, generating no significant activity at all. Schizophrenia affects the ability of “primitive sensory intelligence” and pre-attentive perceptual mechanisms to form implicit groups in the auditory environment. Importantly, this deficit must relate to abnormalities in abstract complex pattern analysis rather than sensory problems in the disorder. The results indicate a deficit in parsing of the complex auditory scene which likely impacts negatively on successful social navigation in schizophrenia.

Membrane proteins are implicated as drug targets and play an important role in disease pathways. The computational structure prediction from membrane protein sequences AIDS understanding of the structures. The prediction of structural preferences of individual residues within a protein sequence is often used as a starting point by higher order structure prediction algorithms that predict atomic coordinates. The low number of membrane proteins relative to globular proteins is a motivation for classifiers employing a meta-cognitive framework, as they have been shown in the machine learning literature to learn from a smaller number of samples and to generalize well to new datasets. In this paper, the recently developed Projection based, Meta-cognitive Radial Basis Function Network (PBL-McRBFN) was used in the membrane protein structure prediction problem. The PBL-McRBFN consists of a cognitive component that employs a projection-based learning algorithm. The meta-cognitive component controls the architecture and learning strategies of the cognitive component.

The McRNN has two components, namely, a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive components. The cognitive component is an evolving single hidden layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with Gaussian activation functions. The meta-cognitive component present in McRNN helps to cognitive component in selecting proper samples to learn based on its current knowledge and evolve architecture automatically. The McRNN employs extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to find optimal network parameters in training. First, the performance of the proposed sequential learning McRNN algorithm has been evaluated using a set of benchmark function approximation problems and is compared with existing sequential learning algorithms. The performance results on these problems show the better performance of McRNN algorithm over the other algorithms. Next, the proposed McRNN algorithm has been applied to RUL estimation problem based on sensor data. For simulation studies, we have used Prognostics Health Management (PHM) 2008 Data Challenge data set and compared with the existing approaches based on state-of-the-art regression algorithms.

Instead, biological networks work on minimizing energy expenditure by encoding sparse stimulus features that maximize information representation.

While the linkages between metaphors, analogies, and design thinking are not new, how architects use them is not systematically explored. Metaphors and analogies are used idiosyncratically. What a particular metaphor or analogy signifies varies from person to person and could mean different things to different people. In this study two key findings emerge from the interviews with five prominent Iranian architects, who have used metaphors or analogies in their projects. First, this study confirms the other findings that designers use metaphors/analogies in three ways: problem solving, problem definition, and explaining a problem to others. At times architects post-rationalize metaphors or analogies, or use them after the fact instead of during the conceptual design stage; second, arguably, metaphors and analogies shed some light on broader issues of public concern, that is, the authenticity (originality) vs. imitation debate.

Auditory inputs enter cortex with its own set of unique qualities, and leads to use in oral communication, speech, music, and the understanding of emotional and intentional states of others, all of which are central to the human experience. To better understand how the auditory system develops, recovers after injury, and how it may have transitioned in its functions over the course of hominin evolution, advances are needed in models of how the human brain is organized to process real-world natural sounds and ""auditory objects"". This review presents a simple fundamental neurobiological model of hearing perception at a category level that incorporates principles of bottom-up signal processing together with top-down constraints of grounded cognition theories of knowledge representation. Though mostly derived from human neuroimaging literature, this theoretical framework highlights rudimentary principles of real-world sound processing that may apply to most if not all mammalian species with hearing and acoustic communication abilities. The model encompasses three basic categories of sound-source: (1) action sounds (non-vocalizations) produced by 'living things', with human (conspecific) and non-human animal sources representing two subcategories; (2) action sounds produced by 'non-living things', including environmental sources and human-made machinery; and (3) vocalizations ('living things'), with human versus non-human animals as two subcategories therein. The model is presented in the context of cognitive architectures relating to multisensory, sensory-motor, and spoken language organizations. The models' predictive values are further discussed in the context of anthropological theories of oral communication evolution and the neurodevelopment of spoken language proto-networks in infants/toddlers. These phylogenetic and ontogenetic frameworks both entail cortical network maturations that are proposed to at least in part be organized around a number of universal acoustic-semantic signal attributes of natural sounds, which are addressed herein. © 2017.","Acoustic communication; Acoustic signal processing; Grounded cognition; Language evolution; Language neurodevelopment; Meta-analysis; Neuroimaging",,2-s2.0-85019630231

At baseline and follow up, motor and cognitive functional measures as well as brain structural MRI scans were obtained. Tensor-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used to map longitudinal modifications of GM and WM structures and their correlation with functional scales. After training, both groups improved at cognitive tests, whereas the AOT-G also improved hand motor performance. Following training, no modifications of WM diffusion tensor MRI indexes were detected. After training, compared to C-G, AOT-G had increased volume of the left superior frontal gyrus and decreased volume of the right lingual gyrus. Compared to AOT-G, C-G showed increased volume of the right middle frontal gyrus and left inferior temporal gyrus. In AOT-G, GM volume changes correlated with improvements at cognitive tests. Ten-day AOT in healthy individuals modifies GM structure, promoting structural brain plasticity and functional competence. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Action observation training; Gray matter; Healthy subjects; Magnetic resonance imaging; Structural plasticity; White matter",,2-s2.0-84991102187

Their activity is positively and negatively regulated by GEFs and GAPs molecules, respectively. However their in vivo roles are poorly known. The ArhGAP15 gene, coding for a Rac-specific GAP protein, is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the adult hippocampus, and its loss results in the hyperactivation of Rac1/Rac3. In the CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the ArhGAP15 mutant hippocampus the CR+, PV+ and SST+ inhibitory neurons are reduced in number, due to reduced efficiency and directionality of their migration, while pyramidal neurons are unaffected. Loss of ArhGAP15 alters neuritogenesis and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, with a net functional result consisting in increased spike frequency and bursts, accompanied by poor synchronization. Thus, the loss of ArhGAP15 mainly impacts on interneuron-dependent inhibition. Adult ArhGAP15-/- mice showed defective hippocampus-dependent functions such as working and associative memories. These findings indicate that a normal architecture and function of hippocampal inhibitory neurons is essential for higher hippocampal functions, and is exquisitely sensitive to ArhGAP15-dependent modulation of Rac1/Rac3. © The Author(s) 2016.",,,2-s2.0-84990237441

These spectral responses have been linked to several cognitive processes; including working memory, attention, perceptual binding and neuronal coordination. In this paper, we show how Bayesian methods can be used to finesse the ill-posed problem of reconstructing—and explaining—oscillatory responses. We offer an overview of recent developments in this field, focusing on (i) the use of MEG data and Empirical Bayes to build hierarchical models for group analyses—and the identification of important sources of inter-subject variability and (ii) the construction of novel dynamic causal models of intralaminar recordings to explain layer-specific activity. We hope to show that electrophysiological measurements contain much more spatial information than is often thought: on the one hand, the dynamic causal modelling of non-invasive (low spatial resolution) electrophysiology can afford sub-millimetre (hyper-acute) resolution that is limited only by the (spatial) complexity of the underlying (dynamic causal) forward model. On the other hand, invasive microelectrode recordings (that penetrate different cortical layers) can reveal laminar-specific responses and elucidate hierarchical message passing and information processing within and between cortical regions at a macroscopic scale. In short, the careful and biophysically grounded modelling of sparse data enables one to characterise the neuronal architectures generating oscillations in a remarkable detail. © 2016 The Author(s)","Compartmental models; Connectivity; Dynamic causal modelling; Hierarchical Bayesian models; Intersubject variability; Laminar responses; Microelectrodes",,2-s2.0-84990960930

The constructed model retrieves photos based on human memory characteristics such as learning, forgetting, inhibition, and noise. These memory characteristics are regulated with parameter values corresponding to cognitive and emotional health. The authors assumed that a user's mental health could be assessed from their reactions to photo sequences retrieved by models with various parameter settings. The authors also assumed that it would be possible to motivate a user by guiding their memory recall with photo sequences generated from a healthy optimal state model.

The functional architecture of spatial working memory was therefore explored in younger (18-40 years) and older (64-85 years) adults, using passive and active recall tasks. Spatial working memory was assessed using a modified version of the Spatial Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale - Third Edition (WMS-III; Wechsler, 1998). Across both age groups, the effects of interference (control, visual, or spatial), and recall type (forward and backward), were investigated. There was a clear effect of age group, with younger adults demonstrating a larger spatial working memory capacity than the older adults overall. There was also a specific effect of interference, with the spatial interference task (spatial tapping) reliably reducing performance relative to both the control and visual interference (dynamic visual noise) conditions in both age groups and both recall types. This suggests that younger and older adults have similar dependence upon active spatial rehearsal, and that both forward and backward recall require this processing capacity. Linear regression analyses were then carried out within each age group, to assess the predictors of performance in each recall format (forward and backward). Specifically the backward recall task was significantly predicted by age, within both the younger and older adult groups. This finding supports previous literature showing lifespan linear declines in spatial-sequential working memory, and in working memory tasks from other domains, but contrasts with previous evidence that backward spatial span is no more sensitive to aging than forward span. The study suggests that backward spatial span is indeed more processing-intensive than forward span, even when both tasks include a retention period, and that age predicts backward spatial span performance across the adult lifespan, within both younger and older adulthood. © 2016 Brown.","Ageing; Central executive attention; Cognitive aging; Corsi blocks test; Spatial-sequential working memory; Spatio-sequential; Visual-spatial; Visuo-spatial sketchpad",,2-s2.0-84996553934

With Moore's law having surrendered, innovative architectural concepts as well as technologies are urgently required, to enable a path for tackling exascale and beyond - even though current computing systems face the inevitable instruction-level parallelism, power, memory, and bandwidth walls. As part of any computing system, the general perception of memories depicts unreliability, power hungriness and slowness, resulting in a future prospective bottleneck. The latter being an outcome of a pin limitation derived by packaging constraints, an unexploited tremendous row bandwidth is determinable, which off-chip diminishes to a bare minimum. Building upon a shift towards data-centric computing systems, the near-memory processing concept seems to be most promising, since power efficiency and computing performance increase by co-locating tasks on bandwidth-rich in-memory processing units, whereas data motion mitigates by the avoidance of entire memory hierarchies.

Although these conditions commonly affect children, threat conditioning and extinction have been primarily studied in adults. However, differences in phenomenology and neural architecture prohibit the generalization of adult findings to youth. Areas covered: A comprehensive literature search using PubMed and PsycInfo was conducted to identify studies that have used differential conditioning tasks to examine threat acquisition and extinction in youth. The information obtained from this review helps to clarify the influence of these processes on the etiology and treatment of youth with OCD, PTSD and other anxiety disorders. Thirty studies of threat conditioning and extinction were identified Expert commentary: Youth with anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD have largely comparable threat acquisition relative to unaffected controls, with some distinctions noted for youth with PTSD or youth who have suffered maltreatment. However, impaired extinction was consistently observed across youth with these disorders and appears to be consistent with deficiencies in inhibitory learning.

The second is that all adaptive behavior is driven by the free energy principle and the process of model-based inference it entails. The third is that cognition is not ubiquitous. These three incompatible propositions together comprise a problem of scope for the free energy principle as a theory of cognition. The prospects for rejecting each of these propositions are considered. To drop either the first or the second would limit the explanatory success of the principle.

In order to solve this problem, a hierarchical Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) architecture that several administration entities focus on providing spectrum services for users of variety tiers is proposed. The corresponding resource allocation algorithm based on stable matching in this architecture is also given.

We focus on a secondary system that provides wireless unicast secure layered video information to multiple single-antenna secondary receivers. The resource-allocation algorithm design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem for the minimization of the total transmit power at the secondary transmitter. The proposed framework takes into account a quality-of-service (QoS) requirement regarding video communication secrecy in the secondary system, the imperfection of the channel state information (CSI) of potential eavesdroppers (primary receivers) at the secondary transmitter, and a limit for the maximum tolerable received interference power at the primary receivers. Thereby, the proposed problem formulation exploits the self-protecting architecture of layered transmission and artificial noise generation to ensure communication secrecy. The considered nonconvex optimization problem is recast as a convex optimization problem via semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation. It is shown that the global optimal solution of the original problem can be constructed by exploiting both the primal and the dual optimal solutions of the SDP-relaxed problem. In addition, two suboptimal resource-allocation schemes are proposed for the case when the solution of the dual problem is unavailable for constructing the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate significant transmit power savings and robustness against CSI imperfection for the proposed optimal and suboptimal resource-allocation algorithms employing layered transmission compared to baseline schemes employing traditional single-layer transmission. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive radio (CR); layered transmission; nonconvex optimization; physical-layer security","Channel state information; Cognitive systems; Convex optimization; Network layers; Optimal systems; Optimization; Quality of service; Radio systems; Radio transmission; Resource allocation; Transmitters; Convex optimization problems; Layered transmissions; Multi user multiple input single outputs; Nonconvex optimization; Nonconvex optimization problem; Physical layer security; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Resource allocation algorithms; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-85020203525

One major difficulty in setting up and getting participation in large-scale cognitive decathlon and grand challenge competitions, or even smaller scale cross-framework evaluation and Turing testing, is that there is no standard interface protocol that enables and facilitates human and computational agent ""plug-and-play"" participation across various tasks. We identify three major issues. First, human-readable task interfaces aren't often translated into machine-readable form. Second, in the cases where a task interface is made available in a machine-readable protocol, the protocol is often task-specific, and differs from other task protocols. Finally, where both human and machine-readable versions of the task interface exist, the two versions often differ in content. This makes the bar of entry extremely high for comparison of humans and multiple computational frameworks across multiple tasks. This paper proposes a standard approach to task design where all task interactions adhere to a standard API.

Our proposal is to add the FCM algorithm to the SDON control plane in order to achieve a better network performance, when compared with a non-cognitive control plane. In this context, we illustrate the use of the FCM algorithm for determining, in real time and autonomously, the modulation format of high-speed flexible rate transponders in accordance with the quality of transmission of optical channels. The performance of this FCM algorithm is evaluated via computational simulations for a long-haul network and compared to the case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm, which is commonly used in optical cognitive networks. We demonstrate that FCM outperforms CBR in both fastness and error avoidance, achieving 100Â % of successful classifications, being two orders of magnitude faster.

This paper proposes an intelligent case-based Q-learning method for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) which improves and stabilises the performance of cognitive cellular systems with dynamic topologies.

Effective management of FOG is difficult given its episodic nature, heterogeneous manifestation and limited responsiveness to drug treatment. Methods In order to verify the acceptance of a smartphone-based architecture and its reliability at detecting FOG in real-time, we studied 20 patients suffering from PD-related FOG. They were asked to perform video-recorded Timed Up and Go (TUG) test with and without dual-tasks while wearing the smartphone. Video and accelerometer recordings were synchronized in order to assess the reliability of the FOG detection system as compared to the judgement of the clinicians assessing the videos. The architecture uses two different algorithms, one applying the Freezing and Energy Index (Moore-Bächlin Algorithm), and the other adding information about step cadence, to algorithm 1. Results A total 98 FOG events were recognized by clinicians based on video recordings, while only 7 FOG events were missed by the application. Sensitivity and specificity were 70.1% and 84.1%, respectively, for the Moore-Bächlin Algorithm, rising to 87.57% and 94.97%, respectively, for algorithm 2 (McNemar value = 28.42; p = 0.0073). Conclusion Results confirm previous data on the reliability of Moore-Bächlin Algorithm, while indicating that the evolution of this architecture can identify FOG episodes with higher sensitivity and specificity. An acceptable, reliable and easy-to-implement FOG detection system can support a better quantification of the phenomenon and hence provide data useful to ascertain the efficacy of therapeutic approaches. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Accelerometer; Freezing of gait; Parkinson's disease; Smartphone; Wearable system","aged; algorithm; Article; clinical article; clinical assessment; cognitive function test; diagnostic accuracy; disease duration; female; freezing of gait; Frontal Assessment Battery test; gait disorder; Hoehn and Yahr scale; human; limit of quantitation; male; Parkinson disease; priority journal; reliability; sensitivity and specificity; smartphone; Timed Up and Go test; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; videorecording",2-s2.0-84983458766

Here, using longitudinal resting-state data from 198 participants, we investigated 5-year changes in FC of the anterior and posterior MTL. We found an opposite pattern, such that the degree of FC within the anterior MTL declined after age 60, whereas elevated FC within the posterior MTL was observed along with attenuated posterior MTL-cortical connectivity. A significant negative change-change relation was observed between episodic-memory decline and elevated FC in the posterior MTL. Additional analyses revealed age-related cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases in posterior MTL at the follow-up session, along with a positive relation of elevated FC and CBF, suggesting that elevated FC is a metabolically demanding alteration.

The paper describes the early-stage of implementation and evolution of this concept, which define a dialogue between building and users, by realizing a bi-directional interaction via a newly developed mobile application. The app - Smart Campus UNIBS - mediates, as part of a complex system, between the two entities using the connectivity of Smart Living and the process of Data Analytics.

The sensors aim at providing data to develop adaptive, dynamic as well as predictive controls virtually incrementing the smartness of the building. The step further is to include the behavioral perspective linking the users to the previous framework.

Several members of the early growth response (EGR) transcription factor family can be implicated in regulation of this aberrant developmental change. Our study draws a connection between the genetic risk architecture of autism and molecular features of cortical development unique to humans. © 2016 Public Library of Science.

The main source of information is the structural components, including the relations among them and how they might be structurally arranged. These relations are studied to generate valuable information for EA professionals. However, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to combine structural information with a second source of information: expert's tacit knowledge. We believe combining these sources employing two new methods - what we call cognitive-structural diagnosis analysis and attribute check analysis - can refine the expert's knowledge about the architecture. To demonstrate these methods' feasibility, we apply them with two application architecture datasets collected in two different organizations. We also offer a classification schema for enterprise architecture network analysis at the component level, our focus. Our conclusions indicate that the cognitive- structural diagnosis analysis method minimizes analysis subjectivity while validating important components and also suggesting important structural ones to be further analyzed by experts. The attribute check analysis offers further contributions by helping in the investigation of particular attributes of applications in important architectural positions. © 2016 IEEE.","analysis; Enterprise Architecture; method.; Network measures","Building components; Structural analysis; analysis; Application architecture; Enterprise Architecture; method; Network measures; Structural component; Structural diagnosis; Structural information; Network architecture",2-s2.0-84994453121

The proposed network architecture is based on the spectral requirement of Secondary Users (SUs). In the proposed network architecture, only parts of SUs are equipped with Cognitive Radio (CR) module.

Preclinical studies using AMN082, the mGluR7 allosteric agonist, produced conflicting results, so that results of further in-vivo studies are needed. Here, we investigated effects of subcutaneous administration at the lights onset of AMN082 on sleep-wake architecture and spectral contents in rats. In an attempt to solve the reported mixed results, we estimated the specific functional effects in mGluR7 (-/-) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates. In rats, AMN082 (2.5 mg/kg) elicited a primary waking effect over the first 2 h post-administration by consistent increases in the number of waking bouts and transitions from sleep states towards wakefulness. In mice, baseline recordings over 72 h showed comparable spontaneous sleep-wake cycle in mGluR7 (-/-) mice and their WT littermates, suggesting that mGluR7 is not involved in the regulation of vigilance states. Remarkably, cortical arousal properties of AMN082 were confirmed in WT mice, and occurred concomitantly with a marked decrease in body temperature, likely dissociated from locomotor activity. Surprisingly, the wake arousal and hypothermia effects of AMN082 were also observed in mGluR7 (-/-) mice. AMN082 significantly attenuated the slow wave activity during sleep and had no effect on waking EEG power in the 4-50 Hz range. The present findings in rats do not lend support to proposed somnogenic effects of AMN082, while comparable responses in WT and mGluR7 (-/-) mice provide further evidence of an off-target action of AMN082 that contributes to its waking properties. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","AMN082; Body temperature; EEG oscillations; Glutamate; Locomotor activity; MGluR7; MGluR7 (-/-) mice; Off-target; Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders; Rats; Sleep-wake cycle","metabotropic receptor 7; n,n' dibenzhydrylethylenediamine; animal experiment; arousal; Article; body temperature; controlled study; drug mechanism; electroencephalography; hypothermia; locomotion; male; mouse; nonhuman; nonREM sleep; priority journal; rat; sleep; sleep stage; sleep waking cycle; wakefulness; wild type",2-s2.0-84973376020

In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses. © 2016 Marblestone, Wayne and Kording.","Cognitive architecture; Cost functions; Neural networks; Neuroscience","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Costs; Digital storage; Electrophysiology; Learning systems; Network architecture; Networks (circuits); Neural networks; Neurology; Reconfigurable hardware; Cognitive architectures; Computational problem; Credit assignment; Dedicated systems; Neuroscience; Specialized systems; Specific problems; Training procedures; Cost functions; attention; behavior; brain; learning; long term memory; nerve cell; neuroscience; storage",2-s2.0-84989345063

However, recent studies have shown that subconcussive trauma may be a better indicator of future risks, such as impaired cognitive, motor, and sensory functions, as well as loss of control of emotion and behavior. Therefore, the current reactive and hospital-centered approach where waiting until a concussion has been diagnosed before providing quality care to student athletes is insufficient.

Drawing on a comparative and cross-national case study on the assessment of the risks linked to animal cloning for food, the author examines coproduction of the context of regulatory science, and its substantive content. Two different ways of producing regulatory science are identified, each which combines different ways of knowing (ways of reasoning, cognitive schemes, categories and concepts) and different ways of regulating (institutional architectures, regulatory resources, sources of authority). The analysis shows that the performance of regulatory science is strongly embedded in institutions which bear the hallmark of their national histories.

A challenge, however, is the implementation of synapses (analog memories) composed of such materials. In this work, we introduce robust, fastly programmable, nonvolatile organic memristive nanodevices based on electrografted redox complexes that implement synapses thanks to a wide range of accessible intermediate conductivity states. We demonstrate experimentally an elementary neural network, capable of learning functions, which combines four pairs of organic memristors as synapses and conventional electronics as neurons. Our architecture is highly resilient to issues caused by imperfect devices. It tolerates inter-device variability and an adaptable learning rule offers immunity against asymmetries in device switching.

Among these, the design of control systems capable of automating a wide range of UAV activities is one of the most actively explored and evolving. Currently, researchers and developers are interested in designing control systems that can be referred to as intelligent, e.g. the systems which are suited to solve such tasks as planning, goal prioritization, coalition formation, etc. and thus guarantee high levels of UAV autonomy. One of the principal problems in intelligent control system design is tying together various methods and models traditionally used in robotics and aimed at solving such tasks as dynamics modeling, control signal generation, location and mapping, path planning, etc. with the methods of behavior modeling and planning which are thoroughly studied in cognitive science. Our work is aimed at solving this problem. We propose layered architecture-STRL (strategic, tactical, reactive, layered)-of the control system that automates the behavior generation using a cognitive approach while taking into account complex dynamics and kinematics of the control object (UAV). We use a special type of knowledge representation-sign world model-that is based on the psychological activity theory to describe individual behavior planning and coalition formation processes. We also propose path planning methodology which serves as the mediator between the high-level cognitive activities and the reactive control signals generation. To generate these signals we use a state-dependent Riccati equation and specific method for solving it. We believe that utilization of the proposed architecture will broaden the spectrum of tasks which can be solved by the UAV's coalition automatically, as well as raise the autonomy level of each individual member of that coalition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cognitive architecture; Intelligent control system; Nonlinear control; Path planning; Sign world model; State-dependent Riccati equation","Cognitive systems; Computer architecture; Control systems; Control theory; Equations of state; Intelligent control; Knowledge representation; Motion planning; Nonlinear equations; Riccati equations; Robot programming; Robotics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Cognitive architectures; Control signal generation; Design of control system; Designing control system; Non linear control; Proposed architectures; State-dependent Riccati equation; World model; Aircraft control; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automation; cognitive architecture; control system; nonlinear system; priority journal; robotics; unmanned aerial vehicle",2-s2.0-84960491974

Here, I apply such a model to re-evaluate the local advantage phenomenon in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), that is, the better than typical performance on visual tasks in which local stimulus features are to be discerned. The model takes (a) perceptual organization as a predominantly stimulus-driven process yielding hierarchical stimulus organizations, and (b) attention as predominantly scrutinizing the hierarchical structure of established percepts in a task-driven top-down fashion. This accounts for a dominance of wholes over parts and implies that perceived global structures mask incompatible local features. The model also substantiates that impairments in neuronal synchronization – as found in ASD – reduce the emergence of global structures and, thereby, their masking effect on incompatible features. I argue that this explains the local advantage phenomenon and I discuss implications and suggestions for future research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Autism spectrum disorders; Cognitive architecture; Global vs. local processing; Local advantage phenomenon; Neuronal synchronization; Perceptual organization","Article; autism; cognitive architecture; disease association; functional anatomy; hemispheric dominance; human; mental task; nerve cell network; neuroanatomy; neurophysiology; priority journal; task performance; vision test; attention; autism; cognition; pathophysiology; perception; physiology; vision; Attention; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Cognition; Humans; Perceptual Masking; Visual Perception",2-s2.0-84928713986

However, medicine is also one of the most demanding domains for computer-based support systems, since medical assistance tasks are complex and the practical experience of the physician is crucial. Recent developments in the area of cognitive computing appear to be well suited to tackle medicine as an application domain. Methods: We propose a system based on the idea of cognitive computing and consisting of auto-configurable medical assistance algorithms and their self-adapting combination. The system enables automatic execution of new algorithms, given they are made available as Medical Cognitive Apps and are registered in a central semantic repository. Learning components can be added to the system to optimize the results in the cases when numerous Medical Cognitive Apps are available for the same task. Our prototypical implementation is applied to the areas of surgical phase recognition based on sensor data and image progressing for tumor progression mappings. Results: Our results suggest that such assistance algorithms can be automatically configured in execution pipelines, candidate results can be automatically scored and combined, and the system can learn from experience. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that the Medical Cognitive Apps are providing the correct results as they did for local execution and run in a reasonable amount of time.

Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is the key function of cognitive radio technology to identify the available spectrum. However, the nature of aggregating data makes CSS offer opportunities for malicious SUs. Recently, a lot of efforts have been paid to combating spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) threat, but little attention to the multi-hop architecture of cognitive radio ad hoc networks. In this paper, we report the discovery of a novel attack called spectrum sensing data hijack (SSDH), in which attackers disguise as routers to hijack and tamper with spectrum sensing data during the transmission. Our simulations show that this new attack needs much less cost to manipulate CSS and has a much higher success rate compared with SSDF attack. We conduct an in-depth investigation on SSDH and propose a two-level defense scheme from the design ideas of IBC signature-verification and neighbor monitor. We also perform simulations to validate our approach.

Accurate prediction of the resource availability assists efficient resource allocation before the routing of such data. Most of the published work on resource prediction in MANET focuses on either bandwidth or energy without considering mobility effects. Adoption of intelligent software agent such as Cognitive Agent (CA) for the accurate resource prediction has a significant potential to solve the challenges of resource prediction in MANET. The intelligence provided in CA is similar to the logical thinking like a human for decision-making. The predominant CA architecture is the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model, which performs the various tasks on behalf of the human user as an assistant. In this paper, we propose a CA-based Resource Prediction mechanism considering Mobility (CA-RPM) that predicts the resources using agents through the resource prediction agency consisting of one static agent, one cognitive agent and two mobile agents. Agents predict the traffic, mobility, buffer space, energy, and bandwidth effectively that is necessary for efficient resource allocation to support real-time and multimedia communications. The mobile agents collect and distribute network traffic statistics over MANET whereas a static agent collects the local statistics. CA creates static/mobile agent during the process of resource prediction. Initially, the designed time-series Wavelet Neural Networks (WNNs) predict traffic and mobility. Buffer space, energy, and bandwidth prediction use the predicted mobility and traffic.

Each layer in the architecture represents increasingly complex human activity features. The first layer consists of a SOM which performs dimensionality reduction and clustering of the feature space. It represents the dynamics of the stream of posture frames in action sequences as activity trajectories over time. The second layer in the hierarchy consists of another SOM which clusters the activity trajectories of the first-layer SOM and learns to represent action prototypes. The third- and last-layer of the hierarchy consists of a neural network that learns to label action prototypes of the second-layer SOM and is independent - to certain extent - of the camera's angle and relative distance to the actor. The experiments were carried out with encouraging results with action movies taken from the INRIA 4D repository. In terms of representational accuracy, measured as the recognition rate over the training set, the architecture exhibits 100% accuracy indicating that actions with overlapping patterns of activity can be correctly discriminated. On the other hand, the architecture exhibits 53% recognition rate when presented with the same actions interpreted and performed by a different actor. Experiments on actions captured from different view points revealed a robustness of our system to camera rotation. Indeed, recognition accuracy was comparable to the single viewpoint case. To further assess the performance of the system we have also devised a behavioural experiments in which humans were asked to recognise the same set of actions, captured from different points of view.

It has been the dominant approach in the vision science of the last half century, and it is currently one of the fundamental methods of investigation for most higher cognitive functions. Yet, neurocomputational approaches to moral behavior are lacking. Computational modeling in general has been scarcely pursued in morality, and existent non-neural attempts have failed to account for the mental processes involved in morality. In this paper we argue that recently the situation has evolved in a way that subverted the insufficient knowledge on the basic organization of moral cognition in brain circuits, making the project of modeling morality in neurocomputational terms feasible. We will present an original architecture that combines reinforcement learning and Hebbian learning, aimed at simulating forms of moral behavior in a simple artificial context. The relationship between language and morality is controversial. In the analytic tradition of philosophy, morality is essentially the language of morals. On the other side, current cognitive ethology has shown how non human species display behaviors that are surprisingly similar to those prescribed by human ethics. Nevertheless, morality in humans is deeply entrenched with language, and the semantics of words like 'wrong' resists consensual explanations. The model here proposed includes an auditory processing pathway, with the purpose of showing how the coding of ""wrong"", even if highly simplified with respect to its rich content in natural language, can emerge in the course of moral learning. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Amygdala; Moral cognition; Neural computation; Orbitofrontal cortex; Self-organization","Biology; Brain; Cognitive systems; Computational linguistics; Curricula; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Amygdala; Moral cognition; Neural computations; Orbitofrontal cortex; Self organizations; Behavioral research; amygdaloid nucleus; Article; auditory nervous system; cognition; computer model; decision making; emotion; human; learning; morality; natural language processing; nerve cell network; orbital cortex; priority journal; reinforcement; semantics; visual system",2-s2.0-84955559105

In this paper, I distinguish between different understandings of association, and I argue that the crucial senses of association for elucidating implicit bias are the cognitive structure and mental process senses. A hypothesis is subsequently derived: if associations really underpin implicit biases, then implicit biases should be modulated by counterconditioning or extinction but should not be modulated by rational argumentation or logical interventions. This hypothesis is false; implicit biases are not predicated on any associative structures or associative processes but instead arise because of unconscious propositionally structured beliefs.

This so-called attentional blink (AB) occurs when the second of two targets (T2) is presented closely after the first (T1) in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We hypothesized that entrainment to a rhythmic stream of stimuli—before visual targets appear—would reduce the AB. Experiment 1 tested the effect of auditory entrainment by presenting sounds with a regular or irregular interstimulus interval prior to a RSVP where T1 and T2 were separated by three possible lags (1, 3 and 8). Experiment 2 examined visual entrainment by presenting visual stimuli in place of auditory stimuli. Results revealed that irrespective of sensory modality, arrhythmic stimuli preceding the RSVP triggered an alerting effect that improved the T2 identification at lag 1, but impaired the recovery from the AB at lag 8. Importantly, only auditory rhythmic entrainment was effective in reducing the AB at lag 3.

This work forms an important step towards the development of personalized stimulation protocols for medical treatment or performance enhancement. © 2016 Public Library of Science.

Serotonergic hypofunction has been linked to depressed mood, low stress tolerance and pain intolerance, while its metabolite melatonin has been linked to loss of sleep architecture and flattening of all circadian rhythms. Catecholamines, norepinephrine and dopamine have been related to cognitive dysfunction and an inability to feel pleasure, respectively.

As a case study, the method was applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected during a GO/NOGO cognitive task performed by untreated opiate addicts, those undergoing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for opiate dependence and a healthy control group. Methods: The method is based on an SNN architecture called NeuCube, trained on spatiotemporal EEG data. Objective: NeuCube was used to classify EEG data across subject groups and across GO versus NOGO trials, but also facilitated a deeper comparative analysis of the dynamic brain processes. Results: This analysis results in a better understanding of human brain functioning across subject groups when performing a cognitive task. In terms of the EEG data classification, a NeuCube model obtained better results (the maximum obtained accuracy: 90.91%) when compared with traditional statistical and artificial intelligence methods (the maximum obtained accuracy: 50.55%). Significance: more importantly, new information about the effects of MMT on cognitive brain functions is revealed through the analysis of the SNN model connectivity and its dynamics.

For the former, a new logic computational process based on the material implication is discussed. It consists of several memristors which play roles of combined logic processor and memory, called stateful logic circuit. In this circuit configuration, the logic process flows primarily along a time dimension, whereas in current von Neumann computers it occurs along a spatial dimension. In the stateful logic computation scheme, the energy required for the data transfer between the logic and memory chips can be saved. The non-volatile memory in this circuit also saves the energy required for the data refresh. Neuromorphic (cognitive) computing refers to a computing paradigm that mimics the human brain. Currently, the neuromorphic or cognitive computing mainly relies on the software emulation of several brain functionalities, such as image and voice recognition utilizing the recently highlighted deep learning algorithm. However, the human brain typically consumes ≈10–20 Watts for selected “human-like” tasks, which can be currently mimicked by a supercomputer with power consumption of several tens of kilo- to megawatts. Therefore, hardware implementation of such brain functionality must be eventually sought for power-efficient computation. Several fundamental ideas for utilizing the memristors and their recent progresses in these regards are reviewed. Finally, material and processing issues are dealt with, which is followed by the conclusion and outlook of the field. These technical improvements will substantially decrease the energy consumption for futuristic information technology. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The numerical evaluation of these pattern-based notions by another, more placid system of ANNs governs the magnitude of weight disturbances administered to the former assembly, that perturbative intensity in turn controlling the novelty of the resulting ideational stream as well as the retention of newly formed concepts. In search of solution patterns to posed problems, such collaborating neural systems autonomously cycle between two extremes in mean synaptic perturbation level. The higher limit, characterized by chaos and inattentiveness to exogenous input patterns, is the regime in which ideas first form and incubate. The lower bound, marked by relative synaptic tranquility, is favorable to the reactivation and reinforcement of concepts first seeded during heightened perturbation. When considering this synthetic neural architecture as a cognitive model, the proposed source of such synaptic fluctuations is volume neurotransmitter release within cortex where both ideational and critic nets are commingled. As a result of their overlap, not only are the generative cortical networks suffused with neurotransmitters, but also those functioning in a critic role, leading to altered ‘opinions’ about the perturbation-driven stream of consciousness that then govern the injection of neurotransmitters into cortex. The likely effect of such chemical feedback is that the brain constantly cycles between states of idea generating chaos and perception stabilizing tranquility in much the same way that creative artificial neural systems do. Postulating that ideas are potentially useful or interesting false memories born within such turmoil, creativity appears to take place through a cyclic process consisting of alternating phases of (1) cognitive incapacitation, during which confabulatory notions incubate, and (2) synaptic calm when these incubated thoughts reemerge and reinforce themselves as they are then recognized for their value by a lucid perceptual apparatus. Extremes in such cycling, especially within the former dysfunctional phase, would be problematic from a mental health perspective. Whereas the literature is replete with findings linking creativity and various psychopathologies, the main hypothesis advanced herein is that the neurodynamics of both phenomena are the same. If vindicated, this theory may lead to advanced treatments that could potentially boost creativity as well as safeguard against the associated cognitive and psychological disorders, all through control of just one parameter, the difference between cortical concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,"Article; artificial neural network; brain cortex; cognition; connectome; creativity machine paradigm; feedback system; human; hypothesis; insanity cycle; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; mental disease; molecular dynamics; neurotransmission; process development; theory; anxiety disorder; attention deficit disorder; biological model; bipolar disorder; creativity; Markov chain; memory; metabolism; nerve cell; nerve cell network; pathology; pathophysiology; perception; phobia; psychosis; schizophrenia; statistical model; synapse; thinking; agents interacting with transmitter, hormone or drug receptors; Anxiety Disorders; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Bipolar Disorder; Cognition; Creativity; Humans; Memory; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Nerve Net; Neurons; Neurotransmitter Agents; Perception; Phobic Disorders; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Stochastic Processes; Synapses; Thinking",2-s2.0-84979609965

However, what the functional role of SN is, how these key SN nodes interact with each other to form a network in a perceptual decision, and how the network depends on the perceptual difficulty remain largely unknown. In the present study, we measured blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During four PDM tasks (1) face-house discrimination, (2) happy-angry face discrimination, (3) audiovisual asynchrony and synchrony perception, and a (4) random dot motion direction task, we varied the task difficulty and examined the interactions between these SN nodes. In all the experiments, behavioral accuracy decreased and response time increased with task difficulty. The BOLD signal increased in SN nodes with the ambiguity in the sensory information. We also found that there were significant directed functional connections between AIs and dACC in all four tasks and that the interactions between these nodes increased with task difficulty.

LOAD cases are more prevalent with genetically complex architecture. In spite of significant research focused on understanding the etiological mechanisms, search for diagnostic biomarker(s) and disease-modifying therapy is still on. In this article, we aim to comprehensively review AD literature on established etiological mechanisms including role of beta-amyloid and apolipoprotein E (APOE) along with promising newer etiological factors such as epigenetic modifications that have been associated with AD suggesting its multifactorial nature.

Issues with addressing and implementing such requirements are more common to the architecture/engineering/construction/operation (AECO) industry compared with other industries. Earlier theoretical propositions mainly originating from cognitive science could shed new light on how information technology (IT) developments may be best exerted for formalized requirements management. For conducting this literature review, a framework suggested by vom Brocke et al. (2009) and a taxonomy developed by Cooper et al. (1998) were implemented. This review has its focus on the central issues of the reviewed articles. The analysis process follows an espousal position and the organization of the findings is conceptual. Through analysis and synthesis of literature, major characteristics and dynamics intrinsic to requirements management in the AECO industry have been identified. Moreover, a number of theoretical views on design and validation processes namely Pattern Language, Schema Theory (Chan, 1990) and the theory of axiomatic design (Suh, 2001) have been revisited with the aim of disclosing their take on formalized requirements formulation and modification. As a prerequisite for developing further theoretical grounds for formalized requirements management, terminological and taxonomic ambiguities throughout the requirements management discourse have been notified.

We propose that prediction errors, inversely weighted with prior probabilities of predictions, yield subjective experiences of positive or negative affect. In this way, we link affect to predictions within a predictive coding framework. We discuss how three key factors - uncertainty, expectations, and conflict - influence prediction accuracy and show how they shape our affective response. We demonstrate that predictable stimuli are, in general, preferred to unpredictable ones, though too much predictability may decrease this liking effect. Furthermore, the account successfully overcomes the ""dark-room"" problem, explaining why we do not avoid stimulation to minimize prediction error.

This study was aimed at investigating the neural architecture of brain structures related to social information processing in boys with 47, XXY, also in comparison with boys with idiopathic ASD. MRI scans of 16 boys with 47, XXY, 16 with ASD, and 16 nonclinical, male controls were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A region of interest mask containing the superior temporal cortex, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insular cortex, and medial frontal cortex was used.

The 47, XXY group could not be distinguished from the ASD group on mean SRS scores, and their scores were significantly higher than in controls. VBM showed that boys with 47, XXY have significant gray matter volume reductions in the left and right insula, and the left OFC, compared with controls and boys with ASD. Additionally, boys with 47, XXY had significantly less gray matter in the right superior temporal gyrus than controls.

However, precursors of food choice often are investigated using tasks offering a very limited number of options despite the comparably complex environment surrounding real life food choice. In the present study, we investigated how the assortment impacts the relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes and food choice (confectionery and fruit), assuming that a more complex choice architecture is more taxing on cognitive resources. Specifically, a binary and a multiple option choice task based on the same stimulus set (fake food items) were presented to ninety-seven participants. Path modeling revealed that both explicit and implicit attitudes were associated with relative food choice (confectionery vs. fruit) in both tasks. In the binary option choice task, both explicit and implicit attitudes were significant precursors of food choice, with explicit attitudes having a greater impact. Conversely, in the multiple option choice task, the additive impact of explicit and implicit attitudes was qualified by an interaction indicating that, even if explicit and implicit attitudes toward confectionery were inconsistent, more confectionery was chosen than fruit if either was positive. This compensatory 'one is sufficient'-effect indicates that the structure of the choice environment modulates the relationship between attitudes and choice. The study highlights that environmental constraints, such as the number of choice options, are an important boundary condition that need to be included when investigating the relationship between psychological precursors and behavior. © 2016 König, Giese, Schupp and Renner.","Choice architecture; Dual process models; Explicit attitudes; Food choice; Implicit attitudes",,2-s2.0-84988416817

According to CCA, cognitive functions are associated with the action of restricted brain regions, and this association is temporally stable; by contrast, DSP argues that cognitive functions are better explained by interactions between several brain areas, whose engagement in specific functions is temporal and context-dependent and based on neural reuse. We outline the main neurobiological facts about adolescent maturation, focusing on the neuroanatomical and neurofunctional processes associated with adolescence. We then explain the importance of emotional management in adolescent maturation. We explain the interplay between emotion and cognition under the scope of CCA and DSP, both at neural and behavioral levels. Finally, we justify why, according to CCA, emotional management is understood as regulation, specifically because the cognitive aspects of the brain are in charge of regulating emotion-related modules. However, the key word in DSP is integration, since neural information from different brain areas is integrated from the beginning of the process. Consequently, although the terms should not be conceptually confused, there is no cognition without emotion, and vice versa. Thus, emotional integration is not an independent process that just happens to the subject, but a crucial part of personal growth. Considering the importance of neuropsychological research in the development of educational and legal policies concerning adolescents, we intend to expose that the holistic view of adolescents is dependent on whether one holds the implicit or explicit interpretation of brain functioning. © 2016 Oron Semper, Murillo and Bernacer.","Emotion regulation; Executive functions; Integration; Personal identity; Socialization",,2-s2.0-84989284371

There is evidence that gliomas and surgery alter the functional brain connectivity but studies on the longitudinal effects are lacking. Methods: We acquired longitudinal (pre- and post-radiotherapy) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on three selected glioblastoma patients. These cases were selected to study three models: a lesion involving a functional hub within a central system, a lesion involving a peripheral node within a central system and a lesion involving a peripheral node of a non-central system. Results: We found that, as expected, the tumor lesion affects connections in close vicinity, but when the lesion relates to a functional hub, these changes involve long-range connections leading to diverse connectivity profiles pre- and post-radiotherapy. In particular, a global but temporary improvement in the post-radiotherapy connectivity was obtained when treating a lesion close to a network hub, such as the posterior Cingulate Cortex. Conclusions: This suggests that this node re-establishes communication to nodes further away in the network. Eventually, these observed effects seem to be transient and on the long-term the tumor burden leads to an overall decline of connectivity following the course of the pathology. Furthermore, we obtained that the link between hubs, such as the Supplementary Motor Area and posterior Cingulate Cortex represents an important backbone by means of which within and across network communication is handled: the disruption of this connection seems to imply a strong decrease in the overall connectivity. © 2016 The Author(s).","Brain tumor; Functional connectivity; Radiotherapy; Resting-state fMRI","antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; brain function; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; case report; case study; central nervous system disease; cingulate gyrus; female; functional anatomy; functional magnetic resonance imaging; glioblastoma; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; outcome assessment; patient selection; peripheral neuropathy; resting state network; Brain Neoplasms; computer assisted diagnosis; glioblastoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; Aged; Brain Neoplasms; Female; Glioblastoma; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged",2-s2.0-84982223810

The mystery of how the brain can be so efficient is compounded by recent evidence that all brain regions are constantly active as they interact in so-called resting-state networks (RSNs). To investigate the brain’s ability to process complex cognitive demands efficiently, we compared functional connectivity (FC) during rest and multiple highly distinct tasks. We found previously that RSNs are present during a wide variety of tasks and that tasks only minimally modify FC patterns throughout the brain. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, although subtle, these task-evoked FC updates from rest nonetheless contribute strongly to behavioral performance. One might expect that larger changes in FC reflect optimization of networks for the task at hand, improving behavioral performance. Alternatively, smaller changes in FC could reflect optimization for efficient (i.e., small) network updates, reducing processing demands to improve behavioral performance. We found across three task domains that high-performing individuals exhibited more efficient brain connectivity updates in the form of smaller changes in functional network architecture between rest and task. These smaller changes suggest that individuals with an optimized intrinsic network configuration for domain-general task performance experience more efficient network updates generally. Confirming this, network update efficiency correlated with general intelligence. The brain’s reconfiguration efficiency therefore appears to be a key feature contributing to both its network dynamics and general cognitive ability. © 2016 the authors.","Brain connectivity; Cognitive control; fMRI; Individual differences; Intelligence; Task switching","Article; echo planar imaging; executive function; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; intelligence; language test; male; nerve cell network; priority journal; rest; resting state network; task performance; working memory; blood; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; image processing; intelligence; language; mental function; nerve tract; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; short term memory; oxygen; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Intelligence; Language; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Mental Processes; Neural Pathways; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxygen; Rest",2-s2.0-84982274235

Animal and in vitro models have revealed β-III spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein present throughout the soma and dendritic tree of cerebellar Purkinje cells, to be required for the maintenance of dendritic architecture and for the trafficking and/or stabilisation of several membrane proteins: ankyrin-R, cell adhesion molecules, metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 (mGluR1), voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) and glutamate transporters. This scaffold of interactions connects β-III spectrin to a wide variety of proteins implicated in the pathology of many SCAs. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding β-III spectrin (SPTBN2) underlie SCA type-5 whereas homozygous mutations cause spectrin associated autosomal recessive ataxia type-1 (SPARCA1), an infantile form of ataxia with cognitive impairment. Loss-of β-III spectrin function appears to underpin cerebellar dysfunction and degeneration in both diseases resulting in thinner dendrites, excessive dendritic protrusion with loss of planarity, reduced resurgent sodium currents and abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission. The initial physiological consequences are a decrease in spontaneous activity and excessive excitation, likely to be offsetting each other, but eventually hyperexcitability gives rise to dark cell degeneration and reduced cerebellar output. Similar molecular mechanisms have been implicated for SCA1, 2, 3, 7, 13, 14, 19, 22, 27 and 28, highlighting alterations to intrinsic Purkinje cell activity, dendritic architecture and glutamatergic transmission as possible common mechanisms downstream of various loss-of-function primary genetic defects.

It is proposed that schizophrenia is a by-product of the complex evolution of the human brain and a compromise for humans’ language, creative thinking, and cognitive abilities. Methods We analyzed recent large genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia and a range of other human phenotypes (anthropometric measures, cardiovascular disease risk factors, immune-mediated diseases) using a statistical framework that draws on polygenic architecture and ancillary information on genetic variants. We used information from the evolutionary proxy measure called the Neanderthal selective sweep (NSS) score. Results Gene loci associated with schizophrenia are significantly (p = 7.30 × 10−9) more prevalent in genomic regions that are likely to have undergone recent positive selection in humans (i.e., with a low NSS score). Variants in brain-related genes with a low NSS score confer significantly higher susceptibility than variants in other brain-related genes. The enrichment is strongest for schizophrenia, but we cannot rule out enrichment for other phenotypes. The false discovery rate conditional on the evolutionary proxy points to 27 candidate schizophrenia susceptibility loci, 12 of which are associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders or linked to brain development. Conclusions Our results suggest that there is a polygenic overlap between schizophrenia and NSS score, a marker of human evolution, which is in line with the hypothesis that the persistence of schizophrenia is related to the evolutionary process of becoming human. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry","Evolution; GWAS; Human; Neanderthal; Polygenic; Schizophrenia","microRNA; genetic marker; anthropometry; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; evolution; gene locus; genetic association; genetic marker; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; human; major clinical study; neanderthal selective sweep score; phenotype; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; schizophrenia; scoring system; single nucleotide polymorphism; brain; genetic marker; genetic predisposition; genetics; metabolism; multifactorial inheritance; pathology; schizophrenia; Biological Evolution; Brain; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Multifactorial Inheritance; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Schizophrenia",2-s2.0-84949660777

In this setting, Broca's area has been considered as the ""speech area""; moreover, this observation led to localizationism. However, advances in brain mapping techniques, as functional neuroimaging and direct electrical stimulation in patients undergoing awake surgery for gliomas, has resulted in a paradigmatic shift regarding models of neural architecture. In fact, the brain is organized in distributed complex networks underpinning sensorimotor, visuospatial, language, cognitive and emotional functions. In this connectomal workframe, cerebral processing is not conceived as the sum of segregated subfunctions, but results from the integration and potentiation of parallel (even if partially overlapped) subcircuits. Such a networking model, taking into account cortical and subcortical anatomic constraints, explains interindividual variability in physiology and after brain damage, particularly in aphasiology - e.g. double dissociations during electrostimulations, as comprehension versus naming disorders, semantic versus phonemic paraphasias, or syntactic disturbances versus anomia. This dynamic organization mediated by the well-synchronized functioning of delocalized groups of interconnected neurons (rather than by discrete centers) also explains the huge potential of neuroplasticity following cerebral insult, on the condition that the axonal connectivity is preserved. According to this principle, massive surgical resection of brain regions dogmatically considered as ""critical"" in a localisationist view can be achieved with no functional deficit, as the removal of Broca's area - which is not the speech area - without disorders. This connectomal account of neural processing may have major implications in cognitive neurosciences and in therapeutic management of brain-damaged patients. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Awake surgery; Brain connectome; Direct electrical stimulation; Low-grade gliomas; Neuroplasticity; Serial mappings",,2-s2.0-85018647191

Our method is based upon a multi-channel Adaptive Resonance Associative Memory (ARAM) network architecture to obtain multiple sensory sources for topological map building. It comprises two layers: input and memory. The input layer collects sensory data and incrementally clusters the obtained information into a set of topological nodes. In the memory layer, the clustered information is used as a topological map where nodes are associated with actions. The advantages of the proposed method are: (1) it does not require high-level cognitive processes and prior knowledge to make it work in a natural environment; and (2) it can process multiple sensory sources simultaneously in continuous space, which is crucial for real-world robot navigation. Thus, we combine our Topological Gaussian ARAM method (TGARAM) with incremental principle component analysis to constitute a basis for topological map building. Lastly, the proposed method was validated using several standardized benchmark datasets. © 2016 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Adaptive resonance theory; Place cell learning; SLAM; Topological map; Unsupervised learning","Associative processing; Brain; Cells; Cytology; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Principal component analysis; Robots; Unsupervised learning; Adaptive resonance theory; Catastrophic forgetting; Hippocampal place cells; Place cell; Principle component analysis; SLAM; Stability-plasticity dilemma; Topological map; Topology",2-s2.0-84982993422

Next-generation sequencing has highlighted the crucial contribution of de novo mutations to the genetic architecture of EEs as well as to their underlying genetic heterogeneity. Our previous whole-exome sequencing study of 264 parent-child trios revealed more than 290 candidate genes in which only a single individual had a de novo variant. We sought to identify additional pathogenic variants in a subset (n = 27) of these genes via targeted sequencing in an unsolved cohort of 531 individuals with a diverse range of EEs. We report 17 individuals with pathogenic variants in seven of the 27 genes, defining a genetic etiology in 3.2% of this unsolved cohort. Our results provide definitive evidence that de novo mutations in SLC1A2 and CACNA1A cause specific EEs and expand the compendium of clinically relevant genotypes for GABRB3. We also identified EEs caused by genetic variants in ALG13, DNM1, and GNAO1 and report a mutation in IQSEC2. Notably, recurrent mutations accounted for 7/17 of the pathogenic variants identified. As a result of high-depth coverage, parental mosaicism was identified in two out of 14 cases tested with mutant allelic fractions of 5%–6% in the unaffected parents, carrying significant reproductive counseling implications.

Such subsystems are thought to reflect functional hierarchy and segregation within the network. Because preclinical models can inform translational studies of neuropsychiatric disorders, partitioning of the DMN in nonhuman species, which has previously not been reported, may inform both physiology and pathophysiology of the human DMN. In this study, we sought to identify constituents of the rat DMN using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging. After identifying DMN using a group-level independent-component analysis on the rs-fMRI data, modularity analyses fractionated the DMNinto an anterior and a posterior subsystem,whichwere further segregated into five modules. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography demonstrates a close relationship between fiber density and the functional connectivity between DMN regions, and provides anatomical evidence to support the detected DMN subsystems. Finally, distinct modulation was seen within and between these DMN subcomponents using a neurocognitive aging model.

While qualitative methods, taking advantage of the human cognitive system, have a great potential in addressing a wide range of problems in futures studies, this potential is mostly due to the human visual logic that can handle the task of imagining future scenarios much better than mathematical logic. On the other hand, computational methods benefit from the advantages of silicon-based systems namely speed, large memory, rapid networking, and communication. Hence, it would be extremely beneficial to come up with a solution that combines the positive sides of both qualitative and computational approaches.

Considering the advantages of MDA in phase transitions, this study proposes that integrating conventional OOAD instruction with the MDA framework and describing transition relations in diagrammatic representations might improve students' understanding of the transitions. This study used an empirical design that involved using two treatments (MDA-based and conventional instruction) to examine the relevance of MDA-based instruction in the effective understanding of the transitions on the basis of cognitive load theory, the split-attention principle, and theories of representation format. The results indicate that, compared with conventional instruction, MDA-based instruction is more efficient because it improves mental efficiency by reducing extraneous cognitive load.

For these CM2MNs, due to dynamic spectrum access (DSA) nature, there exists possibly unidirectional opportunistic wireless fading links and thus traditional flow control mechanisms at link level do not fit anymore. Furthermore, effective end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control is still required to provide a reliable transportation for such multihop CM2M communications. Facing the above challenges, we propose a novel statistical QoS control mechanism through cooperative relaying, realizing virtual multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications at session level. In particular, a probabilistic network coded routing algorithm and the statistical QoS guarantee are first proposed to coordinate and cooperate tremendous machines. Next, based on the proposed guarantee and routing algorithm, the statistical QoS control mechanism is designed to enable MIMO communications for the session traffic. Specifically, the diversity mode is used to deal with PS's opportunistic nature and wireless fading, and the spatial multiplexing mode is employed to obtain the maximum end-to-end throughput. Simulation results confirm that under our control solution, the great improvements of end-to-end delay violation probability are obtained, thus practically facilitating network coded multipath routing in large CM2MNs. © 2015 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; cooperative relay; effective capacity; machine-to-machine (M2M) communications; network coded multipath routing; statistical quality-of-service (QoS) control","Ad hoc networks; Cognitive radio; Cognitive systems; Cooperative communication; Data communication systems; Fading (radio); Flow control; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network coding; Network routing; Quality control; Statistics; Telecommunication networks; Cooperative relay; Effective capacity; Machine-to-machine communications; Multi path routing; Statistical quality of service; Quality of service",2-s2.0-84983001971

In this paper, we investigate a multi-band energy detection architecture based on different polyphase filter banks (PFBs), which aim to reliably sense multiple active bands by exploiting the low power leakage property of PFB. We have theoretically derived the closed-form expressions of detection probability and false alarm probability for PFBs and fast Fourier transform based detectors, respectively. Theoretical detection thresholds are therefore computed, which ensures a fair comparison for different detectors.

Throughout the history of thought, science and philosophy have addressed the problem of mind-brain from different epistemic perspectives. The first covers specific areas of reality and constructs hypotheses with limited scope and multiple inter-scientific connectivity with the aim of validating theoretical models; the second extends its systemic architecture to all that is real (including scientific activity). Development. The complexity of the mind-brain problem requires the generation of a link connecting the disciplines of philosophy and science; our onto-epistemological presuppositions therefore fall within the framework of a scientifically oriented philosophy (scientific philosophy). Emergentist materialism is defended as a coherent and verifiable philosophicalscientific solution, as opposed to other proposals developed on the basis of different ontological models (for example, interactionist dualism, functionalism, theory of identity, epiphenomenalism, and so on). Conclusions. An answer to the mind-brain problem is only feasible if based on a philosophically grounded cognitive neuroscience: emergentist materialism –an ontological postulate– holds that the mind is an emergent property (qualitative novelty) of the brain; scientific realism –an epistemological postulate– holds that cognitive neuroscience is the basic theoretical-experimental tool that allows cognitive access to both the brain and its neurocognitive processes. We consider that on the basis of this philosophical reasoning, cognitive neuroscience acquires epistemic legitimacy to be able to undertake the study of the most genuinely human mental process: consciousness. © 2016 Revista de Neurología.

The predominant classical explanation for systematicity appeals to a notion of common syntactic/symbolic structure among the systematically related capacities. Although learning is a (second-order) cognitive capacity of central interest to cognitive science, a systematic ability to learn certain cognitive capacities, i.e., second-order systematicity, has been given almost no attention in the literature. In this paper, we introduce learned associations as an instance of second-order systematicity that poses a paradox for classical theory, because this form of systematicity involves the kinds of associative constructions that were explicitly rejected by the classical explanation. Our category theoretic explanation of systematicity resolves this problem, because both first and second-order forms of systematicity are derived from the same categorical construction: universal morphisms, which generalize the notion of compositionality of constituent representations to (categorical) compositionality of constituent processes. We derive a model of systematic associative learning based on (co)recursion, which is an instance of a universal construction. These results provide further support for a category theory foundation for cognitive architecture. © 2016 Phillips, Wilson.

The origins of these biases have been linked to the operation of so-called executive functions through empirical studies varying, e.g., rate of production, modality of response, and (in dual task conditions) secondary task. We present a computational process model of random generation that accounts for a broad range of these empirical effects. The model, which operationalises a previous verbal account of random generation, is grounded in both the cognitive architectures and the executive functions literatures. As such, it instantiates a hypothesis concerning the interaction of multiple distinct executive functions in the generation of complex behaviour. In particular, it is argued on the basis of simulations of empirical findings that three cognitive factors play separable roles in random generation behaviour: cognitive load, which when high exacerbates underlying biases in a generation stage, monitoring, which when impaired results in greater inequality of response usage, and set-shifting, which when impaired results in less frequent switching between response schemas. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Executive function; Information processing model; Monitoring; Random generation; Response inhibition; Set shifting",,2-s2.0-84978060427

Application of new analytical approaches can help translate the improved understanding of early functional connectivity provided through these studies into predictive models of neurodevelopmental outcome. One approach to achieving this goal is multivariate pattern analysis, a machine-learning, pattern classification approach well-suited for high-dimensional neuroimaging data. It has previously been adapted to predict brain maturity in children and adolescents using structural and resting state-functional MRI data. In this study, we evaluated resting state-functional MRI data from 50 preterm-born infants (born at 23-29 weeks of gestation and without moderate-severe brain injury) scanned at term equivalent postmenstrual age compared with data from 50 term-born control infants studied within the first week of life. Using 214 regions of interest, binary support vector machines distinguished term from preterm infants with 84% accuracy (p < 0.0001). Inter- and intra-hemispheric connections throughout the brain were important for group categorization, indicating that widespread changes in the brain's functional network architecture associated with preterm birth are detectable by term equivalent age. Support vector regression enabled quantitative estimation of birth gestational age in single subjects using only term equivalent resting state-functional MRI data, indicating that the present approach is sensitive to the degree of disruption of brain development associated with preterm birth (using gestational age as a surrogate for the extent of disruption). This suggests that support vector regression may provide a means for predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in individual infants. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Developmental neuroimaging; Functional MRI; Infant; Multivariate pattern analysis; Prematurity","algorithm; Article; brain maturation; clinical article; controlled study; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gestational age; human; infant; interhemispheric transfer; machine learning; male; neuroimaging; predictive value; prematurity; priority journal; resting state network; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine",2-s2.0-84969498387

Yet, we have only the most rudimentary understanding of how the human brain conducts abstract symbolic transformations that underlie word and object meaning. Neuroscience has evolved a sophisticated arsenal of techniques for elucidating the architecture of conceptual representation. Nevertheless, theoretical convergence remains elusive. Here we describe several contrastive approaches to the organization of semantic knowledge, and in turn we offer our own perspective on two recurring questions in semantic memory research: (1) to what extent are conceptual representations mediated by sensorimotor knowledge (i.e., to what degree is semantic memory embodied)? (2) How might an embodied semantic system represent abstract concepts such as modularity, symbol, or proposition? To address these questions, we review the merits of sensorimotor (i.e., embodied) and amodal (i.e., disembodied) semantic theories and address the neurobiological constraints underlying each. We conclude that the shortcomings of both perspectives in their extreme forms necessitate a hybrid middle ground. We accordingly propose the Dynamic Multilevel Reactivation Framework—an integrative model predicated upon flexible interplay between sensorimotor and amodal symbolic representations mediated by multiple cortical hubs. We discuss applications of the dynamic multilevel reactivation framework to abstract and concrete concept representation and describe how a multidimensional conceptual topography based on emotion, sensation, and magnitude can successfully frame a semantic space containing meanings for both abstract and concrete words. The consideration of ‘abstract conceptual features’ does not diminish the role of logical and/or executive processing in activating, manipulating and using information stored in conceptual representations. Rather, it proposes that the materials upon which these processes operate necessarily combine pure sensorimotor information and higher-order cognitive dimensions involved in symbolic representation. © 2015, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Concreteness effect; Embodied cognition; Semantic memory; Semantic representation",,2-s2.0-84974782958

Despite decades of intensive debate, cognitive scientists have yet to reach a consensus on an explanation for this property of cognitive architecture-the basic processes and modes of composition that together afford cognitive capacity-called systematicity. Systematicity is generally considered to involve a capacity to represent/process common structural relations among the equivalently cognizable entities. However, the predominant theoretical approaches to the systematicity problem, i.e., classical (symbolic) and connectionist (subsymbolic), require arbitrary (ad hoc) assumptions to derive systematicity. That is, their core principles and assumptions do not provide the necessary and sufficient conditions from which systematicity follows, as required of a causal theory. Hence, these approaches fail to fully explain why systematicity is a (near) universal property of human cognition, albeit in restricted contexts. We review an alternative, category theory approach to the systematicity problem. As a mathematical theory of structure, category theory provides necessary and sufficient conditions for systematicity in the form of universal construction: each systematically related cognitive capacity is composed of a common component and a unique component. Moreover, every universal construction can be viewed as the optimal construction in the given context (category). From this view, universal constructions are derived from learning, as an optimization. The ultimate challenge, then, is to explain the determination of context. If context is a category, then a natural extension toward addressing this question is higher-order category theory, where categories themselves are the objects of construction. © 2016 Phillips and Wilson.","(Co)algebra; (Co)recursion; Category theory; Classicism; Compositionality; Connectionism; Systematicity; Universal construction",,2-s2.0-84982239240

This approach is composed of a long-term artificial neural network memory (LTANN-MEM), a working memory (WM) in addition to a proposed neural symbolization algorithm (NSA) which uses LTANN-MEM and WM for synthesizing symbolic models equivalent to learning examples. The proposed LTANN-MEM is composed of two separate multilayer perceptron (MLP) feed-forward neural networks as well as the working memory which is composed of a single MLP. The core idea of the proposed approach is based on memorizing the learning experience of individual perceptrons in long-term memory (LTM), so they become available to be reused in generating and developing hypotheses about the learning examples. Although this idea is generic and could be used for the purpose of symbolization in general, it is applied here in symbolic regression for Boolean domain only. The obtained results show the ability of the proposed approach to search the solutions space using learning experience stored previously in LTM to guide the search process.

Various organizations have started exploring the power of such a large user membership to influence the online buyers at social media and are attempting to engage consumers with their brands, which will finally influence their brand image. The chapter explores the extent of consumer experience and engagement, how online consumers are engaged towards a specific brand. The methodology for study is empirical evidence through netnography, and result of this study is through correlation and regression model. Findings confirm the factors contributing to consumer engagement and swarm intelligence in management of a brand at social media. © 2017 by IGI Global.

Brain-inspired neuromorphic computing systems increasingly attract research interest as an alternative to the classical von Neumann processor architecture, mainly because of the coexistence of memory and processing units. In these systems, the basic components are neurons interconnected by synapses. The neurons, based on their nonlinear dynamics, generate spikes that provide the main communication mechanism. The computational tasks are distributed across the neural network, where synapses implement both the memory and the computational units, by means of learning mechanisms such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In this work, we present an all-memristive neuromorphic architecture comprising neurons and synapses realized by using the physical properties and state dynamics of phase-change memristors. The architecture employs a novel concept of interconnecting the neurons in the same layer, resulting in level-tuned neuronal characteristics that preferentially process input information. We demonstrate the proposed architecture in the tasks of unsupervised learning and detection of multiple temporal correlations in parallel input streams. The efficiency of the neuromorphic architecture along with the homogenous neuro-synaptic dynamics implemented with nanoscale phase-change memristors represent a significant step towards the development of ultrahigh-density neuromorphic co-processors. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","computational nanotechnology; neuromorphic systems; phase-change devices","Cognitive systems; Computer architecture; Distributed computer systems; Dynamics; Memory architecture; Memristors; Nanotechnology; Network architecture; Neural networks; Communication mechanisms; Computational nanotechnology; Neuromorphic Architectures; Neuromorphic computing; Neuromorphic systems; Phase Change; Proposed architectures; Spike timing dependent plasticities; Neurons",2-s2.0-84984846408

Here we discuss a powerful class of graphical models that can be implemented as stochastic, generative neural networks. These models overcome many limitations associated with classic connectionist models, for example by exploiting unsupervised learning in hierarchical architectures (deep networks) and by taking into account top-down, predictive processing supported by feedback loops. We review some recent cognitive models based on generative networks, and we point out promising research directions to investigate neuropsychological disorders within this approach. Though further efforts are required in order to fill the gap between structured Bayesian models and more realistic, biophysical models of neuronal dynamics, we argue that generative neural networks have the potential to bridge these levels of analysis, thereby improving our understanding of the neural bases of cognition and of pathologies caused by brain damage. © 2016 Testolin and Zorzi.","Computational neuropsychology; Connectionist modeling; Deep neural networks; Probabilistic generative models; Unsupervised learning","Bayesian networks; Brain; Cognitive systems; Complex networks; Graphic methods; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Unsupervised learning; Connectionist models; Deep neural networks; Generative model; Hierarchical architectures; Neurocognitive functions; Neuropsychology; Probabilistic graphical models; Statistical distribution; Stochastic models; Article; Bayes theorem; cognitive defect; conceptual framework; connectome; feedback system; glucose homeostasis; human; learning; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nerve cell network; neuropsychology; nonhuman; signal noise ratio; signal transduction; simulation",2-s2.0-84978645461

Methods: This study, which was conducted from March 2010 to July 2014, included seven patients diagnosed with KLS in the Sleep and Wake Disorder Center of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, China). PSG and multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) were performed during their episodes and the results were evaluated. Results: Five of the seven patients were males. The mean age at KLS onset was 15.6 ± 3.6 years. The number of episodes ranged from 2 to 7. The duration of episodes lasted from 4 to 11 days. The sleep architecture and proportion were normal in most of the patients. The average value of mean sleep latency was 6.9 ± 4.1 min. No sleep-onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) was detected in three of the patients, whereas one patient experienced one period of SOREM, and such episodes occurred twice in other two patients.

This ‘neuromolecular gaze’ [Rose, N. & Abi-Rached, J. (2013) Neuro: The New Brain Sciences and the Management of the Mind, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ] also heralds new ways of intervening in the regulation of social phenomena, based on the objectification of the cerebral processes that underlie individual conducts. Neuroeconomics applies this brain-centric perspective to the study of economic decision-making. This paper engages with the two dominant approaches in neuroeconomics. The first section concentrates on the work of Paul Glimcher, who considers economic models and their correlative notion of ‘utility maximization’ as providing the neurosciences with a theoretical framework as to how the brain solves decision problems. The second section discusses the findings of behavioural neuroeconomics, which attempts to model departures from the rationality axiom by measuring the cognitive and emotional biases that have their sources in the brain’s complex architecture. Whereas both strands of neuroeconomics rely on a benchmark of economic rationality, this paper argues that they reformulate in allegedly neutral neuroscientific terms a behavioural norm that is basically moral in nature. If rational decision-making conditions economic and indeed evolutionary survival, and yet if most people regularly fail as utility optimizers, then understanding the neural causes of such failures should help people better themselves and behave as good homines œconomici. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bodies; economics; experiments; governmentality; Rationality",,2-s2.0-84975864736

At the same time, CST specify a more general Reference Cognitive Architecture, which is a reference model for the construction of application specific cognitive architectures. Differently from other Cognitive Architectures available in the literature, which are computational frameworks, CST is a toolkit, which means more flexibility in choosing specific techniques and algorithms for setting up the application architecture.

However, there is still a need for appropriate environments in such agent architectures for the modeling of the interaction between emotional and cognitive components. In this paper, we address the following research question: how to model the interaction of emotion and cognition in agent architectures so that AAs are capable of generating consistent emotional states and displaying believable emotional behaviors. We address this problem from the perspective of the development of Computational Models of Emotions (CMEs).

The robot associates movements to music perception creating an aesthetically valuable dance by using a Hidden Markov Model with a nonclassical approach. Two matrices mainly influence the model: a Transition matrix TM, and an Emission Matrix EM. The TM matrix rules the transition between two subsequent movements. The EM matrix constitutes the link between a set of movements and the perceived music features. In order to compute the EM matrix, we exploit a genetic algorithm approach. The approach makes use of two kinds of fitness functions. The first one is an internal evaluation fitness that allows the robot to autonomously learn the association between music and movements. The second one depends on the interaction with a human teacher, leading to the determination of different dance styles, which constitute the robot repertoire.

Unfortunately, traditional network security solutions fall short of addressing the unique security requirements of the emerging environment given their general emphasis on administratively managed, preconfigured security context and strong physical security mechanisms. To cope with the security challenges of this emerging environment, novel cognitive-inspired security architectures have been proposed that emphasize dynamic, autonomous trust management. Cognitive security systems take advantage of sensing and computing capabilities of smart devices to analyze raw sensor data and apply machine learning techniques to make security decisions. In this article, we present a canonical representation of cognitive security architectures and examine the practicality of using these architectures to address the security challenges of rapidly growing networks of mobile/embedded autonomous devices including the ability to identify threats simply based on symptoms, without necessarily understanding attack methods. Using authentication as the main focus, we introduce our canonical representation and define various categories of contextual information commonly used by cognitive security architectures to handle authentication requirements, and highlight key advantages and disadvantages of each category. We then examine three grand challenges facing the cognitive security research including the tension between automation and security, the unintended consequences of using machine learning techniques as a basis for making security decisions, and the revocation problem in the context of cognitive security.

As the intelligence of a Cognitive Radio system is located in the digital domain - the Cognitive Engine and associated layers - extensive research has been ongoing in that domain since Mitola published his idea in 1999. Since, a big progress has been made in the domain of architectures and algorithms making systems more efficient and highly flexible. The pace of this progress, however, is going to be impeded by hard requirements on the received and transmitted signal quality, introducing ultimate challenges on the performance of the RF analog frontend, such as in-band local oscillator harmonics, ultra low sensitivity and ultra high linearity. The RF frontend is thus likely to become the limiting technical factor in the true realization of a Cognitive Cellular System. Based on short recapitulations of the most crucial issues in RF analog design for Cognitive Systems, this article will point out why those mechanisms become responsible for the limitation of the overall performance particularly in a broadband Cognitive Cellular System. Furthermore, as part of a possible solution to ease the situation, system design of a high intermediate frequency (IF) to UHF frequency converter for cognitive radios is discussed and the performance of such a converter analyzed as a proof of concept. In addition to successfully tackling some of the challenges, such a high-IF converter enables white space operation for existing commercial devices by acting as frequency converter. From detailed measurements, the capabilities in both physical layer and application layer performance of a high-IF frontend developed out of off-the-shelf components is explained and is shown to provide negligible degradation to the commercial device being connected to. © 2016 by De Gruyter 2016.","Cognitive Radio; dynamic range; frequecy converters; high-IF architecture; linearity; TV white spaces","Cellular telephone systems; Cognitive systems; Data transfer; Data transfer rates; Digital radio; Frequency converters; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network layers; Radio systems; Application layers; Commercial Devices; Dynamic range; Intermediate frequencies; linearity; Off-the-shelf components; Transmitted signal; Tv white spaces; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84978389600

The recent ascendance of cognitive phenomenology in philosophy has important implications for biologically-inspired cognitive architectures and the role that these models can play in understanding the fundamental nature of consciousness. To the extent that cognitive phenomenology occurs, it provides a new route to a deeper understanding of consciousness via neurocomputational studies of cognition. This route involves identifying computational correlates of consciousness in neurocomputational models of high-level cognitive functions that are associated with subjective mental states. Here we develop this idea and compile a summary of potential neurocomputational correlates of consciousness that have been proposed/recognized during the last several years based on biologically-inspired cognitive architectures. We conclude that the identification and study of computational correlates of consciousness will lead to a better understanding of phenomenal consciousness, a framework for creating a conscious machine, and a better understanding of the mind-brain problem in general. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For some timing tasks, e.g. reaction time and discrimination of temporal stimuli in working memory, the associations with intelligence are likely to involve top-down mechanisms such as attention. However, studies on repetitive, automatic motor timing tasks indicate that correlations between intelligence and timing also may reflect bottom-up mechanisms, i.e. basic neural properties that influence both the temporal accuracy of behavior and cognitive processes. Here, we study the genetic architecture of the associations between intelligence, perceptual timing (auditory rhythm discrimination) and motor timing (finger tapping) in a large twin cohort. Specifically, we hypothesized that the associations between these tasks on the phenotypic level involve broad pleiotropic genetic effects that influence all three tasks, as well as additional genetic effects on the covariation between perceptual and motor timing. Phenotypic associations between the variables were low to moderate, with Pearson's correlations in the range 0.17-0.32. Trivariate twin modeling showed that the associations between the three variables were essentially due to shared genetic influences. In support of the hypotheses, we found evidence for pleiotropic effects on motor timing, perceptual timing, and intelligence, as well as additional genetic covariation between the two timing tasks that was not shared with intelligence. We conclude, first, that genetic factors underlying intelligence may involve genes which influence brain properties of importance for the temporal accuracy of neural processing. We discuss possible neural substrates of such effects. Secondly, the correlation between motor and perceptual timing also partly explained by genetic influences that are unrelated to intelligence. © 2016 Elsevier Inc..","Intelligence; Perception; Rhythm; Tapping; Timing; Twin",,2-s2.0-84963957962

By using graph-analytical measures, recent studies indicate that patients with schizophrenia exhibit changes in the organizational principles of whole-brain networks and that these changes relate to cognitive symptoms. However, there has not been a systematic investigation of functional brain network changes in schizophrenia to test the consistency of these changes across multiple studies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all available functional graph-analytical studies in patients with schizophrenia. Effect size measures were derived from each study and entered in a random-effects meta-analytical model. All models were tested for effects of potential moderator variables as well as for the presence of publication bias. The results of a total of n = 13 functional neuroimaging studies indicated that brain networks in patients with schizophrenia exhibit significant decreases in measures of local organization (g = -0.56, P =. 02) and significant decreases in small-worldness (g = -0.65, P =. 01) whereas global short communication paths seemed to be preserved (g = 0.26, P =. 32).

Background: Evidence-based design is a field of study that emphasizes the importance of using credible data in order to influence the design process. It addresses whether/how the design and operation of buildings support positive health outcomes through a growing collection of solutions informed by research and practical knowledge. In order to acquire this knowledge, we must consider the environment in a very precise and measurable way, which can then be investigated quantitatively with regard to various human behaviors and cognitive processes. Topical Headings: Space Syntax theory and methods are concerned with understanding how spaces are arranged and connected to one another. It provides quantitative measures of individual spaces and of the entire layout, thereby achieving great accuracy. Space Syntax researchers have used graph theory to define spatial measures and have produced computer tools to quantify the relational properties of spaces and to provide numerical and display values for each. Moreover, they have developed more precise tools that can be embedded within basic Space Syntax concepts in order to augment the credibility of the acquired data. Conclusion: The study elaborates on the effectiveness of Space Syntax and its newly developed measures for the field of healthcare facility design and research. We present a comprehensive model that brings together these measures with their correlated behavioral and perceptual consequences, thereby providing a point of departure for further investigation and exploration. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","behavior; evidence-based design; healthcare; Space Syntax; spatial analysis","behavior; field study; health care facility; human; human experiment; quantitative study; scientist; spatial analysis; theoretical model; topical drug administration; architecture; construction work and architectural phenomena; procedures; Architecture as Topic; Facility Design and Construction; Health Facilities; Spatial Analysis",2-s2.0-84983000714

Hidden beneath this fascinating paradigm is a fundamental question: by cumulatively interacting with different objects, how can an agent abstract the underlying cause-effect relations to predict and creatively exploit potential affordances of novel objects in the context of sought goals? Re-enacting this Aesop's Fable task on a humanoid within an open-ended 'learning-prediction-abstraction' loop, we address this problem and (i) present a brain-guided neural framework that emulates rapid one-shot encoding of ongoing experiences into a long-term memory and (ii) propose four task-agnostic learning rules (elimination, growth, uncertainty and status quo) that correlate predictions from remembered past experiences with the unfolding present situation to gradually abstract the underlying causal relations. Driven by the proposed architecture, the ensuing robot behaviours illustrated causal learning and anticipation similar to natural agents. Results further demonstrate that by cumulatively interacting with few objects, the predictions of the robot in case of novel objects converge close to the physical law, i.e. the Archimedes principle: this being independent of both the objects explored during learning and the order of their cumulative exploration. © 2016 The Authors.","Affordances; Animal cognition; Cause-effect relations; Developmental robotics; Episodic memory","Cognitive systems; Affordances; Animal cognition; Cause-effect; Developmental robotics; Episodic memory; Forecasting; behavior; episodic memory; human; learning; prediction; robotics; animal; biological model; hominid; learning; long term memory; nerve cell network; physiology; Animals; Hominidae; Humans; Learning; Memory, Long-Term; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net",2-s2.0-84983027548

One explanation for this critical period is the idea that children have access to a set of language learning processes or mechanisms unavailable to adults. From this perspective, developmental change is explained in terms of a discontinuity of learning processes. We suggest that this is not the only possible explanation for developmental change in language learning outcomes. Instead, we propose that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition (in particular, we highlight statistical learning) are largely continuous across the lifespan. From this perspective, developmental change is explained in terms of experience, differences in the input with age, and maturational changes in the cognitive architecture supporting learning, even while the learning process itself operates continuously across developmental time.

We hypothesize that the DMN may be altered in Williams syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder characterized by an unique cognitive and behavioral phenotype. In this study, we assessed the architecture of the DMN using fMRI in WS patients and typically developing matched controls (sex and age) in terms of FC and volumetry of the DMN. Moreover, we complemented the analysis with a functional connectome approach. After excluding participants due to movement artifacts (n = 3), seven participants with WS and their respective matched controls were included in the analyses. A decreased FC between the DMN regions was observed in the WS group when compared with the typically developing group. Specifically, we found a decreased FC in a posterior hub of the DMN including the precuneus, calcarine and the posterior cingulate of the left hemisphere. The functional connectome approach showed a focalized and global increased FC connectome in the WS group. The reduced FC of the posterior hub of the DMN in the WS group is consistent with immaturity of the brain FC patterns and may be associated with the singularity of their visual spatial phenotype. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,2-s2.0-84978806397

However, identifying genes that give rise to individual variation in susceptibility to lead toxicity is challenging in human populations. Objectives: Our goal was to use Drosophila melanogaster to identify evolutionarily conserved candidate genes associated with individual variation in susceptibility to lead exposure. Methods: To identify candidate genes associated with variation in susceptibility to lead toxicity, we measured effects of lead exposure on development time, viability and adult activity in the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and performed genome-wide association analyses to identify candidate genes. We used mutants to assess functional causality of candidate genes and constructed a genetic network associated with variation in sensitivity to lead exposure, on which we could superimpose human orthologs. results: We found substantial heritabilities for all three traits and identified candidate genes associated with variation in susceptibility to lead exposure for each phenotype. The genetic architectures that determine variation in sensitivity to lead exposure are highly polygenic. Gene ontology and network analyses showed enrichment of genes associated with early development and function of the nervous system. conclusions: Drosophila melanogaster presents an advantageous model to study the genetic underpinnings of variation in susceptibility to lead toxicity. Evolutionary conservation of cellular pathways that respond to toxic exposure allows predictions regarding orthologous genes and pathways across phyla.

It proposes a method borrowed from the literary theory of Northrop Frye – archetypal criticism – for identifying the four basic forms of emotional architecture that characterise the myths of particular nations: tragic, romantic, comic and satiric. The study of nationalism has long acknowledged the importance of narrative in political behaviour. But consideration of how distinct types of narratives affect specific emotions is missing. The ‘narrative turn’ in the social sciences, which has responded to instrumentalist scepticism, has thus far focused on the cognitive functions of narrative. That is, how narrative influences the acquisition and interpretation of information and how stories are used to construct or reinforce a collective understanding of events. The undertheorised dimension of narrative in nationalism relates to the emotional structures embedded within narrative. This is where this paper makes its contribution. © The author(s) 2016.

Recent studies of rare structural and sequence variants have identified hundreds of loci involved in ASD, but our knowledge of the overall genetic architecture and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remains incomplete. Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in the adult nervous system but exert an excitatory action in immature neurons. GlyRs containing the α;2 subunit are highly expressed in the embryonic brain, where they promote cortical interneuron migration and the generation of excitatory projection neurons. We previously identified a rare microdeletion of the X-linked gene GLRA2, encoding the GlyR α;2 subunit, in a boy with autism. The microdeletion removes the terminal exons of the gene (GLRA2 Δex8-9). Here, we sequenced 400 males with ASD and identified one de novo missense mutation, p.R153Q, absent from controls. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated that the GLRA2 Δex8 - 9 protein failed to localize to the cell membrane, while the R153Q mutation impaired surface expression and markedly reduced sensitivity to glycine. Very recently, an additional de novo missense mutation (p.N136S) was reported in a boy with ASD, and we show that this mutation also reduced cell-surface expression and glycine sensitivity.

Previous studies in these neurodevelopmental disorders have demonstrated functional abnormalities and alterations of white matter microstructural integrity in specific brain regions. These findings suggest that the global organization of brain networks is affected in DCD and ASD and support the hypothesis of a ‘dys-connectivity syndrome’ from a network perspective. No studies have compared the structural covariance networks between ASD and DCD in order to look for the signature of DCD independent of comorbid autism. Here, we aimed to address the question of whether abnormal connectivity in DCD overlaps that seen in autism or comorbid DCD-autism. Using graph theoretical analysis, we investigated differences in global and regional topological properties of structural brain networks in 53 children: 8 ASD children with DCD (DCD+ASD), 15 ASD children without DCD (ASD), 11 with DCD only, and 19 typically developing (TD) children. We constructed separate structural correlation networks based on cortical thickness derived from Freesurfer. The children were assessed on the Movement-ABC and the Beery Test of Visual Motor Integration. Behavioral results demonstrated that the DCD group and DCD+ASD group scored on average poorer than the TD and ASD groups on various motor measures. Furthermore, although the brain networks of all groups exhibited small-world properties, the topological architecture of the networks was significantly altered in children with ASD compared with DCD and TD. ASD children showed increased normalized path length and higher values of clustering coefficient. Also, paralimbic regions exhibited nodal clustering coefficient alterations in singular disorders. These changes were disorder-specific, and included alterations in clustering coefficient in the isthmus of the right cingulate gyrus and the pars orbitalis of the right inferior frontal gyrus in ASD children, and DCD-related increases in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Children meeting criteria for both DCD and ASD exhibited topological changes that were more widespread from those seen in children with only DCD, i.e. children with DCD+ASD showed alterations of clustering coefficient in (para)limbic regions, primary areas, and association areas. The DCD+ASD group showed changes in clustering coefficient in the left association cortex relative to the ASD group. Finally, the DCD+ASD group shared ASD-specific abnormalities in the pars orbitalis of right inferior frontal gyrus, which was hypothesized to reflect atypical emotional-cognitive processing. Our results provide evidence that DCD and ASD are neurodevelopmental disorders with a low degree of overlap in abnormalities in connectivity. The co-occurrence of DCD+ASD was also associated with a distinct topological pattern, highlighting the unique neural signature of comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,2-s2.0-85027943824

There are many open-source architecture frameworks for UAS that claim the autonomous operation of UAS, but they still have two main open issues: (1) level of autonomy, being in most of the cases limited and (2) versatility, being most of them designed specifically for some applications or aerial platforms. As a response to these needs and issues, this paper presents Aerostack, a system architecture and open-source multi-purpose software framework for autonomous multi-UAS operation. To provide higher degrees of autonomy, Aerostack's system architecture integrates state of the art concepts of intelligent, cognitive and social robotics, based on five layers: reactive, executive, deliberative, reflective, and social. To be a highly versatile practical solution, Aerostack's open-source software framework includes the main components to execute the architecture for fully autonomous missions of swarms of UAS; a collection of ready-to-use and flight proven modular components that can be reused by the users and developers; and compatibility with five well known aerial platforms, as well as a high number of sensors. Aerostack has been validated during three years by its successful use on many research projects, international competitions and exhibitions. To corroborate this fact, this paper also presents Aerostack carrying out a fictional fully autonomous indoors search and rescue mission. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Competition; Computer architecture; Computer programming; Computer software; Open systems; Robotics; Software engineering; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Autonomous operations; International competitions; Level of autonomies; Open source architecture; Practical solutions; Software frameworks; System architectures; Unmanned aerial systems; Open source software",2-s2.0-84979788535

In past years cognitive radio made its way to enable more intelligent and autonomous wireless networks but it has encountered several practical problems which have slowed down the massive adoption of this technology.

Typically, these sensors come with APIs as specified by the manufacturer and hence integrating newer sensors on the existing and newer platforms as well as interoperability with other platform sub-systems is highly taxing. Also, these sensors open the realm of possibilities for further automation of vehicles. Types and levels of automation are a big challenge as to how much automation is possible and should be allowed, and how to effectively use the sensors for automation and informing the vehicle crew. The NATO Generic Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) proposes an open architecture approach to land vehicle platform design and integration and standardises the interfaces and protocols for military vehicle systems integration. However, the NGVA does not specify any feedback mechanisms exploiting the available sensor data to support the vehicle crew. In this paper, we present a simple crew assistance system which integrates NGVA-compliant sensors and includes an adaptable rule-based interface for sensor data processing. This crew assistance system takes into consideration human factors such as human cognitive and physical workload and informs the crew members about ongoing critical events derived from available sensor data using visual, audio and haptic feedbacks in the form of alarms to increase their Situational Awareness by raising alarms on detection of specific events and making intelligent future predictions. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Architecture; Automation; Automobile manufacture; Computer architecture; Data handling; Feedback; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Interoperability; Military communications; Network architecture; Vehicles; Civilian vehicles; Feedback mechanisms; Future predictions; Levels of automation; Physical workloads; Sensor data processing; Situational awareness; Vehicle architecture; Military vehicles",2-s2.0-84979780275

While it is known that changes to stimuli affect action cascading mechanisms, it is unknown whether action cascading changes when sensory stimuli are not manipulated, but the neural architecture to process these stimuli is altered. In the current study we test this hypothesis using prelingually deaf subjects as a model to answer this question. We use a system neurophysiological approach using event-related potentials (ERPs) and source localization techniques. We show that prelingually deaf subjects show improvements in action cascading. However, this improvement is most likely not due to changes at the perceptual (P1-ERP) and attentional processing level (N1-ERP), but due to changes at the response selection level (P3-ERP). It seems that the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is important for these effects to occur, because the TPJ comprises overlapping networks important for the processing of sensory information and the selection of responses. Sensory deprivation thus affects cognitive processes downstream of sensory processing and only these seem to be important for behavioral improvements in situations requiring complex sensorimotor processes and action cascading.",,,2-s2.0-84975487855

These artifacts, in particular instances of “symbolic” body ornaments, have been considered proof of “behavioral modernity” and used to draw inferences about the cognitive equivalence between primitive and modern human populations. Very recently, however, proponents of holistic mapping and material engagement theory have provided two separate lines of argument criticizing the notion of behavioral modernity and its use in cognitive archaeology. Major problems with this concept have been identified at both the epistemological and metaphysical levels. In this paper I will articulate a critique of behavioral modernity by integrating the preliminary tenets of the aforementioned approaches within a unitary perspective. This integrative process will provide close examination of behavioral modernity under the lights of scientific eliminativism. I will argue that behavioral modernity fails to instantiate a natural kind and thus it cannot be the object of reliable scientific analysis. Furthermore, behavioral modernity does also not represent a useful functional kind, for it offers no explanatory role in the mapping of artifacts and mental architectures. The current use of behavioral modernity in cognitive archaeology is grounded in a series of arbitrary categories and unwarranted inferences. In consequence, this notion can, and in fact, does harm this domain, because it fosters incommensurable theories. For these reasons, I conclude that behavioral modernity ought to be eliminated from the cognitive archaeology vocabulary. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Behavioral modernity; Cognitive archaeology; Holistic mapping; Material engagement; Scientific eliminativism","archaeological evidence; archaeology; artifact; mapping; modernity; Neanderthal; Paleolithic",2-s2.0-84937242900

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different dietary levels of folic acid (FA) on postnatal cerebellar morphology, including the architecture and organisation of the various layers. A total of forty male OFA rats (a Sprague-Dawley strain), 5 weeks old, were classified into the following four dietary groups: FA deficient (0 mg/kg FA); FA supplemented (8 mg/kg FA); FA supra-supplemented (40 mg/kg FA); and control (2 mg/kg FA) (all n 10 per group). Rats were fed ad libitum for 30 d. The cerebellum was quickly removed and processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Slides were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (to label Bergmann glia), calbindin (to label Purkinje cells) and NeuN (to label post-mitotic neurons). Microscopic analysis revealed two types of defect: partial disappearance of fissures and/or neuronal ectopia, primarily in supra-supplemented animals (incidence of 80 %, P≤0·01), but also in deficient and supplemented groups (incidence of 40 %, P≤0·05), compared with control animals. The primary fissure was predominantly affected, sometimes accompanied by defects in the secondary fissure. Our findings show that growing rats fed an FA-modified diet, including both deficient and supplemented diets, have an increased risk of disturbances in cerebellar corticogenesis. Defects caused by these diets may have functional consequences in later life. The present study is the first to demonstrate that cerebellar morphological defects can arise from deficient, as well as high, FA levels in the diet. © The Authors 2016.","Cerebellum; Cognitive deficits; Corticogenesis; Folic acid; Postnatal morphology; Supplementation","calbindin; folic acid; glial fibrillary acidic protein; neuron specific nuclear protein; folic acid; vitamin B complex; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; brain development; brain function; brain slice; controlled study; diet supplementation; dietary intake; ectopic tissue; folic acid blood level; histology; immunohistochemistry; male; microscopy; molecular dynamics; neuronal ectopia; nonhuman; postnatal development; protein determination; protein function; rat; animal; Brain Diseases; cerebellum; complication; diet; dietary supplement; disease model; drug effects; folic acid deficiency; growth, development and aging; newborn; nutritional status; pathology; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Brain Diseases; Cerebellum; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Disease Models, Animal; Folic Acid; Folic Acid Deficiency; Male; Nutritional Status; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Vitamin B Complex",2-s2.0-84966550394

This has resulted in solutions being proposed for securing these devices, usually in stand-alone mode. Medical devices are however becoming increasingly interconnected and interoperable as a way to improve patient safety, decrease false alarms, and reduce clinician cognitive workload. Given the nature of interoperable medical devices (IMDs), attacks on IMDs can have devastating consequences. This work outlines our effort in understanding the threats faced by IMDs, an important first step in eventually designing secure interoperability architectures. A useful way of performing threat analysis of any system is to use attack trees. Attack trees are conceptual, multi-leveled diagrams showing how an asset, or target, might be attacked. They provide a formal, methodical way of describing the threats to a system. Developing attack trees for any system is however non-trivial and often requires considerable expertise in identifying the various attack vectors. IMDs are typically deployed in hospitals by clinical engineers who may not possess such expertise. We therefore develop a methodology that will enable the automated generation of attack trees for IMDs based on a description of the IMD operational workflow and list of safety hazards that need to be avoided during its operation. Both these pieces of information can be provided by the users of IMDs in a care facility. The contributions of this paper are: (1) a methodology for automated generation of attack trees for IMDs using process modeling and hazard analysis, and (2) a demonstration of the viability of the methodology for a specific IMD setup called Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA-IMD), which is used for delivering pain medication to patients in hospitals. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Biomedical equipment; Forestry; Hazards; Hospitals; Automated generation; Clinical engineers; Cognitive workloads; Individual devices; Interoperability architecture; Interoperable medical devices; Patient-controlled analgesia; Stand-alone modes; Interoperability",2-s2.0-84979221761

At the same time, novel insights from cognitive neuroscience research have begun to influence various disciplines, leading to a turn to cognition and emotion in the fields of planning and architectural design. Since 2003, the Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture has been supporting 'neuro-architecture' as a way to connect neuroscience and the study of behavioral responses to the built environment. Among the many topics related to multisensory perceptual integration and embodiment, the concept of hapticity was recently introduced, suggesting a pivotal role of tactile perception and haptic imagery in architectural appraisal. Arguments have thus risen in favor of the existence of shared cognitive foundations between hapticity and the supramodal functional architecture of the human brain. Precisely, supramodality refers to the functional feature of defined brain regions to process and represent specific information content in a more abstract way, independently of the sensory modality conveying such information to the brain. Here, we highlight some commonalities and differences between the concepts of hapticity and supramodality according to the distinctive perspectives of architecture and cognitive neuroscience. This comparison and connection between these two different approaches may lead to novel observations in regard to people-environment relationships, and even provide empirical foundations for a renewed evidence-based design theory. © 2016 Papale, Chiesi, Rampinini, Pietrini and Ricciardi.","Architecture and design; Hapticity; Neuroscience; Review; Sensory perception; Supramodality; Touch; Vision",,2-s2.0-84979996113

Verbal instructions do not typically have a one-to-one mapping to robot actions, due to various reasons: economy of spoken language, e.g., one short instruction might indeed correspond to a complex sequence of robot actions, and details about action execution might be omitted; grounding, e.g., some actions might need to be added or adapted due to environmental contingencies; embodiment, e.g., a robot might have different means than the human ones to obtain the goals that the instruction refers to. We propose a general cognitive architecture to deal with these issues, based on three steps: i) language-based semantic reasoning on the instruction (high-level), ii) formulation of goals in robot symbols and probabilistic planning to achieve them (mid-level), iii) action execution (low-level). The description of the mid-level is the main focus of this paper. The robot plans are adapted to the current scenario, perceived in real-time and continuously updated, taking in consideration the robot capabilities, modeled through the concept of affordances: this allows for flexibility and creativity in the task execution.

Such an interpretation has important impacts on several cognitive capabilities and manifestations of intelligence, such as prediction and planning. In this paper, a new framework based on denoising Auto-encoders (dA) is proposed which allows an agent to explore its environment and actively learn the affordances of objects and tools by observing the consequences of acting on them. The dA serves as a unified framework to fuse multi-modal data and retrieve an entire missing modality or a feature within a modality given information about other modalities. This work has two major contributions. First, since training the dA is done in continuous space, there will be no need to discretize the dataset and higher accuracies in inference can be achieved with respect to approaches in which data discretization is required (e.g. Bayesian networks). Second, by fixing the structure of the dA, knowledge can be added incrementally making the architecture particularly useful in online learning scenarios.

The increasing need to fly unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in the national airspace system (NAS) to perform missions of vital importance to national security, defense, and science has pushed ahead the design and implementation of new radio platforms. However, a lot still has to be done to improve those radios in terms of performance and capabilities. In addition, an important aspect to account for is hardware cost and the feasibility to implement these radios using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. UAV radios come with numerous technical challenges and their development involves contributions at different levels of the design. Cognitive algorithms need to be developed in order to perform agile communications using appropriate frequency allocation while maintaining safe and efficient operations in the NAS and, digital reconfigurable architectures have to be designed in order to ensure a prompt response to environmental changes. Command and control (C2) communications have to be preserved during standard operations while crew operations have to be minimized. It is clear that UAV radios have to be software-defined systems, where size, weight and power consumption (SWaP) are critical parameters.

The salience network (SN), anchored in the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, plays a crucial role in this process through rapid detection of goal-relevant events and facilitation of access to appropriate cognitive resources. Here, we leverage the subsecond resolution of large multisession fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project and apply novel graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN. We show that the large-scale brain dynamics of the SN are characterized by several distinctive and robust properties. First, the SN demonstrated the highest levels of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks, including the frontoparietal network (FPN), the cingulate–opercular network (CON), and the ventral and dorsal attention networks (VAN and DAN). Second, dynamic functional interactions of the SN were among the most spatially varied in the brain. Third, SN nodes maintained a consistently high level of network centrality over time, indicating that this network is a hub for facilitating flexible cross-network interactions. Fourth, time-varying connectivity profiles of the SN were distinct from all other prefrontal control systems. Fifth, temporal flexibility of the SN uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. Importantly, each of these results was also observed in a second retest dataset, demonstrating the robustness of our findings. Our study provides fundamental new insights into the distinct dynamic functional architecture of the SN and demonstrates how this network is uniquely positioned to facilitate interactions with multiple functional systems and thereby support a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain. © 2016 Chen et al.",,"brain; connectome; control system; dorsal attention network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; salience network; theoretical model; adult; algorithm; biological model; brain; brain mapping; cognition; diagnostic imaging; female; kinetics; male; nerve cell network; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; time factor; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Female; Humans; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neural Pathways; Time Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84979080357

Therefore, we used fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) to investigate the resting state spontaneous activity differences between young adult smokers and nonsmokers.

Moreover, the fALFF values of the caudate were correlated with craving and RSFC strength between the caudate and ACC was associated with the cognitive control impairments in young adult smokers.

The cognitive psychologist Ulric Neisser explored the implications of affordances in his book ""Cognition and Reality"" in 1976. He introduced the perceptual cycle as a new model for perception/action coupling, a model that today can be considered a comprehensive model for interactions. Don Norman introduced the term affordances to the design community in his book ""The Design of Everyday Things"" in 1986. This paper examines the role of affordances for design in light of the new findings in cognitive science and neuroscience and presents a framework for designing affordance that is directly actionable as a representation that provides the right information for action at the right moment in the right form and in the right place.

This letter aims to minimize the transmit power at ST while guaranteeing minimum information rates and the amounts of harvested energy at PR and SR, and constraining the potential eavesdropping rate at PR. Considering imperfect channel state information at ST, we propose a joint robust beamforming and transformation matrix at ST and power splitting at the PR and SR schemes, which can minimize the transmit power in the worst case. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","cognitive relay network; power splitting; Robust beamforming; secrecy wireless information and power transfer","Beamforming; Channel capacity; Channel state information; Linear transformations; Relay control systems; Security systems; Transmitters; Cognitive relay networks; Imperfect channel state information; Information and power transfers; Minimum information; Power splitting; Robust beamforming; Signal transmission; Transformation matrices; Signal receivers",2-s2.0-84976477515

Sensing of spectrum holes in a particular spectrum is one of the important concepts in implementing a CR system. In cognitive radio system the foremost concept is sensing the holes (spaces) in the frequency spectrum allotted and it facilitates a way that how effectively and efficiently the bandwidth is used by finding the spectrum holes in a designated spectrum. Among the various methods available for spectrum sensing, cyclostationary detection is found to be more effective and efficient. This cyclostationary feature mainly focuses on detecting whether the primary user is present or absent. By using cyclic cross-periodogram matrix, the calculation of threshold of a signal is carried out to find the existence of noise or signal. The difficulty in evaluating the targeted threshold can be overcome by means of training an artificial neural network and extract cyclostationary feature by FFT accumulation method. This paper is proposing hardware architecture for cyclostationary feature detection using FFT accumulation method and artificial neural network. The proposed method is implemented using FPGA. From the synthesis report it is found that the maximum frequency of operation is 78MHz. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Cognitive radio; Cyclostationary; Energy detector; FFT; FPGA; Neural network etc",,2-s2.0-84978677662

Unfortunately, the unfavorable high-dimensional nature of neuroimaging data, but a limited small number of samples available, makes it challenging to build a robust computer-aided diagnosis system. Machine learning techniques have been considered as a useful tool in this respect and, among various methods, sparse regression has shown its validity in the literature. However, to our best knowledge, the existing sparse regression methods mostly try to select features based on the optimal regression coefficients in one step. We argue that since the training feature vectors are composed of both informative and uninformative or less informative features, the resulting optimal regression coefficients are inevidently affected by the uninformative or less informative features. To this end, we first propose a novel deep architecture to recursively discard uninformative features by performing sparse multi-task learning in a hierarchical fashion. We further hypothesize that the optimal regression coefficients reflect the relative importance of features in representing the target response variables. In this regard, we use the optimal regression coefficients learned in one hierarchy as feature weighting factors in the following hierarchy, and formulate a weighted sparse multi-task learning method. Lastly, we also take into account the distributional characteristics of samples per class and use clustering-induced subclass label vectors as target response values in our sparse regression model. In our experiments on the ADNI cohort, we performed both binary and multi-class classification tasks in AD/MCI diagnosis and showed the superiority of the proposed method by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Deep architecture; Feature selection; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Multi-task learning; Positron emission topography (PET); Sparse least squared regression","amyloid beta protein[1-42]; biological marker; tau protein; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; anterior commissure; Article; cerebellum; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; deep sparse multitask learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; gray matter; human; learning test; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; posterior commissure; predictive value; priority journal; regression analysis; response variable; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; white matter; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; pathology; procedures; support vector machine; Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Positron-Emission Tomography; Regression Analysis; Sensitivity and Specificity; Support Vector Machine",2-s2.0-84929692240

This paper via qualitative research of variety of sources explores the stability and persistence of a traditional 2D paper-based approach in the light of Institutional theory. The paper illustrates how the traditional approach is embedded within AEC culture by considering the regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive aspects. These aspects support each other, thus providing even more stability and support for the existing values and ways of working. The aim of this work is to provide some insight into reasons for slower penetration of the BIM based construction.

Methods In total, 12 patients with AD (mean age: 79.0±4.1 years old) were enrolled in this study. The following tests were performed: the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for the assessment of BPSD, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive function, and PSG for evaluation of sleep architecture. After baseline examinations, patients were treated with memantine according to a standard prescription protocol. After being treated with 20 mg/day of memantine for 4 weeks, examinations were carried out again. Results All subjects completed the trial. The mean MMSE and NPI scores were 22.6±3.4 and 13.8±12.9, respectively. Treatment with memantine significantly decreased the NPI score (5.8±4.3, p<0.01).

In order to understand how meaningful interpretations of space give rise to urban conflict, this paper examines the architectural expansions of two Toronto museums. Both projects were fiercely opposed by local creative and professional class residents—a group who might be expected to welcome elite architecture and cultural investment. To explain the origins of this conflict, I demonstrate how the museum leadership and surrounding community understood the spatial context of the expansion projects in strikingly different ways. While the former group saw Toronto as a “global city” and looked to international landmarks for precedents, the latter saw Toronto as a “city of neighborhoods” and were more concerned with how the projects contributed to more mundane aspects of the neighborhoods such as parks and playgrounds.

The research team sought to understand how stress is spoken about as well as experienced in professional creative courses. Terms such as stress, stressful, or being stressed represent both the negative and positive aspects associated with learning. As interior architecture (IA) educators, could the positive aspects be facilitated in the future, while the negative aspects are reduced, by building on the knowledge gained through this study? A number of issues were revealed through which tension was demonstrated as grounds for stress to develop. The issues arising include conflicting expectations between the university, staff, and students; lack of student understanding of the core discipline activities and culture; student levels of maturity; individual variation in response to learning situations, such as design studios, group work, or industry placements; and the university context and culture. In turn, these issues were often linked to miscommunication-that is, although concepts and issues were being addressed through interactions in the university context, what was being said or demonstrated was not what was being heard or understood and applied by the students. Miscommunication can be an instigator of stressful situations for students, and if this manifests in a negative way, students can experience physical, cognitive, and emotional issues that can alter their learning potential and enjoyment. For lecturers in contemporary universities, miscommunication is relevant, and a need to improve clarity and to foster shared meaning seems evident. Initially, a summary of background literature sets the scene for the study. Then, our action-based methodology is outlined before discussing the issues identified and the implications they hold for learning and teaching as well as for future research.

Energy detection involves lower complexity and energy consumption, but it is unreliable at low signal-To-noise ratios (SNRs). Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal property is used by an autocorrelation-based detector, which involves more complexity and is more robust at low SNRs. We build the cascaded design of both energy detection and autocorrelation-based detection to take advantage of each technique. The performance of a cascaded detector is then presented. It is shown that the probability of detection of the cascaded design is always better than the probability of detection of a single detector. The design of the cascaded detector has been implemented which does not require additional sensing time.

Previous neuroimaging studies exclusively used volumetric methods to measure cortical volume as a whole rather than focusing on anatomical and neuropathological distinct indices. Here we decomposed the cortical architecture into cortical thickness (CTh), surface area (SA), and gyrification, for the first time, to provide a more integrative profile of brain damage in COPD. Clinical T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired in 25 stable COPD patients (mean age 69) and 25 age-matched controls. Images were processed using surface-based morphometry to obtain cortical parameters enabling more accurate measurement in deep sulci and localized regional mapping. Demographic, physiological, and cognitive assessments were made and correlated with cortical indices. Compared to controls, COPD patients showed significantly reduced CTh broadly distributed in motor, parietal, and prefrontal cortices, together with more circumscribed SA reduction in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and Broca’s area (cluster-level P &lt; 0.05 corrected). No abnormal gyrification was detected. Decreased CTh in parietofrontal networks strongly correlated with visuospatial construction impairment in COPD patients. Furthermore, thinner dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) best predicted poorer performance (r2 = 0.315, P = 0.004), and was associated with lower arterial oxygen saturation. These data indicate that cortical thinning is a key morphologic feature associated with COPD that could be partly attributed to oxygen desaturation and contributes to COPD visual memory and drawing deficits. Surface-based morphometry provides valuable information concerning COPD, and could ultimately help us to characterize the neurodegenerative pattern and to clarify neurologic mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in COPD patients. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Cortical thinning; Hypoxia; MRI; Surface-based morphometry; Visuospatial deficits","budesonide; ipratropium bromide; salbutamol; terbutaline sulfate; adult; aged; arterial oxygen saturation; Article; brain damage; brain size; Broca area; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); demography; dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; gray matter; heart right ventricle failure; human; hypoxemia; Mini Mental State Examination; morphometrics; motor cortex; neuroimaging; neuropsychology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; oxygen desaturation; parietal cortex; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; surface area; visual memory; white matter; working memory; anatomy and histology; attention; brain cortex; chronic obstructive lung disease; cognition; female; frontal lobe; male; memory; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attention; Cerebral Cortex; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Prefrontal Cortex; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",2-s2.0-84929688515

Here I will propose that a basic representational structure, the belief file, could provide the foundation for efficiently encoding, and updating information about, others’ beliefs in online social interactions. I will discuss the representational possibilities offered by the belief file and the ways in which the repertoire of mental state reasoning is shaped by the characteristics of its constituents. A series of questions will be outlined concerning the representational skeleton of the belief file, sketching a possible structure that supports the rapid encoding and re-identification of belief related information (e.g., variables for the agent, as the belief holder and for the belief-content). After analyzing the possible limitations of the belief attribution system, I will examine some of its characteristics that might enable a flexibility that is often neglected. I will suggest that operations involving belief files are not impeded by the absence of precise first-person information regarding their contents. In fact, the system permits manipulations with “empty” belief files, allowing humans to ascribe beliefs to conspecifics based on little or no direct information regarding the content of the mental state. Such an analysis aims to advance our understanding of how spontaneous belief attribution may be performed, and to provide an insight into the possible mechanisms that allow humans to successfully navigate the social world. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,2-s2.0-84975828230

There is much new knowledge on the neural control of systemic physiology and the feedback actions of physiologic mediators on brain regions regulating higher cognitive function, emotional regulation, and self-regulation. The healthy brain has a considerable capacity for resilience, based upon its ability to respond to interventions designed to open “windows of plasticity” and redirect its function toward better health. As a result, plasticity-facilitating treatments should be given within the framework of a positive behavioral intervention; negative experiences during this window may even make matters worse. Indeed, there are no magic bullets and drugs cannot substitute for targeted interventions that help an individual become resilient, of which mindfulness-based stress reduction and meditation are emerging as useful tools. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.","allostasis; allostatic load/overload; amygdala; eudaimonia; hippocampus; meditation; mindfulness; physical activity; prefrontal cortex; self-regulation","fluoxetine; hydrocortisone; allostasis; ambiguity; Article; autoregulation; brain region; caloric restriction; chronic stress; circadian rhythm; cognition; epigenetics; feedback system; human; mindfulness; nerve cell plasticity; physical activity; prefrontal cortex; regulatory mechanism",2-s2.0-84979643828

Mobile EEG is a research methodology that requires tightly controlled experiments and complicated analytical tools, but it is increasingly used beyond the clinical and research context to monitor brain function and cognition in real world. It is used to unravel our understanding of the neural processes that enable spatial perception and cognition, while is also applied to the study of psychological transactions between people and the environment, for example to gauge the effects of urban or natural environments on the emotional state of pedestrians. In the near future, mobile EEG could be integrated in the research on cities as a tool to understand the cognitive foundations of urban movement, assess the psychological impact of environments on individuals, or target interventions to improve the quality of the urban environment.

For example, the ability to detect an error in one's own speech, halt speech production, and finally correct the error can be explained by assuming an inner speech loop which continuously compares the word representations induced by production to those induced by perception at various cognitive levels (e.g., conceptual, word, or phonological levels). Because spontaneous speech errors are relatively rare, a picture naming and halt paradigm can be used to evoke them. In this paradigm, picture presentation (target word initiation) is followed by an auditory stop signal (distractor word) for halting speech production. The current study seeks to understand the neural mechanisms governing self-detection of speech errors by developing a biologically inspired neural model of the inner speech loop. The neural model is based on the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and consists of a network of about 500,000 spiking neurons. In the first experiment we induce simulated speech errors semantically and phonologically. In the second experiment, we simulate a picture naming and halt task. Target-distractor word pairs were balanced with respect to variation of phonological and semantic similarity. The results of the first experiment show that speech errors are successfully detected by a monitoring component in the inner speech loop. The results of the second experiment show that the model correctly reproduces human behavioral data on the picture naming and halt task. In particular, the halting rate in the production of target words was lower for phonologically similar words than for semantically similar or fully dissimilar distractor words. We thus conclude that the neural architecture proposed here to model the inner speech loop reflects important interactions in production and perception at phonological and semantic levels. © 2016 Kroger, Crawford, Bekolay and Eliasmith.","Inner speech; Neurocomputational model; Speech errors; Speech production and perception; Spiking neural networks","Behavioral research; Errors; Neural networks; Semantics; Speech recognition; Biologically inspired neural models; Neural architectures; Neurocomputational models; Semantic similarity; Speech errors; Speech production; Spiking neural networks; Word representations; Speech; error; experimental model; human; monitoring; nerve cell; perception; speech",2-s2.0-84973343808

Deviations from rationality in human thinking are currently well documented [25] as non-reducible to rational pursuit of egoistic benefit or its occasional distortion with temporary emotional excitation, as it is often assumed.

Non-rationality can no longer be perceived as a rare affective abnormality in otherwise rational thinking, but as a systemic, permanent quality, 'a design feature' of human cognition. While social psychology has systematically addressed non-rationality of human cognition (including its non-emotional aspects) for decades [63]. It is not the case for computer science, despite obvious relevance for individual and group behavior modeling.

The proposed network consists of mobile cognitive radios and infrastructure wireless sensor nodes. The sensor nodes, exploiting their spatial diversity, perform spectrum sensing for the mobile cognitive radios. In the proposed network, sensor nodes laying in the communication range of the cognitive radios form clusters based on their distances. The clusters are regularly updated due to mobility of the cognitive radios and are further divided into disjoint sub-clusters, which are formed by deactivating the redundant sensor nodes. For energy conservation, one of the sub-clusters in a cluster remains active while others are switched to sleep mode.

It is associated with calculation, and shares the common activation of the fronto-parietal regions with calculation, which suggests that numerical inductive reasoning may correspond to a general calculation process. However, compared with calculation, rule identification is critical and unique to reasoning. Previous studies have established the central role of the fronto-parietal network for relational integration during rule identification in numerical inductive reasoning. The current question of interest is whether numerical inductive reasoning exclusively corresponds to calculation or operates beyond calculation, and whether it is possible to distinguish between them based on the activity pattern in the fronto-parietal network. To directly address this issue, three types of problems were created: numerical inductive reasoning, calculation, and perceptual judgment. Our results showed that the fronto-parietal network was more active in numerical inductive reasoning which requires more exchanges between intermediate representations and long-term declarative knowledge during rule identification. These results survived even after controlling for the covariates of response time and error rate.

Liver X Receptor agonist, GW3965, has been demonstrated to successfully modulate neuroinflammation and lipid metabolism in murine models of AD. This is partially due to increased expression of ApoE levels and increased mobility of endothelial progenitor cells. This paper analyzes changes in the neurovascular unit and in astrocytes and microglia markers following oral administration of GW3965 in a very old triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD mice). We found that astrogliosis, but not activation of microglia, decreased in very old (24 months) 3xTg-AD mice treated with GW965. In addition, GW3965 increased LRP1 levels in neuron-like cells and partially restored microvascular morphology by decreasing tortuosity and increasing length as shown by Lectin immunostaining. Interestingly, these changes were associated with decreased Aβ in blood vessels. In conclusion, short-term treatment of 3xTg-AD mice with GW3965 restored microvascular architecture which may be important in the cognitive improvement previously shown. © 2016.","Alzheimer's disease; GW3965; Liver x receptors; Neuroinflammation; Neurovascular endothelium","3 [3 [[2 chloro 3 (trifluoromethyl)benzyl](2 diphenylethyl)amino]propoxy]phenylacetic acid; amyloid beta protein; liver X receptor; 3 [3 [[2 chloro 3 (trifluoromethyl)benzyl](2 diphenylethyl)amino]propoxy]phenylacetic acid; amyloid beta protein; benzoic acid derivative; benzylamine derivative; biological marker; glial fibrillary acidic protein; glial fibrillary astrocytic protein, mouse; liver X receptor; 3XTg mouse; aged; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; astrocyte; astrocytosis; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; microglia; microvasculature; mouse; nervous system inflammation; nonhuman; priority journal; short course therapy; very elderly; aging; agonists; Alzheimer disease; animal; drug effects; hippocampus; metabolism; microvasculature; nerve cell; pathology; transgenic mouse; vascularization; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Astrocytes; Benzoates; Benzylamines; Biomarkers; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Hippocampus; Liver X Receptors; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Microglia; Microvessels; Neurons",2-s2.0-84962709108

However, the factors contributing to pre-stroke architecture of cognitive networks are often ignored, even though they reportedly play a decisive role in the manifestation of cognitive impairment in neurodegeneration. The present review on post-stroke cognitive deficits therefore adopts the concept of brain and cognitive reserve, which was originally developed to account for the individual differences in the course of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. By focusing on spatial neglect, a typical network disorder, it is discussed how individual susceptibility to stroke lesion might explain the reported discrepancies in lesion anatomy, non-spatial deficits and recovery courses. A detailed analysis of the literature reveals that premorbid brain (age, brain atrophy, previous strokes, leukoaraiosis, genetic factors, etc.) and cognitive reserve (IQ, life experience, education, occupation, premorbid cognitive impairment, etc.) greatly impact the brain's capacity for compensation. Furthermore, the interaction between pre-stroke brain/cognitive reserve and the degree of stroke-induced system impairment (e.g., hypoperfusion, lesion load) determines both the extent of neglect symptoms variability and the course of recovery. Premorbid brain/cognitive reserves should thus be considered to: (i) understand the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disorders and sufficiently explain their inter-individual variability; (ii) provide a prognosis for cognitive recovery and hence post-stroke dependency; (iii) identify individual targets for cognitive rehabilitation: in the case of reduced brain/cognitive reserve, neglect might occur even with a confined lesion, and non-spatial training of general attentional capacity should represent the main therapeutic target also for treatment of neglect; this might be true also for non-cognitive domains, e.g., motor deficit. This alternative view of how neglect and other cognitive deficits occur and recover promotes discussion about plasticity and recovery to a general rather than a single stroke-based domain, providing more efficiency in recovery research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive reserve; Post-stroke cognitive deficit; Recovery from neglect; Spatial neglect; Stroke outcome; Stroke recovery",,2-s2.0-85009288445

In the current study, we quantified contextual demands on the cognitive control system via a priori estimation of information across three tasks varying in difficulty (oddball, go/nogo, and switch tasks) and compared neural responses across these different contexts. We report evidence of the involvement of multiple frequency bands during preparation and implementation of cognitive control. Specifically, a common frontoparietal delta and a central alpha process corresponded to rule implementation and motor response respectively. Interestingly, we found evidence of a frontal theta signature that was sensitive to increasing amounts of information and a posterior parietal alpha process only seen during anticipatory rule updating. Importantly, these neural signatures of context processing match proposed frontal hierarchies of control and together provide novel evidence of a complex interplay of multiple frequency bands underpinning flexible, contextually sensitive cognition. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","EEG; Executive function; Go/nogo; Information theory; Oddball; Prefrontal cortex; Task switching; Time frequency","accuracy; adult; analytical error; Article; central alpha; electroencephalogram; executive function; female; frontal theta; frontoparietal delta; go nogo task; human; information processing; information science; male; mental task; nerve potential; oddball task; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; switch task",2-s2.0-84961822850

Furthermore, abnormalities in basic motor control, skilled motor gestures, and motor learning, are common in ASD. These characteristics have been attributed to a possible defect in the pre- and postnatal development of specific neural networks including the dentate-thalamo-cortical pathway, which is involved in motor learning, automaticity of movements, and higher cognitive functions. The current study utilized custom diolistic labeling and unbiased stereology to characterize morphological alterations in neurons of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum in developing rat pups exposed to abnormally high levels of the serotonergic agonist 5-methyloxytryptamine (5-MT) pre-and postnatally. Occurring in as many as 30% of autistic subjects, developmental hyperserotonemia (DHS) is the most consistent neurochemical finding reported in autism and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD. This exposure produced dramatic changes in dendritic architecture and synaptic features. We observed changes in the dendritic branching morphology which did not lead to significant differences (p > 0.5) in total dendritic length. Instead, DHS groups presented with dendritic trees that display changes in arborescence, that appear to be short reaching with elaborately branched segments, presenting with significantly fewer (p > 0.001) dendritic spines and a decrease in numeric density when compared to age-matched controls. These negative changes may be implicated in the neuropathological and functional/behavioral changes observed in ASD, such as delays in motor learning, difficulties in automaticity of movements, and deficits in higher cognitive functions. © 2016 IBRO.","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Dentate nucleus; Diolistic labeling; Hyperserotonemia; Neuronal morphology; Stereology","5 methoxytryptamine; serotonin; serotonin agonist; abnormally high substrate concentration in blood; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autism; behavior change; brain development; brain nerve cell; cell count; cell density; cell labeling; controlled study; dendritic spine; dentate nucleus; developmental hyperserotonemia; female; male; neurochemistry; neuropathology; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rat; stereology; animal; autism; cell motion; cerebellum nucleus; confocal microscopy; disease model; drug effects; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nerve cell; newborn; pathology; physiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; randomization; Sprague Dawley rat; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Cell Movement; Cerebellar Nuclei; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Microscopy, Confocal; Neurons; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Random Allocation; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Serotonin; Serotonin Receptor Agonists",2-s2.0-84959421366

Epidemiological studies revealed that radiation exposure during weeks 8–15 of pregnancy was associated with an increased occurrence of mental disability and microcephaly. Such neurological deficits were reproduced in animal models, in which rodent behavioral testing is an often used tool to evaluate radiation-induced defective brain functionality. However, up to now, animal studies suggested a threshold dose of around 0.30 Gray (Gy) below which no behavioral alterations can be observed, while human studies hinted at late defects after exposure to doses as low as 0.10 Gy. Here, we acutely irradiated pregnant mice at embryonic day 11 with doses ranging from 0.10 to 1.00 Gy. A thorough investigation of the dose-response relationship of altered brain function and architecture following in uteroirradiation was achieved using a behavioral test battery and volumetric 3D T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We found dose-dependent changes in cage activity, social behavior, anxiety-related exploration, and spatio-cognitive performance. Although behavioral alterations in low-dose exposed animals were mild, we did unveil that both emotionality and higher cognitive abilities were affected in mice exposed to ≥0.10 Gy. Microcephaly was apparent from 0.33 Gy onwards and accompanied by deviations in regional brain volumes as compared to controls. Of note, total brain volume and the relative volume of the ventricles, frontal and posterior cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and striatum were most strongly correlated to altered behavioral parameters.

In other words, the very architecture of the language processor favours certain types of processing errors because in a majority of instances, this “fast and frugal”, less effortful processing is good enough to support communication. By way of historical background, connections are made between this relatively recent facet of psycholinguistic study, other recent language processing models, and related concepts in other areas of cognitive science.

In this paper, the Hierarchical and Distributed Cognitive Radio Architecture Management (HDCRAM), initially proposed to manage Cognitive Radio systems, is proposed for the management of the SG. This architecture can both be applied to the whole SG and to any sub-part (distribution network, production network, microgrid). In this paper we focus on the distribution network and the hierarchical position of each element is identified. As an example, HDCRAM is used for smart home management and multi-agent based modeling shows benefits of such an architecture. In the simulated scenario, without any management the peak power consumption is 5500 W and the hierarchical and distributed management allows to reduce it to 900 W.

Systems may possess an internal structure that is relatively complex to describe—especially after many changes. In addition, some changes may require several iterations before stakeholders converge on a final design choice. There is currently no unified mathematical theory that captures these factors. We developed metrics for flexibility, descriptive complexity, and rework potential defined on graph-based representations of a system's structure. We applied these metrics to four idealized generic system architectures: Tree-structured hierarchies are easy to describe and require minimal design iteration. However, they permit relatively few changes, unless the underlying architecture itself is changed. Furthermore, each such change adds significant complexity. Grid networks are more flexible than trees, but also more descriptively complex. Grids also require some degree of design iteration between stakeholders. Teams are extremely flexible but the requirement for consensus (e.g., due to cognitive limits among humans) restricts their size. Layered hierarchies possess moderate flexibility and require fewer iterations than corresponding grids and teams, although they can be difficult to describe succinctly. Our findings suggest that no architecture is ideal under all circumstances; rather, each has strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited in different environments. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","architecture metrics; descriptive complexity; grid networks; layered hierarchy; rework; rework potential; team; tree hierarchy","Architecture; Complex networks; Forestry; Graphic methods; Network architecture; Network layers; Descriptive complexity; Grid network; layered hierarchy; rework; rework potential; team; tree hierarchy; Computer architecture",2-s2.0-84987700921

Yet, during the last decade, contemporary cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology and behavioural science have made impressive progress in the measurement, monitoring and understanding of human cognition and behaviour. These novel approaches offer advanced tools to study the human brain, body and mind; other disciplines (economics, political science, ergonomics and, recently, architecture) have successfully adopted these methods. The aim of the present paper is to introduce these concepts to the research community who studies the effects of underground work and offer practical examples of how these methods can be employed to understand crucial problems related to ""underground psychology"".

Treatment with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) offers some protection from the effects of OSA, although it is still unclear which populations should be targeted, for how long, and what the effects of treatment are on different organ systems. We investigated whether cognitive improvements can be achieved as early as one month into CPAP treatment in patients with OSA. Methods: 55 patients (mean (SD) age: 47.6 (11.1) years) with newly diagnosed moderate-severe OSA (Oxygen Desaturation Index: 36.6 (25.2) events/hour; Epworth sleepiness score (ESS): 12.8 (4.9)) and 35 matched healthy volunteers were studied. All participants underwent neurocognitive testing, neuroimaging and polysomnography. Patients were randomized into parallel groups: CPAP with best supportive care (BSC), or BSC alone for one month, after which they were re-tested. Findings: One month of CPAP with BSC resulted in a hypertrophic trend in the right thalamus [mean difference (%): 4.04, 95% CI: 1.47 to 6.61], which was absent in the BSC group [- 2.29, 95% CI: - 4.34 to - 0.24]. Significant improvement was also recorded in ESS, in the CPAP plus BSC group, following treatment [mean difference (%): - 27.97, 95% CI: - 36.75 to - 19.19 vs 2.46, 95% CI: - 5.23 to 10.15; P = 0.012], correlated to neuroplastic changes in brainstem (r = - 0.37; P = 0.05), and improvements in delayed logical memory scores [57.20, 95% CI: 42.94 to 71.46 vs 23.41, 95% CI: 17.17 to 29.65; P = 0.037]. Interpretation: One month of CPAP treatment can lead to adaptive alterations in the neurocognitive architecture that underlies the reduced sleepiness, and improved verbal episodic memory in patients with OSA. We propose that partial neural recovery occurs during short periods of treatment with CPAP. © 2016 The Authors.","Cognition; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Neuroimaging; Obstructive sleep apnea","adult; aged; Article; best supportive care; cognition; cognitive function test; controlled oral word association test; controlled study; Epworth sleepiness scale; female; follow up; human; male; neuroanatomy; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient care; polysomnography; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; pulse oximetry; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; sleep disordered breathing; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; brain; cognition; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; pathology; physiology; positive end expiratory pressure; procedures; quality of life; randomization; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; treatment outcome; Adult; Brain; Cognition; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Polysomnography; Quality of Life; Random Allocation; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84962113307

It then analyzes some subsurface experiences of the 20th century and, by looking at their successes and failures, shows how a renewed human and dynamic vision could help move from developing isolated structures towards a connected form of urbanism. Such a transition would provide an adequate response to the challenges of modern metropolises, for instance in the Paris area. On the strength of these realizations, a national transdisciplinary research program was deemed necessary and this is how Ville 10D - Ville d'Idées came to be in 2013. This article thus recaps the history and reflection that led to the creation of the Ville 10D project, and explains how it emerged as a systemic approach to subterranean development. Method: Conception and development of a change of paradigm: consider the living and motion as primary, unifying agents between the underground and the city above it; play with and act on the subsurface in order to reinject mixed uses and complexity into the city through a systemic approach of the underground in the urban eco-system. Creation of a research project whose organization reflects these concerns: in order to take the living into account, make the study as cross-disciplinary as possible, mixing competences and points of views.Four-fold organization - socio-economical, environmental, psycho-social, cognitive (knowledge and management of the underground) - corresponding to four main themes plus two transversal themes (legal and urban planning). Unfolding in four stages of 18 months each, these thematic approaches are casting converging light onto token sites chosen for their diverse typology. Around a hundred professional players are involved in the Ville 10D project. Study results: Beyond the data gradually obtained through the project studies themselves, and without anticipating those to come, the first results so far have shown a growing awareness of and interest in the reality of underground potential. There has been a genuine gradual involvement of the development players, researchers and academics in elaborating the project. For us, gaining support from the players is an essential stake to ""unlock"" the underground in the minds first, then in reality thanks to tools built by Ville 10D in all the fields of development.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether emotion recognition ability generalizes across modalities, such that those who are good at recognizing emotions from the face, for example, are also good at identifying emotions from nonfacial cues (such as cues conveyed via the body). The primary goal of the current set of studies was to address these questions through establishing the structure of individual differences in visual emotion recognition ability. In three independent samples (Study 1: n=640; Study 2: n=389; Study 3: n=303), we observed that the ability to recognize visually presented emotions is based on different sources of variation: a supramodal Emotion-General factor, supramodal Emotion-Specific factors, and Face-And Within-Modality Emotion-Specific factors. In addition, we found evidence that general intelligence and alexithymia were associated with supramodal emotion recognition ability. Autism-Like traits, empathic concern, and alexithymia were independently associated with Face-Specific emotion recognition ability. These results (a) provide a platform for further individual differences research on emotion recognition ability, (b) indicate that differentiating levels within the architecture of emotion recognition ability is of high importance, and (c) show that the capacity to understand expressions of emotion in others is linked to broader affective and cognitive processes. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Alexithymia; Autism; Emotion recognition; Empathy; Latent variable","adult; affect; association; emotion; emotional disorder; face; facial expression; factor analysis; female; human; individuality; intelligence; male; pathophysiology; physiology; recognition; vision; Adult; Affect; Affective Symptoms; Cues; Emotions; Face; Facial Expression; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Individuality; Intelligence; Male; Recognition (Psychology); Visual Perception",2-s2.0-84960860788

These approaches include binding through synchrony (Shastri & Ajjanagadde), ""mesh"" binding (van der Velde & de Kamps), and conjunctive binding (Smolensky). Recent theoretical work has suggested that most of these methods will not scale well, that is, that they cannot encode structured representations using any of the tens of thousands of terms in the adult lexicon without making implausible resource assumptions. Here, we empirically demonstrate that the biologically plausible structured representations employed in the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) approach to modeling cognition (Eliasmith, ) do scale appropriately. Specifically, we construct a spiking neural network of about 2.5 million neurons that employs semantic pointers to successfully encode and decode the main lexical relations in WordNet, which has over 100,000 terms. In addition, we show that the same representations can be employed to construct recursively structured sentences consisting of arbitrary WordNet concepts, while preserving the original lexical structure. We argue that these results suggest that semantic pointers are uniquely well-suited to providing a biologically plausible account of the structured representations that underwrite human cognition. © 2016 Cognitive Science Society, Inc..","Biologically plausible; Connectionism; Knowledge representation; Neural network; Scaling; Vector symbolic architecture; WordNet","algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; cognition; language; psychological model; semantics; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cognition; Language; Models, Psychological; Neural Networks (Computer); Semantics",2-s2.0-84969548871

Participants completed a detailed phenotypic assessment and a neuroimaging battery including diffusion kurtosis imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Athletes with a history of concussion performed no differently from those without on phenotypic assessment, but showed significantly elevated fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left genu and anterior corona radiata relative to those without. Post hoc analyses revealed that elevated FA was associated with increased microstructural complexity perpendicular to the primary axon (radial kurtosis). Athletes with concussion history also showed significant differences in the organization of the default mode network (DMN) characterized by stronger temporal coherence in posterior DMN, decreased temporal coherence in anterior DMN, and increased functional connectivity outside the DMN. In the absence of deficits on detailed phenotypic assessment, athletes with a history of concussion displayed changes to the microstructural architecture of the cerebral white matter and to the functional connectivity of the brain at rest.

They use these ideas to understand creativity as it occurs in many domains, and in particular in science. We argue that, because of its algebraic properties, convolution alone is ill-suited to the role proposed by Thagard and Stewart. The semantic pointer concept (Eliasmith, How to build a brain, 2013) allows us to see how we can apply the full range of HRR operations while keeping the modal representations so central to Thagard and Stewart’s theory. By adding another combination operation and using semantic pointers as the combinatorial basis, this modified version overcomes the limitations of the original theory and perhaps helps us explain aspects of creativity not covered by the original theory. While a priori reasons cast doubts on the use of HRR operations with modal representations (Fisher et al., Appl Opt 26(23):5039–5054, 1987) such as semantic pointers, recent models point in the other direction, allowing us to be optimistic about the success of the revised version. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Creativity; Holographic reduced representation; Modal representation; Neural network; Semantic pointer; Vector symbolic architecture",,2-s2.0-84945562723

The model is based on a role for this hormone in the generation and maintenance of social familiarity and affiliation across five homologous, functionally similar, and sequentially co-opted contexts: mothers with offspring, female and male mates, kin groups, individuals with reciprocity partners, and individuals within cooperating and competing social groups defined by culture. In each situation, oxytocin motivates, mediates and rewards the cognitive and behavioural processes that underlie the formation and dynamics of a more or less stable social group, and promotes a relationship between two or more individuals. Such relationships may be positive (eliciting neurological reward, reducing anxiety and thus indicating fitness-enhancing effects), or negative (increasing anxiety and distress, and thus motivating attempts to alleviate a problematic, fitness-reducing social situation). I also present evidence that testosterone exhibits opposite effects from oxytocin on diverse aspects of cognition and behaviour, most generally by favouring self-oriented, asocial and antisocial behaviours. I apply this model for effects of oxytocin and testosterone to understanding human psychological disorders centrally involving social behaviour. Reduced oxytocin and higher testosterone levels have been associated with under-developed social cognition, especially in autism. By contrast, some combination of oxytocin increased above normal levels, and lower testosterone, has been reported in a notable number of studies of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, and, in some cases, higher oxytocin involves maladaptively 'hyper-developed' social cognition in these conditions. This pattern of findings suggests that human social cognition and behaviour are structured, in part, by joint and opposing effects of oxytocin and testosterone, and that extremes of such joint effects partially mediate risks and phenotypes of autism and psychotic-affective conditions. These considerations have direct implications for the development of therapies for alleviating disorders of social cognition, and for understanding how such disorders are associated with the evolution of human cognitive-affective architecture.

Unlike most neuroimaging techniques, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows the establishment of causal relationships in the study of the functional architecture of the human brain. While this tool is increasingly used to probe the functional and causal nature of the associations between brain regions, a comprehensive guide documenting the various existing stimulation protocols is currently lacking, limiting its use. Objective The main objective of the current work is to characterize the various dual-coil TMS protocols used to probe effective connectivity and plasticity within the motor system. In addition, we want to propose a short TMS battery that could be used in clinical and research settings. Method Articles using dual-coil TMS indexed in PubMed and Medline published between 1990 and 2015 were included in the review. Results A wide range of stimulation parameters has been used to probe connectivity and plasticity. However, a few protocols have been shown to produce robust effects, mostly inhibitory in nature. Conclusion Dual-coil TMS offers the distinctive opportunity to investigate effective connectivity and plasticity between different parts of the brain. Sites of stimulation, stimulation intensity, inter-stimulus interval and coil orientation are crucial factors to consider when using this technique. We propose a brief battery of tests that could be used to assess effective brain connectivity in clinical populations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Attempts to meet this challenge are a manifestation of what Fechner called ""inner"" psychophysics: The theory of the precise mapping between mental quantities and the brain. In his own time, inner psychophysics remained an unrealized ambition for Fechner. We suggest that, today, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), or neural ""decoding,"" methods provide a promising starting point for developing an inner psychophysics. A cornerstone of these methods are simple linear classifiers applied to neural activity in high-dimensional activation spaces. We describe an approach to inner psychophysics based on the shared architecture of linear classifiers and observers under decision boundary models such as signal detection theory. Under this approach, distance from a decision boundary through activation space, as estimated by linear classifiers, can be used to predict reaction time in accordance with signal detection theory, and distance-to-bound models of reaction time. Our ""neural distance-to-bound"" approach is potentially quite general, and simple to implement. Furthermore, our recent work on visual object recognition suggests it is empirically viable. We believe the approach constitutes an important step along the path to an inner psychophysics that links mind, brain, and behavior. © 2016 Ritchie and Carlson.","Inner psychophysics; MVPA; Reaction times; Signal detection theory; Visual object categorization","behavior; brain; chemical binding; classification; classifier; human; human experiment; psychophysics; reaction time; recognition; signal detection; theoretical model",2-s2.0-84966350063

Methods: Fifteen patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of RBD according to International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, 2nd edition). Under the monitor of polysomnography (PSG), the sleep architectures of all RBD cases were evaluated by Polysmith software and visual analysis. Furthermore, all RBD patients and 15 normal controls underwent TCS. Cases with substantia nigra echo intensity over III grade and substantia nigra area over 0.20 cm2 were supposed to be hyperechogenicity. Additionally, the width of the third ventricle was measured and whether there was hyperechogenicity in basal ganglia was evaluated. The cognitive functions were evaluated by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results: RBD patients presented typical clinical manifestations and electrophysiologic changes. No significant difference (P = 0.080, 0.109) was found in the comparison of hyperechogenicity rate on substantia nigra (6/15) and basal ganglia (7/15) in RBD patients and normal controls (1/15, 2/15). No significant difference in the comparison of MoCA was found in RBD patients with or without substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (P = 0.075). The RBD patients with hyperechogenicity on basal ganglia had higher MMSE scores than those without hyperechogenicity on basal ganglia, and the difference was significant (P = 0.021). Conclusions: RBD which is suggested as the prodromal period of synucleinopathy may present hyperechogenicity in substantia nigra and basal ganglia on TCS. TCS could detect subclinical changes of brain and evaluate the risk of synucleinopathy.

In Cognitive Radios (CRs), learning is necessary for its cognition, while two of the key challenges are how to classify primary user agents with their performances and predict their behaviors.

The sensor nodes within communications range of each CR are grouped into a cluster, and the clusters of CRs are regularly updated according to the random mobility of the CRs. We reduce the energy consumption and the end-to-end delay of the sensor network by dividing each cluster into disjoint subsets with overlapped sensing coverage of primary user (PU) activity. Respective subset of a CR provides target detection and false alarm probabilities. Substantial energy efficiency is achieved by activating only one subset of the cluster, while putting the rest of the subsets in the cluster into sleep mode. Additional gain in energy efficiency is obtained by two promising propositions: 1) selecting nodes from the active subset for actual sensing and 2) switching the active subset to sleep mode by scheduling. The sensor nodes for actual spectrum sensing are chosen considering their respective time durations for sensing. Even the only active subset is switched to sleep mode for a certain number of time slots, utilizing the history of PU activity.

CALHM1 function in the brain remains unknown, but recent results showed that neuronal CALHM1 controls intracellular calcium signaling and cell excitability, two mechanisms required for synaptic function. Here, we describe the generation of Calhm1 knockout (Calhm1 -/-) mice and investigate CALHM1 role in neuronal and cognitive functions. Structural analysis revealed that Calhm1 -/- brains had normal regional and cellular architecture, and showed no evidence of neuronal or synaptic loss, indicating that CALHM1 deficiency does not affect brain development or brain integrity in adulthood. However, Calhm1 -/- mice showed a severe impairment in memory flexibility, assessed in the Morris water maze, and a significant disruption of long-term potentiation without alteration of long-term depression, measured in ex vivo hippocampal slices. Importantly, in primary neurons and hippocampal slices, CALHM1 activation facilitated the phosphorylation of NMDA and AMPA receptors by protein kinase A. Furthermore, neuronal CALHM1 activation potentiated the effect of glutamate on the expression of c-Fos and C/EBPβ, two immediate-early gene markers of neuronal activity. Thus, CALHM1 controls synaptic activity in cerebral neurons and is required for the flexible processing of memory in mice. These results shed light on CALHM1 physiology in the mammalian brain.",,"AMPA receptor; calcium channel; CALHM1 protein, mouse; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; cognition; deficiency; knockout mouse; memory; metabolism; nerve cell; phosphorylation; physiology; protein processing; Animals; Brain; Calcium Channels; Cognition; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Memory; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Neurons; Phosphorylation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Receptors, AMPA; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate",2-s2.0-84963807278

For students with intellectual disabilities, completing technology-dependent tasks may pose unique challenges that are not always addressed by the disability support services offered at the university level. During our fieldwork, we have observed several barriers to online education tools in a postsecondary environment for students with intellectual disabilities. For example, a student with an intellectual disability submitting an assignment via email to an instructor may encounter difficulties recalling and navigating to the location of their attachment file. In this paper, we describe core skills and common interfaces that we have identified as problematic for this population through an emic ethnography. We offer emic (perceptions from within a given environment) experience accounts to highlight the obstacles we have observed in a) information retrieval, b) navigation and information architecture c) file management, and d) password management. As researchers and educators involved in a postsecondary program for young adults with intellectual disability (ID), we have spent considerable time working with this population. For each scenario, we offer examples from our own experience of the techniques and technologies that did or did not help students accomplish these tasks. Based on these experiences, we provide recommendations for mitigating these barriers including education and training for students and developers and the use of existing interventions and tools. We also discuss future directions for this work.

In order to identify human errors and improve performance in human system interaction (HSI), it is of essential significance to explore the cognition mechanism and characterize the dynamic interaction scenario. However, very few methods have yet been proposed to analyze the entire human system reliability in a quantitative way. This paper tries to confront this challenge and develops a computational HSI model from the human error perspective based on stochastic hybrid automation (SHA). Under situation awareness (SA) centered cognition architecture, the fuzzy logic and fuzzy entropy are introduced to describe the cognitive process with uncertainty. Moreover, the Human reliability analysis (HRA) is also employed to characterize the performance fluctuation. Finally, the quantitative cognitive model is incorporated into SHA framework. Thus, the human error produced in HSI could be presented and demonstrated dynamically.

On the other is emergent intelligence, in which intelligence emerges as the outcome of an infinitude of negotiations between multitudinous cognitive agents.

While speech errors have traditionally been seen as categorical substitutions of one sound for another, acoustic/articulatory analyses show they partially reflect the intended sound. When ""pig"" is mispronounced as ""big,"" the resulting /b/ sound differs from correct productions of ""big,"" moving towards intended ""pig""-revealing the role of graded sound representations in speech production. Investigating the origins of such phenomena requires detailed estimation of speech sound distributions; this has been hampered by reliance on subjective, labor-intensive manual annotation. Computational methods can address these issues by providing for objective, automatic measurements. We develop a novel high-precision computational approach, based on a set of machine learning algorithms, for measurement of elicited speech. The algorithms are trained on existing manually labeled data to detect and locate linguistically relevant acoustic properties with high accuracy. Our approach is robust, is designed to handle mis-productions, and overall matches the performance of expert coders. It allows us to analyze a very large dataset of speech errors (containing far more errors than the total in the existing literature), illuminating properties of speech sound distributions previously impossible to reliably observe. We argue that this provides novel evidence that two sources both contribute to deviations in speech errors: planning processes specifying the targets of articulation and articulatory processes specifying the motor movements that execute this plan. These findings illustrate how a much richer picture of speech provides an opportunity to gain novel insights into language processing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic phonetic analysis; Machine learning; Speech errors; Speech production; Structured prediction","acoustic analysis; acoustics; Article; autoanalysis; cognition; consonant; controlled study; female; human; language processing; learning algorithm; machine learning; maximum likelihood method; Monte Carlo method; phoneme; priority journal; speech; automated pattern recognition; male; phonetics; procedures; signal processing; speech; Cognition; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Phonetics; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Speech; Speech Acoustics",2-s2.0-84953791763

We propose an approach for spectrum occupancy forecasting which can be used to reduce the delay in making dynamic spectrum allocation decisions and improve the cognitive and management functionalities of cloud-based architectures such as C-RAN. The spectrum occupancy and usage activity in a predefined frequency band is based on the statistical processing of a large amount of collected data and the introduction of a frequency–time resources indicator as a measure of spectrum usage. Furthermore, we apply ML algorithms to predict spectrum usage and compare the predicted with actual measured data. Taking into consideration that the accuracy of the prediction depends on the volume of collected data and the time of prediction on the BD and ML approach, we propose the development of a cloud-based generic processing architecture to solve the “accuracy versus latency” trade-off problem.

Such converters play a crucial role in software-defined radio and in cognitive radio technology. One way to circumvent the limits of today’s ADC technologies is to split the analog input signal into multiple components and then sample them with ADCs in parallel. The two main split approaches, time interleaved and frequency splitting, can be modeled using a filter bank paradigm, where each of these two architectures requires a specific analysis for its design. In this research, the frequency splitting approach was implemented with the use of a hybrid filter bank ADC, which requires an output digital filter bank perfectly matched to the input analog filter bank. To achieve this end, an analog transfer function, together with an assumption of strictly band-limited input signal, has been used to design the digital filter bank so far. In contrast, the author proposes dropping the band-limit assumption and shows that the out-of-band input signal has to be taken into account when designing a hybrid filter bank. © 2015, The Author(s).","A-to-D converter; Bandpass sampling; Equivalent digital filter bank; Hybrid filter bank; Quantization error; Wide-band ADC","Bandpass filters; Cognitive radio; Digital filters; Filter banks; Matched filters; Software radio; Time varying networks; Analog to digital converters; Band-pass sampling; Cognitive radio technologies; Design and simulation; Hybrid filter bank; Quantization errors; Software-defined radios; Wide-band; Analog to digital conversion",2-s2.0-84959296596

Spectrum sensing techniques plays important role in Cognitive Sensor Networks. Cognitive radio has ability to know the unutilized spectrum in license and unlicensed band by spectrum sensing. With the help of cognitive radio, idle spectrum band is identified and allocated to sensor nodes. This approach reduces the interference and collisions in WSN which in turn avoids packet retransmissions ensure fair energy in WSN.

In the meantime, Cognitive Radio (CR) – a novel communication paradigm which embodies SDR with intelligence and self-reconfigurability properties – has emerged. Intelligence and on-the-fly self-reconfiguration abilities of CRs constitute an important next step in the Communications Electronic Warfare, as they may enable the jamming entities with the capabilities of devising and deploying advanced jamming tactics. Similarly, they may also aid the development of the advanced intelligent self-reconfigurable systems for jamming mitigation. This work outlines the development and implementation of the Spectrum Intelligence algorithm for Radio Frequency (RF) interference mitigation. The developed system is built upon the ideas of obtaining relevant spectrum-related data by using wideband energy detectors, performing narrowband waveform identification, extracting the waveforms’ parameters and properly classifying the waveforms. All relevant spectrum activities are continuously monitored and stored. Coupled with the self-reconfigurability of various transmission-related parameters, Spectrum Intelligence is the facilitator for the advanced interference mitigation strategies.

Prevailing accounts attribute the protracted development of this mental process to incremental changes in the functional organization of a cognitive control network. Here, we challenge the notion that cognitive control is linked to a topologically static network, and argue that the capacity to manage unanticipated challenges and its development should instead be characterized in terms of inter-regional functional coupling dynamics. Ongoing changes in temporal coupling have long represented a fundamental pillar in both empirical and theoretical-based accounts of brain function, but have been largely ignored by traditional neuroimaging methods that assume a fixed functional architecture. There is, however, a growing recognition of the importance of temporal coupling dynamics for brain function, and this has led to rapid innovations in analytic methods. Results in this new frontier of neuroimaging suggest that time-varying changes in connectivity strength and direction exist at the large scale and further, that network patterns, like cognitive control process themselves, are transient and dynamic. © 2015 The Authors.","Cognitive control network; Dynamics; fMRI; Functional connectivity; Resting-state","age; Article; BOLD signal; brain development; brain mapping; child development; cognitive control network; connectome; default mode network; executive function; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; mental task; myelination; nerve cell network; priority journal; resting state network; adult; aging; biological model; brain; child; cognition; growth, development and aging; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; time factor; Adult; Aging; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Cognition; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84941729965

In terms of a large-scale brain network, in this paper, we focus on time-varying patterns of functional networks, i.e., functional dynamics, inherent in rs-fMRI, which is one of the emerging issues along with the network modelling. Specifically, we propose a novel methodological architecture that combines deep learning and state-space modelling, and apply it to rs-fMRI based Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnosis. We first devise a Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) to discover hierarchical non-linear functional relations among regions, by which we transform the regional features into an embedding space, whose bases are complex functional networks. Given the embedded functional features, we then use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to estimate dynamic characteristics of functional networks inherent in rs-fMRI via internal states, which are unobservable but can be inferred from observations statistically. By building a generative model with an HMM, we estimate the likelihood of the input features of rs-fMRI as belonging to the corresponding status, i.e., MCI or normal healthy control, based on which we identify the clinical label of a testing subject. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on two different datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. We also analyzed the functional networks learned by DAE, estimated the functional connectivities by decoding hidden states in HMM, and investigated the estimated functional connectivities by means of a graph-theoretic approach. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Dynamic functional connectivity; Hidden Markov model; Mild cognitive impairment; Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging","aged; Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep learning; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; hidden Markov model; human; image analysis; learning; male; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell network; priority journal; resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging; signal noise ratio; signal processing; biological model; brain; cognitive defect; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; machine learning; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; rest; Aged; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Rest",2-s2.0-84957052106

However, very little is known about whether and how the interactions within and between these 3 networks would be modulated by cognitive demands. Here, we employed graph-based modularity analysis to identify the DMN, ECN, and SN during an N-back working memory (WM) task and further investigated the modulation of intra- and inter-network interactions at different cognitive loads. As the task load elevated, functional connectivity decreased within the DMN while increased within the ECN, and the SN connected more with both the DMN and ECN. Within-network connectivity of the ventral and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex was differentially modulated by cognitive load. Further, the superior parietal regions in the ECN showed increased internetwork connections at higher WM loads, and these increases correlated positively with WM task performance. Together, these findings advance our understanding of dynamic integrations of specialized brain systems in response to cognitive demands and may serve as a baseline for assessing potential disruptions of these interactions in pathological conditions. © 2015 Published by Oxford University Press 2015.

The human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been repeatedly implicated in the monitoring of such situations, and its neural activity is thought to be involved in behavioral adjustment. However, this hypothesis is mainly based on neuroimaging results and is challenged by animal studies that failed to report any neuronal correlates of conflict monitoring. This discrepancy is thought be due either to methodological or more fundamental cross-species differences. In this study, we eliminated methodological biases and recorded single-neuron activity in monkeys performing a Stroop-like task. We found specific changes in dACC activity during incongruent trials but only in a small subpopulation of cells. Critically, these changes were not related to reaction time and were absent before any incorrect action was taken. A larger fraction of neurons exhibited sustained activity during the whole decision period, whereas another subpopulation of neurons was modulated by reaction time, with a gradual increase in their firing rate that peaked at movement onset. Most of the neurons found in these subpopulations exhibited activity after the delivery of an external negative feedback stimulus that indicated an error had been made. These findings, which are consistent with an executive control role, reconcile various theories of prefrontal cortex function and support the homology between human and monkey cognitive architectures. © 2015 The Author 2015.

Because of its complexity, discussion has been carried out on methodological criteria useful to define and assess NetZEBs (building system boundary, conversion factors, energy balance, interaction with the grid, monitoring, etc.), mainly with the engineering approach, and a number of case studies worldwide have been investigated. In regard to photovoltaics' (PV) design, research demonstrated the following: (1) PV is an indispensable technology for meeting the net zero energy target; (2) meeting the target of the net zero energy balance at the architectural scale (by using only the surfaces of the building envelope to place renewables) is very difficult and therefore (3) an extension of the balance boundary to a wider scale is needed.

Human problem solving links to flexible reasoning and inference rather than to slow trial-and-error learning. It has received considerable attention since the early days of cognitive science, giving rise to well known cognitive architectures such as SOAR and ACT-R, but its computational and brain mechanisms remain incompletely known. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether problem solving is a “specialized” domain or module of cognition, in the sense that it requires computations that are fundamentally different from those supporting perception and action systems. Here we advance a novel view of human problem solving as probabilistic inference with subgoaling. In this perspective, key insights from cognitive architectures are retained such as the importance of using subgoals to split problems into subproblems. However, here the underlying computations use probabilistic inference methods analogous to those that are increasingly popular in the study of perception and action systems. To test our model we focus on the widely used Tower of Hanoi (ToH) task, and show that our proposed method can reproduce characteristic idiosyncrasies of human problem solvers: their sensitivity to the “community structure” of the ToH and their difficulties in executing so-called “counterintuitive” movements. Our analysis reveals that subgoals have two key roles in probabilistic inference and problem solving. First, prior beliefs on (likely) useful subgoals carve the problem space and define an implicit metric for the problem at hand—a metric to which humans are sensitive. Second, subgoals are used as waypoints in the probabilistic problem solving inference and permit to find effective solutions that, when unavailable, lead to problem solving deficits. Our study thus suggests that a probabilistic inference scheme enhanced with subgoals provides a comprehensive framework to study problem solving and its deficits. © 2016 Donnarumma et al.",,"human; model; perception; problem solving; algorithm; biology; cognition; computer simulation; decision making; neuropsychological test; psychological model; statistical model; Algorithms; Cognition; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Decision Making; Humans; Models, Psychological; Models, Statistical; Neuropsychological Tests; Problem Solving",2-s2.0-84964720944

Exposure to MeHg during gestation causes cognitive and motor imbalance in the rat pups. No studies are available on the differential effect of transplacental MeHg exposure on oxidative stress responses and cellular architecture in the specific motor and cognitive centers of rat offspring. Hence our study aimed to evaluate the changes in oxidative stress markers and histology in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of F1 generation due to prenatal MeHg exposure. We have tried four different doses viz, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 mg/kg of MeHg in drinking water to the pregnant rats from GD 5 till parturition. Pups of 2.5mg/kg and 3.5 mg/kg group were not survived. In 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg MeHg dosage group, on PND 21, the pups showed neurobehavioural toxicity in morris water maze, forced swim, rotarod, hotplate and open field behaviour tests. Increased TBARS levels and decreased GSH, GPx, Catalase and SOD were found in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Appearance of gliosis and extensive neuronal degeneration in both 0.5mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg doses were observed. Among the doses, oxidative, histological and behavioural changes were significant in 1.5mg/kg group.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA4 gene that codes for the alpha4 subunit of alpha4/beta2-containing receptors have previously been implicated in aspects of (mostly visual) attention and smoking-related behavioralmeasures. Here we investigated the effects of six synonymous but functional CHRNA4 exon 5 SNPs on the N100 event-related potential (ERP), an electrophysiological endophenotype elicited by a standard auditory oddball. A total of N = 1,705 subjects randomly selected from the general population were studied with electroencephalography (EEG) as part of the German Multicenter Study on nicotine addiction. Two of the six variants, rs1044396 and neighboring rs1044397, were significantly associated with N100 amplitude. This effect was pronounced in females where we also observed an effect on reaction time. Sequencing of the complete exon 5 region in the population sample excluded the existence of additional/functional variants thatmay be responsible for the observed effects. This is the first large-scale population-based study investigation the effects of CHRNA4 SNPs on brain activitymeasures related to stimulus processing and attention. Our results provide further evidence that common synonymous CHRNA4 exon 5 SNPs affect cognitive processes and suggest that they also play a role in the auditory system. As N100 amplitude reduction is considered a schizophrenia-related endophenotype the SNPs studied here may also be associated with schizophrenia outcome measures. ©2016 Mobascher et al.

The multimodal-acting antidepressant vortioxetine is an antagonist at 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptors, a partial agonist at 5-HT1B receptors, an agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, and an inhibitor of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) and has pro-cognitive properties. In preclinical studies, vortioxetine enhances long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of neuroplasticity, and enhances memory in various cognitive tasks. However, the molecular mechanisms by which vortioxetine augments LTP and memory remain unknown. Dendritic spines are specialized, actin-rich microdomains on dendritic shafts and are major sites of most excitatory synapses. Since dendritic spine remodeling is implicated in synaptic plasticity and spine size dictates the strength of synaptic transmission, we assessed if vortioxetine, relative to other antidepressants including ketamine, duloxetine, and fluoxetine, plays a role in the maintenance of dendritic spine architecture in vitro. We show that vortioxetine, ketamine, and duloxetine induce spine enlargement. However, only vortioxetine treatment increased the number of spines in contact with presynaptic terminals. In contrast, fluoxetine had no effect on spine remodeling. These findings imply that the various 5-HT receptor mechanisms of vortioxetine may play a role in its effect on spine dynamics and in increasing the proportion of potentially functional synaptic contacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Latent profile analysis was conducted on a school sample of 1648 children (11-12 years) and replicated in a sample of 2006 twins (8-17 years). Results In both samples pure-depressive and conduct-depressive profiles were identified. The pure-depressive profile was associated with female gender, while the conduct-depressive profile was associated with lower cognitive ability but not with gender.

Exposure to urban air pollution has been associated with poorer cognitive performance, which is thought to be a result of direct interference with brain maturation. We aimed to assess the extent of such potential effects of urban pollution on child brain maturation using general indicators of vehicle exhaust measured in the school environment and a comprehensive imaging evaluation. A group of 263 children, aged 8 to 12 years, underwent MRI to quantify regional brain volumes, tissue composition, myelination, cortical thickness, neural tract architecture, membrane metabolites, functional connectivity in major neural networks and activation/deactivation dynamics during a sensory task. A combined measurement of elemental carbon and NO2 was used as a putative marker of vehicle exhaust. Air pollution exposure was associated with brain changes of a functional nature, with no evident effect on brain anatomy, structure or membrane metabolites. Specifically, a higher content of pollutants was associated with lower functional integration and segregation in key brain networks relevant to both inner mental processes (the default mode network) and stimulus-driven mental operations. Age and performance (motor response speed) both showed the opposite effect to that of pollution, thus indicating that higher exposure is associated with slower brain maturation. In conclusion, urban air pollution appears to adversely affect brain maturation in a critical age with changes specifically concerning the functional domain. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Brain development; Functional connectivity; Functional MRI","carbon; exhaust gas; adolescent; air pollution; Article; artificial neural network; brain function; brain maturation; brain region; brain size; child; connectome; cortical thickness (brain); environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; female; frontal operculum; human; male; memory consolidation; motor performance; myelination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; school; somatosensory cortex; supplementary motor area; urban area; working memory; adverse effects; air pollution; brain; cognition; computer assisted diagnosis; drug effects; exhaust gas; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pathophysiology; physiology; toxicity; Air Pollution; Brain; Child; Cognition; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Neural Pathways; Vehicle Emissions",2-s2.0-84970922513

In this perspective, a semantic cognitive virtual microscopy approach has been recently initiated, the MICO project, by focusing on cognitive digital pathology. This approach supports the elaboration of pathology-compliant daily protocols dedicated to breast cancer grading, in particular mitotic counts and nuclear atypia. A proof of concept has thus been elaborated, and an extension of these approaches is now underway in a collaborative digital pathology framework, the FlexMIm project. As important milestones on the way to routine digital pathology, a series of pioneer international benchmarking initiatives have been launched for mitosis detection (MITOS), nuclear atypia grading (MITOS-ATYPIA) and glandular structure detection (GlaS), some of the fundamental grading components in diagnosis and prognosis. These initiatives allow envisaging a consolidated validation referential database for digital pathology in the very near future. This reference database will need coordinated efforts from all major teams working in this area worldwide, and it will certainly represent a critical bottleneck for the acceptance of all future imaging modules in clinical practice. In line with recent advances in molecular imaging and genetics, keeping the microscopic modality at the core of future digital systems in pathology is fundamental to insure the acceptance of these new technologies, as well as for a deeper systemic, structured comprehension of the pathologies. After all, at the scale of routine whole-slide imaging (WSI; ∼0.22 μm/pixel), the microscopic image represents a structured 'genomic cluster', enabling a naturally structured support for integrative digital pathology approaches. In order to accelerate and structure the integration of this heterogeneous information, a major effort is and will continue to be devoted to morphological microsemiology (microscopic morphology semantics). Besides insuring the traceability of the results (second opinion) and supporting the orchestration of high-content image analysis modules, the role of semantics will be crucial for the correlation between digital pathology and noninvasive medical imaging modalities. In addition, semantics has an important role in modelling the links between traditional microscopy and recent label-free technologies. The massive amount of visual data is challenging and represents a characteristic intrinsic to digital pathology. The design of an operational integrative microscopy framework needs to focus on scalable multiscale imaging formalism. In this sense, we prospectively consider some of the most recent scalable methodologies adapted to digital pathology as marked point processes for nuclear atypia and point-set mathematical morphology for architecture grading. To orchestrate this scalable framework, semantics-based WSI management (analysis, exploration, indexing, retrieval and report generation support) represents an important means towards approaches to integrating big data into biomedicine. This insight reflects our vision through an instantiation of essential bricks of this type of architecture. The generic approach introduced here is applicable to a number of challenges related to molecular imaging, high-content image management and, more generally, bioinformatics. © 2016 S.

Although the specific role of these oscillations has yet to be determined, it is clear that neuronal oscillations are abundant in the central nervous system. This raises the question of the origin of these oscillations: are the mechanisms for generating these oscillations genetically hard-wired or can they be acquired via a learning process? Here, we study the conditions under which oscillatory activity emerges through a process of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in a feed-forward architecture. First, we analyze the effect of oscillations on STDP-driven synaptic dynamics of a single synapse, and study how the parameters that characterize the STDP rule and the oscillations affect the resultant synaptic weight. Next, we analyze STDP-driven synaptic dynamics of a pre-synaptic population of neurons onto a single post-synaptic cell. The pre-synaptic neural population is assumed to be oscillating at the same frequency, albeit with different phases, such that the net activity of the pre-synaptic population is constant in time. Thus, in the homogeneous case in which all synapses are equal, the post-synaptic neuron receives constant input and hence does not oscillate. To investigate the transition to oscillatory activity, we develop a mean-field Fokker-Planck approximation of the synaptic dynamics. We analyze the conditions causing the homogeneous solution to lose its stability. The findings show that oscillatory activity appears through a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in the general case the homogeneous solution is unstable, and the synaptic dynamics does not converge to a different fixed point, but rather to a limit cycle. We show how the temporal structure of the STDP rule determines the stability of the homogeneous solution and the drift velocity of the limit cycle. © 2016 Luz, Shamir.",,"oscillation; plasticity; spike; synapse; velocity; action potential; algorithm; animal; biological model; biology; brain; computer simulation; human; learning; nerve cell plasticity; nerve ending; physiological feedback; physiology; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Brain; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Feedback, Physiological; Humans; Learning; Models, Neurological; Neuronal Plasticity; Presynaptic Terminals",2-s2.0-84964756604

Opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks is emerging for maximizing the RF spectrum efficiency where unlicensed Secondary Users (SUs) access idle spectrum bands without causing any harmful interference to licensed Primary Users (PUs). All SUs are required to scan/sense RF spectrum to find idle bands or search for idle bands in a spectrum database not to interfere with PUs while using those idle bands. In this paper, we propose a Real-time Opportunistic Spectrum Access in Cloud-assisted Cognitive Radio Networks (ROAR) architecture where SUs (i.e., USRP wireless devices) are equipped with wide-band (50 MHz - 6 GHz) antenna and GPS units. ROAR uses cloud computing platform for real-time processing of wide-band data since SUs' performance is considerably constrained by their limited power, memory and computational capacity. In ROAR architecture, there are two parts: spectrum sensing to create a database of idle channels and dynamic spectrum access for opportunistic SU communications using idle channels. For the spectrum database, RF sensors scan/sense RF bands to find idle bands and report the geo-location of idle band, channel frequency and time stamp to the database installed in the distributed cloud platform. For opportunistic spectrum access, each SU interested for opportunistic communication queries a spectrum database to find idle channels. Distributed cloud computing is used to find idle channels for the SU where geolocation and other demands (e.g., data rate) are checked to find whether the SU is admissible or not for a given geo-location and time. If the SU is admissible based on the admissibility criteria, spectrum server sends the list of channels available for a given location and time to the SU. Then SU chooses the best suited channel to communicate opportunistically. We evaluate the ROAR architecture using numerical results obtained from extensive experiments. © 2016 IEEE.","cloud-assisted dynamic spectrum access; cognitive radio network; Opportunistic spectrum access; ROAR architecture","Cloud computing; Computer architecture; Database systems; Location; Memory architecture; Microwave antennas; Network architecture; Query languages; Radio; Radio communication; Radio systems; Spectroscopy; Cloud computing platforms; Cognitive radio network; Computational capacity; Dynamic spectrum access; Harmful interferences; Opportunistic communications; Opportunistic spectrum access; Radio frequency spectrum; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84966651025

Through the modulation of ?-aminobutyric acid and glutamate release by the cannabinoid type 1 receptor, cannabinoids can activate the dopaminergic mesolimbic system and induce dependence in regular or heavy marijuana users. Overall, cannabis may provoke a profound alteration in brain neurotransmission and, in particular, in the mesolimbic system, where it can rearrange the molecular architecture at the synaptic level. In this way cannabis consumption can result in the disruption of the endocannabinoids' protective role of ongoing synaptic brain function, especially in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

One of the principal contributors to O&S cost is the airframe maintenance process. The US Air Force airframes are maintained using the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). ASIP's goal is to ensure the desired level of structural safety, durability, and supportability with the least possible economic burden throughout the aircraft design service life. ASIP uses a schedule-based maintenance approach by establishing predefined maintenance intervals for performing manual inspections. This approach requires vehicles to be removed from service at predetermined times regardless of their actual condition. In most cases, inspections performed during this process do not find any damage, and the airframe is returned to service until the next inspection interval. In December 2007, the DoD implemented the ""Condition-Based Maintenance Plus"" policy. As the name indicates, the DoD plans to move toward a process that services weapon systems based on their actual condition instead of the presumptive schedule-based approach. As a result of this policy, an increased emphasis has been placed on the development of advanced health management technologies, such as structural health monitoring (SHM). An essential element of condition based maintenance is improved decision making.This chapter presents a recently developed method for improved decision making, the cognitive architecture for state exploitation (CASE). CASE is demonstrated in a laboratory simulation of an SHM task. The simulation is followed by a comparison of availability, reliability, and costs that result from CASE and ASIP-guided decisions. Although the CASE guided decisions in the SHM application show great potential benefits, it is a new technology which must be validated before it can be used in practice. The chapter concludes with a discussion regarding methods for the validation of SHM systems when maintenance decisions are aided by a progressive decision framework such as CASE. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Aircraft structural integrity program (ASIP); Cognitive architecture for state exploitation (CASE); Maintenance; Repair; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Structural integrity","Airframes; Costs; Decision making; Fighter aircraft; Inspection; Life cycle; Maintenance; Repair; Structural frames; Structural integrity; Cognitive architectures; Condition based maintenance; Health management technologies; Maintenance approaches; Maintenance intervals; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Structural health monitoring systems; Total life cycle costs; Structural health monitoring",2-s2.0-84968756363

It has a great potential to make human life richer, more productive and more intelligent. For the realization of the cognitive computing, an efficient and scalable non-von Neumann architecture inspired by the human brain structure has been developed and a device which demonstrates the concept was also built. This device mimics the signal processing of the human brain, packing one million neuron circuits in 4,096 cores. It consumes almost 1,000 times less energy per event compared with a state-of-the-art multiprocessor. However, one million neurons only correspond to those of the bee's brain, and the inter-chip wiring becomes a key element to mimic the brains of higher order animals because this kind of neuromorphic device requires a large number of parallel signal lines for massive parallel signal operations. 3D chip stacking is one of the prospective technologies in achieving the device. In 3D chip stacking, technologies such as low cost TSV formation and fine-pitch interconnection, smaller than 10μm pitch technology are required. From the device reliability point of view, the optimization of solder composition for fine-pitch interconnection is also important. Injection Molded Solder (IMS) is well fit to this fine pitch interconnection, in terms of material optimization and low cost joints. As for the interposer, the build-up organic interposer is the most attractive candidates for the cost issue, but in the most top layer, ultra-fine pitch wiring with the line and space widths smaller than 1μm should be prepared. A number of material and process innovations are necessary for the inter-chip connection of neuromorphic devices. © 2016 SMTA.","Cognitive Computing; IMS and 3D integration; neuromorphic device","Artificial intelligence; Brain; Costs; Injection molding; Learning systems; Microelectronics; Microstrip lines; Signal processing; Three dimensional integrated circuits; 3-D integration; Cognitive Computing; Interconnect technology; Material optimization; Neumann architecture; Neuromorphic; Process Innovation; Solder composition; Integrated circuit interconnects",2-s2.0-84964969297

CRs work in an unlicensed network setting, so it is important that cognitive users utilize the spectrum opportunistically, i.e., without interrupting the licensed user's activity. To provide the opportunistic access for a cognitive 4G user, we propose an architecture that delivers the desired solution by following a novel five-step process. First, the cognitive (or secondary) user relays its throughput requirements from the application layer down to the media access layer by way of cross-layering. Second, the media access layer at its end senses the licensed spectrum and, based on the sensed parameters, characterizes the licensed (or primary) user's amount of spectrum occupancy into three different occupancy level types. Third, the licensed user's spectrum occupancy, categorized into three levels, is statistically represented by setting up a Markov model that evaluates the probability that the licensed channel could be found in a particular state at a given time instant for each level. Fourth, to provide opportunistic spectrum access to the secondary user, an optimization strategy is devised in the media access control layer that will bring face to face the throughput requirements obtained from the application layer and the steady-state probabilities for the licensed channel from the physical layer. Fifth, optimal performance metrics concerning the 4G user throughput and power are attained by solving the optimization problem. Results obtained are simulated against a variety of network parameters, and performance improvement through the proposed scheme is assessed by simulations conducted for a long-term evolution (LTE) system. © 2014 IEEE.","Cognitive radio (CR); cross-layer design (CLD); geometric programming (GP); Markov processes; quality of service","Computer simulation; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Markov processes; Medium access control; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network architecture; Network layers; Optimization; Radio systems; Throughput; Wireless telecommunication systems; Fourth generation (4G); Media access control layer; Opportunistic access; Opportunistic spectrum access; Optimization problems; Optimization strategy; Spectrum occupancies; Steady state probabilities; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84913620363

This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application model, called model of Mental Architecture Digitized - AMD. In particular, performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The concept of AMD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. AMD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus, the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The transmission and retention of knowledge rests on the cognitive faculty of the concepts linked to it.

For cognitive radio applications in particular, it can enable flexible and agile spectrum allocation, yet suffers from spectral leakage in the form of large side lobes, leading to inter-channel interference unless mitigated carefully. Hence, recent OFDM-based standards such as IEEE 802.11p for vehicular communication and IEEE 802.11af for TV whitespace reuse impose strict spectrum emission mask limits to combat adjacent channel interference. Stricter masks allow channels to operate closer together, improving spectral efficiency at the cost of implementation difficulty. Meeting these strict limits is a significant challenge for implementing both 802.11p and 802.11af, yet remains an important requirement for enabling cost-effective systems. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds baseband filtering within a cognitive radio architecture to meet the specification for the most stringent 802.11p and 802.11af masks, while allowing up to ten additional active 802.11af sub-carriers to occupy a single basic channel without violating SEM specifications.

In this respect, this paper introduces an innovative approach to cope with some key limitations of the present communication networks. In particular, the need of efficiently utilizing the available network resources and of guaranteeing the user expectations in terms of QoE requires a full cognitive approach, which is realized by the introduction of a novel architecture design, the so-called future Internet core platform. The future Internet core platform aims at bringing together the applications world with the network world, hence introducing a further cognitive level while enabling a new generation of applications: network-aware applications. This paper is concerned with an important aspect of the intelligent connectivity between applications and network: the service class association, which, if performed with a cognitive approach, can yield some important improvements and advantages in the emerging information era. The key idea presented in this paper is a real-time dynamic control procedure for the selection of the optimal service class. The approach is based on theoretical considerations validated by a proof-of-concept simulation. © 2014 IEEE.","Cognitive networks; future Internet; network-aware applications; optimal control; quality of experience (QoE)","Internet; Cognitive approaches; Information eras; Innovative approaches; Network resource; Novel architecture; Quality of experience (QoE); Real-time dynamics; User expectations; Quality of service",2-s2.0-84908053277

To better understand the socio-technical system we model alternative single pilot operations using Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) and analyse those models using Social Network Analysis (SNA). Four potential models of single pilot operations were compared to existing two pilot operations. Using SOCA-CAT from CWA, we were able to identify the potential functional loading and interactions between networks of agents. The interactions formed the basis on the SNA. These analyses potentially form the basis for distributed system architecture for the operation of a future aircraft.

Method: 57 cocaine dependent participants were randomized to receive modafinil 400 mg or placebo daily during a period of inpatient treatment followed by six weeks of outpatient treatment. Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recording during inpatient treatment prior to and after starting modafinil. Outpatient treatment consisted of weekly cognitive behavioral therapy. Contingency management was used to promote participation in treatment and research demands, including thrice weekly visits during the outpatient phase for urine toxicology screens and other assessments. The primary clinical outcome was the percent of urine toxicology screens that were negative for cocaine. Results: Modafinil treatment was associated with a higher mean percentage (52% vs. 26%) of cocaine-free urine screens (p = 0.02) and an increase in N3 sleep time (p = 0.002). The change in N3 sleep time mediated the higher rate of cocaine-free urine screens. Modafinil treatment was also associated with more consecutive days abstinent during outpatient treatment, greater survival of abstinence, higher daily rates of abstinence, and less sleep degradation typically associated with abstinence from chronic cocaine use. Conclusions: Morning-dosed modafinil improves slow-wave sleep in abstinent cocaine users in the inpatient setting, and this effect is a statistical mediator of improved clinical outcomes associated with continued modafinil treatment. The high rates of abstinence achieved in this trial suggest that promoting healthy sleep physiology in an inpatient setting may be important in the effective treatment of cocaine dependence. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Cocaine; Modafinil; Sleep; Slow-wave sleep; Treatment","modafinil; placebo; benzhydryl derivative; modafinil; wakefulness promoting agent; adult; Article; cocaine dependence; controlled study; disease free survival; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; female; human; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; patient compliance; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; REM sleep; sex difference; sleep quality; sleep time; slow wave sleep; treatment outcome; Cocaine-Related Disorders; cognitive therapy; complication; drug effects; hospital patient; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; outpatient; psychology; sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders; Adult; Benzhydryl Compounds; Cocaine-Related Disorders; Cognitive Therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Inpatients; Male; Middle Aged; Outpatients; Sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders; Treatment Outcome; Wakefulness-Promoting Agents",2-s2.0-84960082397

This architecture is a unified and consistent system with functional parts of sensory encoding, learning, and decoding. This is the first systematic model attempting to reveal the neural mechanisms considering both the upstream and the downstream neurons together. The whole system is a consistent temporal framework, where the precise timing of spikes is employed for information processing and cognitive computing. Experimental results show that the system is competent to perform the sequence recognition, being robust to noisy sensory inputs and invariant to changes in the intervals between input stimuli within a certain range. The classification ability of the temporal learning rule used in the system is investigated through two benchmark tasks that outperform the other two widely used learning rules for classification. The results also demonstrate the computational power of spiking neurons over perceptrons for processing spatiotemporal patterns. In summary, the system provides a general way with spiking neurons to encode external stimuli into spatiotemporal spikes, to learn the encoded spike patterns with temporal learning rules, and to decode the sequence order with downstream neurons. The system structure would be beneficial for developments in both hardware and software. © 2012 IEEE.","Encoding; pattern recognition; sequence recognition; spiking neural networks (SNNs); Temporal learning","Decoding; Encoding (symbols); Network architecture; Neurons; Classification ability; Cognitive Computing; Computational power; Hardware and software; Sequence recognition; Spatiotemporal patterns; Spiking neural networks; Systematic modeling; Neural networks; action potential; algorithm; animal; biological model; computer simulation; human; information processing; nerve cell; nerve cell network; physiology; Action Potentials; Algorithms; Animals; Automatic Data Processing; Computer Simulation; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Neurons",2-s2.0-84927750136

Assessment of potential state-dependent alterations in sleep architecture and arousal relative to antipsychotic-like activity is critical for the development of novel antipsychotic drugs (APDs). Recently, we reported that VU0467154, a selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), exhibits robust APD-like and cognitive enhancing activity in rodents. However, the state-dependent effects of VU0467154 on sleep architecture and arousal have not been examined. Using polysomnography and quantitative electroencephalographic recordings from subcranial electrodes in rats, we evaluated the effects of VU0467154, in comparison with the atypical APD clozapine and the M1/M4-preferring mAChR agonist xanomeline. VU0467154 induced state-dependent alterations in sleep architecture and arousal including delayed Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep onset, increased cumulative duration of total and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, and increased arousal during waking periods. Clozapine decreased arousal during wake, increased cumulative NREM, and decreased REM sleep. In contrast, xanomeline increased time awake and arousal during wake, but reduced slow wave activity during NREM sleep. Additionally, in combination with the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801, modeling NMDAR hypofunction thought to underlie many symptoms in schizophrenia, both VU0467154 and clozapine attenuated MK-801-induced elevations in high frequency gamma power consistent with an APD-like mechanism of action. These findings suggest that selective M4 PAMs may represent a novel mechanism for treating multiple symptoms of schizophrenia, including disruptions in sleep architecture without a sedative profile. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to demonstrate the importance of cooperative communication in vehicular networks, a spectral efficient architecture has been proposed for cooperative centralized and distributed spectrum sensing in vehicular networks. We discuss the possibilities of Cognitive Radio in the cooperative vehicular environment. In order to exhibit cooperative vehicular networks, hardware modules are designed for a vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure and infrastructure to infrastructure communications. Furthermore, quantitative analysis is made in order to calculate the energy optimization, connectivity failure probability and traffic management in cooperative vehicular networks. In addition, we test the results of the cooperative vehicular network by simulating it in NS2.

Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) promote sleep by selectively inhibiting wake-promoting neuropeptide signaling, unlike global inhibition of central nervous system excitation by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor (GABAaR) modulators. We evaluated the effect of DORA versus GABAaR modulators on underlying sleep architecture, ability to waken to emotionally relevant stimuli versus neutral auditory cues, and performance on a sleepiness-sensitive cognitive task upon awakening. Methods: DORA-22 and GABAaR modulators (eszopiclone, diazepam) were evaluated in adult male rhesus monkeys (n = 34) with continuous polysomnography recordings in crossover studies of sleep architecture, arousability to a classically conditioned salient versus neutral acoustical stimulus, and psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) performance if awakened. Results: All compounds decreased wakefulness, but only DORA-22 sleep resembled unmedicated sleep in terms of underlying sleep architecture, preserved ability to awaken to salient-conditioned acoustic stimuli while maintaining sleep during neutral acoustic stimuli, and no congnitive impairment in PVT performance. Although GABAaR modulators induced lighter sleep, monkeys rarely woke to salient stimuli and PVT performance was impaired if monkeys were awakened. Conclusions: In nonhuman primates, DORAs' targeted mechanism for promoting sleep protects the ability to selectively arouse to salient stimuli and perform attentional tasks unimpaired, suggesting meaningful differentiation between a hypnotic agent that works through antagonizing orexin wake signaling versus the sedative hypnotic effects of the GABAaR modulator mechanism of action.","Arousal; Auditory discrimination; Nonhuman primates; Orexin receptor antagonist; Psychomotor vigilance task; Sleep","diazepam; dora 22; eszopiclone; orexin; orexin receptor antagonist; unclassified drug; diazepam; DORA-22; eszopiclone; GABAergic receptor affecting agent; hypnotic sedative agent; orexin; orexin receptor antagonist; piperidine derivative; triazole derivative; adult; alertness; animal experiment; arousal; Article; association; attention; cognition; controlled study; drug mechanism; electrocorticography; electromyogram; electrooculogram; Haplorhini; male; nonhuman; polysomnography; priority journal; psychomotor vigilance task; REM sleep; sleep; slow wave sleep; stimulus; wakefulness; animal; arousal; conditioned reflex; crossover procedure; drug effects; metabolism; physiology; rhesus monkey; signal transduction; sleep; sleep stage; wakefulness; Animals; Arousal; Conditioning, Classical; Cross-Over Studies; Diazepam; Eszopiclone; GABA Agents; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Macaca mulatta; Male; Orexin Receptor Antagonists; Orexins; Piperidines; Polysomnography; Signal Transduction; Sleep; Sleep Stages; Triazoles; Wakefulness",2-s2.0-84960422725

However, it remains unclear whether a compensatory modification of spontaneous neural activity occurs in adult brain during prolonged high-altitude (HA) adaptation. In this study, we obtained resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) images in 16 adults who have immigrated to Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2300-4400 m) for 2 years and in 16 age-matched sea level (SL) controls. A validated regional homogeneity (Reho) method was employed to investigate the local synchronization of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Seed connectivity analysis was carried out subsequently. Cognitive and physiological assessments were made and correlated with the image metrics. Compared with SL controls, global mean Reho was significantly increased in HA immigrants as well as a regional increase in the right inferolateral sensorimotor cortex. Furthermore, mean z-Reho value extracted within the inferolateral sensorimotor area showed trend-level significant inverse correlation with memory search reaction time in HA immigrants. These observations, for the first time, provide evidence of adult brain resilience of spontaneous neural activity after long-term HA exposure without inherited and developmental effects.

Here, we employed graph theoretical analysis of longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging data (DTI) over a 5-year period to investigate brain network topology in schizophrenia and its relationship with clinical manifestations of the illness. Using deterministic tractography, weighted brain anatomical networks were constructed from 31 patients experiencing schizophrenia and 28 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. Although the overall small-world characteristics were observed at both baseline and follow-up, a scan-point independent significant deficit of global integration was found in patients compared to controls, suggesting dysfunctional integration of the brain and supporting the notion of schizophrenia as a disconnection syndrome. Specifically, several brain regions (e.g., the inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral insula) that are crucial for cognitive and emotional integration were aberrant. Furthermore, a significant group-by-longitudinal scan interaction was revealed in the characteristic path length and global efficiency, attributing to a progressive aberration of global integration in patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, the progressive disruptions of the brain anatomical network topology were associated with the clinical symptoms of the patients. Together, our findings provide insights into the substrates of anatomical dysconnectivity patterns for schizophrenia and highlight the potential for connectome-based metrics as neural markers of illness progression and clinical change with treatment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Anatomical networks; Connectome; Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Graph theory; Longitudinal; Schizophrenia","adult; age distribution; anatomic landmark; Article; brain radiography; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical feature; connectome; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; disease association; female; human; male; middle aged; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; priority journal; schizophrenia; sex difference; young adult; brain; case control study; diagnostic imaging; diffusion tensor imaging; longitudinal study; nerve tract; pathology; procedures; psychological rating scale; schizophrenia; Adult; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Connectome; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Schizophrenia; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84958106099

Documenting changes in the structure of anatomical networks for this population would substantiate the notion that the brain's core network-level organization may undergo neuroplasticity as a result of life-long experience. To examine this issue, we compared whole-brain networks of regional cortical-thickness covariance in early blind and matched sighted individuals. This covariance is thought to reflect signatures of integration between systems involved in similar perceptual/cognitive functions. Using graph-theoretic metrics, we identified a unique mode of anatomical reorganization in the blind that differed from that found for sighted. This was seen in that network partition structures derived from subgroups of blind were more similar to each other than they were to partitions derived from sighted.

Neuroimaging data showing consistent activation of different multi-modal areas during word and sentence comprehension suggest that all meanings are processed indistinctively, by a set of general semantic centres or 'hubs'. However, words belonging to specific semantic categories selectively activate modality-preferential areas; for example, action-related words spark activity in dorsal motor cortex, whereas object-related ones activate ventral visual areas. The evidence for category-specific and category-general semantic areas begs for a unifying explanation, able to integrate the emergence of both. Here, a neurobiological model offering such an explanation is described. Using a neural architecture replicating anatomical and neurophysiological features of frontal, occipital and temporal cortices, basic aspects of word learning and semantic grounding in action and perception were simulated. As the network underwent training, distributed lexico-semantic circuits spontaneously emerged. These circuits exhibited different cortical distributions that reached into dorsal-motor or ventral-visual areas, reflecting the correlated category-specific sensorimotor patterns that co-occurred during action- or object-related semantic grounding, respectively. Crucially, substantial numbers of neurons of both types of distributed circuits emerged in areas interfacing between modality-preferential regions, i.e. in multimodal connection hubs, which therefore became loci of general semantic binding. By relating neuroanatomical structure and cellular-level learning mechanisms with system-level cognitive function, this model offers a neurobiological account of category-general and category-specific semantic areas based on the different cortical distributions of the underlying semantic circuits. © 2015 The Authors.

Evans and Stanovich both opt for a dual-process theory, according to which Type-1 processes are autonomous and Type-2 processes use working memory and involve cognitive decoupling. Carruthers maintains a two-system account, according to which there is an intuitive system and a reflective system. I argue that these defenses of dual-process theory face two problems. First, as pointed out by Sloman, these new dual-process theories cast the net of “reasoning” too wide. Second, and more importantly, this singular distinction cannot accomplish the explanatory work needed to support dual-process theory. These theorists must fall back on using various properties from the Standard Menu in explanations, thereby committing these accounts to a “Standard View” that they had hoped to avoid. Thus, these theorists face a dilemma: either the distinction between intuitive and reflective (or autonomous and working memory involving) falls back on using the properties of the Standard Menu, or it lacks the explanatory promise that made dual-process theory attractive. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Cognitive Architecture; dual-process; Higher-Order Theories of Cognition; Jonathan Evans; Keith Stanovich; Peter Carruthers; reasoning; two-system",,2-s2.0-84957842946

Existing symbolic architectures, such as Soar and ACT-R, have been used in this way, but here the focus is on a new architecture, Sigma (∑), that leverages probabilistic graphical models towards a uniform grand unification of not only the traditional cognitive capabilities but also key non-cognitive aspects, and which thus yields unique opportunities for construction of new kinds of non-modular high-fidelity behavior models.

Software Defined Radio systems and their extension to cognitive and smart radio are characterized by distinct control loops for management which constantly increase network complexity and management inefficiencies, due to clear-cut between radio and core network management. Adding numerous devices and networks together will constantly increase the management cost, thus hinders scalability. Therefore, a holistic solution to synchronize radio and networks status has an elevated demand. To interconnect these systems and devices together, there is a need for a common management interface. OpenFlow is the first standard interface that enables Software Defined Networking (SDN). It can be rolled out in a variety of networking devices to enable improved automation and management by using common Application Program Interfaces to abstract the underlying networking details. The Software Defined Networking & Radio (SDN&R) framework proposed here has a potential combination between SDN and Radio networks to discover the underlying dynamism in cognitive access networks with integrated radio management. By isolating the control plane from the data plane, SDN&R enables a flexible management framework empowered by end-to-end goals through OpenFlow. In this article, we propose, validate, and evaluate the SDN&R architecture. In doing so, first we implement the OpenFlow enabled cognitive basestations (BSs) on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform. Furthermore, we develop software agents on BSs to provide radio status information to the cognitive control application implemented on the SDN controller. The results verify that the proposed framework in-lines with layer-2 or layer-3 forwarding performance.

The website's content was based on existing protocols and its structure was based on a card sort study. A Human Centered Design approach was applied to ensure a match between user and technology. In the current study we assess whether the website's structure still matches user needs, again via a card sort study. Methods: An open card sort study was conducted. Randomly drawn samples of 100 on-site search queries as they were entered on the MRSA-net website (during one year of use) were used as card input. In individual sessions, the cards were sorted by each participant (18 German and 10 Dutch HCWs, and 10 German and 10 Dutch members of the general public) into piles that were meaningful to them. Each participant provided a label for every pile of cards they created. Cluster analysis was performed on the resulting sorts, creating an overview of clusters of items placed together in one pile most frequently. In addition, pile labels were qualitatively analyzed to identify the participants' mental models. Results: Cluster analysis confirmed existing categories and revealed new themes emerging from the search query samples, such as financial issues and consequences for the patient. Even though MRSA-net addresses these topics, they are not prominently covered in the menu structure. The label analysis shows that 7 of a total of 44 MRSA-net categories were not reproduced by the participants. Additional themes such as information on other pathogens and categories such as legal issues emerged. Conclusions: This study shows that the card sort performed to create MRSA-net resulted in overall long-lasting structure and categories. New categories were identified, indicating that additional information needs emerged. Therefore, evaluating website structure should be a recurrent activity. Card sorting with ecological data as input for the cards is useful to identify changes in needs and mental models. By combining qualitative and quantitative analysis we gained insight into additional information needed by the target group, including their view on the domain and related themes. The results show differences between the four user groups in their sorts, which can mostly be explained by the groups' background. These findings confirm that HCD is a valuable approach to tailor information to the target group. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Card sort; Evaluation methods; Human centered design; Information architecture; Medical protocol; Mental models; MRSA; Website","Bacteria; Cluster analysis; Cognitive systems; Information management; Information retrieval; Information science; Network architecture; Sorting; Structural design; Websites; Card sort; Evaluation methods; Human-centered designs; Information architectures; Medical protocols; Mental model; MRSA; Piles; Article; cluster analysis; Dutchman; German (citizen); health care financing; health care personnel; human; Internet; legal aspect; medical informatics; medical information; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; priority journal; reproducibility; adult; clinical protocol; computer interface; electronic medical record system; evaluation study; female; Internet; male; microbiology; Staphylococcal Infections; transmission; utilization; Adult; Clinical Protocols; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Medical Informatics Applications; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcal Infections; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-84955305928

Cognitive radio (CR), which has the favorable ability to improve the spectrum utilization, provides an efficient and reliable solution for smart grid communications networks. In this paper, we study the QoS differential scheduling problem in the CR-based smart grid communications networks. The scheduler is responsible for managing the spectrum resources and arranging the data transmissions of smart grid users (SGUs). To guarantee the differential QoS, the SGUs are assigned to have different priorities according to their roles and their current situations in the smart grid. Based on the QoS-Aware priority policy, the scheduler adjusts the channels allocation to minimize the transmission delay of SGUs. The entire transmission scheduling problem is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process and solved by the methodology of adaptive dynamic programming. A heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) architecture is established for the scheduling problem. By the online network training, the HDP can learn from the activities of primary users and SGUs, and adjust the scheduling decision to achieve the purpose of transmission delay minimization. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed priority policy ensures the low transmission delay of high priority SGUs. In addition, the emergency data transmission delay is also reduced to a significantly low level, guaranteeing the differential QoS in smart grid. © 2012 IEEE.","Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP); cognitive radio (CR); quality of service (QoS); smart grid communications network; transmission scheduling.","Cognitive radio; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Dynamic programming; Heuristic programming; Markov processes; Quality of service; Scheduling; Adaptive dynamic programming; Communication technologies; Data transmission delay; Heuristic dynamic programming; Scheduling decisions; Semi-Markov decision process; Smart Grid Communications; Transmission scheduling; Smart power grids",2-s2.0-84928242403

In the artificial neural network literature, complex behaviors can be produced by composing elementary building blocks or motor primitives, possibly organized in a layered structure. However, it is still unknown how the brain learns and encodes multiple motor primitives, and how it rapidly reassembles, sequences and switches them by exerting cognitive control. In this paper we advance a novel proposal, a hierarchical programmable neural network architecture, based on the notion of programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme. In this approach, complex (and novel) behaviors can be acquired by embedding multiple modules (motor primitives) in a single, multi-purpose neural network. This is supported by recent theories of brain functioning in which skilled behaviors can be generated by combining functional different primitives embedded in “reusable” areas of “recycled” neurons. Such neuronal substrate supports flexible cognitive control, too. Modules are seen as interpreters of behaviors having controlling input parameters, or programs that encode structures of networks to be interpreted. Flexible cognitive control can be exerted by a programmer module feeding the interpreters with appropriate input parameters, without modifying connectivity. Our results in a multiple T -maze robotic scenario show how this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers permitting to learn, encode and control multiple qualitatively different behaviors. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","cognitive control; distributed representation; hierarchical organization; neuronal reuse; Programming neural networks",,2-s2.0-84957824197

By increasing the accuracy of common SPA operations, the overall network performance can be increased considerably. As well, the representations in such networks present a trade-off between being able to represent all possible values and being only able to represent the most likely values, but with high accuracy. We derive a heuristic to find the near-optimal point in this trade-off. This allows us to improve the accuracy of common SPA operations by up to 25 times. Ultimately, it allows for a reduction of neuron number and a more efficient use of both traditional and neuromorphic hardware, which we demonstrate here.

The insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa (IRSp53, also known as Baiap2) is a signaling and adapter protein in forebrain excitatory synapses. Mice deficient in IRSp53 display enhanced levels of postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and long-term potentiation (LTP) associated with severe learning deficits. In humans, reduced IRSp53/Baiap2 expression is associated with a variety of neurological disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we analyzed mice lacking one copy of the gene coding for IRSp53 using behavioral tests including contextual fear conditioning and the puzzle box. We show that a 50% reduction in IRSp53 levels strongly affects the performance in fear-evoking learning paradigms. This correlates with increased targeting of NMDARs to the postsynaptic density (PSD) in hippocampi of both heterozygous and knock out (ko) mice at the expense of extrasynaptic NMDARs. As hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP is enhanced in IRSp53-deficient mice, we investigated signaling cascades important for the formation of fear-evoked memories. Here, we observed a dramatic increase in cAMP response element-binding protein-dependent signaling in heterozygous and IRSp53-deficient mice, necessary for the transcriptional dependent phase of LTP. In contrast, activation of the MAPK and Akt kinase pathways required for translation-dependent phase of LTP are reduced. Our data suggest that loss or even the reduction in IRSp53 increases NMDAR-dependent cAMP responsive element-binding protein activation in the hippocampus, and interferes with the ability of mice to learn upon anxiety-related stimuli. © 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.","CREB; MAP kinase; NMDA receptor; PDZ domain; signal transduction; synaptic plasticity","cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; insulin receptor substrate; insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa; mitogen activated protein kinase; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor 2A; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor 2B; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; brain cortex; cognitive function test; controlled study; corpus striatum; correlation analysis; elevated plus maze test; enzyme activation; fear; fear conditioning test; genetic code; hippocampus; knockout mouse; learning; learning disorder; long term potentiation; male; memory; mouse; mouse mutant; nonhuman; postsynaptic density; priority journal; puzzle box test; signal transduction; wild type",2-s2.0-84957309423

The mechanisms accounting for this are likely multifactorial, and are not fully understood. Here we pursue the possibility that one important element is that TH affects basal and activity-dependent neurotrophin expression in brain regions important for neural processing. Graded exposure to propylthiouracil (PTU) during development produced dose-dependent reductions in mRNA expression of nerve growth factor (Ngf) in whole hippocampus of neonates. These changes in basal expression persisted to adulthood despite the return to euthyroid conditions in blood. In contrast to small PTU-induced reductions in basal expression of several genes, developmental PTU treatment dramatically reduced the activity-dependent expression of neurotrophins and related genes (Bdnft, Bdnfiv, Arc, and Klf9) in adulthood and was accompanied by deficits in hippocampal-based learning. These data demonstrate that mild TH insufficiency during development not only reduces expression of important neurotrophins that persists into adulthood but also severely restricts the activity-dependent induction of these genes. Considering the importance of these neurotrophins for sculpting the structural and functional synaptic architecture in the developing and the mature brain, it is likely that TH-mediated deficits in these plasticity mechanisms contribute to the cognitive deficiencies that accompany developmental TH compromise.

These kinds of task-specific activations are known to have a profound influence on both the functional and structural architecture of the human brain. However, until now, it is widely unknown whether this specific imprint of musical practice can still be detected during rest when no musical instrument is used. Therefore, we applied high-density electroencephalography and evaluated whole-brain functional connectivity as well as small-world topologies (i.e., node degree) during resting state in a sample of 15 professional musicians and 15 nonmusicians. As expected, musicians demonstrate increased intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity between those brain regions that are typically involved in music perception and production, such as the auditory, the sensorimotor, and prefrontal cortex as well as Broca's area. In addition, mean connectivity within this specific network was positively related to musical skill and the total number of training hours. Thus, we conclude that musical training distinctively shapes intrinsic functional network characteristics in such a manner that its signature can still be detected during a task-free condition.

In fMRI research, DN activity is associated with spontaneous and self-generated cognition, such as mind-wandering, episodic memory retrieval, future thinking, mental simulation, theory of mind reasoning, and creative cognition. Despite large literatures on developmental and disease-related influences on the DN, surprisingly little is known about the factors that impact normal variation in DN functioning. Using structural equation modeling and graph theoretical analysis of resting-state fMRI data, we provide evidence that Openness to Experience-a normally distributed personality trait reflecting a tendency to engage in imaginative, creative, and abstract cognitive processes-underlies efficiency of information processing within the DN. Across two studies, Openness predicted the global efficiency of a functional network comprised of DN nodes and corresponding edges. In Study 2, Openness remained a robust predictor-even after controlling for intelligence, age, gender, and other personality variables-explaining 18% of the variance in DN functioning. These findings point to a biological basis of Openness to Experience, and suggest that normally distributed personality traits affect the intrinsic architecture of large-scale brain systems.

The cognitive states of drivers significantly affect driving safety; in particular, fatigue driving, or drowsy driving, endangers both the individual and the public. For this reason, the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that can identify drowsy driving states is a crucial and urgent topic of study. Many EEG-based BCIs have been developed as artificial auxiliary systems for use in various practical applications because of the benefits of measuring EEG signals. In the literature, the efficacy of EEG-based BCIs in recognition tasks has been limited by low resolutions. The system proposed in this paper represents the first attempt to use the recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) architecture to increase adaptability in realistic EEG applications to overcome this bottleneck. This paper further analyzes brain dynamics in a simulated car driving task in a virtual-reality environment. The proposed RSEFNN model is evaluated using the generalized cross-subject approach, and the results indicate that the RSEFNN is superior to competing models regardless of the use of recurrent or nonrecurrent structures. © 2012 IEEE.","Brain-computer interface (BCI); driving fatigue; electroencephalography (EEG); recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN).","Dynamics; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Interface states; Interfaces (computer); Virtual reality; Auxiliary systems; Brain computer interfaces (BCIs); Competing models; Evolving fuzzy neural networks; Prediction systems; Recurrent fuzzy neural network; Regression problem; Virtual-reality environment; Brain computer interface; adult; artificial neural network; brain; car driving; electroencephalography; fatigue; female; forecasting; fuzzy logic; human; male; physiology; procedures; psychology; reaction time; young adult; Adult; Automobile Driving; Brain; Electroencephalography; Fatigue; Female; Forecasting; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Male; Neural Networks (Computer); Reaction Time; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84947967497

Because of the prevalence of these communication acts in daily routines (e.g., educational, vocational, and social), disrupted discourse is an important target for treatment of persons with cognitivecommunication (CC) disorders (American Speech-Language Hearing Association, 2005). However, there is a paucity of information with regard to the underlying cognitive architecture and processing demands associated with the various forms of discourse in non-brain-injured adults. This is, in part, due to a number of methodological constraints of functional neuroimaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging that severely limit ecologically typical communication acts such as listening and speaking during scanning. To circumvent these issues, this pilot investigation used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor hemodynamic activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during natural discourse-processing tasks in 13 neurologically healthy adult participants. Task demands were manipulated across a variety of discourse types to elucidate the associated neural and cognitive resources. Results indicate that the comprehension of well-organized discourse text is minimally demanding on the PFC. However, discourse production places a significant burden on the PFC and these processing demands generally reflect the relative complexity of the discourse task. These findings are discussed in terms of potential clinically relevant implications with regard to the elicitation, assessment, and remediation of CC impairments in clinical populations. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Traditional CN architecture requires each network devices to independently employ channel sensing mechanisms to discover free (or white) spectrum that can be temporarily borrowed for its own use. However, the distributed physical layer-based channel borrowing techniques cannot guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of primary and secondary users in a CN due to the lack of channel availability information. On the other hand, the FCC regulations introduced in 2010 allowed the use of Geo-Location Database (GDB) as the primary means of determining white space availability. Using GDB-based CN network architecture could offer significant QoS advantages. In this paper, we propose a new GDB-based QoS-aware CN architecture and secondary channel allocation technique that guarantees predictable and stable QoS for the secondary users. The proposed channel allocation technique uses statistical QoS estimation to predict the radio resource requirements of secondary users. We also propose to deploy a centralized channel manager that uses both proactive and reactive resource allocation techniques to allocate the white spectrum among secondary users. An OMNeT++ based CN simulation model has been developed to evaluate the proposed secondary channel allocation technique for an IEEE802.11 based cognitive WiFi network. Simulation results show that the proposed secondary channel allocation technique offers significant QoS advantages and stability to secondary users compared to the conventional distributed channel sensing technique. © 2015 IEEE.","Cognitive networks; Cognitive WiFi; IEEE802.11af; Radio resource allocation","Cognitive radio; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network layers; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Signal processing; Telecommunication networks; Wi-Fi; Cognitive network; Distributed channels; Geo-location database; IEEE802.11af; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Radio resource allocation; Resource allocation techniques; Transmission resources; Network architecture",2-s2.0-84963653965

Electrical stimulation approaches, such as deep-brain stimulation, have achieved the most clinical success, but they ultimately may be limited by the computational capacity of the residual cerebral circuitry. An alternative strategy is brain substrate expansion, in which the computational capacity of the brain is augmented through the addition of new processing units and the reconstitution of network connectivity. This latter approach has been explored to some degree using both biological and electronic means but thus far has not demonstrated the ability to reestablish the function of large-scale neuronal networks. In this review, we contend that fulfilling the potential of brain substrate expansion will require a significant shift from current methods that emphasize direct manipulations of the brain (e.g., injections of cellular suspensions and the implantation of multi-electrode arrays) to the generation of more sophisticated neural tissues and neural-electric hybrids in vitro that are subsequently transplanted into the brain. Drawing from neural tissue engineering, stem cell biology, and neural interface technologies, this strategy makes greater use of the manifold techniques available in the laboratory to create biocompatible constructs that recapitulate brain architecture and thus are more easily recognized and utilized by brain networks. © 2016 Chen, Jgamadze, Serruya, Cullen, Wolf and Smith.","Axons; Brain repair; Neural interfaces; Neuronal networks; Stem cells; Tissue engineering","brain damage; brain depth stimulation; brain electrophysiology; brain function; cell communication; cell suspension; cognition; cytoarchitecture; depth electrode; electroencephalography; hippocampus potential; human; nerve cell network; nerve potential; nerve reconstruction; nervous system development; neural substrate expansion; neurotransmission; prosthesis implantation; Review; tissue engineering",2-s2.0-84957881762

In addition, this ''wishlist'' of functionality also needs to be constrained within the limits of current technology. Designers of I-MASs are looking at mechanisms and processes that can satisfy more involved requirements. Two such paradigms are cognitive architectures and computational intelligence. The Agent Coordination and Cooperation Cognitive Model (AC3M) was developed to primarily illustrate the link between agent coordination and cooperation. Whilst analysing AC3M, the Stimulate-Orient-Decide-Act (SODA) methodology was discovered. This methodology is a result of integrating cognitive architecture principles with computational intelligence. SODA was the integration of the Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) methodology with the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop and results in the components of BDI being linked to phases of the OODA loop.

Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to independently track these microstructural and morphological changes in vivo, however few studies have investigated the relationship between them despite their concurrency in the developing brain. Further, because measures of cortical morphology rely on underlying gray-white matter tissue contrast, which itself is a function of white matter myelination, it is unclear if contrast-based measures of cortical development accurately reflect cortical architecture, or if they merely represent adjacent white matter maturation. This may be particularly true in young children, in whom brain structure is rapidly maturing. Here for the first time, we investigate the dynamic relationship between cortical and white matter development across early childhood, from 1 to 6. years. We present measurements of cortical thickness with respect to cortical and adjacent myelin water fraction (MWF) in 33 bilateral cortical regions. Significant results in only 14 of 66 (21%) cortical regions suggest that cortical thickness measures are not heavily driven by changes in adjacent white matter, and that brain imaging studies of cortical and white matter maturation reflect distinct, but complimentary, neurodevelopmental processes. © 2015 The Authors.","Brain MRI; Cortical development; Cortical thickness; Infant brain development; Myelin water fraction; Myelination","myelin; water; age distribution; Article; brain cortex; brain maturation; child; childhood; cohort analysis; cortical thickness (brain); female; human; image analysis; male; myelination; neuroimaging; preschool child; priority journal; white matter; brain cortex; computer assisted diagnosis; growth, development and aging; infant; myelin sheath; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; white matter; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myelin Sheath; White Matter",2-s2.0-84945559468

Alcohol-induced abnormalities in glial cells have been suspected of contributing to the adverse effects of alcohol on the developing brain for several years, although much research still needs to be done to causally link the effects of alcohol on specific brain structures and behavior to alterations in glial cell development and function. Damage to radial glia due to prenatal alcohol exposure may underlie observations of abnormal neuronal and glial migration in humans with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), as well as primate and rodent models of FAS. A reduction in cell number and altered development has been reported for several glial cell types in animal models of FAS. In utero alcohol exposure can cause microencephaly when alcohol exposure occurs during the brain growth spurt a period characterized by rapid astrocyte proliferation and maturation; since astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the brain, microenchephaly may be caused by reduced astrocyte proliferation or survival, as observed in in vitro and in vivo studies. Delayed oligodendrocyte development and increased oligodendrocyte precursor apoptosis has also been reported in experimental models of FASD, which may be linked to altered myelination/white matter integrity found in FASD children. Children with FAS exhibit hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, two areas requiring guidance from glial cells and proper maturation of oligodendrocytes. Finally, developmental alcohol exposure disrupts microglial function and induces microglial apoptosis; given the role of microglia in synaptic pruning during brain development, the effects of alcohol on microglia may be involved in the abnormal brain plasticity reported in FASD. The consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure on glial cells, including radial glia and other transient glial structures present in the developing brain, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and their precursors, and microglia contributes to abnormal neuronal development, reduced neuron survival and disrupted brain architecture and connectivity. This review highlights the CNS structural abnormalities caused by in utero alcohol exposure and outlines which abnormalities are likely mediated by alcohol effects on glial cell development and function. © 2016 Wilhelm and Guizzetti.","Animal models; Astrocyte; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; Fetal alcohol syndrome; Microglia; Neurodevelopment; Oligodendrocyte","glial fibrillary acidic protein; astrocyte; brain development; brain malformation; brain nerve cell; brain size; cell proliferation; disease association; fetal alcohol syndrome; glia cell; human; lipid homeostasis; microglia; myelination; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; oligodendroglia; oxidative stress; protein expression; Review",2-s2.0-84957965133

However, neuroimaging methods thus far have failed to visualize the NFA in healthy participants, likely due to fMRI signal dropout caused by the air/bone interface of the petrous bone (Shum et al., 2013). In the current study, we combined a 64-channel head coil with high spatial resolution, localized shimming, and liberal smoothing, thereby decreasing the signal dropout and increasing the temporal signal-to-noise ratio in the neighborhood of the NFA. We presented subjects with numbers, letters, false numbers, false letters, objects and their Fourier randomized versions.

Further, we could identify the NFA on the single-subject level in most of our participants.

Antibodies against these proteins resolve forebrain centres, or their equivalents, having the same ground pattern of neuronal organization in species across five phyla.

I shall point out that the three approaches on CT are incomplete: (1) neglects pretend play (which prelinguistic children perform) as an instantiation of the CT; (2) puts too much emphasis on the linguistic dimension of pretense; (3) is highly demanding on the cognitive architecture that we ought to have by nature-the socalled children as scientists. © 2016 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Bayesian learning; causal learning; cognitive development; Counterfactual reasoning; interventionism",,2-s2.0-84961181128

In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The DNN takes a component-centered approach to system design, decomposing each asset in terms of data inputs and outputs according to their roles and interactions in a fusion network. However, to ensure relevancy to and organizational fitment within command and control (C2) processes, principles from cognitive systems engineering emphasize that system design must take a human-centered systems view, integrating information needs and decision making requirements to drive the architecture design and capabilities of network assets. In the current work, we present an approach for structuring and assessing DNDW systems that uses a unique hybrid DNN top-down system design with a human-centered process design, combining DNN node decomposition with artifacts from cognitive analysis (i.e., system abstraction decomposition models, decision ladders) to provide work domain and task-level insights at different levels in an example intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) system setting.

SGs feature multi-way communication among energy generation, transmission, distribution, and usage facilities. The reliable, efficient, and intelligent management of complex power systems requires integration of high-speed, reliable, and secure data information and communication technology into the SGs to monitor and regulate power generation and usage. Despite several challenges, such as trade-offs between wireless coverage and capacity as well as limited spectral resources in SGs, wireless communication is a promising SG communications technology. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) in particular are highly promising for providing timely SG wireless communications by utilizing all available spectrum resources. We provide in this paper a comprehensive survey on the CRN communication paradigm in SGs, including the system architecture, communication network compositions, applications, and CR-based communication technologies. We highlight potential applications of CR-based SG systems. We survey CR-based spectrum sensing approaches with their major classifications.

Increasing bandwidth requirements coupled with increasing the number of satellites in LEO, MEO, and GEO orbits will lead to spectrum interference. Space communication networks will require spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum allocation, and use of spectrum databases to mitigate these issues for the single link connectivity and cognitive networking techniques for the multiple link connectivity. Ground networks, which are capable of automatically connecting to various satellite networks, will need to be augmented with cognitive abilities as well. Emerging spectrum management approaches are becoming increasingly complex. In this paper, we propose an architectural approach based on the integration of technologies such as deep learning, cognitive radios, cognitive networking, and security. The approach enables a significant degree of automation in the space communication network. Several high-level aero and space scenarios where spectrum interference is going to be a key issue are identified. Details of proposed architecture will be systematically described from communications and security perspective.

Setting aside debates about the legitimacy of inferring the existence of dissociable systems from 'behavioural' dissociation data, the main idea behind the dissociation approach is that two cognitive systems are dissociable, and thus viewed as distinct, if each can be damaged, or impaired, without affecting the other system's functions. In this article, I propose a notion of functional independence that does not require dissociability, and describe an approach to the functional decomposition and modelling of cognitive systems that complements the dissociation approach. I show that highly integrated cognitive and neurocognitive systems can be decomposed into non-dissociable but functionally independent components, and argue that this approach can provide a general account of cognitive specialization in terms of a stable structure-function relationship. © 2015 The Author.

Traditionally, planners have been used to decide skills to be activated, as well as in which sequence, like state machines. Recently, cognitive architectures like SOAR have been proposed to act as the reasoner by selecting which competence the robot should perform, addressing it towards the goal. However, they have been unidirectionally integrated: once the plan is completely designed by the cognitive architecture, it is sent to the robot, but no feedback is provided to the reasoner. Instead, our proposal allows to establish bi-directional communication between the reasoner and the robot. In this form, the reasoner can develop incomplete plans under the assumption that a part of the information to complete the plan for achieving the goal will arrive delayed from the robot's environment as well as the user. Our work develops this bi-directional communication between the SOAR cognitive architecture and the ROS (Robot Operating System) environment, usual in mobile robotics.

For future end-to-end architecture designs, a key challenge is meeting expected application quality of service requirements for multiple simultaneous mission data flows with options to use diverse onboard local data buses, commercial ground networks, and multiple satellite relay constellations in LEO, MEO, GEO, or even deep space relay links. Effectively utilizing a complex network topology requires orchestration and direction that spans the many discrete, individually addressable computer systems, which cause them to act in concert to achieve the overall network goals. The system must be intelligent enough to not only function under nominal conditions, but also adapt to unexpected situations, and reorganize or adapt to perform roles not originally intended for the system or explicitly programmed. This paper describes architecture features of cognitive networking within the future NASA space communications infrastructure, and interacting with the legacy systems and infrastructure in the meantime. The paper begins by discussing the need for increased automation, including inter-system collaboration. This discussion motivates the features of an architecture including cognitive networking for future missions and relays, interoperating with both existing endpoint-based networking models and emerging information-centric models.

However, visual narratives, like those in comics, provide an interesting challenge to multimodal communication because the words and/or images can guide the overall meaning, and both modalities can appear in complicated ""grammatical"" sequences: sentences use a syntactic structure and sequential images use a narrative structure. These dual structures create complexity beyond those typically addressed by theories of multimodality where only a single form uses combinatorial structure, and also poses challenges for models of the linguistic system that focus on single modalities. This paper outlines a broad theoretical framework for multimodal interactions by expanding on Jackendoff's (2002) parallel architecture for language. Multimodal interactions are characterized in terms of their component cognitive structures: whether a particular modality (verbal, bodily, visual) is present, whether it uses a grammatical structure (syntax, narrative), and whether it ""dominates"" the semantics of the overall expression. Altogether, this approach integrates multimodal interactions into an existing framework of language and cognition, and characterizes interactions between varying complexity in the verbal, bodily, and graphic domains. The resulting theoretical model presents an expanded consideration of the boundaries of the ""linguistic"" system and its involvement in multimodal interactions, with a framework that can benefit research on corpus analyses, experimentation, and the educational benefits of multimodality. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Comics; Gesture; Linguistic models; Multimodality; Narrative; Parallel architecture; Visual language","Article; codominance; cognition; conceptual framework; grammar; human; language; narrative; perception; priority journal; semantics; theoretical model; visual information; interpersonal communication; semantics; Communication; Humans; Semantics",2-s2.0-84944789745

Our point of departure is Simondon's (1992) theory of individuation, which we integrate with the enactive theory of cognition (Di Paolo et al., 2010) and Luhmann's (1996) theory of social systems. This forges a novel view of social systems as complex, individuating sequences of communicative interactions that together constitute distributed yet distinct cognitive agencies, acquiring a capacity to exert influence over their human-constituted environment. We conclude that the resulting framework suggests several different paths of integrating AI agents into human society. One path suggests the emulation of a largely simplified version of the human mind, reduced in its functions to a specific triple selection-making which is necessary for sustaining social systems.

Sensing architecture based on IPv6 can help AMI be aware of communication network topology and the access time of electrical devices, and calculate real-time electricity billing. Smart meter data is collected using cognitive architecture so that it would be more accurate and meaningful. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic architecture of AMI, including master station system, smart meters and the key technologies of communication network. And then, for the existing AMI architecture, we analyze the current situation and challenges in the aspect of perception. Finally an AMI sensing architecture based on 6LowPAN and Mesh is proposed. Experiments show that the architecture can not only improve the accuracy of the meter data, but also sense the temporary access devices.

As in other academic fields, these theories aim to explain and predict the key phenomena of the discipline. Objective: The present article proposes a general theory of software engineering that we have labeled the Tarpit theory, in reference to the 1982 epigram by Alan Perlis. Method: An integrative theory development approach was employed to develop the Tarpit theory from four underlying theoretical fields: (i) languages and automata, (ii) cognitive architecture, (iii) problem solving, and (iv) organization structure. Its applicability was explored in three test cases. Results: The theory demonstrates an explanatory and predictive potential for a diverse set of software engineering phenomena. It demonstrates a capability of explaining Brooks's law, of making predictions about domain-specific languages, and of evaluating the pros and cons of the practice of continuous integration. Conclusion: The presented theory appears capable of explaining and predicting a wide range of software engineering phenomena.

As a result, there is a strong need for novel methods of behavior planning suitable for modern cognitive architectures aimed at robot control. One such method is presented in this work and is studied within a special class of navigation task called smart relocation task. The method is based on the hierarchical two-level model of abstraction and knowledge representation, e.g. symbolic and subsymbolic. On the symbolic level sign world model is used for knowledge representation and hierarchical planning algorithm, MAP, is utilized for planning. On the subsymbolic level the task of path planning is considered and solved as a graph search problem. Interaction between both planners is examined and inter-level interfaces and feedback loops are described.

Humans in such cases typically rely on social factors, such as individual relationships and ethical background. An artificial autonomous agent in such cases can be more useful and efficient as an actor in a human team, if its behavior is believable, i.e., similar to the naturally motivated human behavior. This similarity can be achieved in a cognitive architecture through the attribution of characters to actors and human-like reasoning in terms of ethical norms and moral schemas applied to developing individual relationships among characters. Whether the actor's behavior is sufficiently human-like and human-compatible in this sense, can be judged based on a Turing-like test that is described and analyzed here in simplistic videogame settings. The challenge for an artificial actor is to be preferred, over its human rival, as a trustworthy partner of the human participant. Additional metrics include behavioral characteristics derived from the study of cognitive architecture eBICA. The paradigm extends to other settings as well, and can be useful for evaluation of cognitive architectures that support near-human-level social emotionality. © 2016 The Authors.","believability; emotional cognition; human-level AI; Turing test","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Cognitive systems; Philosophical aspects; Behavioral characteristics; believability; Cognitive architectures; emotional cognition; Human behaviors; Human levels; Multiple actors; Turing tests; Behavioral research",2-s2.0-85006489743

We investigate this question in the framework of the ""Distributed Adaptive Control"" (DAC) cognitive architecture, where we study top-down and bottom-up interactions between low-level reactive control and symbolic rule learning in embodied agents. Reactive behaviors are modeled using a neural allostatic controller, whereas high-level behaviors are modeled using a biologically-grounded memory network reflecting the role of the prefrontal cortex.

Such systems need to understand the context under which they operate, by perceiving, planning and reasoning to team up with a human. The robotic system should also have perspective taking capabilities in order to efficiently collaborate with the human. In this work an integrated cognitive architecture for human robot collaboration, that aims to develop perspective taking capabilities using human preferences, is proposed. This is achieved by developing a 'mental model' that takes human preferences, the knowledge of the task (including the objects), and the capabilities of the human and the robot. This mental model forms the basis of the cognitive architecture, to perceive, reason and plan in the human-robot collaborative scenario. The robotic platform guided by the cognitive architecture, performs 'picking', 'showing', 'placing' and 'handover' actions on real world objects (of interest in the assembly process) in coordination with the human. The goal is to answer the 'how' (how a manipulation action should be carried out by the robot in a dynamically changing environment) and the 'where' (where the manipulation action should take place) of the assembly process considering/given varying human preferences. We show that the proposed cognitive architecture is capable of answering these questions through various experiments and evaluation. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.","Common goal; Human robot collaboration; Human robot interaction; Knowledge representation; Perception and vision in robotics; Task planning","Assembly; Cognitive systems; Human computer interaction; Knowledge representation; Robot programming; Robotic assembly; Robotics; Robots; Changing environment; Cognitive architectures; Common goal; Human-robot collaboration; Levels of abstraction; Perspective taking; Real-world objects; Task planning; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85019773228

This architecture relies on a machine consciousness approach - Global Workspace Theory - in order to use competition and broadcast, allowing a group of local traffic controllers to interact, resulting in a better group performance. The main idea is that the local controllers usually perform a purely reactive behavior, defining the times of red and green lights, according just to local information. These local controllers compete in order to define which of them is experiencing the most critical traffic situation. The controller in the worst condition gains access to the global workspace, further broadcasting its condition (and its location) to all other controllers, asking for their help in dealing with its situation. This call from the controller accessing the global workspace will cause an interference in the reactive local behavior, for those local controllers with some chance in helping the controller in a critical condition, by containing traffic in its direction. This group behavior, coordinated by the global workspace strategy, turns the once reactive behavior into a kind of deliberative one. We show that this strategy is capable of improving the overall mean travel time of vehicles flowing through the urban network. A consistent gain in performance with the ""Artificial Consciousness"" traffic signal controller during all simulation time, throughout different simulated scenarios, could be observed, ranging from around 13.8% to more than 21%. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Collaboration means working with a partner to reach a common goal and it involves performing both, individual and joint actions, with her. Human-robot collaboration requires, at least, two conditions to be efficient: a) a common plan, usually under-defined, for all involved partners; and b) for each partner, the capability to infer the intentions of the other in order to coordinate the common behavior. This is a hard problem for robotics since people can change their minds on their envisaged goal or interrupt a task without delivering legible reasons. Also, collaborative robots should select their actions taking into account human-aware factors such as safety, reliability and comfort. Current robotic cognitive systems are usually limited in this respect as they lack the rich dynamic representations and the flexible human-aware planning capabilities needed to succeed in these collaboration tasks. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing and discussing a deep hybrid representation, DSR, which will be geometrically ordered at several layers of abstraction (deep) and will merge symbolic and geometric information (hybrid). This representation is part of a new agents-based robotics cognitive architecture called CORTEX. The agents that form part of CORTEX are in charge of high-level functionalities, reactive and deliberative, and share this representation among them. They keep it synchronized with the real world through sensor readings, and coherent with the internal domain knowledge by validating each update. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Deep representations; Social robotics; World internalization","Cognitive systems; Human computer interaction; Manipulators; Robot programming; Robots; Autonomous mobile manipulator; Cognitive architectures; Deep representations; Human-robot collaboration; Hybrid representations; Internal representation; Social robotics; World internalization; Robotics",2-s2.0-84952361618

Digital Predistortion (DPD) is an effective technique to counteract these impairments. To help maximize agility in cognitive radio systems, it is important to investigate dynamically reconfigurable DPD systems that are adaptive to changes in the employed modulation schemes and operational constraints. To help maximize effectiveness, such reconfiguration should be performed based on multidimensional operational criteria. With this motivation, we develop in this paper a novel evolutionary algorithm framework for multiobjective optimization of DPD systems. We demonstrate our framework by applying it to develop an adaptive DPD architecture, called the adaptive, dataflow-based DPD architecture (ADDA), where Pareto-optimized DPD parameters are derived subject to multidimensional constraints to support efficient predistortion across time-varying operational requirements and modulation schemes.

To address this issue, we propose to learn non-linear representations of brain connectivity patterns from deep learning architectures. This is non-trivial, due to the limited subjects and the high costs of acquiring the data. Fortunately, auxiliary information from multiple side views such as clinical, serologic, immunologic, cognitive and other diagnostic testing also characterizes the states of subjects from different perspectives.

The proposed system generates a dance for a humanoid robot through the combination of basic movements synchronized with the music. The system made up of three parts: the extraction of features from audio file, estimation of movements through the Hidden Markov Models and, finally, the generation of dance. Starting from a set of given movements, the robot choices sequence of movements a suitable Hidden Markov Model, and synchronize them processing musical input. The proposed approach has the advantage that movement execution probabilities could be changed according evaluation of the dance execution in order to have an artificial creative system. In the same way, a choreographer could give more importance to some movements and/or exclude others, using the system as a co-creation tool. The approach has been tested on Aldebaran NAO humanoid using different genres of music, and experimentations was conduct at presence of real human dancers to have feedback of the goodness of the robot execution. Three professional judges expressed their evaluations about the following points: appropriateness of movements for a given musical genre; the precision to track the rhythm; the aesthetic impact of the whole sequence of movements; and the overall judgment of the robot performance. All the evaluations are very satisfying, and confirm that robot dance is realistic and aesthetically acceptable.

This paper first characterizes the new features of spectrum sharing in future wireless networks, including heterogeneity in sharing bands, diversity in sharing patterns, crowd intelligence in sharing devices, and hyperdensification in sharing networks. Then, to harness the benefits of these unique features and promote a vision of spectrum without bounds and networks without borders, this paper introduces a new concept of the Internet of spectrum devices (IoSDs) and develops a cloud-based architecture for IoSD over future wireless networks, with the prime aim of building a bridging network among various spectrum monitoring devices and massive spectrum utilization devices, and enabling a highly efficient spectrum sharing and management paradigm for future wireless networks. Furthermore, this paper presents a systematic tutorial on the key enabling techniques of the IoSD, including big spectrum data analytics, hierarchal spectrum resource optimization, and quality of experience-oriented spectrum service evaluation. In addition, the unresolved research issues are also presented. © 2013 IEEE.","cognitive radio; data analytics; Internet of spectrum devices (IoSD),; quality of experience (QoE); resource optimization","Cognitive radio; Computer architecture; Internet; Quality of service; Radio systems; Resource allocation; Wireless networks; Cloud-based architectures; Data analytics; Enabling techniques; Future wireless networks; Quality of experience (QoE); Resource optimization; Spectrum monitoring; Spectrum utilization; Network architecture",2-s2.0-84979829156

In this paper, we present a novel integration of mental simulation and analogical generalization algorithms into a cognitive robotic architecture that enables a similarly rudimentary generalization capability in robots. Specifically, we show how a robot can generate variations of a given scenario and then use the results of those new scenarios run in a physics simulator to generate generalized action scripts using analogical mappings. The generalized action scripts then allow the robot to perform the originally learned activity in a wider range of scenarios with different types of objects without the need for additional exploration or practice. In a proof-of-concept demonstration we show how the robot can generalize from a previously learned pick-and-place action performed with a single arm on an object with a handle to a pick-and-place action of a cylindrical object with no handle with two arms.

In fact, agents are social beings at the core. That is, agent behaviour is the result of more than just rational, goal-oriented deliberation. This requires novel agent architectures that start from and integrate different socio-cognitive elements such as emotions, social norms and personality. Current agent architectures however, do not support the construction of social agents in a structured, modular and computational- and designefficient manner. Inspired by service-orientation concepts, in this paper we propose MaaS (Mind as a Service) as a modular architecture for agent systems that enables the composition of different socio-cognitive capabilities into a running system. Depending on the characteristics of the domain, agent’s deliberation will require different social capabilities. We propose to model these capabilities as services, and define a ‘Deliberation Bus’ that enables to design deliberation as a composition of services. This approach allows to define deliberation architectures that are situational and dependent on the available components in order to cope with the complexity of social and physical environments in parallel.

Different accounts have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. The Trace Deletion account (Grodzinsky, 1995, 2000, 2006) attributes this deficit to an impairment in syntactic representations, whereas others (e.g., Caplan, Waters, Dede, Michaud, & Reddy, 2007; Haarmann, Just, & Carpenter, 1997) propose that the underlying structural representations are unimpaired, but sentence comprehension is affected by processing deficits, such as slow lexical activation, reduction in memory resources, slowed processing and/or intermittent deficiency, among others. We test the claims of two processing accounts, slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, and two versions of the Trace Deletion Hypothesis (TDH), in a computational framework for sentence processing (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005) implemented in ACT-R (Anderson, Byrne, Douglass, Lebiere, & Qin, 2004). The assumption of slowed processing is operationalized as slow procedural memory, so that each processing action is performed slower than normal, and intermittent deficiency as extra noise in the procedural memory, so that the parsing steps are more noisy than normal. We operationalize the TDH as an absence of trace information in the parse tree. To test the predictions of the models implementing these theories, we use the data from a German sentence-picture matching study reported in Hanne, Sekerina, Vasishth, Burchert, and De Bleser (2011). The data consist of offline (sentence-picture matching accuracies and response times) and online (eye fixation proportions) measures. From among the models considered, the model assuming that both slowed processing and intermittent deficiency are present emerges as the best model of sentence processing difficulty in aphasia. The modeling of individual differences suggests that, if we assume that patients have both slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, they have them in differing degrees. © 2015 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.","Aphasia; Cognitive architecture; Computational modeling; Eye movements; Individual differences; Non-canonical sentences; Sentence-picture matching","aphasia; ataxic aphasia; cognitive defect; comprehension; eye fixation; human; oculography; pathophysiology; psychological model; psychology; reaction time; Aphasia; Aphasia, Broca; Cognition Disorders; Comprehension; Eye Movement Measurements; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Models, Psychological; Reaction Time",2-s2.0-84956716756

Thus, in order to take the right decision during navigation, the robot is able to process both set of information, compare them in real time and react accordingly.

The need in constructing intelligent monitoring system is shown. Ambient intelligence architecture for intelligent monitoring system is introduced, its components are discussed. An important component of ambient intelligence architecture is a hybrid system of knowledge acquisition/discovery that contains sensor data mining (interpretation), expert knowledge acquisition and ontological engineering facilities. Four principles of cognitive measurements are formulated in the context of intelligent monitoring. Cognitive measurement is seen here as a two-leveled hierarchical granulation process realized by using cognitive sensors. Here cognitive sensor is interpreted as not only measurement-information device for studying monitoring object and enabling knowledge discovery from measurement, but also as an “artificial understanding system”. The operation of cognitive sensor is based on logical-algebraic pragmatics of measurements. In this context some concepts and definitions of understanding are discussed. A dual descriptive-prescriptive nature of understanding is shown. A generalized logical-algebraic approach to constructing cognitive sensors is proposed. It is based on the concept of logical world and visual representation of various algebraic structures specifying logical worlds by Hasse diagrams. Colored Hasse diagrams are introduced in the paper enabling a better understanding of logical world pragmatics for measurement results.

For a successful operation the surgeon has to keep track of a variety of relevant impact factors, such as patient-individual medical history records, valve geometries, or tissue properties of the surgical target, and thereon-based deduce type and size of the best-suitable ring prosthesis according to practical surgery experience. With this work, we aim at supporting the surgeon in selecting this ring prosthesis by means of a comprehensive information processing pipeline. It gathers all available patient-individual information, and mines this data according to 'surgical rules', that represent published MVR expert knowledge and recommended best practices, in order to suggest a set of potentially suitable annuloplasty rings. Subsequently, these rings are employed in biomechanical MVR simulation scenarios, which simulate the behavior of the patient-specific mitral valve subjected to the respective virtual ring implantation. We present the implementation of our deductive system for MVR ring selection and how it is integrated into a cognitive data processing pipeline architecture, which is built under consideration of Linked Data principles in order to facilitate holistic information processing of heterogeneous medical data. By the example of MVR surgery, we demonstrate the ease of use and the applicability of our development.

In this research, the purpose of this paper is to provide a hardware friendly framework to generate sparse features that can be useful for key feature point selection, feature extraction, and descriptor construction. The inspiration is drawn from feature formation processes of the human brain, taking into account the sparse, modular, and hierarchical processing of visual information. Design/methodology/approach: A sparse set of neurons referred as active neurons determines the feature points necessary for high-level vision applications such as object recognition. A psycho-physical mechanism of human low-level vision relates edge detection to noticeable local spatial stimuli, representing this set of active neurons. A cognitive memory cell array-based implementation of low-level vision is proposed. Applications of memory cell in edge detection are used for realizing human vision inspired feature selection and leading to feature vector construction for high-level vision applications. Findings: True parallel architecture and faster response of cognitive circuits avoid time costly and redundant feature extraction steps. Validation of proposed feature vector toward high-level computer vision applications is demonstrated using standard object recognition databases. The comparison against existing state-of-the-art object recognition features and methods shows an accuracy of 97, 95, 69 percent for Columbia Object Image Library-100, ALOI, and PASCAL VOC 2007 databases indicating an increase from benchmark methods by 5, 3 and 10 percent, respectively. Originality/value: A hardware friendly low-level sparse edge feature processing system is proposed for recognizing objects. The edge features are developed based on threshold logic of neurons, and the sparse selection of the features applies a modular and hierarchical processing inspired from the human neural system. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Active neurons; Cognitive memory-cell array; Edge detection; Feature description; Low-level vision; Object features; Object recognition; Sparse features; Threshold logic","Computer circuits; Computer hardware; Computer vision; Edge detection; Extraction; Hardware; Memory architecture; Neurons; Object recognition; Parallel architectures; Semiconductor storage; Threshold logic; Active neurons; Cognitive memory; Feature description; Low-level vision; Object features; Sparse features; Feature extraction",2-s2.0-84997610856

Briefly, when two or more people agree on a common goal and a joint intention to reach that goal, they have to coordinate their actions to engage in joint actions, planning their courses of actions according to the actions of the other partners. The same holds for teams where the partners are people and robots, resulting on a collection of technical questions difficult to answer. Human-robot collaboration requires the robot to coordinate its behavior to the behaviors of the humans at different levels, e.g., the semantic level, the level of the content and behavior selection in the interaction, and low-level aspects such as the temporal dynamics of the interaction. This forces the robot to internalize information about the motions, actions and intentions of the rest of partners, and about the state of the environment. Furthermore, collaborative robots should select their actions taking into account additional human-aware factors such as safety, reliability and comfort. Current cognitive systems are usually limited in this respect as they lack the rich dynamic representations and the flexible human-aware planning capabilities needed to succeed in tomorrow human-robot collaboration tasks. Within this paper, we provide a tool for addressing this problem by using the notion of deep hybrid representations and the facilities that this common state representation offers for the tight coupling of planners on different layers of abstraction. Deep hybrid representations encode the robot and environment state, but also a robot-centric perspective of the partners taking part in the joint activity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Agent-based robotic architecture; Cognitive robots; Deep representations","Behavioral research; Brain; Cognitive systems; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Semantics; Cognitive robots; Collaborative robots; Deep representations; Human social interactions; Human-robot collaboration; Hybrid representations; Robotic architectures; State representation; Human robot interaction",2-s2.0-85007398595

To address these issues new radio technologies and network architectures need to be designed to cater to several future devices having connectivity demands. For radio communications, the frequency spectrum allocation will have to be adapted for efficient spectrum utilization considering new bandwidth and application requirements. Novel research directions based on the use of opportunistic radio resource utilization such as those based on cognitive radio (CR) technology will have to be pursued for efficiency as well as reliability. Cognitive Radio is a promising enabler communication technology for IoT. Its opportunistic communication paradigm is suited to communicating objects having event driven nature, that generate bursty traffic. Cognitive Radio can help overcome the problems of collision and excessive contention in the wireless access network that will arise due to the deployment of several objects connected to infrastructure through radio links. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before cognitive radio technology can be used for Internet of things.

Agent-based modeling is often used to study sociality both from a behavioral and evolutionary perspective. The aim of this chapter is to present the strengths of this modeling approach, highlighting the usefulness of-and in some scientific domains, the need for-cognitively rich architectures, as, for instance, in studying the emergence of communicative systems and information sharing. The main reasons supporting this perspective are different. On one hand, social behavior (and not collective behavior) of living organisms in most cases is possible because individuals have cognitive abilities and skills that allow them to interact in complex ways with other individuals and with the environment where they live. On the other hand, while analytical modeling simplifies properties and behaviors of a real system to find regularities and equilibria (and this may limit the applicability of this approach), agent-based modeling adopts the opposite philosophy: agents are heterogeneous-they behave in different ways and they use different strategies to deal with unexpected events and changing environments.The use of agent-based modeling is consolidated in investigating complex social behaviors and dynamics in some specific scientific domains (e.g., the study of cooperative behavior in living organisms); but potentially, agent-based modeling may represent a useful scientific method and tool in many other scientific fields investigating complex systems and dynamics.The study of social-ecological systems is presented as one of the main scientific fields where the use of agent-based modeling is gaining more and more attention and where it has already shown itself to be relevant.Finally, another scientific field-namely, the study of Earth Systems and Dynamics-is presented to highlight the promising applications of agent-based models in helping to better understand complex and nonlinear phenomena (e.g., tipping points) where the social component (i.e., the human component) is crucial and plays a central role.The scientific journey presented in this chapter should clarify the enormous potential of agent-based modeling from an interdisciplinary and multi-scale perspective, stressing the centrality of individual cognitive skills and abilities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Agent-based modeling; Computational modeling; Multi-level modeling; Multi-scale modeling; Social behaviors; Social dynamics",,2-s2.0-84978196324

Today, design assignments and studio-based learning formats are finding their way into engineering programs, often as part of larger movements to implement Student-Centered, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) pedagogies. This spectrum of pedagogies is mutually supportive, as illustrated in the University of Michigan's SmartSurfaces course where students majoring in engineering, art and design, and architecture collaborate on wickedly complex and ill-defined design problems. In SmartSurfaces and other similar PBL environments, students encounter complex, trans-disciplinary, open-ended design prompts that have timely social relevance. Analyzing data generated in studio-based PBL courses like SmartSurfaces can help educators evaluate and track students' intellectual growth. This paper presents a rubric for measuring students' development of increasingly refined epistemological understanding (regarding knowledge and how it is created, accessed, and used). The paper illustrates use of the tool in evaluating blogs created by students in SmartSurfaces, which in turn provides evidence to help validate the rubric and suggest avenues for future refinement. The overall result of the exploratory study reported here is to provide evidence of positive change among students who learn in PBL environments and to provide educators with a preliminary tool for assessing design-related epistemological development.

The design approach focuses on reducing the resources required for developing and validating new advanced radar modalities. Such an approach fosters innovation and provides risk reduction since actual radar data can be collected in the appropriate mode, processed, and analyzed early in the development process. This allows for an accurate, detailed understanding of the corresponding trade space. This paper is a follow-on to last years paper and discusses the advancements that have been made to the FlexSAR system. The overall system architecture is discussed and presented along with several examples illustrating the system utility. © 2016 SPIE.","Adaptive radar; Agile radar; ATI; Cognitive radar; Prototype; Radar; RF; SAR","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Design; Radar; Radar equipment; Synthetic aperture radar; Adaptive radar; Agile radars; Cognitive radars; Design approaches; Development process; Prototype; Research prototype; System architectures; Radar systems",2-s2.0-84982267591

Cognitive radio (CR) technology has been proposed as a solution to improve spectrum utilization, enabling the devices to identify alternate frequency bands and opportunistically use them. We propose a novel social-cognitive radio (S-CR) architecture able to improve the network energy efficiency. The key aspect of the such solution is the resulting indirect form of cooperation. Indeed, the devices only share information about channel availability and device profile information, without any predefined cooperation to perform a common task, such as cooperative spectrum sensing. In this way, it is possible to reduce some energy demanding operations of the cognitive cycle, such as the sensing procedure, since the social information sharing requires less energy. A novel S-CR protocol is developed to share environmental information and allocate spectrum resources to the CRs. Simulation results compare the S-CR protocol with its non-social version and reveal the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of energy consumption reduction. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2016.","Cognitive radio networks; Energy efficiency; Sharing; Social networks","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Frequency bands; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Radio; Social networking (online); Wireless networks; Channel availability; Co-operative spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio technologies; Environmental information; Information sharing; Sharing; Spectrum utilization; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84976619726

The concept of enterprise architecture involves the development of the structure of a company's information system in alignment with specific requirements set out in its business model and strategy. This paper undertakes to formally represent a particular company's business model and development strategy and does so through the example of the corporate integrated establishment MPK Dinskoi, ZAO, a meat-processing complex based in Krasnodar Krai, Russia. Thar is the first stage in putting together a company's enterprise architecture. For the purposes of this work, the authors elect to utilize the model proposed by A. Osterwalder. The strategy for development is described in the paper through the construction of a strategy map. To help determine strategic areas for development, the authors propose a methodology that is based on principles of goal setting. A large system, like an agro-industrial corporation, will, accordingly, have a great number of strategic areas identified for it, which may complicate the understanding of the cause and effect relationships between these areas. To this end, the authors utilize a method of cognitive systems analysis, known as 'Starry Sky Map', which is designed to determine a specific, so-called, key factor.

Objective: To determine the contribution of both localized white matter tract damage and disruption of global network architecture to cognitive control, in older age and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients with MCI and 20 age, sex, and intelligence-matched healthy volunteers were investigated with 3 Tesla structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cognitive control and episodic memory were evaluated with established tests. Structural network graphs were constructed from diffusion MRI-based whole-brain tractography. Their global measures were calculated using graph theory. Regression models utilized both global network metrics and microstructure of specific connections, known to be critical for each domain, to predict cognitive scores. Results: Global efficiency and the mean clustering coefficient of networks were reduced in MCI. Cognitive control was associated with global network topology. Episodic memory, in contrast, correlated with individual temporal tracts only. Relationships between cognitive control and network topology were attenuated by addition of single tract measures to regression models, consistent with a partial mediation effect. The mediation effect was stronger in MCI than healthy volunteers, explaining 23-36% of the effect of cingulum microstructure on cognitive control performance. Network clustering was a significant mediator in the relationship between tract microstructure and cognitive control in both groups. Conclusion: The status of critical connections and large-scale network topology are both important for maintenance of cognitive control in MCI. Mediation via large-scale networks is more important in patients with MCI than healthy volunteers. This effect is domain-specific, and true for cognitive control but not for episodic memory. Interventions to improve cognitive control will need to address both dysfunction of local circuitry and global network architecture to be maximally effective. © 2016 Berlot, Metzler-Baddeley, Ikram, Jones and O'Sullivan.","Cognitive aging; Cognitive control; Diffusion MRI; Mild cognitive impairment; Networks; Neuroimaging; Tractography","age; aged; Article; cingulum (brain); clinical article; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; episodic memory; executive function; female; human; male; mental performance; micromorphology; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; structure analysis; tractography; white matter injury",2-s2.0-85009436109

To learn and adapt to the operational environment, cognitive networking uses a variety of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The concept of cognitive networking is still early in its development, and there are a number of different technologies that can be combined and explored to realize different aspects of a cognitive network. Network emulation is a useful way to study cognitive technology. Existing emulation tools tend to focus more on supporting present technologies than on those of the future (e. g. software-defined networking, delay-tolerant networking, and others). This paper describes CogSWEL, an emulation technology designed to support the exploration of technologies for cognitive networking and intelligent routing. The paper begins with an exploration of the unique aspects of cognitive networking for space communications, and explains some of the gaps in existing emulation systems. Next, the paper explains the Mininet technology that CogSWEL is based on, and reviews Mininet’s strengths and weaknesses for cognitive networking, along with how CogSWEL enhances Mininet. The paper explains that, using only minimal engineering time and cost, CogSWEL has been used to model both present (SCaN Testbed) and future (SGSS) networks.

The use of the 5C CPS architecture has the potential to standardise this approach. This paper describes a case study where data from a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system located in a large manufacturing company was fused with grid electricity and gas models as well as a maintenance cost model using the 5C architecture with a view to making effective decisions on its cost efficient operation. A control change implemented based on the cognitive analysis enabled via the 5C architecture implementation has resulted in energy cost savings of over €7400 over a four-month period, with energy cost savings of over €150,000 projected once the 5C architecture is extended into the production environment. © 2016 The Authors.

However this new system architecture causes another issue, which is not solved in wireless TCPs. In this paper, we discuss new issues that affect the TCP throughput over CR systems, which we call Bandwidth Variation and Packet Loss Event and it as concerned with three events such as PU-Interference Loss Event, Mild-Congestion Event and RTT-Variance Event that cause these issues. In view of these three events we proposed three event handlers such as Primary user interference handlers, Fast recovery handlers, RTT adjustment function to boost TCP throughput. A cross layer arrangement is proposed to manage these new issues. We propose an event driven CR-TCP that joins these event handlers, which can be solved with begin of-start-of-Art CR-TCP arrangements.

On the other hand, in modern cooperative CRNs, the full-duplex spectrum sensing (FD-SS) scheme is designed to be a promising candidate technique for fully utilizing the channel spectrum while significantly enhancing the performance. However, how to efficiently integrate the FD-SS technique in supporting statistical QoS over cooperative CRNs imposes many new challenges not met before. To effectively overcome the above-mentioned difficulties, we propose the QoS-driven resource allocation scheme to implement FD-SS based multimedia services in cooperative CRNs.

Part of the variation observed among and within language users and across tasks may be explained from variation in the cognitive resources available to speakers and listeners. This paper presents a computational model of reference production and comprehension developed within the cognitive architecture ACT-R. Through simulations with this ACT-R model, it is investigated how cognitive constraints interact with linguistic constraints and features of the linguistic discourse in speakers' production and listeners' comprehension of referring expressions in specific tasks, and how this interaction may give rise to variation in referential choice. The ACT-R model of reference explains and predicts variation among language users in their referential choices as a result of individual and task-related differences in processing speed and working memory capacity. Because of limitations in their cognitive capacities, speakers sometimes underspecify or overspecify their referring expressions, and listeners sometimes choose incorrect referents or are overly liberal in their interpretation of referring expressions. © 2016 Hendriks.","ACT-R; Cognitive modeling; Perspective taking; Processing speed; Reference comprehension; Reference production; Working memory",,2-s2.0-84974573450

Attention is given to the purposes of knowledge, management and conservation of the heritage. This project finds its place in a research of history and documentation of architectural heritage and environment. History and a multi-disciplinary research method are also the foundation of all forms of protection and enhancement.

One important constructive feature of this architecture consists in splitting up the entire system into two similar hemi-systems (by analogy with the right and left cerebral hemispheres). One of these is responsible for the generation of information and learning, with other one being responsible for the reception and processing of well-known information. This functional specialization is provided by the presence of noise (a random factor) in the generation hemi-system; in the reception hemi-system, all the processes should proceed successively rather than stochastically. The interpretation of the concepts of intuition, logic, consciousness, and sub-consciousness is discussed. The architecture that is designed within the natural-constructive approach is compared with other theoretical approaches (graph theory and the “cognitom” concept), and with anatomical data.

Defence employs Tactical Data Link (TDL)s to maintain situation awareness and convey the intent of command and control information. Connectivity is achieved using digital radio communication systems that conform to present military TDL standard waveforms. Managing a TDL is inherently complex and typically requires operators (called TDL Network Managers (TDLNMs)) to actively manage these networks. These TDLNMs are trained military personnel and, due to the transient nature of their careers, most are posted within a few years and are often replaced with less experienced operators. Given this fluctuating level of experience, a Decision Support System (DSS) is being considered to assist the operators in maintaining a network. This chapter describes the conceptual design of an agent-based DSS, that could be used to support an operator, who is responsible for monitoring and optimizing a TDL. This includes tasks such as monitoring, troubleshooting and modifying various aspects of the TDL in order to maintain the required levels of connectivity and performance. One of the key tools used to support this role is a computer-based Network Management System (NMS). The proposed DSS could be developed using an Agent Architecture Framework (AAF) and integrated with the DSS based on Distributed Object Computing (DOC) technology. This approach minimizes the risk of integration between the NMS and the DSS, whilst allowing flexibility for future integration requirements. Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) techniques could also be employed to capture and encode the expertise required for the DSS to operate effectively. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Agent; Cognitive work analysis; Decision support system; Distributed object computing; Network manager; Software oriented architecture; Tactical data link","Agents; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computer architecture; Conceptual design; Decision support systems; Digital radio; Digital to analog conversion; Hierarchical systems; Managers; Military communications; Network architecture; Network management; Object oriented programming; Radio communication; Software agents; Cognitive work analysis; Decision support system (dss); Distributed object computing; Integration requirements; Network management systems; Network managers; Tactical data links; Tactical data links (TDL); Distributed computer systems",2-s2.0-84951774883

This inherently raises the challenge of bandwidth management. Regulatory activities have led to frequency allocation charts that are growing more complex and harder to manage. Such problem needs therefore to be addressed in order to achieve a more efficient use of resources and cope with the escalating traffic in satellite communications in the sub-5GHz bands. The H2020 SCREEN project is addressing this challenge by resorting to cognitive radio (CR) technology at S-band. SCREEN is working towards maturing several CR enabling technologies up to TRL4/5, considering two reference scenarios: Satcom-enabled UAV constellations and Inter-Satellite Links for satellite networks. This paper focuses on the design, development, simulation and implementation of the proposed cognitive radio algorithms in SCREEN, namely spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum manager (DSM), and learning techniques, presenting the most promising results achieved thus far. In CR environments, communication conditions may show a considerable variability, and therefore, adaptable and reconfigurable spectrum sensing architectures can bring valuable benefits. In this paper, we describe a multi-resolution spectrum sensing architecture, compatible with the proposed approach for dynamic spectrum management, which considers a local and a global DSM and how to combine both methods to offer a higher level of performance. Regarding learning techniques, SCREEN defined two principal strategies: Centralized learning and de-centralized learning that lend themselves to different protocol architectures, namely in terms of medium-access control. Additionally, a novel simulation framework for evaluating cognitive radio for Satcom applications is presented, which is based on the open source network simulator (ns-3). The simulator considers realistic satellite orbits, propagation loss and propagation delay models and supports the placement of interferer nodes. The simulation results are output in the open KMZ format, allowing visualization in Google Earth and other GIS. The integrated simulation tool is one of the major novelties of SCREEN. Simulation results and implications are presented on the comparison of both centralized and decentralized MAC approaches with different learning and channel assignment strategies, e.g. based on greedy or reinforcement learning. Finally, early implementation results of these algorithms in an off-the-shelf space Software-Defined Radio platform will be discussed, as a pioneer step into showing the true applicability of cognitive radio for a new generation of flexible and versatile space-bound transceivers.

In this study, we proposed a classification framework to distinguish MCI converters (MCIc) from MCI non-converters (MCInc) by using a combination of FreeSurfer-derived MRI features and nodal features derived from the thickness network. At the feature selection step, we first employed sparse linear regression with stability selection, for the selection of discriminative features in the iterative combinations of MRI and network measures. Subsequently the top K features of available combinations were selected as optimal features for classification. To obtain unbiased results, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with nested cross validation were used for classification. The combination of 10 features including those from MRI and network measures attained accuracies of 66.04, 76.39, 74.66, and 73.91% for mixed conversion time, 6, 12, and 18 months before diagnosis of probable AD, respectively. Analysis of the diagnostic power of different time periods before diagnosis of probable AD showed that short-term prediction (6 and 12 months) achieved more stable and higher AUC scores compared with long-term prediction (18 months), with K-values from 1 to 30.

The present article is a review of the relationships between architecture and education, not from a perspective that insists only on the presence of the architecture and urban planning in the educational contemporary curricula, following the much imitated case of Finland, but from a point of view that considers the whole education changed by the spatial dimensions of culture. We start from the work carried out by the research group working into education on architecture during the last 40 years, thanks to developmental interdisciplinary research projects, international congresses and international journals. METHOD. Addressing the relationship between architecture and education methodological approaches requires a combination of different disciplines, such as methods from: Cognitive Anthropology, Ethnomethodology, Cognitive Sciences, History of Art, etc. In the present article we describe some examples of this interdisciplinary crossroads. RESULTS. The article shows that the relationship between architecture and education provides solutions to the interrelations between disciplines described above that have been isolated until now. DISCUSSION. The findings of this brief revision aim to highlight the fundamental hypothesis of the article, that is to say that without these deep changes in education, with the aim to strengthen the capacity of the societies to defend their cultures with good architecture and urban design able to support physical, mental and social health of their inhabitants. In this way, urban planning and education are the two faces of the same coin: when one of them disappear the currency loses its full value. © Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.","Architecture; Education; Science and Society; Social Knowledge",,2-s2.0-84960807483

It is simpler and it requires less sensing time. However, there are a lot of problems that decrease the performance of the energy sensor; it is susceptible to the uncertainty in noise power.

The change is from a house of brands to a branded house approach in which the corporate brand is prominent. The study proposes two alternative approaches in order to explore how consumers build the corporate brand equity from single product brand equities in the portfolio: the dilution process or the bookkeeping/subtyping cognitive process. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a questionnaire administered to 150 Italian consumers. All the items were related to a real corporate brand – Procter & Gamble (P&G) – and to seven of the product brands in its portfolio. The choice of the Italian context and the P&G brand was motivated by the fact that P&G has recently adopted a shift in its brand strategy, starting to give prominence to the corporate brand in its communication campaign in Italy. Findings: The dilution process does not describe the effect of a change in strategy on corporate brand equity, but the bookkeeping/subtyping cognitive process does. This suggests that consumers tend not to revise corporate brand equity when they perceive many product brands behind it. Originality/value: The value of the present paper is to deal with a relevant and current topic: the brand architecture dynamism. This research is an exploratory step to satisfy the need for theory-based research on consumer responses to the shift in the brand portfolio architecture strategy. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bookkeeping process; Brand architecture; Brand portfolio; Customer-based brand equity; Dilution effect; Subtyping process",,2-s2.0-84988526186

Under dynamic spectrum access to provide the ability of working any band of frequency based on need, the reconfigurable cognitive radio is designed. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Multicarrier modulation is the feasible method to share the spectrum without interference. OFDM is one of the efficient multicarrier techniques available for the system design. One of the problems in OFDM for spectral sharing is the side band leakage that will inject interference from secondary radio sub carrier to primary radio sub carrier. To avoid this, in this work a Filter Bank based Multi Carrier (FBMC) modulation is used. Findings: Few simulation works are reported for the interference free spectrum sharing by using FBMC. But this work analyzes the real time practical implementation of the interference free dynamic spectrum sharing. Reconfigurable is another important aspect of the implementation which is provided by the Kintex 7 FPGA implementation of the reconfigurable filter bank multicarrier modulation using NI USRP 2943R SDR platform. This FBMC based Transceiver is implemented by using fast Xilink IP cores of FFT and systolic array based FIR filter IP core. The transceiver is realized to produce output for every clock after a fixed latency 240 clocks or 6 microsecond for 40Mz clock rate. This performance is achieved using single clock loop architecture of LABVIEW FPGA tool and the parallel, pipelined architecture realization of IP cores and other building blocks. Applications/Improvements: Experimental study shows that the BER of primary user for the implemented system is better than the OFDM system by the factor of 10-1.","Cognitive radio; Dynamic spectrum sharing; Multi carrier modulation; OFDM reconfigurable; SDR",,2-s2.0-84960932314

Methods: EEG was recorded in 30 Nold, 30 aMCI, and 30 AD during EC and EO. Undirected and weighted cortical brain network was built to evaluate graph core measures. eLORETA lagged linear connectivity was used to weight the network. Results: In Nold, in EO condition, the brain network is characterized by more SW (higher SW) in alpha bands and less SW (lower SW) in beta2 and gamma bands. In aMCI, SW has the same trend, except for delta and theta bands where the network shows less small worldness. AD shows a similar trend of Nold, but with less fluctuations between EO/EC conditions. Furthermore, in both conditions, aMCI SW architecture presents midway properties between AD and Nold. At low frequencies (delta e theta bands) in EC, aMCI group presents network's architecture similar to Nold, while in EO aMCI, SW is superimposable to AD ones. Conclusions: In resting state condition, aMCI small-world architecture presents midway topological properties between AD subjects and healthy controls, confirming the hypothesis that aMCI is an intermediate step along the disease progression.

Training ""adaptation"" is multi-faceted. For the trainee, the delivery of training must adapt to individual trainee needs and to the organizational groupings of trainees (e.g., an Army unit). Training must be adaptively tailored to trainee state (cognitive, affective, psychomotor, social, etc.) and to trainee task performance. Adaptations might be determined and delivered in real time during training events or determined through assessment of learner data over extended time and delivered periodically (non-real time). Adaptations may seek to inform and optimize instructional strategies both during training and off-line (between training sessions). Training content adaptations might be automated, semi-automated, or human (instructor)-driven. From a ""training systems"" life cycle perspective, the adaptation approaches must seek to optimize training over learner lifecycles through optimal blending of training types and modalities (e.g., computer-based, tutor-based, game-based, simulation-based, Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC), etc.). A central barrier that impedes increased use of adaptive training is the amount of time and the high cost required to build and maintain these complex training applications. This paper describes an ontology-driven Multi-domain Adaptive Training (MAT) approach for adaptive training application integration and management that targets this challenge. The MAT approach is founded on the observation that inter-domain ontology mappings may be used to drive multi-domain adaptive training application information exchange requirements.

However, little is known about the disrupted intra- and inter-network architecture in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Here, we employed a priori defined regions of interest to investigate the intra- and inter-network functional connectivity profiles of these RSNs in longitudinal participants, including normal controls (n=23), participants with early MCI (n=26), and participants with late MCI (n=19). We found longitudinal alterations of functional connectivity within the DMN, where they were correlated with variation in cognitive ability. The SAL as well as the interaction between the DMN and the SAL were disrupted in MCI. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that longitudinal alterations of functional connectivity are more profound in earlier stages as opposed to later stages of the disease. The increased severity of cognitive impairment is associated with increasingly altered RSN connectivity patterns, suggesting that disruptions in functional connectivity may contribute to cognitive dysfunction and may represent a potential biomarker of impaired cognitive ability in MCI.

Hy-CIRCA addresses the high computational complexity of such systems by first planning at an abstract level, and then progressively refining the original plan. Hy-CIRCA is an extension of our Playbook1 approach, which aims to make it easy for users to exert supervisory control over multiple autonomous systems by ""calling a play."" The Playbook approach is implemented by combining (1) a human-machine interface for commanding and monitoring the autonomous systems; (2) a hierarchical planner for translating commands into executable plans; and (3) a smart executive to manage plan execution by coordinating the control systems of the individual autonomous agents, tracking plan execution, and triggering replanning when necessary. Hy-CIRCA integrates the dReal non-linear SMT solver, with enhanced versions of the SHOP2 HTN planner and the CIRCA Control Synthesis Module (CSM). Hy-CIRCA's planning process has 5 steps: (1) Using SHOP2, compute an approximate mission plan. While computing this plan, compute a hybrid automaton model of the plan, featuring more expressive continuous dynamics. (2) Using dReal, solve this hybrid model, establishing the correctness of the plan, and computing values for its continuous parameters. To execute the plan, (3) extract from the plan specifications for closedloop, hard real-time supervisory controllers for the agents that must execute the plan. (4) Based upon these specifications, use the CIRCA CSM to plan the controllers. To ensure correct execution, (5) verify the CSM-generated controllers with dReal.

To meet this ambitious goal, we propose an SDN-based synergistic spectrum sharing technique, the harmonized SDN-enabled approach (HSA), which relies on distributed input reporting on spectrum availabilities in 5G heterogeneous networks. Conventional spectrum sharing mechanisms, particularly those using cognitive radio techniques, rely heavily on spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission-aided communications devices. However, this device-level spectrum sharing might lead to inaccurate sharing decisions due to the widely fluctuating signal quality observed by each device. Moreover, the network becomes vulnerable to malicious devices that report false sensing data to gain unfair access to the spectrum. These problems are further compounded by the fact that operational cellular networks have a somewhat rigid architecture relying on vendor-specific configuration interfaces, hence restricting the operators to have, at best, only indirect control of the network's operation and resources. In addressing these challenges, we adopt a synergistic approach that integrates the distributed sensing devices, cellular base stations, and SDN controller into an intrinsically amalgamated network. To alleviate any potential controller scalability and latency concerns, HSA harmonizes the network's operation by distributing the local decision making and network-wide policy making tasks among the base stations and the SDN controller, respectively. The article outlines the detailed network architecture and also presents an efficient resource management algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.","5G mobile communication; Base stations; Decision making; Quality of service; Resource management; Software defined networking; Wireless networks","Base stations; Cognitive radio; Controllers; Heterogeneous networks; Mobile telecommunication systems; Natural resources management; Network architecture; Quality of service; Radio transmission; Resource allocation; Software defined networking; Wireless networks; Cellular base stations; Cognitive radio techniques; Local decision-making; Mobile communications; Resource management; Resource management algorithms; Spectrum availability; Spectrum management and sharing; Decision making",2-s2.0-84962028181

In the domain of emergency management, the data employed to the process of acquisition and maintenance of SAW are provided by several sources, using different formats and different classifications, such as: images from security cameras, reports made to the emergency response center, posts in social networks and several physical sensors, such as: positional, altitude and movement. Data from this sources, if well processed and understood by a specialist, may contribute to the decision-making process, supporting the establishment of emergency response tactics and a better allocation of operational resources. The acquisition of SAW demands the characterization of the ongoing situation. Typically, knowing exactly what is going on demands exhaustive routines of intelligent data assessment. In the emergency management domain, it means to better explore and analyze what the humans say about the events. This paper presents a general architecture that integrates objects and situational assessment for the emergency management domain and a specific process for the objects assessment using natural language processing (NLP) and semantic practices, to better identify relevant elements that may be useful for the situation assessment routines, such as information fusion. Known approaches are limited due to the absence of data quality analysis as part of the process, undesirable when decision makers need to rely on emergency information.

The design of FFA is tailored to elderly populations, distilling literature guidelines and recommendations. The FFA architecture introduces standard physical exercise protocols in exergaming software engineering, as well as, standard physical assessment tests for augmented adaptability through adjustable exercise intensity. This opens up the way to next generation exergaming software, which may be more automatically/smartly adaptive. 116 elderly users piloted FFA five times/week, during an eight-week controlled intervention. Usability evaluation was formally conducted (SUS, SUMI questionnaires). Control group consisted of a size-matched elderly group following cognitive training. Efficacy was assessed objectively through the senior fitness (Fullerton) test, and subjectively, through WHOQoL-BREF comparisons of pre-postintervention between groups. Adherence to schedule was measured by attendance logs. The global SUMI score was 68.33±5.85%, while SUS was 77.7. Good usability perception is reflected in relatively high adherence of 82% for a daily two months pilot schedule. Compared to control group, elderly using FFA improved significantly strength, flexibility, endurance, and balance while presenting a significant trend in quality of life improvements.

In Cognitive Pluralism, Steven Horst proposes that another sort of unit -- a mental model of a content domain -- is the fundamental unit of understanding. He argues that understanding comes not in word-sized concepts, sentence-sized beliefs, or argument-sized reasoning but in the form of idealized models and in domain-sized chunks. He argues further that this idea of ""cognitive pluralism"" -- the claim that we understand the world through many such models of a variety of content domains -- sheds light on a number of problems in philosophy.Horst first presents the ""standard view"" of cognitive architecture assumed in mainstream epistemology, semantics, truth theory, and theory of reasoning. He then explains the notion of a mental model as an internal surrogate that mirrors features of its target domain, and puts it in the context of ideas in psychology, philosophy of science, artificial intelligence, and theoretical cognitive science. Finally, he argues that the cognitive pluralist view not only helps to explain puzzling disunities of knowledge but also raises doubts about the feasibility of attempts to ""unify"" the sciences; presents a model-based account of intuitive judgments; and contends that cognitive pluralism favors a reliabilist epistemology and a ""molecularist"" semantics. Horst suggests that cognitive pluralism allows us to view rival epistemological and semantic theories not as direct competitors but as complementary accounts, each an idealized model of different dimensions of evaluation. © 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

These capabilities have led to developments of a variety of sensor systems, like robotic platforms. There are benefits to these new sensor systems, however, these benefits have been offset by new difficulties; dynamic data overload, keeping pace with changing tempo, and managing data flows from multiple sensors feeds. One approach to manage data overload from multiple sensor feeds are computational models of attention. These models also address an important aspect of human-machine symbiosis, the need for machines agents to understand attention, manage interaction based on the flow of attention, and anticipate the flow of attention in the future. Unfortunately, existing computational models of attention use assumptions that limit their applicability to human-machine systems. The Artificial Attention Architecture is introduced and demonstrates how computational models of attention can be extended to handle multi-agent, multi-sensor systems. The Artificial Attention Architecture addresses important properties of human-machine systems like the need to build symbiosis between people searching for meaning in extensive data flows and the computational algorithms processing complex and dynamic data flows.

In this paper, we describe a novel neural network architecture called the Reasoning Network (ReasoNet) for machine comprehension tasks. ReasoNets make use of multiple turns to effectively exploit and then reason over the relation among queries, documents, and answers. Different from previous approaches using a fixed number of turns during inference, ReasoNets introduce a termination state to relax this constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning, ReasoNets can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer. ReasoNets have achieved state-of-the-art performance in machine comprehension datasets, including unstructured CNN and Daily Mail datasets, and a structured Graph Reachability dataset.

The spectrum cognition at RF processing is categorized as four kinds of sensing mechanisms. Two recent reseaches are described as promising candidates for the C-WSN. One senses spectrum by the frequency discriminating receiver, the other senses and detects from the frequency selective super-regenerative receiver. The introduced systems with simple and low-power RF architectures play dual roles of channel sensing and demodulation, simultaneously.

While these properties enable humans to generate innovative ideas, the amounts of knowledge and cognitive flexibility that humans can possess are limited, which in turn limits human idea generation capability. With business model idea generators, a new class of information systems is proposed that can contribute to alleviating the limits that constrain human idea generation. The ideas that such idea generators produce can complement human business model ideas, thereby increase the probability for high-quality ideas, and eventually raise the odds of successful business model innovation.

This paper presents the initial results of efforts at modeling such a system, using a virtual agent. The agent has analogs of a sensory motor system to accommodate environment inputs and internally generated motor commands, a limbic system to model affect, and a cognitive system to perform analysis. The claim is that agents built using this architecture, founded on and situated narrowly in understandings from second-generation cognitive science can construct their own ontology and \view of the world"" by interacting with the objects in their world.

The goal of this study is to explore the use of Agent-based Modeling as part of the Cognitive Agent-based Computing (CABC) framework to model a Complex communication network problem. Method: We use Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM), as part of the CABC framework, to develop an autonomous multi-agent architecture for managing carbon footprint in a corporate network. To evaluate the application of complexity in practical scenarios, we have also introduced a company-defined computer usage policy. Results: The conducted experiments demonstrated two important results: Primarily CABC-based modeling approach such as using Agent-based Modeling can be an effective approach to modeling complex problems in the domain of IoT.

This paper summarizes the capabilities of an architecture that combines the complementary strengths of declarative programming, probabilistic graphical models, and reinforcement learning, to represent, reason with, and learn from, qualitative and quantitative descriptions of incomplete domain knowledge and uncertainty. Representation and reasoning is based on two tightly-coupled domain representations at different resolutions. For any given task, the coarse-resolution symbolic domain representation is translated to an Answer Set Prolog program, which is solved to provide a tentative plan of abstract actions, and to explain unexpected outcomes. Each abstract action is implemented by translating the relevant subset of the corresponding fine-resolution probabilistic representation to a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Any high probability beliefs, obtained by the execution of actions based on the POMDP policy, update the coarse-resolution representation. When incomplete knowledge of the rules governing the domain dynamics results in plan execution not achieving the desired goal, the coarse-resolution and fine-resolution representations are used to formulate the task of incrementally and interactively discovering these rules as a reinforcement learning problem. These capabilities are illustrated in the context of a mobile robot deployed in an indoor office domain. Copyright © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Higher-level cognitive processes, as found in language and reasoning, can be performed with in situ concepts by embedding them in specialized neurally inspired ""blackboards."" The interactions between the in situ concepts and the blackboards form the basis for in situ concept computing architectures. In these archi-Tectures, memory (concepts) and processing are interwoven, in contrast with the sepa-ration between memory and processing found in Von Neumann architectures. Because the further development of Von Neumann computing (more, faster, yet power limited) is questionable, in situ concept computing might be an alternative for concept-based computing. In situ concept computing will be illustrated with a recently developed BABI reasoning task. Neurorobotics can play an important role in the development of in situ concept computing because of the development of in situ concept representations derived in scenarios as needed for reasoning tasks. Neurorobotics would also benefit from power limited and in situ concept computing. © 2016 van der Velde.","Babi tasks; Computing; Concepts; Insitu representations; Neural assemblies; Reasoning","Brain; Memory architecture; Babi tasks; Computing; Concepts; Insitu representations; Reasoning; Computer architecture; brain; embedding; human; human experiment; language; memory; perception",2-s2.0-84994010485

Inspired by recent research on the cognitive science of human morality, we propose the outlines of an architecture for morality and ethics in robots. As in humans, there is a rapid intuitive response to the current situation. Reasoned reflection takes place at a slower time-scale, and is focused more on constructing a justification than on revising the reaction. However, there is a yet slower process of social interaction, in which both the example of action and its justification influence the moral intuitions of others. The signals an agent provides to others, and the signals received from others, help each agent determine which others are suitable cooperative partners, and which are likely to defect. This moral architecture is illustrated by several examples, including identifying research results that will be necessary for the architecture to be implemented.

We use a set of models to represent and manage the transfer; these are based on informing science framework and specific learning principles. We use process, data and system perspectives to describe software architecture. Our case studies include knowledge transfer from the Carnegie Mellon University masters’ program in software engineering to the Russian Innopolis IT University. The CMU curriculum is integrated with project-based software development; the focus is quality and process improvement. The knowledge transfer requires special instructor training in teaching proficiency. We identified the key factors, which may inhibit technology transfer; these are differences in culture, geography and process maturity. To promote technology transfer in crisis, we suggest using multiple contexts and scaffolding, reducing overall cognitive teaching-and-learning load, establishing efficient feedback and mastering “soft” skills, such as communication, negotiations and time management. We recommend crisis-efficient metacognitive self-directed learning and addressing higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy including justification, analysis and practical application. As a result, the students learn to act as software engineering professionals and experts. Multi-context education includes hands-on learning-by-doing, “wicked” problems and “soft” skills required for crisis agility, which includes self-assessment, self-justification and self-adjustment. We also suggest a model for the knowledge transfer, which includes informing framework of transmitting and receiving sides, and the environment. For crisis, we recommend adding signal amplification, bidirectional feedback and amplitude thresholds. In crisis, successful knowledge transfer requires special training of the receiving side, which involves a number of human-related factors, such as prior knowledge, knowledge organization, feedback, mastery and practice. To ensure the learning quality, adequate bidirectional feedback-driven meta-cognitive cycle organization is very important. Both the students and the faculty should act as software engineering professionals and use their own expert-level judgment. Knowledge transfer should be multi-context and include hands-on project practice. Teamwork, communication and time management are the mission-critical “soft” skills in crisis environments, which are often complex and uncertain. Further, we suggest a high-level design pattern approach in order to model the architectures for systems-of-systems; the model includes five application levels and two data levels. We instantiate this pattern by high-level architecture outlines for systems-of-systems in oil-and-gas and nuclear power industries. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Informing science; Knowledge transfer; System-of-systems; “Soft” skills","Education computing; Human resource management; Information management; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear industry; Personnel training; Scaffolds; Software architecture; Software design; Software engineering; System of systems; Systems engineering; Teaching; Technology transfer; Carnegie Mellon University; Engineering professionals; High level architecture; Informing science; Knowledge organization; Knowledge transfer; Nuclear-power industry; Self-directed learning; Engineering education",2-s2.0-85007185956

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with a high risk for developing AD. However, no study has directly examined the brain topological alterations based on combined effects of tau protein pathway genes in MCI population. Forty-three patients with MCI and 30 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in Chinese Han, and a tau protein pathway-based imaging approaches (7 candidate genes: 17 SNPs) were used to investigate changes in the topological organisation of brain activation associated with MCI. Impaired regional activation is related to tau protein pathway genes (5/7 candidate genes) in patients with MCI and likely in topologically convergent and divergent functional alterations patterns associated with genes, and combined effects of tau protein pathway genes disrupt the topological architecture of cortico-cerebellar loops. The associations between the loops and behaviours further suggest that tau protein pathway genes do play a significant role in non-episodic memory impairment.

A common example of such challenges involves multimedia techniques that transform permanent information into a fleeting, transient form by replacing written explanatory text with spoken text and static pictures with dynamic visualizations such as animations. Due to well-established processing limitations of human cognitive system, such transient forms of information may create fundamental challenges to learning faced in multimedia environments. From an educational technology design perspective, it is important to a) identify when transiency overloads learner working memory and b) develop and apply techniques that can minimise transiency effects. Cognitive load theory is the instructional theory that deals with negative effect of working memory limitations in learning, and its principles could be applied to ensure that learning outcomes are maximised. This chapter reviews recent developments in this research area with specific reference to techniques that could be used to manage transient information. The influence of transient information on instructional techniques suggested by cognitive load theory is discussed, as well as the role of learner prior knowledge in dealing with the effects of transiency. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Significant performance gains are achievable in a cooperative D2D framework, wherein the user equipments (UEs) cooperate with each other to enable a variety of low-latency proximity-based services or to establish indirect communication links with the Base Station (BS) whenever direct service coverage is not possible. This chapter is focused on the throughput gains achievable in the latter scenario, i.e., when few UEs perform relaying operations to provide indirect service coverage to other UEs. In this direction, resource allocation problems are formulated for a variety of system models operating under the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular or cognitive radio (CR) access architectures. The performance of mobile D2D relaying under different scenarios is evaluated. The system models are designed to study the benefits of incorporating additional capabilities at the devices, such as packet storage (using buffers), energy-harvesting, and cognitive spectrum access within the cooperative D2D framework. Depending on the system model, efficient algorithms are proposed to obtain optimal power allocation, subcarrier assignment, subcarrier pairing, and relay-UE selection policies which maximize the system throughput under a variety of system-dependant constraints.

Energy Detection (ED) and Covariance Absolute Value(CAV) are well known algorithms for spectrum sensing. However, CAV is efficient for sensing correlated signals whereas ED suffers from SNR Wall limitation. In this paper, we propose an M4-Edge algorithm to overcome the limitations of CAV and ED algorithms. The proposed algorithm tracks the envelope of the signal burst, of the primary user, in the time domain. The fourth central moment of the envelope is evaluated and compared with a threshold to detect the rising and falling edges of the burst and hence detecting the presence of signal. Further, the algorithm is implemented on a Xilinx Vertex 6 Field Programmable Gate Array development board for evaluating its real time performance. In the real time, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with ED and CAV algorithm by cosidering both BFSK and DVBT signal corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and flat fading, as the Primary user signal to be sensed. The probability of detection, sensing time and resource utilisation are used as the metrics for measuring the efficiency of the algorithms. The sensing time for all three algorithms vary between 2 to 4 milliseconds within their SNR capability envelopes. The FPGA resource utilization is lowest for ED and highest for M4-Edge algorithm. The proposed algorithm outperforms ED and has equivalent performance to CAV in Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) range of -12 to +10 dB. The proposed algorithm has the additional benefit that it performs well when the signal is not correlated. The experimental results reveal that, in the case of the (Digital Video Broadcast Terrestrial) DVBT signal, the proposed M4-Edge algorithm detects the signal with probability of detection 0.9 at -12dB SNR, whereas CAV algorithm fails to detect, due to lack of correlation in the signal. © 2016 IEEE.","Central moment; Cognitive radio; FPGA; Probability of Detection; Spectrum sensing","Cognitive radio; Computer graphics; Fading (radio); Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gaussian noise (electronic); Multimedia systems; Probability; Signal detection; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; White noise; Additive White Gaussian noise; Central moments; Digital video broad cast terrestrials; Probability of detection; Real time performance; Resource utilisation; Resource utilizations; Spectrum sensing; Correlation detectors",2-s2.0-85027493832

Military Command and Control is studied within the framework of Knowledge Creation utilising tools of Evolution Theory and Path Creation to find patterns and dependencies. With this approach, the paper composes a roadmap for Military Knowledge Management. The study proceeds in finding further causalities and dependencies, which are useful in defining Military Enterprise Architectures. This approach identifies several ways to support the Cognitive level of Information Superiority defined by Perry, Signori and Boo (2004). The study proposes that development of a strategy following this approach should first begin with diagnoses of the three dimensions of Sense-making, Decision making and Learning utilising the defined roadmap before launching solution finding.

These cognitive aspects are characterised by knowledge acquired during the process of cognition. The knowledge then is actively used in further landscape observations and forming opinions about it. Consequently, cognitive aspects are associated with an individual's personal and professional interests formed by education, residence, mentality, gender, former experience, etc. These aspects are also associated with psychological mood during the observation process of a particular landscape. The influence of cognition processes has been previously analysed also within the framework of other sciences, basically related to the improvement of the environment of people's lives as well as social and economic background. In the field of landscape architecture the role of cognitive aspects is often associated with the understanding of the identity of the place, its aura and the feeling of belonging to a particular place, which are essential elements in the process of landscape architecture and planning. The aim of the research analysed in the article was to identify and characterise the role of cognitive aspects in different thematic fields of landscape architecture. The research was conducted within the framework of The Baltic Forestry, Veterinary and Agricultural University Network (BOVA) international doctoral study course Landscape Cognition (2015) organised by the Department of Landscape Architecture and Planning of Latvia University of Agriculture. The research analysed 8 scientific themes represented by the doctoral students and lecturers of landscape architecture of this course. The themes were divided into two thematic sections. The first section Rural Landscape Cognition included the following themes: Mainstreaming participatory development in rural Latvia and Estonia; Road landscapes, their values and development scenarios; Digital software in Landscape architecture; Seasons in landscape. The second section Urban Landscape Cognition covered the following themes: Post-industrial areas in cultural landscape of the Lielupe river; Urban forests; Public space of small towns on the Baltic Sea coast; Landscape spatial planning. Within the framework of the research through lectures and practical work the doctoral students under the guidance of the lecturers identified the keywords/criteria which most precisely characterised the role and influence of cognitive aspects in a particular doctoral student's research theme. As a result, within the framework of two thematic sections schematic models were developed where the keywords identified in the research were arranged hierarchically according to their influence and role in the cognition process of a particular field.

In framework of the proposed approach an information space ontology was created, an algorithm for generation of the domain information space was developed on the basis of the personal cognitive spaces using the rule-based reasoning over ontology. We considered three scenarios of the information space construction: an individual and collaborative creation of the information space, as well as creation of the new information space on the basis of the existing spaces. Also we presented a software architecture for the construction of domain information space which includes two software applications: web-application for individual and collaborative creation of the domain information space and builder of personal electronic learning collections. The implementation of the developed approach was illustrated by the example of information space construction for the programming languages domain. The proposed approach is consistent with the concept of Open Science and allows describing the domain structure, combining the distributed open scientific information resources into thematic collections and creating the domain information spaces using these resources.

After a brief history of what has later come to be known as cognitive adequacy, the impact of psycholinguistic notions on the architecture of FDG is discussed and exemplified with emphasis on how FDG confronts the tension between the static nature of a pattern model of grammar and the dynamicity of the communicative process. The article then turns to four ways in which FDG has responded in recent years to ongoing work in psycholinguistics. The first concerns how the incrementality of language production, i.e. the gradual earlier-to-later build-up of utterances, has inspired FDG's coverage of fragmentary discourse acts and its Depth-First Principle. The second, pertaining to the role of prediction in language comprehension, is reflected in the countdown to a clause-final position PF. The third is priming, involving the reuse of elements of structure at all levels of analysis: this interferes with the mapping of function onto form in ways that have been explored in FDG. The fourth is dialogical alignment, the manner in which participants in dialogue mutually accommodate their language use; this has led to new understandings of the respective roles of FDG's Conceptual and Contextual Components. Taken together, these developments have moved FDG towards modelling dialoguing interactants rather than an isolated speaker. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","Cognitive adequacy; Dialogical alignment; Functional Discourse Grammar; Incrementality; Priming",,2-s2.0-84975708764

They exhibit many of the animal learning abilities described by Piaget. Learning occurs when unknowns are detected, triggering the addition of new elements to the network. In this way, forward models can be built from experience, and many of these models can be linked together to form large distributed associative memories; HaveNWant's level of abstraction lies well above neurological models, focusing on functionality and avoiding biological constraints. It also lies above computer AND and OR gates, which operate unidirectionally. In HaveNWant, for every signal going one way, there is another signal coming back. HaveNWant atoms continually reconcile the information on their links, each imposing a particular constraint. Its networks aggregate many single links, to efficiently enforce large sophisticated relationships. HaveNWant operates below most AI architectures, which have algorithms that do not constrain bit-level computational locality.

Prolonged elevation of glucocorticoids alters the neural architecture of the limbic system, resulting in the structural as well as functional changes described in both maltreatment and in migraine.

The commonsense theories of psychology and sociology necessary for such inferences have been a focus of logic-based knowledge representation research, but have been difficult to employ in robust automated reasoning architectures. In this paper we model behavior interpretation as a process of logical abduction, where the reasoning task is to identify the most probable set of assumptions that logically entail the observable behavior of others, given commonsense theories of psychology and sociology. We evaluate our approach using Triangle-COPA, a benchmark suite of 100 challenge problems based on an early social psychology experiment by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel. Commonsense knowledge of actions, social relationships, intentions, and emotions are encoded as defeasible axioms in first-order logic. We identify sets of assumptions that logically entail observed behaviors by backchaining with these axioms to a given depth, and order these sets by their joint probability assuming conditional independence. Our approach solves almost all (91) of the 100 questions in Triangle-COPA, and demonstrates a promising approach to robust behavior interpretation that integrates both logical and probabilistic reasoning. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Traditional tactical information gathering and processing methods and decision-making processes within the current tactical environment are becoming less effective and burdensome. New tactical fighter air platforms require high-quality situation awareness and more advanced decision-making methodologies in order to deliver decision superiority. In essence, new generations of tactical air platforms require a redesign of their tactical Decision Support System (DSS), or Tactical Decision Aid (TDA). Furthermore, these new air platforms can no longer work in isolation, but are required to be part of a distributed team. Therefore not only do new techniques in distributed decision making need to be developed, but the concept of Distributed Tactical Deci-sion Aids (DisTDAs) needs to be experimented. The issue on how to implement Coordination and Cooperation (Coo^2) within DisTDAs needs to be firstly addressed. The Future Integrated Mission System (FIMS) is a first-of-its-kind Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based future integrated mission system for new tactical air strike platforms. The next step is to make FIMS and its TDA distributed - this can be achieved by integrating the Agent Coordination and Cooperation Cognitive Model (AC^3M). AC^3M illustrates how to implement agent coordination and cooperation by means of a cognitive and Intelligent Multi-Agent System (I-MAS). The centerpiece of AC^3M is the ability to successfully show the link between Coo^2 and how beneficial the link is for enhancing team automation. Analysing the model produces three remarkable results: firstly is the Stimulate-Orient-Decide-Act methodology and secondly is how the Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) framework, Coo^2 and Stimulate-Orient-Decide-Act (SODA) were linked and interconnected. The final result was the enhanced decision-making that utilised the benefits created from the annexation of the BDI framework, Coo2 and SODA. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Method: A total of 33 patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed rLOD and 31 healthy control subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The wholebrain functional networks were constructed by thresholding Pearson correlation matrices of 90 brain regions, and their topological properties (ie, small-worldness, network efficiency, and nodal efficiency) were analyzed using graph theory-based approaches. Nonparametric permutation tests were further used for group comparisons of topological metrics. The patients were recruited from January to December 2007. Results: Both the rLOD and control groups showed smallworld architecture in the functional brain networks, suggesting a balance between functional segregation and integration. Importantly, the rLOD patients exhibited abnormal global topology in their functional brain networks (ie, increased shortest path length and decreased network efficiency) compared with the healthy controls, implying a less optimal topological organization in rLOD. Moreover, the rLOD patients showed decreased nodal efficiencies, predominantly in the frontal-striatal-occipital regions that are closely associated with the neuropathological changes in LOD. Intriguingly, we showed that the topological aberrations correlated with the neuropsychological performances in the rLOD patients. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the topological organization of functional brain networks is disrupted in rLOD and that this disruption may contribute to disturbance in cognitive function in rLOD patients. © Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.",,"adult; aged; Article; brain region; clinical article; cognition; cognitive defect; comorbidity; controlled study; depression; DSM-IV; female; frontal cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; image analysis; image processing; male; neuropathology; nonparametric test; occipital cortex; priority journal; remitted late onset depression; brain; case control study; depression; functional neuroimaging; late onset disorder; nerve tract; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; rest; Aged; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cognition; Depression; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Late Onset Disorders; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Neuropsychological Tests; Rest",2-s2.0-84957806176

As a potential explanation for this puzzling function, we introduce the 'Columnar Machine'. We join two neural network types, Structured Sparse Coding (SSC) of generative nature exploiting sparse groups of neurons and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) into one architecture. Memories supporting recognition can be quickly loaded into SSC via supervision or can be learned by SSC in a self-organized manner. However, SSC evaluation is slow. We train FFNs for predicting the sparse groups and then the representation is computed by fast undercomplete methods. This two step procedure enables fast estimation of the overcomplete group sparse representations. The suggested architecture works fast and it is biologically plausible. Beyond the function of the minicolumnar structure it may shed light onto the role of fast feed-forward inhibitory thalamocortical channels and cortico-cortical feed-back connections.

This study takes up a classical cognitive problem in Gestalt psychology known as Rubin's Vase. A very simple classical figure-ground organization problem, Rubin's Vase is an ambiguous image that was developed by the Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin around 1915. The image appears to the viewer as two black faces looking at each other on a white background, or as a white vase on a black background. The image can be interpreted as only one of these two at a time. Rubin's Vase has been the topic of previous research, and many mysteries still remain regarding psychological determinants, neurophysiological mechanisms and so on. Believing that Rubin's Vase can be simulated by information science and robotics, the authors aimed to explain the phenomenon using a conscious system, and demonstrate how to construct a model using an artificial consciousness module they have developed called the Module of Nerves for Advanced Dynamics (MoNAD). Through the study of Rubin's Vase, the authors conclude with the belief that many complex perceptions of humans can be simulated using neural networks, and that this can help us to study in depth the cognitive processes of human perception. © 2016 The Authors.","Ambiguous Image; Artificial Consciousness; Cognition and Behavior; Figure-ground Organization; Neural Network; Robotics; Rubin's Vase","Bionics; Complex networks; Information science; Neural networks; Robotics; Ambiguous Image; Artificial consciousness; Cognition and Behavior; Figure ground; Rubin's Vase; Network architecture",2-s2.0-85006516035

The standard size and features of the human body, for instance, are thought to influence the structure of interiors and buildings, as well as their perception and appreciation. Whereas architectural practice and theory, the visual arts and more recently the cognitive sciences have explored this relationship of humans with their crafted environments, many fictional literary works have long experimented with alterations of body-environment scaling. This so-called Gulliver theme - popular in the science-fiction genre but also in children's literature and philosophical satire - reveals, as a recurrent thought-experiment, our preoccupation with proportions and our fascination for the infinitely small and large. Here I provide an overview of the altered scaling theme in literature, including classics such as Voltaire's Micromégas, Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Caroll's Alice, and Matheson's The Shrinking man, closely examining issues relevant to architectonic embodiment such as: Bodily, perceptual, cognitive, affective, and social changes related to alterations in body size relative to people, objects and architectural environments. I next provide a taxonomy of the Gulliver theme and highlight its main psychological features, and then proceed to review relevant work from cognitive science. Although fictional alterations of body-environment scaling far outreach current possibilities in experimental research, I argue that the peripetiae and morals outlined in the literary realm, as products of the human imagination, provide a unique window into the folk-psychology of body and space. © 2016 Dieguez.","Architecture; Bodily consciousness; Cognition; Embodiment; Literature",,2-s2.0-84974603295

Spatial configuration is a technical term that refers to the particular way in which a set of spaces are connected to one another as a network. Spatial configuration affects safety, security, and efficiency of functioning of complex buildings by facilitating certain patterns of movement and/or impeding other patterns. In cities and suburban built environments, spatial configuration affects accessibilities and influences travel behavioural patterns, e.g. choosing walking and cycling for short trips instead of travelling by cars. As such, spatial configuration effectively influences the social, economic, and environmental functioning of cities and complex buildings, by conducting human movement patterns. In this research, graph theory is used to mathematically model spatial configurations in order to provide intuitive ways of studying and designing spatial arrangements for architects and urban designers. The methods and tools presented in this dissertation are applicable in: - arranging spatial layouts based on configuration graphs, e.g. by using bubble diagrams to ensure certain spatial requirements and qualities in complex buildings; and - analysing the potential effects of decisions on the likely spatial performance of buildings and on mobility patterns in built environments for systematic comparison of designs or plans, e.g. as to their aptitude for pedestrians and cyclists. The dissertation reports two parallel tracks of work on architectural and urban configurations. The core concept of the architectural configuration track is the 'bubble diagram' and the core concept of the urban configuration track is the 'easiest paths' for walking and cycling. Walking and cycling have been chosen as the foci of this theme as they involve active physical, cognitive, and social encounter of people with built environments, all of which are influenced by spatial configuration. The methodologies presented in this dissertation have been implemented in design toolkits and made publicly available as freeware applications. © 2016 Pirouz Nourian.","Architecture; Computational design; Graph theory; Mathematical modelling; Spatial configuration; Urban design",,2-s2.0-84992436625

There is evidence that the adequate dopamine balance in the frontal cortex is associated with a better outcome of the disorder, while the alteration of dopamine mechanism at this level may affect the vascular system leading to secondary neuronal alterations. Our study was conducted post-mortem and its objective was to identify the alterations in the neuronal architecture, in the integrity of the microvascular unit in the frontal cortex of patients treated with potent and excessive D2-blocking antipsychotics. Materials and Methods: We studied post-mortem sections of the frontal cortex of three patients (two women and one man) diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and treated with antipsychotics for the last 24 months. The slides were prepared according to the classical histopathological protocols. Results: Various alterations were found at the neural and vascular levels in the frontal cortex. The most significant was the neural loss as the result of severe changes in the microvessels (diameter reduction, hyaline and collagen deposits, edema, pinocytosis and vacuolization). Discussion: The evidences shown in our study highlight the fact that antipsychotics with potent antagonist action on D2 receptors may affect the neurovascular unit and small vessels in frontal cortex by altering the balance vasoconstriction-vasodilatation, thus reducing the blood flow and metabolism and generating structural microvascular changes proportional with the level of apoptosis at this level. The functional integrity of the dopaminergic system in frontal cortex depends on the vascular support and the capabilities of the neurovascular unit and any dysfunction increases the neuronal loss with clinically significant changes. Conclusions: The pathological data of our study raises the hypothesis for the pathogenic stages at the level of microvessels in the frontal cortex of the patients with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders treated with D2-blocking antipsychotics: a stage with functional, reversible alterations that may be correlated with the impairments of working memory and presence of extrapyramidal symptoms and a lesional, irreversible stage with significant deterioration of cognition and global functioning. Further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis. © 2016, Editura Academiei Romane.

An influential model of PE predicts that speaking rate should affect the relative proportion of these serial-order sound errors (anticipations, perseverations, exchanges). These predictions have been extended to, and have special relevance for persons with aphasia (PWA) because of the increased frequency with which speech errors occur and because their localisation within the functional linguistic architecture may help in diagnosis and treatment. Supporting evidence regarding the effect of speaking rate on phonological encoding has been provided by studies using young normal language (NL) speakers and computer simulations. Limited data exist for older NL users and no group data exist for PWA. Aims: This study tested the phonologic encoding properties of Dell’s model of speech production, which predicts that increasing speaking rate affects the relative proportion of serial-order sound errors (i.e., anticipations, perseverations and exchanges). Methods & Procedures: The effects of speech rate on the error ratios of anticipation/exchange (AE), anticipation/perseveration (AP) and vocal reaction time (VRT) were examined in 16 normal healthy controls (NHC) and 16 PWA without concomitant motor speech disorders. The participants were recorded performing a phonologically challenging (tongue twister) speech production task at their typical and two faster speaking rates. Outcomes & Results: A significant effect of increased rate was obtained for the AP but not the AE ratio. Significant effects of group and rate were obtained for VRT. Conclusion: Although the significant effect of rate for the AP ratio provided evidence that changes in speaking rate did affect PE, the results failed to support the model-derived predictions regarding the direction of change for error-type proportions. The current findings argued for an alternative concept of the role of activation and decay in influencing types of serial-order sound errors. Rather than a slow activation decay rate, the results of the current study were more compatible with an alternative explanation of rapid activation decay or slow build-up of residual activation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","aphasia; phonologic encoding; serial-order errors; speech production; speech rate","adult; aged; aphasia; Article; clinical article; cognitive function test; controlled study; hearing test; human; middle aged; perception; phonetics; reaction time; reliability; sound level measurement; speech rate",2-s2.0-84944710183

With real-time communication with the Earth impossible, the crew-members will have to work autonomously and depend a lot on technical resources located on board. Architects and psychologists need to work together to make sure good space flight behavioral health, the presence of high levels of personal adjustment, and positive interactions with the social and physical environments. METHODS It is presented in this paper the design concept for the interior space of spacecraft or human accommodation in other planets, with the introduction of the latest developments of virtual reality system and robots to the construction of the future environment. Meanwhile, hinted by the latest developments of psychology, the idea of cognitive behavioral therapy is also introduced in the design and construction process of the environment. Utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a very sophisticated psychological treatment of insomnia, the environment presented in this paper enhances the association of different crew-members and improves their psychological status. Based on the well-established efficacy of group treatment of the aforementioned method, crew-members can reduce the level of tension in this environment. RESULT A designed environment integrating psychosocial aspects with behavioral, technical and environmental issues shows that the design of unit space can be easily extended to the more complex situation. Two measures are conceptualized and assessed: emotional status and subjective physical comfort. Results prove the effect prior to their deployment in space. CONCLUSIONS The spaceflight-analogous environments presented in this paper can be served for future Mars or farther mission design and training. By designing and constructing facilities that are activity oriented, habit-ability is increased thereby decreasing environmental challenges to behavioral health. Furthermore, this paper concludes with suggestions for increasing collaboration between architects and psychologists. These include increased sharing of assumptions and mutual advocacy for potent and sustained involvement in mission planning and execution.

I am not sure if Helmholtz’s groundbreaking research has much in common with the work of architects today, but I suspect that many of us will be familiar with the innumerable false starts and missteps that his method entailed. And since the figure of the vigorous mountaineer conjures a far more flattering self image than the one that we usually confront, I suggest that we take the metaphor. In a few simple lines Helmholtz recognized the invaluable role of bad ideas, failed experiments and the countless hours spent on unfulfilled ambitions. More than just research or experiments, his analogy posits that these activities serve as a kind of training necessary for the hard work of cognitive climbing-practice in the fullest sense of the word. Architects should be familiar with this notion since it underlies most systems of architectural apprenticeship and licensure.

Technologies themselves tend to be treated like black-boxes, somehow exogenously defined by engineering R&D efforts, while societies are mainly conceived of as passive agents, which can, at most, accept or reject them on the basis of their preferences. In our paper we adopt a different perspective, i.e., we start from the acknowledgement of the importance of the work of many distributed agents and micro-learning processes in technological evolutions and innovations as well as from the idea that sustainable solutions are by no means restricted to linear progression from past to future, as they can also encompass returns and recombinations of traditional components and practices together with new ones. After grounding our approach in some of the main contributions from innovation studies as well as in the application of cognitive science to evolutionary studies of technologies, we specifically discuss the possibility to use a multi-agent and multi-indexing ontological system as a device to share and learn technological knowledge across a wide community, thus supporting those micro-learning processes of distributed agents, which-in our perspective-can boost innovation and change in practice.

Research on expert-novice variances has shown that the foundation of learner prior-knowledge is vital to influencing comprehension of learning information. Critical Thinking is a domain of Instructional Systems Design (ISD) and educational psychology examining the educational repercussions of the brain’s information processing. This is rooted in the cognitive architecture general model that encompasses two vital elements: working memory and long-term memory and their interrelatedness. Recent research has revealed that learning through the combination of both pictorial (or iconic) representation and textual material generally increases the learning and therefore comprehension of information. Critical thinking is significant to today’s modern learning environment, wherein individuals are tasked with consuming vast amounts of information while examining the complexities of this information. The use of imagery and iconic representation of scientific concepts is a key component in improving Critical Thinking (CT) skills while maintaining optimal Cognitive Load (CL) within higher education STEM learners. Instructional approaches based on active discovery and problem-based learning is becoming more commonplace in today’s educational forum. Opportunities to alternatively assess learning and evaluate comprehension in a digital learning environment are supportive from both a theoretical perspective and an empirical research perspective. Using virtual learning environments not only measures previously outlines learning objectives and goals, but allows learners to measure their cognitive load abilities in these scenarios. Most traditional laboratory experiments do not actively engage students in the three highest levels of the learning process. These levels include analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. By utilizing simulation software, students are encouraged to model scientific phenomena and experience differing outcomes based upon changing parameters. This introduces synthesis and processing skills into their learning environment through the use of student-led learning and mastery of concepts. Achievement of concept mastery is completed by students actively engaging in investigation and experimentation. They gain perspective of analysis of data and evaluation of the data they gather. By not providing a predicted outcome, students can analyze and report conclusions based upon true science, where experimentation leads to knowledge through hypothesizing of scientific processes. Existing research regarding science learning using visualizations for information design processes such as underscoring vital information through cueing and color coding, have focused on presenting a dynamic association between the integration of multiple representations with one another. Current research on the interaction design features of dynamic visualizations focuses on learner control and manipulation of content for best practices in the facilitation of learning. Iconographic representations aid learners in comprehension as a form of intervention in learners who have a lower level of prior knowledge, while this method of assistance in higher levels of prior knowledge learners would impede further learning. Interaction design features must account for expertise reversal effect in the cognitive load schema targeting long-term memory. By mitigating for this effect while constructing intervention processes, researcher and educators can reduce the impact on working memory through the use of carefully integrating iconic representations into learning of complex problem-solving techniques. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-85021892167

They also aspire that their wireless devices be small with a long battery time and life. To meet the first requirement, a smartphone must support a large number of radio standards; this has motivated the development of Flexible Radios that efficiently support a wide range of wireless communication standards. In this context, adaptive radios modify their performance based on the environment. The Cognitive Radios sense the RF environment to use available spectrum and standards. A key enabling technology for each of these types of radios is Software Defined Radios (SDR) that support numerous current and future standards, share resources between different radio threads, and dynamically add new radio threads to an operational radio. The SDR architecture must also be both area- and energy-efficient. One example of an efficient and flexible baseband architecture is the Scalable Communications Core (SCC), which was developed by Intel Labs and meets many of the requirements for an SDR baseband, including programmability, resource sharing, and efficient scheduling of radio threads. Consisting of a heterogeneous set of coarse-grained, programmable accelerators connected via a packet-based Network-on-Chip (NoC), the resulting architecture is energy- and area-efficient. We taped out a prototype SCC test chip in a 65nm CMOS process, programmed and validated it for multiple protocols, including WiFi, WiMAX, GPS, Bluetooth, and DVB-H and found that its measured energy and area efficiency were competitive with other flexible baseband architectures. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85027031889

Recently creativity has also been considered as an alternative approach to foster active ageing. In this study the relationships between visual creativity and visual mental imagery components were investigated in a sample of 100 people with no background in art, design and architecture, aged from 18 to 82 years. Participants were administered an adaptation of Clark’s Drawing Ability Test, aimed at measuring the ability to produce creative drawings, and three mental imagery tasks investigating the three main cognitive processes involved in visual mental imagery in accordance with Kosslyn’s Model: generation, inspection and transformation. Vividness of imagery was also measured. Drawings were evaluated by two independent judges in terms of ‘aesthetic’ and ‘creativity’ values. Correlation analysis revealed that the ability to make aesthetic and creative drawings is related to the ability to generate and accurately transform mental images. Regression analysis confirmed the key role of spatial imagery and also highlighted that the vividness of imagery is crucial. These results confirm and extend previous findings in which artistic creativity in professionals and trained subjects was found to be related to the generation process of imagery rather than to the transformation process of imagery, whereas creativity assessed by means of different tasks in novices was related to different processes of mental imagery (e.g., generation and transformation). This suggests that imagery is important for visual creativity. In addition, with regards the ageing issue, it should be noted that no difference was found between younger and older participants, confirming that creativity can be preserved to some extent with age and suggesting the importance of implementing creativity training aimed at preventing pathological ageing. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Paradox can be a threat, and paradox can be a source for new insight. This paper examines how a paradox can emerge and develop in organizations. I will argue that the organization can be seen as a complex social system, and that the paradox rises as the system faces increased complexity in its environment, while equipped with an information processing architecture that reduces the complexity in an inadequate way. Following a review of classes of paradoxes: rhetorical, logical and social, the paper describes an organization as a complex social system with cognitive operations. The cognitive operations include drawing of distinctions, forming of categories, individuation of the system and the boundaries to the environment, and adaptability as a second order reorganization. The paper then discusses the dynamics and micro-foundation of how a paradox is formed based on this model. Three categories of social paradoxes: paradox of belonging, paradox of learning, and paradox of organizing, are analyzed and described as dynamic behavior in a system. The paper intends to inform a trans-disciplinary approach to describe phenomenon in organizations seen as complex social systems, and to contribute with conceptual understanding to be applied in empirical studies of paradoxical situations in organizations. © 2016, Emergent Publications.

This phenomenon is known as an intelligent tool to study cognitive processes. Methods: Taking a network of excitatory and inhibitory Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron in network architecture of visual cortex, the behavior of coupled spiking neuron in cortical brain that have a direct effect on the emergence of this phenomenon was modeled. To evaluate the performance of this model, direction lines as the two stimuli were applied to the eyes. Findings: Rebuilding the predominance time of each eye, and independence between the two successive dominance times were reported by this model. In addition, the effect of changes in the stimulus applied to each of the two eyes was studied and it was figured out that applied changing stimulus strength to one eye was affected only on dominance time of the other eye. Besides, increasing stimulus strength of both eyes decreased mean dominance time. Conclusion: Obtained results of this model were consistent with known experimental result for this phenomenon and many of dynamics features of this phenomenon reconstructed.

However, even before those declines become noticeable, the neural architecture underlying those mechanisms has undergone considerable restructuring and reorganization. During performance of a cognitive task, not only have the task-relevant networks demonstrated reorganization with aging, which occurs primarily by recruitment of additional areas to preserve performance, but the task-irrelevant network of the ""default-mode"" network (DMN), which is normally deactivated during task performance, has also consistently shown reduction of this deactivation with aging. Here, we revisited those age-related changes in task-relevant (i.e., language system) and task-irrelevant (i.e., DMN) systems with a language production paradigm in terms of task-induced activation/deactivation, functional connectivity, and context-dependent correlations between the two systems. Our task fMRI data demonstrated a late increase in cortical recruitment in terms of extent of activation, only observable in our older healthy adult group, when compared to the younger healthy adult group, with recruitment of the contralateral hemisphere, but also other regions from the network previously underutilized. Our middle-aged individuals, when compared to the younger healthy adult group, presented lower levels of activation intensity and connectivity strength, with no recruitment of additional regions, possibly reflecting an initial, uncompensated, network decline. In contrast, the DMN presented a gradual decrease in deactivation intensity and deactivation extent (i.e., low in the middle-aged, and lower in the old) and similar gradual reduction of functional connectivity within the network, with no compensation. The patterns of age-related changes in the task-relevant system and DMN are incongruent with the previously suggested notion of anti-correlation of the two systems. The context-dependent correlation by psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis demonstrated an independence of these two systems, with the onset of task not influencing the correlation between the two systems. Our results suggest that the language network and the DMN may be non-dependent systems, potentially correlated through the re-allocation of cortical resources, and that aging may affect those two systems differently. © 2016 La, Garcia-Ramos, Nair, Meier, Farrar-Edwards, Birn, Meyerand and Prabhakaran.","BOLD fMRI; DMN; Functional connectivity; Normal aging; Psychophysiological interactions; Task positive network","adult; aging; BOLD signal; compensation; controlled study; default mode network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; language; middle aged; neurophysiological recruitment; task positive network",2-s2.0-84974622784

Importantly, a given property of the linguistic system can be ""specific"" to the domain of language in several ways. For example, if the property evolved by natural selection under the pressure of the linguistic function it serves then the property is domain-specific in the sense that its design is tailored for language. Equally though, if that property evolved to serve a different function or if that property is domain-general, it may nevertheless interact with the linguistic system in a way that is unique. This gives a second sense in which a property can be thought of as specific to language. An evolutionary approach to the language faculty might at first blush appear to favor domain-specificity in the first sense, with individual properties of the language faculty being specifically linguistic adaptations. However, we argue that interactions between learning, culture, and biological evolution mean any domain-specific adaptations that evolve will take the form of weak biases rather than hard constraints. Turning to the latter sense of domain-specificity, we highlight a very general bias, simplicity, which operates widely in cognition and yet interacts with linguistic representations in domain-specific ways. © 2016 Culbertson and Kirby.","Compositionality; Domain-specificity; Language evolution; Regularization; Simplicity; Typological universals; Word order",,2-s2.0-84958559638

Yet, this distinction ignores cultural and linguistic variation in the conceptualisation of mental states that can be labelled as ‘propositional attitudes’. Moreover, this approach overlooks the fact that categorisation of mental states in general and ‘propositional attitudes’ in particular is aligned with cultural attitudes and understandings. This chapter proposes a comparative analysis of selected terms of ‘propositional attitudes’ in English and Russian (to believe vs. sčitat’ and belief vs. mnenie) in terms of universal meanings as they are identified in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). The concepts central to the analysis are know and think which have been shown to have exact semantic equivalents in Russian and English as well as other languages. The chapter demonstrates that the analysed concepts differ in meaning and can be related to culture-specific cognitive styles which can be formulated as cultural scripts. The chapter demonstrates that the supremacy of logical concepts does not correlate to the architecture of mental lexicon as it is revealed in universal human concepts. It argues that NSM semantic universals can be regarded as more appropriate elements in the analysis of propositional attitudes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Cultural scripts; Pragmatics and culture; Propositional attitudes",,2-s2.0-85028612645

Software Defined Radios (SDRs) are highly desired in space missions because of their low Size, Weight, Power consumption and Cost (SWAP-C) and for the large range of communication services they can provide. They can be customized for or during specific missions with software or FPGA code changes only. The proposed software defined transceiver closely aligns with major goals of the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program and its technology efforts. It significantly increases the mission readiness and reduces the cost and mission risk of using Ka-band services. It is able to operate at data rates 4× to 10× higher than current mission transceivers in the same frequency bands. It offers more operational options to missions and improves communications reliability.

We demonstrate distinct limbic (ventromedial prefrontal regions, ventral striatum - VS, ventral tegmental area - VTA), motor (supplementary motor areas - SMAs, putamen, substantia nigra) and cognitive (lateral prefrontal and caudate) functional connectivity. We confirm the functional nature of the cortico-striatal connections, demonstrating correlates of well-established goal-directed behaviour (involving medial orbitofrontal cortex - mOFC and VS), probabilistic reversal learning (lateral orbitofrontal cortex - lOFC and VS) and attentional shifting (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - dlPFC and VS) while assessing habitual model-free (SMA and putamen) behaviours on an exploratory basis. We further use neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to show that more goal-directed model-based learning (MBc) is also associated with higher mOFC neurite density and habitual model-free learning (MFc) implicates neurite complexity in the putamen.

However, researchers today are still working to understand the capabilities, boundaries, and architecture. While the storage capabilities of long-term memory are seemingly unlimited (Bahrick, J Exp Psychol 113:1–2, 1984), working memory, or the ability to maintain and manipulate information held in memory, seems to have stringent capacity limits (e.g., Cowan, Behav Brain Sci 24:87–185, 2001). Individual differences, however, do exist and these differences can often predict performance on a wide variety of tasks (cf. Engle What is working-memory capacity? 297–314, 2001). Recently, researchers have promoted the enticing possibility that simple behavioral training can expand the limits of working memory which indeed may also lead to improvements on other cognitive processes as well (cf. Morrison and Chein, Psychol Bull Rev 18:46–60 2011). However, initial investigations across a wide variety of cognitive functions have produced mixed results regarding the transferability of training-related improvements. Across two experiments, the present research focuses on the benefit of working memory training on visual short-term memory capacity—a cognitive process that has received little attention in the training literature. Data reveal training-related improvement of global measures of visual short-term memory as well as of measures of the independent sub-processes that contribute to capacity (Awh et al., Psychol Sci 18(7):622–628, 2007). These results suggest that the ability to inhibit irrelevant information within and between trials is enhanced via n-back training allowing for selective improvement on untrained tasks. Additionally, we highlight a potential limitation of the standard adaptive training procedure and propose a modified design to ensure variability in the training environment. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"adolescent; adult; attention; cognition; controlled study; female; human; learning; male; photostimulation; physiology; randomized controlled trial; short term memory; task performance; vision; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Cognition; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Photic Stimulation; Task Performance and Analysis; Transfer (Psychology); Visual Perception; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84955176310

Real-world observations from streaming data sources such as sensors, click streams, and social media are becoming increasingly common in many domains, including cybersecurity, infectious disease surveillance, social community networks, and web-based recommendation systems. An emerging approach is to leverage graph-based modeling of these events, to understand ongoing trends and predict future ones.

This phenomenological approach is deply rooted in the theory of pattern formation and offers a formal justification that in the proximity of transitions from one pattern to another a low-dimensional description via canonical models is permissible. We exploit this thinking in the context of auditory scene analysis, specifically auditory streaming, where the brain network integrates or segregates sounds that arise from two or more distinct sources. We interpret the process of integration and segregation as a pattern formation process and demonstrate through mathematical modeling, behavioral experiments and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that selected networks in the brain get differentially activated as a function of the percept. We propose a functional architeture composed of brain areas with tonotopic organization (auditory cortex) and non-tonotopic organization (various parietal areas including right superior parietal lobule and precuneus). The dynamics of this functional architecture extends beyond auditory streaming and suggests the existence of informational convergence zones in the brain that get selectively activated in a nonlinear all-or-none fashion. This dynamics is reminiscent of phase transitions as discussed in synergetics and generalizes concepts well established in multisensory integration. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Auditory streaming; BOLD signal; Emergence; fMRI; Perception; Synergetics",,2-s2.0-85008395504

A fundamental question when applying machine learning to this task is the architecture of the learning model. Most existing approaches make decisions in note-to-note steps (N2N) and use heuristics to resolve conflicts arising in the process. We present here a new approach of processing in chord-to-chord steps (C2C), where a solution for a complete chord is calculated. The C2C approach has the advantage of being cognitively more plausible but it leads to feature modelling problems, while the N2N approach is computationally more efficient. We evaluate a new C2C model in comparison to an N2N model using all 19 four-voice fugues from J. S. Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier The overall accuracy for the C2C model turned out slightly higher but without statistical significance in our experiment.

We view Early Bronze II (EB II) south Levantine urbanism as a novel ideological construct grounded in heterarchical modes of social organization, rather than a direct development from earlier village-based lifestyles. In the current study we employ a phenomenological approach that enables us to identify an urban habitus and to discuss cognitive aspects of town life, rather than constraining the discussion to urban morphology. Tel Bet Yerah in northern Israel is a good place to approach these issues, as it presents a continuous, extensively excavated Early Bronze Age sequence. One of the most prominent elements of the EB II fortified city is a system of paved streets that constructed space in a clear geometric pattern. The investment in street planning and engineering, alongside other aspects of planning, no doubt played a key role in the inculcation of urban concepts at the site. As shared public spaces, the streets were experienced and modified through the everyday practices of the town’s inhabitants and visitors. It is the negotiation between planning, ideology and practice that makes the streets of Bet Yerah an exemplary case of the role of architecture in promoting and sustaining a new social order. © The Fund for Mediterranean Archaeology/Equinox Publishing Ltd., 2016.","Early Bronze Age; Planning; Streets; Tel Bet Yerah; Urbanization","archaeological evidence; Bronze Age; planning history; urban development; urban history; urban morphology; urban planning; urbanization; Israel",2-s2.0-85007504635

Damage to these cerebellar white matter tracts may lead to serious language, cognitive and emotional disturbances, although the pathophysiological mechanism behind it is still debated. Differences in white matter integrity between patients and controls might shed light on structure-function correlations. A probabilistic parcellation atlas of the cerebellar white matter would help these studies by facilitating automatic segmentation of the cerebellar peduncles, the localization of lesions and the comparison of white matter integrity between patients and controls.

Here, we show evidence that perceptual interference between items can be predicted by known receptive field properties of the visual cortex, suggesting that competition within representational maps is an important source of the capacity limitations of visual processing. Across the visual hierarchy, receptive fields get larger and represent more complex, high-level features. Thus, when presented simultaneously, high-level items (e.g., faces) will often land within the same receptive fields, while low-level items (e.g., color patches) will often not. Using a perceptual task, we found long-range interference between high-level items, but only short-range interference for low-level items, with both types of interference being weaker across hemifields. Finally, we show that long-range interference between items appears to occur primarily during perceptual encoding and not during working memory maintenance.

A network view of the mental lexicon is inherent to many cognitive theories, but the predictions of a working model strongly depend on a realistic scale, covering most words used in daily communication. Combining a large network with recent methods from network science allows us to answer questions about its organization at different scales simultaneously, such as: How efficient and robust is lexical knowledge represented considering the global network architecture? What are the organization principles of words in the mental lexicon (i.e. thematic versus taxonomic)? How does the local connectivity with neighboring words explain why certain words are processed more efficiently than others?

It is also rife with metaphors that manifest vast numbers of novel metaphoric expressions. More and more, to understand such issues, to see who is saying what and why, we require big data and statistically-based analysis of such corpora. However, statisticallybased data processing alone cannot do all the work. The MetaNet (MN) project has developed an analysis method that formalizes existing insights about the conceptual metaphors underlying linguistic expressions into a computationally tractable mechanism for automatically discovering new metaphoric expressions in texts. The ontology used for this computational method is organized in terms of metaphor cascades, i.e. pre-existing packages of hierarchically organized primary and general metaphors that occur together. The current paper describes the architecture of metaphor-to-metaphor relations built into this system. MN's methodology represents a proof of concept for a novel way of performing metaphor analysis. It does so by applying the method to one particular domain of social interest, namely the gun debate in American political discourse. Though well aware that such an approach cannot replace a thorough cognitive, sociological, and political analysis, this paper offers examples that show how a cascade theory of metaphor and grammar helps automated data analysis in many ways.","Cascades; Computational linguistics; Construction grammar; Embodied construction grammar; Metaphor; Metaphor identification; Rights metaphors; The gun debate",,2-s2.0-85016321811

We posit that the reason consciousness resists scientific description is because the language of science is too weak; its power to render phenomena objective is exhausted by the sophistication of the brain's architecture. However, this does not mean that there is nothing to say about consciousness. We propose that the phenomenon can be expressed in terms of data compression, a well-defined concept from theoretical computer science which acknowledges and formalises the limits of objective representation. Data compression focuses on the intersection between the uncomputable and the finite. It has a number of fundamental theoretical applications, giving rise, for example, to a universal definition of intelligence (Hutter, 2004), a universal theory of prior probability, as well as a universal theory of inductive inference (Solomonoff, 1964). Here we explore the merits of considering consciousness in such terms, showing how the data compression approach can provide new perspectives on intelligent behaviour, the combination problem, and the hard problem of subjective experience. In particular, we use the tools of algorithmic information theory to prove that integrated experience cannot be achieved by a computable process. © 2016 Institute for Cognitive Science, Seoul National University.","Algorithmic information theory; Artificial intelligence; Combination problem; Consciousness; Data compression; Hard problem; Integrated information; Qualia; Scientific standards",,2-s2.0-85009959357

Stop Signal tests (SSTs) are the most frequently studied paradigm used to assess response inhibition. Previous studies of SSTs have indicated that inhibitory control behavior can be explained using a common model in which GO and STOP processes are initiated independent from one and another, and the process that is completed first determines whether the behavior is elicited (GO process) or terminated (STOP process). Consistent with this model, studies have indicated that individuals strategically delay their behaviors during SSTs in order to increase their stopping abilities. Despite being controlled by distinct neural systems, prior studies have largely documented similar inhibitory control performance across eye and hand movements. Though, no existing studies have compared the extent to which individuals strategically delay behavior across different effectors is not yet clear. Here, we compared the extent to which inhibitory control processes and the cognitive strategies that support them during oculomotor and manual motor behaviors. Methods: We examined 29 healthy individuals who performed parallel oculomotor and manual motor SSTs. Participants also completed a separate block of GO trials administered prior to the Stop Signal tests to assess baseline reaction times for each effector and reaction time increases during interleaved GO trials of the SST. Results: Our results showed that stopping errors increased for both effectors as the interval between GO and STOP cues was increased (i.e., stop signal delay), but performance deteriorated more rapidly for eye compared to hand movements with increases in stop signal delay. During GO trials, participants delayed the initiation of their responses for each effector, and greater slowing of reaction times on GO trials was associated with increased accuracy on STOP trials for both effectors. However, participants delayed their eye movements to a lesser degree than their hand movements, and strategic reaction time slowing was a stronger determinant of stopping accuracy for hand compared to eye movements. Overall, stopping accuracies for eye and hand movements were only modestly correlated, and the time it took individuals to cancel a response was not related for eye and hand movements. Discussion and Conclusion: Our findings that GO and STOP processes are independent and that individuals strategically delay their behavioral responses to increase stopping accuracy regardless of effector indicate that inhibitory control of oculomotor and manual motor behaviors both follow common guiding principles. Yet, our findings document that eye movements are more difficult to inhibit than hand movements, and the timing, magnitude, and impact of cognitive control strategies used to support voluntary response inhibition are less robust for eye compared to hand movements. This suggests that inhibitory control systems also show unique characteristics that are behavior-dependent. This conclusion is consistent with neurophysiological evidence showing important differences in the architecture and functional properties of the neural systems involved in inhibitory control of eye and hand movements. It also suggests that characterizing inhibitory control processes in health and disease requires effector-specific analysis. © 2016 Schmitt, Ankeny, Sweeney and Mosconi.","Inhibitory control; Response inhibition; Stop Signal test",,2-s2.0-85009204396

'Smart' buildings often address little other than technically functional issues, with any ideas of 'design' as a unifying factor being disregarded. At the same time, music and performance art have been in the vanguard of creating digital interaction that intimately involves the user in aesthetic outcomes, in the creation of what Umberto Eco describes as an 'Open Work'. Environments made responsive through embedment of computational technologies can similarly extend usability and user-centred design towards universality, through careful consideration of the relationship between person, context and activity, and of the continuous and ultimately transactional nature of human occupation of built environment. Truly 'smart' environments will learn from and through usage, and can be conceived and designed so as to maximise environmental 'fit' for a wider variety of users, including people described as being 'neurodiverse'. Where user response becomes a significant component in managing a smart environment, the transactional relationship between user and environment is made explicit, and can ultimately be used to drive interaction that favours ease-of-use and personalisation. Inclusion of affective computing in human interaction with built environment offers significant potential for extending the boundaries of Universal Design to include people with autism, people with intellectual disability, and users with acquired cognitive impairment, including that arising from dementia. The same users frequently have issues with sensory-perceptual sensitivity and processing. The resulting mismatch between their individual needs and abilities, and the environments they typically occupy, can give rise to states of chronic and acute anxiety. Analysis of the characteristics of such users gives rise to various 'personas', whose functional and psychosocial needs may be best met by responsive environments which take consideration of affective state, that is, of mood and emotion. Human-computer interaction which marries responsive architecture and affective computing offers a new paradigm for smart environments, which are intrinsically user-centred as a consequence. The technical complexity of designing such an environment must always be balanced by the absolute necessity of utilising Universal Design principles to reduce the underlying technological complexity to a usable interface. This paper is a preliminary exploration of the principles underlying the design of one such responsive environment: An interactive sensory room for children with autism spectrum disorders, (ASDs), which aims to promote relaxation and thus reduce anxiety. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.","Affective computing; Autism; Sensory environments; Universal design","autism; computer interface; construction work and architectural phenomena; disabled person; human; Architectural Accessibility; Autistic Disorder; Disabled Persons; Facility Design and Construction; Humans; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-84988474860

The benefits of the use of vegetation in indoor environment, and in particular the use of Living Wall Systems, are demonstrated by the international scientific literature. Such benefits can be listed as follows: acoustic comfort, indoor air quality and dilution of pollutants, thermo hygrometric comfort, psycho-emotional well-being (improvement of cognitive skills, stress reduction and user satisfaction). During the last years, the LWS' spread is confirmed by the increasing number of buildings featured by vegetation both on façades and on partitioning. Despite the interest about the vegetated technologies and their benefits, LWSs in Italy are seldom used. The reasons are referable to three main causes: high initial and maintenances costs; absence of scientific data about some properties; lack of economic incentives as well as of technical standards aimed at encouraging a wider use of such system. These standards are usually available in other European Countries. According to critical issues described, the paper outlines some research activities in order to assess the LWS' environmental and economic sustainability. Particularly the paper deals with an industrial research carried out by the Department of Architecture and Design (DAD) of Politecnico di Torino. The research was aimed at developing an environmental friendly and low cost LWS. A Life Cycle Thinking approach was adopted in order to plan and assess the LWS over its life cycle.

Bauman and Joseph J. Murray make the case for preserving Deaf communities fromnormalizing influences in order to protect the diversity-cultural, creative, and cognitive-accessible through deaf people and their signed languages. Deaf Studies might bewell served by taking the position that all individualswould be enriched by becoming “a bit more Deaf.” This essay presents a variety of ways Deaf communities have intrinsic and extrinsic value. Acknowledging “Deaf-gain” allows us to see that much of what we know about the complexity of language is indebted to decades of research into sign languages. Using sign language has been linked to advanced visuospatial abilities and potential to learn visually for both deaf and hearing people. Because of its visuospatial aspects, scholars might one day use sign languages to more accurately represent mental images in their explanations. Research still remains to be done in order to show how benefits might emerge from the work of Deaf filmmakers, and furtherworkby groups like theDeafSpaceProjectwill reveal theways that signlanguage users can revitalize architecture and community planning. “Deaf-gain” can also help us reconsider the world of literature, as sign poetry extends both performance and visual traditions into new literary forms. Rather than being hemmed in by cultural boundaries, Deaf Studies has begun to encompass a transnational perspective while also deepening analyses of how deaf people are integrated in their particular national contexts. For instance, use of International Sign has allowed Deaf travelers to communicate across linguistic boundaries with much more success than auditory language users. The authors of this essay suggest that in an era marked by dissolution of communities, the Deaf cultural community can provide models for restoring collectivity. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,2-s2.0-85020655973

In the past sixty years, however, robots have diversified into many different types with a very broad range of functionalities. Despite this large variety of operational robots that have been developed in the past decades, the majority of existing types of robot will currently not be capable of carrying out reliably and effectively meaningful care tasks. For one thing, the communication between the more traditional types of robots and humans is severely underdeveloped. This is only logical as robots were intended to replace human practice in which human-robot communication was either undesirable or of limited value. Aim Fortunately, exceptions to this are increasingly appearing, and these will be treated. At this stage it will not be surprising that an overview of types of robots for care will be a categorization of types of robots, rather than types of care. As it is, current prototypes of robots for care also have different functionalities, and with those, also a very different architecture indicating that no single planned robot can perform all care tasks that are necessary or desired. This manuscript presents an overview of the main types of care robots that are currently under development, and partly even operative in actual care locations. Results It is evident that also the care robots in actual use still have quite limited capabilities, and, coupled with this, a short endurance of about an hour. Yet it also has to be concluded that even the simplest types of robots with a very limited behavioural repertoire can be successful with cases of cognitive decline and early dementia. In view of the potential capabilities of robots a categorization of care activities is proposed that can be stated as (i) physical assistance, (ii) social assistance and (iii) medical assistance. Physical assistance can be provided by relatively large and heavy-weight robots that can lift and transport people with limited mobility. For the great majority of care robots, social assistance is envisaged, to be realized by humanoid robots, looking like real humans but mostly half-size or less. Active research in this field is focusing on robot locomotion, gestures, speech recognition, understanding and production, face recognition and autonomy. Somewhat disconcerting is the observation that medical assistance robots are practically absent in current development efforts, though it can be argued that there are definitely many relatively simple and frequently occurring medical actions that could be successfully carried out by a robot.","Care robots; Human-robot communication; Humanoids; Telecare",,2-s2.0-85007574084

While neurodevelopmental delay and abnormal brain function occur in the absence of overt brain lesions, these conditions have been recently associated with changes in microstructural brain development. Recent imaging studies indicate changes in brain connectivity, in particular involving the white matter fibers belonging to the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop. Furthermore, EP and IUGR have been related to altered brain network architecture in childhood, with reduced network global capacity, global efficiency and average nodal strength. In this study, we used a connectome analysis to characterize the structural brain networks of these children, with a special focus on their topological organization. On one hand, we confirm the reduced averaged network node degree and strength due to EP and IUGR. On the other, the decomposition of the brain networks in an optimal set of clusters remained substantially different among groups, talking in favor of a different network community structure. However, and despite the different community structure, the brain networks of these high-risk school-age children maintained the typical small-world, rich-club and modularity characteristics in all cases. Thus, our results suggest that brain reorganizes after EP and IUGR, prioritizing a tight modular structure, to maintain the small-world, rich-club and modularity characteristics. By themselves, both extreme prematurity and IUGR bear a similar risk for neurocognitive and behavioral impairment, and the here defined modular network alterations confirm similar structural changes both by IUGR and EP at school age compared to control. Interestingly, the combination of both conditions (IUGR + EP) does not result in a worse outcome. In such cases, the alteration in network topology appears mainly driven by the effect of extreme prematurity, suggesting that these brain network alterations present at school age have their origin in a common critical period, both for intrauterine and extrauterine adverse conditions. © 2016 The Authors.

This area could be defined as a “security complex”, whose security architecture is made by the interaction of the various state and non-state actors, or as a geopolitical region. The riparian states are very heterogenous, they greatly differ in territory, population, economy and strategic affilitions. One important problem is that these countries – Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and Turkey, plus the nonriparian ones – the Republic of Moldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan – do not have the same strategic culture, or similar national interests, they do not perceive themselves, at the level of political and economic elites, as being part of the same area and having a common regional identity. No regional organisation plays the role of EU or NATO and this increases the insecurity perceptions among rival actors. Moscow wants to create a “buffer” area by putting pressure on the NATO/EU states to stop the enlargement process and proposes political and economical alternatives like the CSI Collective Security Treaty and the Eurasian Economic Union, while the West wants the Black Sea countries to remain NATO partners (via the PfP) and possible members (Ukraine and Georgia were promised NATO membership in April 2008 at the Bucharest Summit), and also economic/political partners for the EU via the Eastern Partnership and the free trade agreements. The lack of trust and even fear between Russia and the Western states generated, since 2014 (when Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia), accusations, provocative actions and arms building, economic sanctions, thus fostering a “security dilemma” mechanism which is to be explained not only by structural factors like systemic power polarity, predominance of offensive/defensive weapons, but also by psycho-cognitive perceptions of decision-makers. The fact that some states’ leaders perceive the balance of power in the Black Sea as being in a process of rapid change in economy, military, demographics may generate attempts to take profit of or close the windows of vulnerability, increasing the likelihood of regional military or “hybrid” conflicts. © Facultatea de Ştiinţe Politice, Universitatea din Bucureşti.","Arms race; Black Sea; Conflicts; Diaspora; Psychology; Rivalry; Security dilemma",,2-s2.0-85012101534

Currently, it is important to look at the challenge in an alternatively non-standard, yet still systemic way, paying less attention to details and outlining the ways out of this crisis of neuroscience. The purpose of this monograph is to describe the author’s theory about the brain’s architecture and operation to the medical and scientific community. Accompanied with extensive clinical, research and training experience, the author’s theoretical concepts of the brain synthesized with scientific evidence brought about the conclusion that low efficiency in neurologic therapy and mental diseases; the inability to work out mathematical models and simulations that could compete with the human brain; an academic dead end in the development of artificial intelligence; as well as high energy consumption of the computing innovations were conditioned by the inaccurate methodology and outdated anatomical and physiological views of the neurologists and neuroscientists on information processing in the brain, registration of memories and basic functions of the key morphological structures of the brain. The morphological structure and physiological functions of all known anatomical formations of the brain were defined in the late nineteenth century. Since then, these functions have been accepted as dogmatic. The book shows that present day multi-level neuroresearch relies on the foundation of systemic, morphofunctional and neuroanatomic knowledge about the brain structure. It looks for correlations between genome and post-genome data of molecular research in the brain tissue, as well as with neuropsychological and cognitive data; that is, the book intends to integrate the non-integrable into unified information space. The systemic approach in neuroresearch has become outdated by now and interferes with scientific development. The information approach in the author’s research of the genome, transcriptome, proteome in health and in disease permitted the analysis of the inductivity and magnetization of the nervous tissue. It also provided the explanation for targeted movement of the data in the module of the nervous tissue. The author came to the conclusion that gene, protein and neural networks “confused and chained” the pathways of scientific thought. Neural networks are only logistic constructions to provide data transfer in the brain between different modules of the nervous tissue. The author presumes that the funds invested in the development of brain simulations and artificial intelligence will hardly result in the expected advantages. If we are unable to step over the stereotypes of the systemic, morphofunctional research of the previous century, no progress shall come about. The author’s theoretical survey resulted in the unique information-commutation theory of the brain and formulation of the key principles of brain operation. As a clinician and professor of neurology, the author underpins his theory with clinical examples. This book presents the framework of the ideas that require experimental research and proof.

The unique self-directed learning and reconfiguration capabilities of cognitive network [1] enable the load balancing to become more effective. Based on research of the existing traffic scheduling algorithm, this paper improves the weighted least connections scheduling algorithm, and designs the Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm Based on Minimum Traffic (ASAMT). ASAMT conducts the real-time minimum load scheduling to the node service requests and configures the available idle resources in advance to ensure the service QoS requirements. Being adopted for simulation of the traffic scheduling algorithm, OPNET is applied to the cloud computing architecture. Experimental results show that, under the premise of no large network cost, the load condition of this algorithm is better than that of the unmodified weighted least connection scheduling algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.","adaptive algorithms; cloud computing; cognitive network; load balancing","Adaptive algorithms; Algorithms; Cloud computing; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Information science; Network architecture; Network management; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Scheduling algorithms; Adaptive load balancing; Adaptive scheduling algorithm; Cloud computing architectures; Cognitive network; Commercial applications; Reconfiguration capability; Self-directed learning; Weighted least connection scheduling; Computer architecture",2-s2.0-84971597280

As a generic model, there are three abstract functions within the KID model to describe three transformation stages from data to information, from information to knowledge, and from knowledge to data. They are interpretation() for interpreting data under given prior knowledge, assimilation() for assimilating information into existing knowledge, and instantiation() for generating knowledge instances.

While the degeneration of MbDNs underlies the motor defects in Parkinson's disease, imbalances in dopamine levels are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and substance abuse. In recent years, progress has been made in understanding how MbDNs, which constitute a relatively small neuronal population in the brain, can contribute to such diverse functions and dysfunctions. In particular, important insights have been gained regarding the distinct molecular, neurochemical and network properties of MbDNs. How this diversity of MbDNs is established during brain development is only starting to be unraveled. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the diversity in MbDN progenitors and differentiated MbDNs in the developing rodent brain. We discuss the signaling pathways, transcription factors and transmembrane receptors that contribute to setting up these diverse MbDN subpopulations.

In this work we address the problem of simultaneous learning at different levels of abstractions in such an architecture. This problem is important since human environments are highly variable, and many unexpected situations may arise during the execution of a task. The usual approach under this circumstance is to train each level individually to learn how to deal with the new situations. However, this approach is limited since it implies long task interruptions every time a new situation needs to be learned. We propose an architecture where learning takes place simultaneously at all the levels of abstraction. To achieve this, we devise a method that permits higher levels to guide the learning at the levels below for the correct execution of the task. The architecture is instantiated with a logic-based planner and an online planning operator learner, at the highest level, and with online reinforcement learning units that learn action policies for the grounding of the symbolic actions, at the lowest one. A human teacher is involved in the decision-making loop to facilitate learning. The framework is tested in a physically realistic simulation of the Sokoban game. © 2015 IEEE.","Decision making; Grounding; Learning (artificial intelligence); Planning; Robot sensing systems; Service robots","Abstracting; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Electric grounding; Human computer interaction; Planning; Reinforcement learning; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; Teaching; Artificial intelligence techniques; Cognitive architectures; Learning (artificial intelligence); Levels of abstraction; Realistic simulation; Robot sensing system; Robotic applications; Service robots; Intelligent robots",2-s2.0-84958166793

The cognitive radio technology enables opportunistic access of unlicensed sensor nodes to licensed bands without influencing primary users (PUs). Spectrum sensing is a key technology to identify the presence of PUs. Benefit from the diversity of different sensors, Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) can provide a more reliable sensing result compared with individual spectrum sensing. However, due to limited energy of batteries in cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs), more energy consumed by CSS will result in a short network lifetime. In this paper, a novel sensing nodes selection scheme is proposed to improve energy efficiency of cooperative spectrum sensing for cluster-based CRSNs. A novel optimization technique is employed to optimize the number of spectrum sensing nodes in a cluster. The optimized results can efficiently maximize the detection probability and minimize false alarm probability. In addition to this, the proposed scheme can efficiently balance the energy consumption among different sensors to some extent.

Cooperative spectrum sensing can improve the sensing performance in which multiple cognitive radio users cooperate to sense primary user bands. However, cooperative spectrum sensing is vulnerable to incumbent emulation and spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attacks.

The efficiency of the use of radio spectrum for wireless communications can be dramatically increased by dynamic secondary spectrum sharing; an intelligent approach that allows unlicensed devices access to those parts of the spectrum that are otherwise underutilized by the incumbent users. In this paper, we propose a heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning (HARL)-based framework, designed for dynamic secondary spectrum sharing in Long Term Evolution cellular systems. It utilizes a radio environment map as external information for guiding the learning process of cognitive cellular systems. System level simulations of a stadium temporary event scenario show that the schemes based on the proposed HARL framework achieve high controllability of spectrum sharing patterns in a fully autonomous way. This results in a significant decrease in the primary system quality of service degradation due to interference from the secondary cognitive systems, compared with a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solution and a purely heuristic typical LTE solution. The spectrum sharing patterns that emerge by using the proposed schemes also result in remarkable reliability of the cognitive eNodeB on the aerial platform. Furthermore, the novel principle and the general structure of heuristic functions proposed in the context of HARL are applicable to a wide range of self-organization problems beyond the wireless communications domain. © 2015 IEEE.","Dynamic spectrum access; Heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning; Spectrum sharing","Cellular radio systems; Cellular telephone systems; Cognitive radio; Cognitive systems; Heuristic algorithms; Information management; Interference suppression; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Telecommunication networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Dynamic spectrum access; External informations; Reinforcement learning solution; Secondary spectrums; Spectrum management; Spectrum sharing; System level simulation; Wireless communications; Reinforcement learning",2-s2.0-84961093604

How discrete the functions of modules are, how dependent the computational load of each module is to the other modules' processing, and what the precise role of connector nodes is for between-module communication remains underspecified. Here, we use a network model of the brain derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data and investigate the modular functional architecture of the human brain by analyzing activity at different types of nodes in the network across 9,208 experiments of 77 cognitive tasks in the BrainMap database. Using an author topic model of cognitive functions, we find a strong spatial correspondence between the cognitive functions and the network's modules, suggesting that each module performs a discrete cognitive function. Crucially, activity at local nodes within the modules does not increase in tasks that require more cognitive functions, demonstrating the autonomy of modules' functions. However, connector nodes do exhibit increased activity when more cognitive functions are engaged in a task. Moreover, connector nodes are located where brain activity is associated with many different cognitive functions. Connector nodes potentially play a role in betweenmodule communication that maintains the modular function of the brain. Together, these findings provide a network account of the brain'smodular yet integrated implementation of cognitive functions.","Cognition; Graph Theory; Hubs; Modularity; Network","Article; brain function; brain mapping; brain region; cognition; connectome; electroencephalogram; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; normal human; priority journal; resting state network; task performance; brain; cognition; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; Brain; Cognition; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging",2-s2.0-84949293220

Understanding how historical conditions have shaped this architecture is vital for understanding system responses to change at scales from the microbial upwards. However, in the absence of a group selection process, the collective behaviours and ecosystem functions exhibited by the whole community cannot be organised or adapted in a Darwinian sense. A long-standing open question thus persists: Are there alternative organising principles that enable us to understand and predict how the coevolution of the component species creates and maintains complex collective behaviours exhibited by the ecosystem as a whole? Results: Here we answer this question by incorporating principles from connectionist learning, a previously unrelated discipline already using well-developed theories on how emergent behaviours arise in simple networks. Specifically, we show conditions where natural selection on ecological interactions is functionally equivalent to a simple type of connectionist learning, 'unsupervised learning', well-known in neural-network models of cognitive systems to produce many non-trivial collective behaviours. Accordingly, we find that a community can self-organise in a well-defined and non-trivial sense without selection at the community level; its organisation can be conditioned by past experience in the same sense as connectionist learning models habituate to stimuli. This conditioning drives the community to form a distributed ecological memory of multiple past states, causing the community to: a) converge to these states from any random initial composition; b) accurately restore historical compositions from small fragments; c) recover a state composition following disturbance; and d) to correctly classify ambiguous initial compositions according to their similarity to learned compositions. We examine how the formation of alternative stable states alters the community's response to changing environmental forcing, and we identify conditions under which the ecosystem exhibits hysteresis with potential for catastrophic regime shifts. Conclusions: This work highlights the potential of connectionist theory to expand our understanding of evo-eco dynamics and collective ecological behaviours. Within this framework we find that, despite not being a Darwinian unit, ecological communities can behave like connectionist learning systems, creating internal conditions that habituate to past environmental conditions and actively recalling those conditions.

In this context, vocalizations can convey information about the presence of each group member and taking turns allow to minimize the vocal signal interferences. We consider agents equipped with a cognitive architecture based on two coupled control loops: a reactive one implementing a basic regulatory behavior to maintain vocal listening and an adaptive one learning an action policy to maximize vocal contact among group members. We show that the reactive process bootstraps the adaptive learning to converge toward a collective turn-taking strategy. This model provides a computational support to the hypothesis that turn-taking can emerge from functional constraints related to group cohesion and inter-individual vocal signal interferences.

One of the key limiting factors of a six-port receiver is its narrow dynamic range which is mainly limited by the use of square-law diode detectors in the primary detector circuit. In order to improve its dynamic range, this paper proposes to use logarithmic detectors for the detector stage of the six-port receiver. Such an approach helps in detecting signals over a wide dynamic range of 80 dB, thus making it almost comparable to that of the available heterodyne receivers. Additionally, the measured frequency error did not exceed ±51 MHz (3.5%) over the frequency range of 1 to 2 GHz using the equations for the power proportional voltages to estimate the phase angle and accordingly, the frequency, which can then be minimized using further digital post-processing. Also, since the basic operating principle of such a receiver was essentially based on square-law detector circuits so far, this paper also describes the new working principle that needs to be employed if using logarithmic detectors. © 2015 EuMA.","cognitive radio; dynamic range; logarithmic detector; Six-port","Detector circuits; Discriminators; Microwave devices; Microwave frequencies; Microwaves; Reconfigurable hardware; Technical writing; Dynamic range; Heterodyne receivers; Microwave frequency discriminators; Operating principles; Radio applications; Six-port; Square law detectors; Wide dynamic range; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84964330331

Reward learning involves burst firing of midbrain dopamine neurons in response to rewards and cues predictive of reward. The resulting release of dopamine in terminal regions is thought to act as a teaching signaling to areas such as the prefrontal cortex and striatum. In this review, we posit that a pool of extrasynaptic dopaminergic D1-like receptors activated in response to dopamine neuron burst firing serve to enable synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex in response to rewards and their cues. We propose that disruptions in these mechanisms following chronic cocaine use contribute to addiction pathology, in part due to the unique architecture of the mesocortical pathway. By blocking dopamine reuptake in the cortex, cocaine elevates dopamine signaling at these extrasynaptic receptors, prolonging D1-receptor activation and the subsequent activation of intracellular signaling cascades, and thus inducing long-lasting maladaptive plasticity.

They found that training anxious individuals to attend to non-threat stimuli reduces AB, which, in turn, improves anxiety. This effect supports the hypothesis that AB can causally impact on the maintenance of anxiety. At a fundamental level, however, uncertainty still abounds regarding the nature of the processes that underlie AB and its plasticity. According to one approach, the maintenance of AB is the result of the activation of a valence evaluation system. According to another approach, AB involves an impaired recruitment of top-down control. The main goal of the present theoretical paper is to put these two approaches, one against the other. Specifically, the article is structured around three major issues. First, we will debate the possibility that AB may also result from an impaired valence evaluation system. Then, we will discuss the hypothesis that the reduction of AB requires top-down executive control. Finally, we will explore the potential interactions between these two contrasting approaches in the onset and the maintenance of AB. We will also discuss the potential impact of these two approaches in the understanding of the other types of cognitive biases. © 2015, Editions NecPlus. All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-84958177848

Cognitive radio has emerged as a promising solution for efficient radio spectrum utilization. One of the most important techniques of CR is spectrum sensing, which provides the real-time occupancy of available frequency bands for secondary users. However, current CR frameworks require SU terminals to conduct spectrum sensing and upload their sensing results to a fusion center (FIC). This approach leads to many architectural challenges such as high design complexity, increase in hardware costs, inefficient resource usage, and high energy consumption. To address these challenges, we present a novel CR spectrum sensing framework by introducing a new functional entity called the spectrum agent (SA) to perform spectrum sensing tasks for SUs.

In our previous works, we leveraged the reconfigurability properties offered by the CR technology to implement Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks (CMNs) operating on the 2.4-GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. Urban-X, a new architecture for Multi-radio Cognitive Mesh Networks, self-configures and self-adapts to the dynamic interference conditions experienced on the Wi-Fi channels in dense urban environments. Urban-X estimates traffic load of existing users outside the mesh in each channel and utilizes less occupied channels opportunistically. In such dynamic environment, a transport layer protocol can suffer from variation in delay and available bandwidth due to spectrum sensing and mobility. Several TCP solutions for the CWMNs have been proposed but they could not be employed for implementation due to complexity and inefficiency. Instead, we adopt network function virtualization (NFV) technique which allows to instantiate virtualized network functions (VNFs) dynamically on demands. For this, we propose overall architecture of NFV framework for the CMNs and apply TCP accelerators (ACC) VNFs to improve TCP throughput as a case study.

The existing AB estimation techniques lack accuracy and add overhead. Accuracy of these AB estimation techniques could be enhanced by adopting some intelligent techniques. Intelligent software agents such as cognitive agent (CA) have significant potential to solve the challenges of estimating AB in MANETs. Intelligence is provided similar to the logical thinking like human for decision making in CA. The predominant CA architecture is belief desire intention model, which performs the task on behalf of human user as an assistant to him/her. In this paper, we propose CA-based available bandwidth estimation using collision probability, Idle period synchronization and random waiting time (BECIT) in MANETs. The proposed BECIT technique uses CA at each node to create mobile agents for collecting and distributing the statistics (such as idle period, packet loss, and AB, etc.) over the network. The collected network statistics are used by CA to estimate AB using our previous work distributed lagrange interpolation based AB estimation (DLI-ABE). The DLI-ABE comprises of statistical models for idle period synchronization by differentiating their states as BUSY, IDLE, and SENSE BUSY; collision probability using distributed Lagrange Interpolation polynomial; and random waiting time that consumes AB such as request-to-send, clear-to-send commands in IEEE 802.11 standard. Estimation of end-to-end AB on a multi-hop path uses each node AB. The simulation results show that BECIT performs approximately 30 % more accurate than the non-agent based AB estimation scheme.

Recently, Henshilwood and Dubreuil (Current Anthropology 52:361–400, 2011) have supported this stance by arguing that the use of beads and body painting implies the presence of properties typical of modern cognition: high-level theory of mind and awareness of abstract social standards. In this paper I shall disagree with this position. For the purposes of the argument, body ornaments are divided in three categories: aesthetic, indexical and fully-symbolic, on the basis of the necessary and sufficient conditions to construct meaning for each category. As previously acknowledged by a number of authors, I will argue that the abilities considered by Henshilwood & Dubreuil necessarily apply only to fully symbolic ornaments and they do not extend to the aesthetic and indexical categories. Indeed, a series of situated strategies can be sufficient to process non-symbolic categories of ornaments, through their phases of initiation, understanding and maintenance. Since these strategies could be implemented also by non-modern cognitive architectures, it is concluded that early body ornaments are currently unable to support cognitive equivalence between primitive and modern human populations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cognitive archaeology; Early body ornaments; Enactivism; Mindreading",,2-s2.0-84949085661

Industrial wireless technology, such as WirelessHART and ISA 100.11a, also operates in a frequency spectrum utilized by many other wireless technologies. With wireless applications rapidly growing, it is possible that multiple heterogeneous wireless systems would need to operate in overlapping spatiotemporal regions. Interference such as noise or other wireless devices affects connectivity and reduces communication link quality. This negatively affects reliability and latency, which are core requirements of industrial communication. Building wireless networks that are resistant to noise in industrial environments and coexisting with competing wireless devices in an increasingly crowded frequency spectrum is challenging. To meet these challenges, we need to consider the benefits that approaches finding success in other application areas can offer industrial communication. Cognitive radio (CR) methods offer a potential solution to improve resistance of IWSNs to interference. Integrating CR principles into the lower layers of IWSNs can enable devices to detect and avoid interference, and potentially opens the possibility of utilizing free radio spectrum for additional communication channels. This improves resistance to noise and increases redundancy in terms of channels per network node or adding additional nodes.

In accordance with the Knowledge and Appraisal Personality Architecture (KAPA) model (Cervone, 2004, 2005), we used idiographic methods for identifying consistent intra-individual patterns of associations between self-efficacy and perceived situational relevance of attributes, i.e., how personality characteristics are relevant to situations favouring vs. hindering a successful performance. Results showed that situation-related self-efficacy levels were higher when participants believed that their schematic personality attributes help rather than obstacle a successful performance in those situations. No covariation was found when self-efficacy appraisals were related to the situational relevance of aschematic personality attributes.

Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have explored the neural basis of the task-switching. However, no study to date has examined how individual differences in intrinsic functional architecture of the human brain are related to that of the task-switching. In the present study, we took 11 task-switching relevant areas from a meta-analysis study as the regions of interests (ROIs) and estimated their intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the whole brain. This procedure was repeated for 32 healthy adults based upon their fMRI scans during resting-state (rfMRI) to investigate the correlations between switching cost and the iFC strength across these participants. This analysis found that switch cost was negatively correlated with a set of iFC involved ROIs including left inferior frontal junction, bilateral superior posterior parietal cortex, left precuneus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, right middle frontal gyrus and bilateral middle occipital gyrus. These connectivity profiles represent an intrinsic functional architecture of taskswitching where the left inferior frontal junction plays a hub role in this brain-behavior association.

Wideband spectrum sensing (WS) improves the awareness of the surrounding radio environment by jointly monitoring multiple frequency bands. In this paper we propose a WS approach based on the observation of a frequency domain representation of the received signal and the adoption of model order selection (MOS) to identify the occupied frequency components. We provide a general formulation of the problem valid for any kind of spectral representation and then focus on the case in which discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is used. This choice is motivated by the fact that DFT blocks are available in many wireless systems, such as OFDM receivers and recently proposed software radio architectures. We provide analytical expressions for the maximum probability of correct selection of the occupied sub-bands valid for MOS approaches encompassed within the generalized information criterion (GIC). We then propose a method for designing the selection algorithm to balance overestimation and underestimation. Numerical results show that the MOS scheme derived for DFT can be successfully applied also when more accurate frequency representations, such as multitaper (MT) spectrum estimates, are adopted. © 2015 IEEE.","Cognitive radio; generalized information criterion; information theoretic criteria; misspecified statistical model; model order selection; wideband spectrum sensing","Cognitive systems; Discrete Fourier transforms; Electric frequency control; Frequency bands; Frequency domain analysis; Information theory; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Software radio; Generalized information criterion; Information theoretic criterion; Model-order selection; Statistical modeling; Wideband spectrum sensing; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84961620534

Interactions among these networks contribute to normal variations in cognitive functioning and to the aberrant affective profiles present in certain clinical conditions, such as major depression. Nevertheless, their links to non-clinical variations in affective functioning are still poorly understood. To address this issue, we used fMRI to measure the intrinsic functional interactions among these networks in a sample of predominantly younger women (N. = 162) from the Human Connectome Project. Consistent with the previously documented dichotomous motivational orientations (i.e., withdrawal versus approach) associated with sadness versus anger, we hypothesized that greater sadness would predict greater DMN (rather than DAN) functional dominance, whereas greater anger would predict the opposite. Overall, there was evidence of greater DAN (rather than DMN) functional dominance, but this pattern was modulated by current experience of specific negative emotions, as well as subclinical depressive and anxiety symptoms. Thus, greater levels of currently experienced sadness and subclinical depression independently predicted weaker DAN functional dominance (i.e., weaker DAN-FPC functional connectivity), likely reflecting reduced goal-directed attention towards the external perceptual environment. Complementarily, greater levels of currently experienced anger and subclinical anxiety predicted greater DAN functional dominance (i.e., greater DAN-FPC functional connectivity and, for anxiety only, also weaker DMN-FPC coupling). Our findings suggest that distinct affective states and subclinical mood symptoms have dissociable neural signatures, reflective of the symbiotic relationship between cognitive processes and emotional states. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Anger; Functional networks; Sadness","adult; anger; anxiety; Article; brain analysis; brain region; connectome; controlled study; default mode network; depression; dorsal attention network; emotion; emotion assessment; fear; female; frontoparietal control network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; hemispheric dominance; human; human experiment; negative emotion; priority journal; resting state network; sadness; subclinical depression; affect; brain; brain mapping; individuality; male; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; young adult; Adult; Affect; Anger; Anxiety; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Individuality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84941242402

The RTs and accuracy in both groups did not differ. An independent component analyses (ICA) revealed, however, that bilinguals used the left fronto-parietal network and the salience network more than monolinguals while processing go infrequent cues and no-go cues, respectively. It was noteworthy that the modulation of these networks had opposite correlates with performance in bilinguals and monolinguals, which suggests that between-group differences were more qualitative than quantitative.

However, a contemporary phenomenon is the development of Fair Trade consumer markets within the Global South itself: and the paper explores this as a contribution to the evolving geographies of ethical consumerism. Data was captured from secondary sources and field visits that included in-depth interviews and participant observation. Analysis is informed by theories of market creation developed in economic geography and economic sociology. As such we focus on understanding (1) the architecture, or networks and institutions, of commercialisation, governance and certification and (2) the marketing practices and strategies, designed to resonate with and develop cognitive association amongst consumers. Given the alternative geographies of South-South vis-à-vis South-North Fair Trade, we deepen the geographical focus by applying frameworks emerging from the concept of 'geographical entanglement'. Findings identify the similarities and differences of both Southern Fair Trade market creation and marketing compared to the European experience. In some cases, the place-based 'othering', often used to develop sympathetic cognitive frames in Northern marketing, is identified, but this time operates around alternative geographical binaries. In other cases, we highlight instances that avoid such divisive place-making, and which instead draw on inclusive, rather than divisive, imagined geographies, overlaid with the collective aspiration for development, pride and dignity. These findings therefore inform the nature of geographical entanglement followed by ethical market creation, as well as contributing to the wider theoretical understanding of moral geographies endogenous to the Global South. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fair Trade; Geographical entanglements; Global South; Mainstreaming; Marketing; Moral geographies","consumption behavior; economic geography; marketing; trade flow; trade relations; Europe",2-s2.0-84948384256

Control theory is critically important in this regard because it describes and models the dynamic systems that enable control to occur. Yet, the origins and principles of control theory in psychology are often misunderstood. This leads to a failure to capitalize on its strengths as a unifying, dynamic framework. We address this gap in knowledge by describing the early origins of control theory and its 2 main paths of development within psychology, as a ""man-machine system"" approach, and as a ""grand theory"" of psychology. We introduce the grand theory approach to control theory, pioneered by William T. Powers (1926-2013). Powers (1973) proposed that behavior is the control of perception and he introduced a closed-loop, hierarchical architecture to implement this principle. We propose that Powers' control theory provides a wholly new perspective on psychological science and is, as such, a third grand theory, after the behaviorist and cognitive theories. We describe a range of advances in neuroscience, animal behavior, social processes, and mental health, based on Powers' theory, to illustrate its potential to transform the nature of psychological research and practice. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Control theory; Research methodology; Self-regulation; Unified theory",,2-s2.0-84952906658

Brodmann's area 10 is located in the frontal lobe with known contributions in the execution of various higher order cognitive processes. However, recent cytoarchitectural studies of the FP in humans have shown that this portion of cortex contains two distinct cytoarchitectonic regions. Since architectonic differences are accompanied by differential connectivity and functions, the frontal pole qualifies as a candidate region for exploratory parcellation into functionally discrete sub-regions. We investigated whether this functional heterogeneity is reflected in distinct segregations within cytoarchitectonically defined FP-areas using meta-analytic co-activation based parcellation (CBP). The CBP method examined the co-activation patterns of all voxels within the FP as reported in functional neuroimaging studies archived in the BrainMap database. Voxels within the FP were subsequently clustered into sub-regions based on the similarity of their respective meta-analytically derived co-activation maps. Performing this CBP analysis on the FP via k-means clustering produced a distinct 3-cluster parcellation for each hemisphere corresponding to previously identified cytoarchitectural differences. Post-hoc functional characterization of clusters via BrainMap metadata revealed that lateral regions of the FP mapped to memory and emotion domains, while the dorso- and ventromedial clusters were associated broadly with emotion and social cognition processes. Furthermore, the dorsomedial regions contain an emphasis on theory of mind and affective related paradigms whereas ventromedial regions couple with reward tasks.

Interaction with the environment can provide a sparse and discrete set of sample correlations of input-output incidences. These incidences of associative data points can provide useful hints for capturing underlying mechanisms that govern the system's behavioral dynamics. In many approaches to solving this problem, of learning system's input-output relation, a set of previously prepared data points need to be presented to the learning mechanism, as a training data, before a useful estimations can be obtained. Besides data-coding is usually based on symbolic or nonimplicit representation schemes. In this paper, we propose an incremental learning mechanism that can bootstrap from a state of complete ignorance of any representative sample associations. Besides, the proposed system provides a novel mechanism for data representation in nonlinear manner through the fusion of self-organizing maps and Gaussian receptive fields. Our architecture is based solely on cortically-inspired techniques of coding and learning as: Hebbian plasticity and adaptive populations of neural circuitry for stimuli representation. We define a neural network that captures the problem's data space components using emergent arrangement of receptive field neurons that self-organize incrementally in response to sparse experiences of system-environment interactions. These learned components are correlated using a process of Hebbian plasticity that relates major components of input space to those of the output space.

Following a review of embodiment theory that ranges from the phenomenological to the cognitive, the discussion analyses the embodied experience of two digital cultural heritage installations (Pure Land: Inside the Mogao Grottoes and Pure Land: Augmented Reality Edition 2012) as a way of articulating the complexity of human experience inside immersive interactive visualization environments. While the antecedents of these works may be found in the great exhibition complexes of the nineteenth century, this new exhibition machinery provides fresh opportunities to explore paradigms for interpretation and representation of tangible heritage data that subvert didactic models and encourage integrated multisensory and open-ended exploration.

The discussion draws a transdisciplinary framework together from post-processural archaeology, philosophy, architecture, cybernetics, human-computer interface design, new media and its archaeology, and new museology. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","3D; Digital heritage; Dunhuang; Embodied cognition; Embodiment; Enactivism; Immersive; Interactive; Phenomenology; Post-processural archaeology",,2-s2.0-84982204071

We have investigated the relevant intrahemispheric cortico-cortical connections using in vivo DSI tractography combined with landmark-based registration, automatic cortical parcellation and whole-brain structural connection matrices in 20 right-handed male subjects. On the supratemporal plane, the pattern of connectivity was related to the architectonically defined early-stage auditory areas. It revealed a three-tier architecture characterized by a cascade of connections from the primary auditory cortex to six adjacent non-primary areas and from there to the superior temporal gyrus. Graph theory-driven analysis confirmed the cascade-like connectivity pattern and demonstrated a strong degree of segregation and hierarchy within early-stage auditory areas. Putative higher-order areas on the temporal and parietal convexities had more widely spread local connectivity and long-range connections with the prefrontal cortex; analysis of optimal community structure revealed five distinct modules in each hemisphere. The pattern of temporo-parieto-frontal connectivity was partially asymmetrical. In conclusion, the human early-stage auditory cortical connectivity, as revealed by in vivo DSI tractography, has strong similarities with that of non-human primates. The modular architecture and hemispheric asymmetry in higher-order regions is compatible with segregated processing streams and lateralization of cognitive functions. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Auditory areas; Cortical connectivity; Human; Lateralization; Parallel and hierarchical processing","adult; Article; auditory cortex; brain asymmetry; brain cortex; brain function; connectome; diffusion weighted imaging; frontal cortex; hemisphere; human; in vivo study; male; neuroimaging; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; parietal cortex; prefrontal cortex; primary auditory cortex; priority journal; right handedness; superior temporal gyrus; temporal cortex; anatomy and histology; auditory cortex; brain cortex; diffusion weighted imaging; image processing; nerve tract; white matter; young adult; Adult; Auditory Cortex; Cerebral Cortex; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Neural Pathways; White Matter; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84942328284

Studies of the hippocampus have been central to the study of memory in humans and in recent years, the regional specialization and organization of hippocampal functions have been elucidated in experimental models and in human neurological and psychiatric diseases. The hippocampus has long been considered a classic model for the study of neuroplasticity as many examples of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and -depression have been identified and demonstrated in hippocampal circuits. Neuroplasticity is the ability to adapt and reorganize the structure or function to internal or external stimuli and occurs at the cellular, population, network or behavioral level and is reflected in the cytological and network architecture as well as in intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons and circuits. The high degree of hippocampal neuroplasticity might, however, be also negatively reflected in the pronounced vulnerability of the hippocampus to deleterious conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, chronic stress, neurodegeneration and aging targeting hippocampal structure and function and leading to cognitive deficits. Considering this framework of plasticity and vulnerability, we here review basic principles of hippocampal anatomy and neuroplasticity on various levels as well as recent findings regarding the functional organization of the hippocampus in light of the regional vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, ischemia, epilepsy, neuroinflammation and aging. © 2015 IBRO.",,"AMPA receptor; amyloid beta protein; antineoplastic agent; calcium ion; glucocorticoid receptor; glutamate receptor; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor antibody; potassium channel complex antibody; prostaglandin; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; adaptation; aging; Alzheimer disease; amnesia; animal behavior; anxiety; B lymphocyte; brain damage; brain ischemia; calcium homeostasis; caloric restriction; cell function; cell proliferation; cognitive defect; cytokine production; degenerative disease; dentate gyrus; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease predisposition; Editorial; emotion; entorhinal cortex; excitatory postsynaptic potential; exercise; experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; fear; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampal CA3 region; hippocampus; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; immune response; learning; long term depression; long term potentiation; lymphocyte proliferation; membrane steady potential; memory consolidation; metabolic disorder; multiple sclerosis; natural killer cell; nerve cell membrane; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; nerve excitability; nerve sprouting; nervous system development; nervous system inflammation; neurofibrillary tangle; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; paraneoplastic neuropathy; pathophysiology; positive feedback; priority journal; protein function; pyramidal nerve cell; radiation injury; schizophrenia; seizure; sleep disorder; stress; synaptic transmission; T lymphocyte; temporal lobe epilepsy; aging; anatomy and histology; animal; brain disease; hippocampus; nerve cell plasticity; pathophysiology; physiology; Aging; Animals; Brain Diseases; Hippocampus; Humans; Neurogenesis; Neuronal Plasticity",2-s2.0-84945496849

However, recent evidence suggests greaterDMNactivity in an array of tasks, especially those that involve self-referential and memory-based processing. Although data that robustly demonstrate a comprehensive functional role for DMN remains relatively scarce, the global workspace framework, which implicates the DMN in global information integration for conscious processing, can potentially provide an explanation for the broad range of higher-order paradigms that report DMN involvement. We used graph theoretical measures to assess the contribution of the DMN to global functional connectivity dynamics in 22 healthy volunteers during an fMRI-based n-back working-memory paradigm with parametric increases in difficulty. Our predominant finding is that brain modularity decreases with greater task demands, thus adapting a more global workspace configuration, in direct relation to increases in reaction times to correct responses. Flexible default mode regions dynamically switch community memberships and display significant changes in their nodal participation coefficient and strength, which may reflect the observed whole-brain changes in functional connectivity architecture.

Recent studies show that disruption of this functionally efficient organisation is associated with several psychiatric disorders. However, despite increasing attention to this network property, whether age-associated changes in rich-club organisation occur during human adolescence remains unclear. Here, analysing a publicly shared diffusion tensor imaging dataset, we found that, during adolescence, brains of typically developing (TD) individuals showed increases in rich-club organisation and inferred network functionality, whereas individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) did not. These differences between TD and ASD groups were statistically significant for both structural and functional properties. Moreover, this typical age-related changes in rich-club organisation were characterised by progressive involvement of the right anterior insula. In contrast, in ASD individuals, did not show typical increases in grey matter volume, and this relative anatomical immaturity was correlated with the severity of ASD social symptoms. These results provide evidence that rich-club architecture is one of the bases of functionally efficient brain networks underpinning complex cognitive functions in adult human brains.

To explore connectivity during complex cognitive and motor tasks, this study focused on the relevance of small-worldness to human workloads using EEG signals from a dynamic analytic approach. Experiments were designed to investigate the small-worldness under two types of flight simulation tasks at two levels of difficulty - easy and hard. The results demonstrated a consistent small-world architecture of brain connectivity with time-based variance during complex tasks.

The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency.In order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.Our results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognition; Default-mode; FMRI; Hierarchies; Recursion","cognition; default mode network; dorsal region; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; information processing; rest; stimulus; theoretical model",2-s2.0-85001837247

Therefore energy management is the key component for efficient operation. Data analysis of operation data helps to better understand the systems and detect faults and inefficiencies. The facility manager benefits from smart analysis that makes use of machine learning algorithms and innovative visualizations. This analysis is part of a bigger review of the current structure of building automation as it is used in today's buildings. The operation targets in energy efficiency are complex, ambiguous and contradictory: indoor comfort, energy efficiency, high availability and low costs cannot be met at the same time. In order to improve building operation, a novel model of automation is discussed. The foundation of this model is in cognitive automation, since each building is unique in its selection of energy sources, architecture, usage and location, which implies that the building's control system has to be adapted individually.

Although considerable work has been done on modeling human language abilities, it has been difficult to bring them together to a comprehensive tabula rasa system compatible with current knowledge of how verbal information is processed in the brain. This work presents a cognitive system, entirely based on a large-scale neural architecture, which was developed to shed light on the procedural knowledge involved in language elaboration. The main component of this system is the central executive, which is a supervising system that coordinates the other components of the working memory. In our model, the central executive is a neural network that takes as input the neural activation states of the short-term memory and yields as output mental actions, which control the flow of information among the working memory components through neural gating mechanisms. The proposed system is capable of learning to communicate through natural language starting from tabula rasa, without any a priori knowledge of the structure of phrases, meaning of words, role of the different classes of words, only by interacting with a human through a text-based interface, using an open-ended incremental learning process. It is able to learn nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns and other word classes, and to use them in expressive language.

An SU pair and a PU radio pair are implemented using the Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) and the WARPLab software running in MATLAB. The PU is used to create five distinct radio-frequency environments utilizing narrow-band, wideband, and noncontiguous waveforms. The SU response to the PU created environments is measured.

These interdisciplinary research directions towards cognitive systems may be influenced by the models of the brain and/or rely on a new kind of physical implementation of a mathematical model of cognitive systems. This particular special issue on ""Cognitive and Natural Computing with Nanotechnology"" was directed to the broad nanomaterials, nanodevice, nanofabrics, nanocircuit, and nanoarchitecture research communities working specifically on novel nanotechnology-enabled directions. The special issue selected papers on innovative ideas for solutions to the principal challenge of realizing architectures that can enable decision-making, intelligent information and sensorial processing, and autonomous learning and adaptation. These systems may employ a variety of fundamental principles and do not necessarily need to emulate the biological or natural automata. Rather, their key distinguishing aspect is that their plasticity, reconfiguration, and functional underpinnings are achieved without involving software. In particular, such systems could 1) introduce new architectural concepts enabled by nanoscale capabilities, resembling the neocortex and natural systems; 2) leverage new materials and nanodevices and their interactions to achieve core cognitive functions; 3) design or build on novel nanofabrics enabling efficient implementation of cognitive computational approaches including achieving high degree of connectivity and collective functions. The ten papers ultimately selected articulate a vision for a cognitive computing direction beyond von Neumann microprocessors and/or present a technology component that contributes to this vision.

Sixty patients with AD and 60 matched healthy controls completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing perceived physical and mental health (Short-Form 36), mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and cognition (Cognitive Failures Questionnaire).

By characterizing the neuronal architecture in four animal models with intragenic, partial, and complete deletions of the WBS critical interval (ΔGtf2i , ΔGtf2i -/-, PD, and CD), we clarify the involvement of Gtf2i in neurocognitive features. All mutant mice showed hypersociability, impaired motor learning and coordination, and altered anxiety-like behavior. Dendritic length was decreased in the CA1 of ΔGtf2i , ΔGtf2i -/-, and CD mice.

However, there has not yet been a systematic attempt to determine what cognitive processes underlie this ability. Here we present three correlational studies assessing the extent to which performance on higher-order mentalising tasks relates to emotion recognition, self-reported empathy and self-inhibition. In Study 1a and 1b, examining emotion recognition and empathy, a relationship was identified between individual differences in the ability to mentalise and an emotion recognition task (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task), but no correlation was found with the empathy quotient, a self-report scale of empathy. Study 2 investigated whether a relationship exists between individual mentalising abilities and four different forms of self-inhibition: motor inhibition, executive inhibition, automatic imitation and temporal discounting. Results demonstrate that only temporal discounting performance relates to mentalising ability; suggesting that cognitive skills relevant to representation of the minds of others' are not influenced by the ability to perform more basic inhibition.

Despite the fact that BI effects do impact performance on everyday life activities, up to now it is still not clear whether the BI represents an amodal and material-independent process or whether it interacts with the task material. To address this issue, a group of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) characterized by specific difficulties in maintaining and processing visuo-spatial, but not verbal, information, and a mental age-and gender-matched group of typically developing (TD) children were subjected to three task-switching experiments requiring verbal or visuo-spatial material to be processed.

Remarkably, the specifics of sleep along the human lineage have been slow to emerge. This is surprising, given our unique mental and behavioral capacity and the importance of sleep for individual cognitive performance. One view is that our species' sleep architecture is in accord with patterns documented in other mammals. We promote an alternative view, that human sleep is highly derived relative to that of other primates. Based on new and existing evidence, we specifically propose that humans are more efficient in their sleep patterns than are other primates, and that human sleep is shorter, deeper, and exhibits a higher proportion of REM than expected. Thus, we propose the sleep intensity hypothesis: Early humans experienced selective pressure to fulfill sleep needs in the shortest time possible. Several factors likely served as selective pressures for more efficient sleep, including increased predation risk in terrestrial environments, threats from intergroup conflict, and benefits arising from increased social interaction. Less sleep would enable longer active periods in which to acquire and transmit new skills and knowledge, while deeper sleep may be critical for the consolidation of those skills, leading to enhanced cognitive abilities in early humans. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Allometry; Comparative study; Evolutionary mismatch; Human evolution; Human uniqueness","cognition; evolution; genetic selection; human; sleep; Biological Evolution; Cognition; Humans; Selection, Genetic; Sleep",2-s2.0-84949789430

Methods Twelve patients with PMG and 12 matched controls were prospectively evaluated with DTI (32 gradient encoding directions, b-value = 1000 s/mm2) at 3.0 T. The AF was virtually dissected with a deterministic streamline approach. DTI metrics included FA (fractional anisotropy), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). A subset of patients (n = 4) was evaluated to assess cognitive performance and language skills. Results Qualitative evaluation revealed several abnormalities in tracts size and architecture in nearly all PMG patients. Remarkably, in 3 patients with bilateral PMG, the AF was not delineated on both hemispheres. In comparison to controls, patients exhibited significant decrease of FA (p = 0.003) in addition to increase of RD (p = 0.03) in the right AF, whereas there was significant increase of MD in the left AF (p = 0.04). All 4 patients with language evaluation had suboptimal performance on lexical fluency and prosodic linguistic. Conclusions DTI and tractography suggest that the AF is severely disrupted in patients with PMG, providing an anatomical in vivo substrate for the language disorders commonly associated with these cortical malformations. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Practice, sleep, practice. With enough practice - and sleep - we adopt new strategies that eventually become automatic, and subsequently require only the refinement of the existing skill to become an ""expert"". It is not known whether sleep is involved in the mastery and refinement of new skills that lead to expertise, nor is it known whether this may be primarily dependent on rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM stage 2 (NREM2) or slow wave sleep (SWS). Here, we employed behavioural and scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) techniques to investigate the post-learning changes in the architecture (e.g., REM, NREM2 and SWS duration) and the electrophysiological features (e.g., rapid eye movements, sleep spindles and slow wave activity) that characterize these sleep states as individuals progress from night to night, from ""Novice"" to ""Experts"" on a cognitive procedural task (e.g., the Tower of Hanoi task). Here, we demonstrate that speed of movements improves over the course of training irrespective of whether sleep or wake intervenes training sessions, whereas accuracy improves gradually, but only significantly over a night of sleep immediately prior to mastery of the task. On the night that subjects are first exposed to the task, the density of fast spindles increased significantly during both NREM2 and SWS accompanied by increased NREM2 sigma power and SWS delta power, whereas, on the night that subjects become experts on the task, they show increased REM sleep duration and spindles became larger in terms of amplitude and duration during SWS. Re-exposure to the task one-week after it had already been mastered resulted in increased NREM sleep duration, and again, increased spindle density of fast spindles during SWS and NREM2 and increased NREM2 sigma power and SWS delta power. Importantly, increased spindle density was correlated with overnight improvement in speed and accuracy. Taken together, these results help to elucidate how REM and NREM sleep are uniquely involved in memory consolidation over the course of the mastery of a new cognitively complex skill, and help to resolve controversies regarding sequential nature of memory processing during sleep in humans, for which consistent evidence is currently lacking. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Expertise; Memory; Procedural; Rapid eye movements; Skill learning; Sleep; Spindles","accuracy; adult; Article; controlled study; correlational study; delta rhythm; electroencephalography; fast spindle; female; human; human experiment; learning; male; memory consolidation; motor performance; nonREM sleep; normal human; polysomnography; psychomotor performance; REM sleep; sleep; sleep spindle; sleep time; slow brain wave; slow wave sleep; task performance; young adult; aptitude; brain; physiology; sleep; sleep stage; Adult; Aptitude; Brain; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Polysomnography; Practice (Psychology); Sleep; Sleep Stages; Sleep, REM; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84945304247

Recently, a population-specific serotonin 2B (5-HT 2B) receptor stop codon (ie, HTR2B Q20∗) was reported to segregate with severely impulsive individuals, whereas 5-HT 2B mutant (Htr 2B -/-) mice also showed high impulsivity. Interestingly, in the same cohort, early-onset schizophrenia was more prevalent in HTR2B Q∗20 carriers. However, the putative role of 5-HT 2B receptor in the neurobiology of schizophrenia has never been investigated. We assessed the effects of the genetic and the pharmacological ablation of 5-HT 2B receptors in mice subjected to a comprehensive series of behavioral test screenings for schizophrenic-like symptoms and investigated relevant dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurochemical alterations in the cortex and the striatum. Domains related to the positive, negative, and cognitive symptom clusters of schizophrenia were affected in Htr 2B -/- mice, as shown by deficits in sensorimotor gating, in selective attention, in social interactions, and in learning and memory processes. In addition, Htr 2B -/- mice presented with enhanced locomotor response to the psychostimulants dizocilpine and amphetamine, and with robust alterations in sleep architecture. Moreover, ablation of 5-HT 2B receptors induced a region-selective decrease of dopamine and glutamate concentrations in the dorsal striatum. Importantly, selected schizophrenic-like phenotypes and endophenotypes were rescued by chronic haloperidol treatment. We report herein that 5-HT 2B receptor deficiency confers a wide spectrum of antipsychotic-sensitive schizophrenic-like behavioral and psychopharmacological phenotypes in mice and provide first evidence for a role of 5-HT 2B receptors in the neurobiology of psychotic disorders. © 2015 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.",,"amphetamine; dizocilpine; dopamine; glutamic acid; haloperidol; serotonin 2B receptor; amphetamine; dizocilpine maleate; neuroleptic agent; serotonin 2B receptor; amnesia; animal experiment; animal model; Article; attention deficit disorder; controlled study; dopaminergic activity; endophenotype; latent inhibition; learning; locomotion; male; memory; mouse; neurobiology; nonhuman; priority journal; psychosocial withdrawal; receptor gene; schizophrenia; selective attention; sensory gating; sleep; social interaction; startle reflex; animal; association; cohort analysis; conditioning; deficiency; disease model; drug effects; fear; genetics; inhibition (psychology); motor activity; recognition; schizophrenia; social behavior; transgenic mouse; wakefulness; Amphetamine; Animals; Antipsychotic Agents; Cohort Studies; Conditioning (Psychology); Cues; Disease Models, Animal; Dizocilpine Maleate; Fear; Inhibition (Psychology); Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Motor Activity; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2B; Recognition (Psychology); Schizophrenia; Sensory Gating; Social Behavior; Wakefulness",2-s2.0-84944351848

This study investigates whether complex network-derived features in resting state EEG (rsEEG) could be applied as a biomarker to distinguish amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from normal cognitive function in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Method: In this study, EEG was recorded in 28 patients with T2D (16 aMCI patients and 12 controls) during a no-task eyes-closed resting state. Pair-wise synchronization of rsEEG signals were assessed in six frequency bands (delta, theta, lower alpha, upper alpha, beta, and gamma) using phase lag index (PLI) and grouped into long distance (intra- and inter-hemispheric) and short distance interactions. PLI-weighted connectivity networks were also constructed, and characterized by mean clustering coefficient and path length. The correlation of these features and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores was assessed. Results: Main findings of this study were as follows: (1) In comparison with controls, patients with aMCI had a significant decrease of global mean PLI in lower alpha, upper alpha, and beta bands. Lower functional connection at short and long intra-hemispheric distance mainly appeared on the left hemisphere. (2) In the lower alpha band, clustering coefficient was significantly lower in aMCI group, and the path length significantly increased. (3) Cognitive status measured by MoCA had a significant positive correlation with cluster coefficient and negative correlation with path length in lower alpha band. Conclusions: The brain network of aMCI patients displayed a disconnection syndrome and a loss of small-world architecture. The correlation between cognitive states and network characteristics suggested that the more in deterioration of the diabetes patients' cognitive state, the less optimal the network organization become. Hence, the complex network-derived biomarkers based on EEG could be employed to track cognitive function of diabetic patients and provide a new diagnosis tool for aMCI. © 2015 Zeng, Wang, Ouyang, Bian, Wang and Li.","Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI); Diabetes; Graph analysis; Phase lag index (PLI); Resting state electroencephalography (rsEEG)","Biomarkers; Brain; Diagnosis; Distributed computer systems; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Frequency bands; Medical problems; Clustering coefficient; Functional connection; Graph analysis; Mild cognitive impairments; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Network characteristics; Phase lags; Resting state; Complex networks; aged; alpha rhythm; Article; beta rhythm; clinical article; comparative study; connectome; controlled study; delta rhythm; diabetic patient; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography phase synchronization; female; functional connectivity; gamma rhythm; high risk population; human; long intrahemispheric distance; lower alpha rhythm; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; nervous system parameters; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phase lag index; resting state electroencephalogram; resting state network; short intrahemispheric distance; theta rhythm; upper alpha rhythm",2-s2.0-84948762938

Two kinds of probabilistic generative schemes have been proposed in cognitive science and robotics that link to a “theory theory” and “simulation theory” of mindreading, respectively. The former compares perceived actions to optimal plans derived from rationality principles and conceptual theories of others’ minds. The latter reuses one’s own internal (inverse and forward) models for action execution to perform a look-ahead mental simulation of perceived actions. Both theories, however, leave one question unanswered: how are the generative models – including task structure and parameters – learned in the first place? We start from Dennett’s “intentional stance” proposal and characterize it within generative theories of action and intention recognition. We propose that humans use an intentional stance as a learning bias that sidesteps the (hard) structure learning problem and bootstraps the acquisition of generative models for others’ actions. The intentional stance corresponds to a candidate structure in the generative scheme, which encodes a simplified belief-desire folk psychology and a hierarchical intention-to-action organization of behavior. This simple structure can be used as a proxy for the “true” generative structure of others’ actions and intentions and is continuously grown and refined – via state and parameter learning – during interactions. In turn – as our computational simulations show – this can help solve mindreading problems and bootstrap the acquisition of useful causal models of both one’s own and others’ goal-directed actions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Generative model; Intentional stance; Mindreading; Online learning; Structure learning","Cognitive systems; Inverse problems; Generative model; Intentional stance; Mindreading; Online learning; Structure-learning; Computation theory; algorithm; behavior; computer simulation; human; learning; physiology; psychological model; recognition; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Humans; Intention; Learning; Models, Psychological; Recognition (Psychology)",2-s2.0-84942105511

However, the biological mechanisms underpinning the different symptom clusters remain undefined. The rs1344706 single nucleotide polymorphism within ZNF804A was among the first genetic variants found to be associated with schizophrenia. Previously, neuroimaging and cognitive studies have revealed several associations between rs1344706 and brain structure and function. The aim of this study is to use a recall-by-genotype (RBG) design to investigate the biological basis for the association of ZNF804A variants with schizophrenia. A RBG study, implemented in a population cohort, will be used to evaluate the impact of genetic variation at rs1344706 on sleep neurophysiology and procedural memory consolidation in healthy participants. Methods/Design: Participants will be recruited from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) on the basis of genotype at rs1344706 (n = 24). Each participant will be asked to take part in two nights of in-depth sleep monitoring (polysomnography) allowing collection of neurophysiological sleep data in a manner not amenable to large-scale study. Sleep questionnaires will be used to assess general sleep quality and subjective sleep experience after each in-house recording. A motor sequencing task (MST) will be performed before and after the second night of polysomnography. In order to gather additional data about habitual sleep behaviour participants will be asked to wear a wrist worn activity monitor (actiwatch) and complete a sleep diary for two weeks. Discussion: This study will explore the biological function of ZNF804A genotype (rs1344706) in healthy volunteers by examining detailed features of sleep architecture and physiology in relation to motor learning. Using a RBG approach will enable us to collect precise and detailed phenotypic data whilst achieving an informative biological gradient.

Current theories are based on two tenets: (a) information is transmitted by action potentials, the language by which neurons communicate with each other—and (b) homogeneous neuronal assemblies of cortical circuits operate on these neuronal messages where the operations are characterized by the intrinsic connectivity among neuronal populations. In this view, the size and time course of any spike is stereotypic and the information is restricted to the temporal sequence of the spikes; namely, the “neural code”. However, an increasing amount of novel data point towards an alternative hypothesis: (a) the role of neural code in information processing is overemphasized. Instead of simply passing messages, action potentials play a role in dynamic coordination at multiple spatial and temporal scales, establishing network interactions across several levels of a hierarchical modular architecture, modulating and regulating the propagation of neuronal messages. (b) Information is processed at all levels of neuronal infrastructure from macromolecules to population dynamics. For example, intra-neuronal (changes in protein conformation, concentration and synthesis) and extra-neuronal factors (extracellular proteolysis, substrate patterning, myelin plasticity, microbes, metabolic status) can have a profound effect on neuronal computations. This means molecular message passing may have cognitive connotations. This essay introduces the concept of “supramolecular chemistry”, involving the storage of information at the molecular level and its retrieval, transfer and processing at the supramolecular level, through transitory non-covalent molecular processes that are self-organized, self-assembled and dynamic. Finally, we note that the cortex comprises extremely heterogeneous cells, with distinct regional variations, macromolecular assembly, receptor repertoire and intrinsic microcircuitry. This suggests that every neuron (or group of neurons) embodies different molecular information that hands an operational effect on neuronal computation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Action potential; Embodiment; Information; Macromolecule; Neural code; Processing; Supramolecular","action potential; brain cortex; central nervous system function; cognition; conformational transition; connectome; emotion; gene mutation; human; intestine flora; learning; macromolecule; nerve cell; nerve cell plasticity; neuromodulation; neurotransmission; nonhuman; protein conformation; protein degradation; protein synthesis; Review; signal transduction; spike",2-s2.0-84941992807

Its neural processes are seldom simultaneous but occur according to precise spatiotemporal choreographies, manifested by the coordination of their oscillations within and between brains. Methods with good temporal resolution can help to identify so-called “neuromarkers” of social function and aid in disentangling the dynamical architecture of social brains. In our ongoing research, we have used dual-electroencephalography (EEG) to study neuromarker dynamics during synchronic interactions in which pairs of subjects coordinate behavior spontaneously and intentionally (social coordination) and during diachronic transactions that require subjects to perceive or behave in turn (action observation, delayed imitation). In this paper, after outlining our dynamical approach to the neurophysiological basis of social behavior, we examine commonalities and differences in the neuromarkers that are recruited for both kinds of tasks. We find the neuromarker landscape to be task-specific: synchronic paradigms of social coordination reveal medial mu, alpha and the phi complex as contributing neuromarkers. Diachronic tasks recruit alpha as well, in addition to lateral mu rhythms and the newly discovered nu and kappa rhythms whose functional significance is still unclear. Social coordination, observation, and delayed imitation share commonality of context: in each of our experiments, subjects exchanged information through visual perception and moved in similar ways. Nonetheless, there was little overlap between their neuromarkers, a result that hints strongly of task-specific neural mechanisms for social behavior. The only neuromarker that transcended both synchronic and diachronic social behaviors was the ubiquitous alpha rhythm, which appears to be a key signature of visually-mediated social behaviors. The present paper is both an entry point and a challenge: much work remains to determine the nature and scope of recruitment of other neuromarkers, and to create theoretical models of their within- and between-brain dynamics during social interaction. © 2015 Tognoli and Kelso.","Alpha; Brain rhythms; Complexity; Coordination dynamics; Mu; Phi complex; Social coordination","alpha rhythm; Article; brain function; coordination; diachronic social behavior; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; frequency modulation; human; kappa rhythm; movement perception; mu rhythm; nu rhythm; oscillation; phi rhythm; social behavior; social interaction; synchronic social behavior; task performance; visual discrimination",2-s2.0-84947609141

Here, I present an alternative inspired by a classical computing method with quantum power. This method relies on special distributed representations called hyperstrings. Hyperstrings are superpositions of up to an exponential number of strings, which—by a single-processor classical computer—can be evaluated in a transparallel fashion, that is, simultaneously as if only one string were concerned. Building on a neurally plausible model of human visual perceptual organization, in which hyperstrings are formal counterparts of transient neural assemblies, I postulate that synchronization in such assemblies is a manifestation of transparallel information processing. This accounts for the high combinatorial capacity and speed of human visual perceptual organization and strengthens ideas that self-organizing cognitive architecture bridges the gap between neurons and consciousness. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cognitive architecture; Distributed representations; Neuronal synchronization; Quantum computing; Transparallel computing by hyperstrings; Visual perceptual organization","Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Synchronization; Cognitive architectures; Distributed representation; Neuronal synchronization; Perceptual organization; Quantum Computing; Transparallel computing by hyperstrings; Neurons",2-s2.0-84941418630

In this paper, we discover that a high-quality visual saliency model can be learned from multiscale features extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have had many successes in visual recognition tasks. For learning such saliency models, we introduce a neural network architecture, which has fully connected layers on top of CNNs responsible for feature extraction at three different scales. We then propose a refinement method to enhance the spatial coherence of our saliency results. Finally, aggregating multiple saliency maps computed for different levels of image segmentation can further boost the performance, yielding saliency maps better than those generated from a single segmentation. To promote further research and evaluation of visual saliency models, we also construct a new large database of 4447 challenging images and their pixelwise saliency annotations.

However, functional connectivity can also depend on the individual’s mental state. In the present study, we examined the relative contribution of state and trait components in shaping an individual’s functional architecture. We used fMRI data from a large, population-based human sample (N=587, age 18–88 years), as part of the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN), which were collected in three mental states: resting, performing a sensorimotor task, and watching a movie. Whereas previous studies have shown commonalities across mental states in the average functional connectivity across individuals, we focused on the effects of states on the pattern of individual differences in functional connectivity. We found that state effects were as important as trait effects in shaping individual functional connectivity patterns, each explaining an approximately equal amount of variance. This was true when we looked at aging, as one specific dimension of individual differences, as well as when we looked at generic aspects of individual variation. These results show that individual differences in functional connectivity consist of state-dependent aspects, as well as more stable, trait-like characteristics. Studying individual differences in functional connectivity across a wider range of mental states will therefore provide a more complete picture of the mechanisms underlying factors such as cognitive ability, aging, and disease. © 2015 the authors.","Aging; Brain connectivity; fMRI; Network; Resting state","adult; age; aged; Article; behavior; brain function; cognition; connectome; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; genetic trait; human; male; mental health; middle aged; nerve cell network; priority journal; resting state network; sensorimotor function; spike wave; very elderly; young adult; adolescent; aging; blood; brain; brain mapping; image processing; individuality; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; rest; vascularization; oxygen; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Individuality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Oxygen; Rest; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84944595769

In this work, we demonstrate the ability of the Escherichia coli protein toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) to counteract epileptiform phenomena in inbred DBA/2J mice, an animal model displaying genetic background with an high susceptibility to induced- and spontaneous seizures. Via modulation of the Rho GTPases, CNF1 regulates actin dynamics with a consequent increase in spine density and length in pyramidal neurons of rat visual cortex, and influences the mitochondrial homeostasis with remarkable changes in the mitochondrial network architecture. In addition, CNF1 improves cognitive performances and increases ATP brain content in mouse models of Rett syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. The results herein reported show that a single dose of CNF1 induces a remarkable amelioration of the seizure phenotype, with a significant augmentation in neuroplasticity markers and in cortex mitochondrial ATP content. This latter effect is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins, suggesting a role of mitochondrial dynamics in the CNF1-induced beneficial effects on this epileptiform phenotype. Our results strongly support the crucial role of brain energy homeostasis in the pathogenesis of certain neurological diseases, and suggest that CNF1 could represent a putative new therapeutic tool for epilepsy. © 2015 Travaglione et al.

Large-scale network studies based on neuroimaging techniques may provide additional insight into AD pathophysiology. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impaired network functional connectivity with the disease progression. For this purpose, we explored altered functional connectivities based on previously well-defined brain areas that comprise the five key functional systems [the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), control network (CON), salience network (SAL), sensorimotor network (SMN)] in 35 with AD and 27 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, compared with 27 normal cognitive subjects. Based on three levels of analysis, we found that intra-and inter-network connectivity were impaired in AD. Importantly, the interaction between the sensorimotor and attention functions was first attacked at the MCI stage and then extended to the key functional systems in the AD individuals. Lower cognitive ability (lower MMSE scores) was significantly associated with greater reductions in intra-and inter-network connectivity across all patient groups. These profiles indicate that aberrant intra-and inter-network dysfunctions might be potential biomarkers or predictors of AD progression and provide new insight into AD pathophysiology.",,"aged; Alzheimer disease; brain; case control study; cognitive defect; female; human; male; middle aged; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Net",2-s2.0-84943327613

Modular architectures can vary both with respect to the strength of the notion of modularity and the scope of the modularity of mind. We propose a dilemma for these modularity approaches, no matter how they vary along these two dimensions. First, if a modular architecture commits to the informational encapsulation of modules, as it is the case for modularity theories of perception, then modules are on this account impenetrable. However, we argue that there are genuine cases of the cognitive penetrability of perception and that these cases challenge any strong, encapsulated modular architecture of perception. Second, many recent massive modularity theories weaken the strength of the notion of module, while broadening the scope of modularity. These theories do not require any robust informational encapsulation, and thus avoid the incompatibility with cognitive penetrability. However, the weakened commitment to informational encapsulation greatly weakens the explanatory force of the approach and, ultimately, is conceptually at odds with the core of modularity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cognitive architecture; Cognitive penetrability; Dissociation; Informational encapsulation; Modularity",,2-s2.0-84940658594

We propose here a method for cellular resource planning taking into account user mobility. Since users move, the bandwidth resource should also move accordingly. We design a score based method using TV Whitespace, and user experience, to determine from which cell it should be removed and to which one it should be added. Combined with traffic history it calculates scores for each cell. Bandwidth is reallocated on a half day basis. Before that, real traces of cellular networks in urban districts are presented which confirm that static network planning is no longer optimal. A dynamic femtocell architecture is then presented. It is based on mesh interconnected elements and designed to serve the score based bandwidth allocation algorithm. The score method along with the architecture are simulated and results are presented.

In general, it was shown that the theoretical discourse of language teaching favoured a 'communicating-to-learn' approach in the matter (e.g., task-based learning), whereas the practitioner 'world' leaned more towards a 'learning-to-communicate' approach (e.g., Presentation-Practice-Production). The purpose of this paper is to build on these findings by attempting to determine to what extent either of these pedagogic stances can be justified. In doing so, recent research and theorising on the workings of memory in relation to the learning of factual information is reviewed. On the basis of the characteristics of cognitive architecture that this literature describes, it is taken to indicate that i), long-term memorisation of knowledge is the key to skilled performance, and ii), guided or 'direct' instruction is superior to problem-solving or discovery-oriented forms of pedagogy in facilitating the long-term learning of factual information. Following this, the implications of these findings for language teaching pedagogy are discussed.

This type of intelligent computing poses a set of constraints, including real-Time operation, low-power consumption and scalability, which require a radical departure from conventional system design. Brain-inspired architectures offer tremendous promise in this area. To this end, we developed TrueNorth, a 65 mW real-Time neurosynaptic processor that implements a non-von Neumann, low-power, highly-parallel, scalable, and defect-Tolerant architecture. With 4096 neurosynaptic cores, the TrueNorth chip contains 1 million digital neurons and 256 million synapses tightly interconnected by an event-driven routing infrastructure. The fully digital 5.4 billion transistor implementation leverages existing CMOS scaling trends, while ensuring one-To-one correspondence between hardware and software. With such aggressive design metrics and the TrueNorth architecture breaking path with prevailing architectures, it is clear that conventional computer-Aided design (CAD) tools could not be used for the design. As a result, we developed a novel design methodology that includes mixed asynchronous-synchronous circuits and a complete tool flow for building an event-driven, low-power neurosynaptic chip. The TrueNorth chip is fully configurable in terms of connectivity and neural parameters to allow custom configurations for a wide range of cognitive and sensory perception applications. To reduce the system's communication energy, we have adapted existing application-Agnostic very large-scale integration CAD placement tools for mapping logical neural networks to the physical neurosynaptic core locations on the TrueNorth chips. With that, we have successfully demonstrated the use of TrueNorth-based systems in multiple applications, including visual object recognition, with higher performance and orders of magnitude lower power consumption than the same algorithms run on von Neumann architectures. The TrueNorth chip and its tool flow serve as building blocks for future cognitive systems, and give designers an opportunity to develop novel brain-inspired architectures and systems based on the knowledge obtained from this paper. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",,"Asynchronous sequential logic; Brain; Cognitive systems; Computer architecture; Design; Electric power utilization; Integrated circuit design; Intelligent computing; Low power electronics; Network architecture; Neural networks; Object recognition; Sensory perception; Conventional computers; Defect-tolerant architectures; Hardware and software; Lower-power consumption; Multiple applications; Novel design methodology; Routing infrastructure; Visual object recognition; Computer aided design",2-s2.0-84942421799

However, it is still largely unknown how the functional brain network organizes to enable fast and effortless reading processing in the native language (L1) but not in a non-proficient second language (L2), and whether the mechanisms underlying local activity are associated with connectivity dynamics in large-scale brain networks. In the present study, we combined activation-based and multivariate graph-theory analysis with functional magnetic resonance imaging data to address these questions. Chinese-English unbalanced bilinguals read narratives for comprehension in Chinese (L1) and in English (L2). Compared with L2, reading in L1 evoked greater brain activation and recruited a more globally efficient but less clustered network organization. Regions with both increased network efficiency and enhanced brain activation in L1 reading were mostly located in the fronto-temporal reading-related network (RN), whereas regions with decreased global network efficiency, increased clustering, and more deactivation in L2 reading were identified in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, functional network efficiency was closely associated with local brain activation, and such associations were also modulated by reading efficiency in the two languages. Our results demonstrate that an economical and integrative brain network topology is associated with efficient reading, and further reveal a dynamic association between network efficiency and local activation for both RN and DMN.

The human brain tends to be a more regular and efficient neural architecture in the late stage of information processing. In addition, the processing of conflict information needs stronger information integration and transfer between cortical areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Complex network analysis; EEG; Mild cognitive impairment; Phase synchronization; Small-world network; Time-evolution","aged; alpha rhythm; Article; beta rhythm; brain region; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; electroencephalography; female; human; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; nerve cell network; selective attention; task performance; analysis of variance; attention; brain; brain mapping; decision making; electroencephalography; evoked response; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell network; pathology; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; randomized controlled trial; time factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Brain; Brain Mapping; Choice Behavior; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Nerve Net; Photic Stimulation; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84945469046

Task-based results exhibiting similar activation patterns were grouped as similar, while tasks activating different brain networks were classified as functionally distinct. We identified four sub-classes of face tasks: (1) Visuospatial Attention and Visuomotor Coordination to Faces, (2) Perception and Recognition of Faces, (3) Social Processing and Episodic Recall of Faces, and (4) Face Naming and Lexical Retrieval. Interpretation of these sub-classes supports an extension of a well-known model of face perception to include a core system for visual analysis and extended systems for personal information, emotion, and salience processing.

However, few studies have localized the neural structures that differentiate high and low WMC individuals, considering the functional architecture of the prefrontal cortex. The present study aimed to identify a frontal region that underlies individual differences from the perspective of the hierarchical architecture of the frontal cortex. By manipulating an episodic factor of cognitive control (control in selecting an appropriate task set according to a temporal context) and using a parametric modulation analysis, we found that both high- and low- WMC individuals have similar activation patterns in the premotor cortex (BA6, 8), caudal prefrontal cortex (BA44, 45), and frontopolar cortex (BA10, 11), but differed in the rostral part of the prefrontal cortex (BA46/47); high WMC individuals showed greater activation in the higher episodic control condition, whereas low WMC individuals showed reduced activation when episodic control was required. Similar patterns of activation were found in the right inferior parietal and middle/inferior temporal cortices. These results indicate that the rostral prefrontal cortex, which supports episodic cognitive control, possibly by sending a weighting signal toward the inferior parietal and middle/inferior temporal cortices that modulate saliency and sensory processing, underlies individual differences in WMC. Episodic control account, which considers the organization of the prefrontal cortex, fits well with previous findings of individual differences in WMC. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Executive function; Hierarchical model; Individual differences; Prefrontal cortex; Working memory capacity","adult; Article; caudate nucleus; cerebellum; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; executive function; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; human experiment; inferior parietal cortex; inferior temporal cortex; insula; male; middle frontal gyrus; normal human; precuneus; premotor cortex; response time; thalamus; working memory; young adult; biological model; brain mapping; cognition; executive function; individuality; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; photostimulation; physiology; prefrontal cortex; psychomotor performance; reading; short term memory; temporal lobe; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Individuality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Models, Neurological; Neuroimaging; Parietal Lobe; Photic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Psychomotor Performance; Reading; Temporal Lobe; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84940208725

Our goal was to describe the nocturnal sleep architecture and respiratory events associated, like apnea and oxygen saturation in newborn less than 3 months postnatal life. Material and method: 30 newborn ≤ 37 gestation weeks, post-conceptional age ≤ 3 months, not hospitalized, were selected. Through 8 hours nocturnal sleep polisomnographic study they were rated. Results: The gestation weeks median was 34 ± 1.5, the age was 43.5 ± 25.5 at the time of study. The quiet sleep total time was greater than the active sleep total time (Wilcoxon p = 0.411). The central apnea index in active sleep total time (76.2 ± 53.4) was greater than quiet sleep total time (33.6 ± 31.7) Wilcoxon p = 0.026. SaO2 average median was 93.5%. The 27% of sleep total time we registered intermittent hypoxemia. Conclusions: The presence of intermittent hypoxemia in preterm newborn is a risk condition to cognitive and physical development.

In the current design of TV white space spectrum databases, a propagation model is utilized to determine the spectrum availability. However, this propagation model has poor accuracy for radio environment estimation because it requires a large interference margin for the PU coverage area to ensure protection of primary users (PUs); thus, it decreases the spectrum sharing efficiency. The proposed spectrum database consists of radio environment measurement results from sensors on mobile terminals such as vehicles and smart phones. In the proposed database, actual measurements of radio signals are used to estimate radio information regarding PUs. Because the sensors on mobile terminals can gather a large amount of data, accurate propagation information can be obtained, including information regarding propagation loss and shadowing. In this paper, we first introduce the architecture of the proposed spectrum database. Then, we present experimental results for the database construction using actual TV broadcast signals. Additionally, from the evaluation results, we discuss the extent to which the proposed database can mitigate the excess interference margin.

While it is known that arsenic toxicity has a profound effect on the epigenetic landscape, very few studies have investigated its effects on chromatin architecture in the brain. We have previously demonstrated that exposure to a low level of arsenic (50. ppb) during all three trimesters of fetal/neonatal development induces deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), depressive-like symptoms, and alterations in gene expression in the adult mouse brain. As epigenetic processes control these outcomes, here we assess the impact of our developmental arsenic exposure (DAE) paradigm on global histone posttranslational modifications and associated chromatin-modifying proteins in the dentate gyrus and frontal cortex (FC) of adult male and female mice. DAE influenced histone 3. K4 trimethylation with increased levels in the male DG and FC and decreased levels in the female DG (no change in female FC). The histone methyltransferase MLL exhibited a similar sex- and region-specific expression profile as H3K4me3 levels, while histone demethylase KDM5B expression trended in the opposite direction. DAE increased histone 3. K9 acetylation levels in the male DG along with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) expression of GCN5 and decreased H3K9ac levels in the male FC along with decreased HAT expression of GCN5 and PCAF. DAE decreased expression of histone deacetylase enzymes HDAC1 and HDAC2, which were concurrent with increased H3K9ac levels but only in the female DG. Levels of H3 and H3K9me3 were not influenced by DAE in either brain region of either sex. These findings suggest that exposure to a low, environmentally relevant level of arsenic during development leads to long-lasting changes in histone methylation and acetylation in the adult brain due to aberrant expression of epigenetic machinery based on region and sex. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Acetyltransferase; Arsenic; Brain; Histone; Methyltransferase; Sex","arsenic; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase 2; histone demethylase; histone methyltransferase; arsenate sodium; arsenic acid derivative; DNA binding protein; Hdac1 protein, mouse; Hdac2 protein, mouse; histone; histone acetyltransferase PCAF; histone deacetylase 1; histone deacetylase 2; histone demethylase; histone lysine methyltransferase; Kdm5b protein, mouse; mixed lineage leukemia protein; Mll protein, mouse; p300-CBP-associated factor; water pollutant; animal tissue; Article; brain; dentate gyrus; enzyme activity; epigenetics; female; frontal cortex; histone acetylation; histone methylation; histone modification; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein processing; sex difference; systematic review; acetylation; age; animal; C57BL mouse; chromatin assembly and disassembly; comparative study; dealkylation; drug effects; frontal lobe; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; gestational age; metabolism; methylation; newborn; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; toxicity; water pollutant; Mus; Acetylation; Age Factors; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Arsenates; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Dealkylation; Dentate Gyrus; DNA-Binding Proteins; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Frontal Lobe; Gene Expression Regulation; Gestational Age; Histone Deacetylase 1; Histone Deacetylase 2; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Histones; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases; Male; Methylation; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein; p300-CBP Transcription Factors; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Sex Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2-s2.0-84937777855

This study examined rsFC in Down syndrome (DS) compared with another neurodevelopmental disorder, Williams syndrome (WS), and TD. Ten subjects with DS, 18 subjects with WS, and 40 subjects with TD each participated in a 3-Tesla MRI scan. We tested for group differences (DS vs. TD, DS vs. WS, and WS vs. TD) in between- and within-network rsFC connectivity for seven functional networks. For the DS group, we also examined associations between rsFC and other cognitive and genetic risk factors. In DS compared with TD, we observed higher levels of between-network connectivity in 6 out 21 network pairs but no differences in within-network connectivity. Participants with WS showed lower levels of within-network connectivity and no significant differences in between-network connectivity relative to DS. Finally, our comparison between WS and TD controls revealed lower within-network connectivity in multiple networks and higher between-network connectivity in one network pair relative to TD controls. While preliminary due to modest sample sizes, our findings suggest a global difference in between-network connectivity in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders compared with controls and that such a difference is exacerbated across many brain regions in DS. However, this alteration in DS does not appear to extend to within-network connections, and therefore, the altered between-network connectivity must be interpreted within the framework of an intact intra-network pattern of activity. In contrast, WS shows markedly lower levels of within-network connectivity in the default mode network and somatomotor network relative to controls. These findings warrant further investigation using a task-based procedure that may help disentangle the relationship between brain function and cognitive performance across the spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.","APOE; Down syndrome; fMRI; resting state functional connectivity; Williams syndrome","adult; Article; brain function; brain region; clinical article; controlled study; default mode network; dorsal attention network; Down syndrome; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; genetic risk; human; male; priority journal; resting state network; risk factor; ventral attention network; Williams Beuren syndrome; attention; brain; case control study; comprehension; connectome; Down syndrome; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; Williams Beuren syndrome; young adult; apolipoprotein E; Adult; Apolipoproteins E; Attention; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Comprehension; Connectome; Down Syndrome; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Williams Syndrome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84947729172

The underlying mechanisms, including the role of disease-associated risk factors operating in adolescence such as drug abuse and social stressors, remain incompletely understood. Here, we summarize emerging findings from animal models, highlighting the ability of parvalbuminergic interneurons (PVI) to induce, during the juvenile period, long-term plastic changes in prefrontal and visual cortex, thereby altering perception, cognition and behavior in the adult. Of note, molecular alterations in PVI from subjects with schizophrenia, including downregulated expression of a subset of GABAergic genes, have also been found in juvenile stress models of the disorder. Some of the transcriptional alterations observed in schizophrenia postmortem brain could be linked to changes in the epigenetic architecture of GABAergic gene promoters, including dysregulated DNA methylation, histone modification patterns and disruption of promoter-enhancer interactions at site of chromosomal loop formations. Therefore, we predict that, in the not-to-distant future, PVI- and other cell-type specific epigenomic mappings in the animal model and human brain will provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and related psychotic diseases, including the role of cortical GABAergic circuitry in shaping long-term plasticity and cognitive function of the cerebral cortex. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cortical plasticity; Critical period; Epigenome; Parvalbuminergic interneuron; Schizophrenia","epidermal growth factor receptor 4; glutamate decarboxylase 67; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor; glutamate decarboxylase; glutamate decarboxylase 1; parvalbumin; DNA methylation; down regulation; enhancer region; epigenetics; ERBB4 gene; GAD1 gene; GAD67 gene; gene; gene disruption; gene expression; genetic transcription; histone modification; human; interneuron; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; parvalbuminergic interneuron; prefrontal cortex; promoter region; PV gene; Review; schizophrenia; visual cortex; animal; brain cortex; disease model; genetic epigenesis; genetics; growth, development and aging; interneuron; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; prefrontal cortex; schizophrenia; time factor; visual cortex; Animals; Cerebral Cortex; Disease Models, Animal; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; GABAergic Neurons; Glutamate Decarboxylase; Humans; Interneurons; Neuronal Plasticity; Parvalbumins; Prefrontal Cortex; Schizophrenia; Time Factors; Visual Cortex",2-s2.0-84941259756

Nevertheless, there is definite lack of intermediary languages for the representation of symbol grounding mechanisms in robots and standards for inter-robot cognitive communication. We address this void by presenting an intermediary meta-language based on a perceptually grounded algorithmic alphabet - the Affordance and kTR Augmented Alphabet based Neuro-Symbolic language, in short Af-kTRAANS, yielding an abstract layer sandwiched between the natural and the programming language layers that robots can use for knowledge representation, sharing and communication, while being agnostic to the embodiment, the pertinent human language, as well as, socio-cultural contexts and environments. Based on the k-TR theory of cognitive visual perception and implemented for practical systems using the Affordance Network (AfNet) and the AfRob ontology, the graphical language can support a wide variety of object definition phrases as well as action verbs/ object interaction commands while providing the necessary succinctness for tractable modeling.

The anticipation mode (i.e., inverse model control) and the single loop mode are two operating modes of the artificial cognitive control architecture.

While there are many types of reasoning, this paper is specifically looking at valid categorical syllogisms. First we show that a standard bi-directional associative memory cannot learn all valid categorical syllogisms because these syllogisms are not linearly separable. Therefore a more complex architecture is proposed to learn the task. A combination of unsupervised and supervised learning networks are used. The unsupervised network compresses the input into novel solutions. The output from the unsupervised network in conjunction with the original input produces a new linearly separable input for the supervised network. This unsupervised-supervised learning network combination can successfully learn all the valid syllogisms. If there is a combination of valid and conditionally valid syllogisms, two different networks should be used. The conditionally valid syllogisms can be recalled using the bi-directional associative memory while the valid syllogisms need the more complex network. © 2015 IEEE.","Bidirectional associative memory; inference; syllogisms","Associative processing; Associative storage; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Associative memory; Bi-directional associative memory; Cognitive functions; Complex architectures; inference; Supervised network; syllogisms; Unsupervised network; Complex networks",2-s2.0-84951136427

However, while the NEF simplifies the design of neural networks, simulating them using standard computer hardware is still computationally expensive - often running far slower than biological real-time and scaling very poorly: problems the SpiNNaker neuromorphic simulator was designed to solve. In this paper we (1) argue that employing the same model of computation used for simulating general purpose spiking neural networks on SpiNNaker for NEF models results in suboptimal use of the architecture, and (2) provide and evaluate an alternative simulation scheme which overcomes the memory and compute challenges posed by the NEF.

Whether such morphological changes can be detected after human cortical stroke is not yet known, but this would be essential to better understand post-stroke brain architecture and its impact on recovery. Using serial behavioural and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements, we tracked recovery of dexterous hand function in 28 patients with ischaemic stroke involving the primary sensorimotor cortices. We were able to classify three recovery subgroups (fast, slow, and poor) using response feature analysis of individual recovery curves. To detect areas with significant longitudinal grey matter volume (GMV) change, we performed tensor-based morphometry of MRI data acquired in the subacute phase, i.e. after the stage compromised by acute oedema and inflammation. We found significant GMV expansion in the perilesional premotor cortex, ipsilesional mediodorsal thalamus, and caudate nucleus, and GMV contraction in the contralesional cerebellum. According to an interaction model, patients with fast recovery had more perilesional than subcortical expansion, whereas the contrary was true for patients with impaired recovery. Also, there were significant voxel-wise correlations between motor performance and ipsilesional GMV contraction in the posterior parietal lobes and expansion in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In sum, perilesional GMV expansion is associated with successful recovery after cortical stroke, possibly reflecting the restructuring of local cortical networks. Distant changes within the prefrontal-striato-thalamic network are related to impaired recovery, probably indicating higher demands on cognitive control of motor behaviour. © 2014, The Author(s).","Cortical stroke; Grey matter plasticity; Motor recovery; Tensor-based morphometry","adult; algorithm; Article; brain ischemia; caudate nucleus; cerebellum; clinical assessment; cognitive defect; cortical sensorimotor stroke; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; female; functional disease; gray matter; hand paresis; human; inflammation; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; motor control; motor performance; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paresis; parietal lobe; plasticity; postcentral gyrus; premotor cortex; principal component analysis; priority journal; prospective study; quality control; Rankin scale; sensorimotor function; task performance; thalamus; volumetry; aged; cerebrovascular accident; convalescence; gray matter; hand; hemispheric dominance; middle aged; motor cortex; paresis; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; sensorimotor cortex; Aged; Functional Laterality; Gray Matter; Hand; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Cortex; Paresis; Recovery of Function; Sensorimotor Cortex; Stroke",2-s2.0-84940610558

We found significant differences in absolute and relative brain volume across 12 populations. Supporting the EBF, we observed a positive correlation between absolute and relative brain volume with season length. In particular, populations experiencing long seasons were characterized by having relatively large olfactory nerve and optic tecta. Relative, but not absolute, brain volume was also positively correlated with individual age. When accounting for the effects of body size and brain volume, however, the size of different brain structures (olfactory nerve, olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, optic tecta and cerebellum) was independent from age.

Therefore, the demarcation criteria has been drawn between robots as formalized logical architectures and humans as creative, social subjects, creating a bipartite division that leaves out animals. However, by downsizing the discussion of animal cognition and implicitly intuiting assimilation of living organisms (LOs) to robots, key features to explain why human expertise is crucially different from robot expertise are neglected. In the absence of clarification of fundamental cognitive principles of LOs, cognitively robots may appear persuasively closer to humans when they are in fact not. In this paper, I will discuss essential features of organic cognition to emphasise why animals are not like robots at all. The purpose is to add a third category when comparing humans and robots to make a tripartite division that consists of (a) humans (b) LOs, and (c) machines. I will argue that LOs, adapted to ever-changing circumstances, are qualitatively different from robots. Humans, in the sense of belonging to the biological class of LOs, also share this central feature. In addition, however, humans alone possess and use language in a way that turns cognition from a predominantly online to off-line activity (e.g. Wilson Psychonomic Bulletin & Review 9(4), 625–635 2002) that introduces truly abstract thinking. In the end I introduce the concept of ‘Linguification’ to dissect the particular mechanisms sustaining abstract thinking in the explanation of what makes humans distinct from robots and LOs. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Animal cognition; Contextuality; Derived embodiment; Language; Linguification; Robots",,2-s2.0-84941875235

Electrophysiological, imaging and immediate early gene immunostaining studies have been instrumental in identifying and characterizing neurons that respond to different sensory stimuli, events and motor actions. Here we highlight approaches that have manipulated the activity of physiologically classified neurons to determine their role in the generation of behavioural responses. Previous experiments have often exploited the functional architecture observed in many cortical areas, where clusters of neurons share response properties. However, many brain structures do not exhibit such functional architecture. Instead, neurons with different response properties are anatomically intermingled. Emerging genetic approaches have enabled the identification and manipulation of neurons that respond to specific stimuli despite the lack of discernable anatomical organization. These approaches have advanced understanding of the circuits mediating sensory perception, learning and memory, and the generation of behavioural responses by providing causal evidence linking neural response properties to appropriate behavioural output. However, significant challenges remain for understanding cognitive processes that are probably mediated by neurons with more complex physiological response properties. Currently available strategies may prove inadequate for determining how activity in these neurons is causally related to cognitive behaviour. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

However, CaBPs are also expressed in the cell nucleus, suggesting that they modulate nuclear calcium signals, which are key regulators of neuronal gene expression. Here we show that the calcium buffering capacity of the cell nucleus in mouse hippocampal neurons regulates neuronal architecture by modulating the expression levels of VEGFD and the complement factor C1q-c, two nuclear calcium-regulated genes that control dendrite geometry and spine density, respectively. Increasing the levels of nuclear calcium buffersbymeansofexpression ofa nuclearly targeted form of parvalbumin fused to mCherry (PV.NLS-mC) led to a reduction in VEGFD expression and, as a result, to a decrease in total dendritic length and complexity. In contrast, mRNA levels of the synapse pruning factor C1q-c were increased in neurons expressing PV.NLS-mC, causing a reduction in the density and size of dendritic spines. Our results establish a close link between nuclear calcium buffering capacity and the transcription of genes that determine neuronal structure. They suggest that the development of cognitive deficits observed in neurological conditions associated with CaBP deregulation may reflect the loss of necessary structural features of dendrites and spines. © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

While this kind of data is increasingly rich and offers many grand opportunities to identify patterns and predict behaviour of groups and individuals, it is not immediately obvious how to develop a framework for extracting plausible inferences from these data. In our case, we have access to a large volume (more than half a billion individual records) of real user data from the Point smart phone application, and we have developed a generic and layered system architecture to incrementally find aggregate items of interest within that data. 'Interest' is based on the semantics of the data, so include time and space correlations, e.g., Are people searching for dinner and a movie, distributions of usage patterns and platforms, e.g., Geographic distribution of Android, Apple, and Black-Berry users, and clustering to identify interesting and relatively complex search and movement patterns, e.g., Consumer trajectories from key word searches. Our integration of visualization tools is thus guided top-down, by semantic concepts in the application domain, rather than by bottom-up tool development. Our presentation here is preliminary in that we provide sketches of case-studies that demonstrate an application specific integration of the three major components of modern visual analytics: visualization, analytics, and interaction (VAI). Our case-study sketches show how an interactive system for visual data exploration can be used to alternate between exploratory search - looking for ideas and new hypothesis in data - and explanatory search - looking for evidence to support a hypothesis. While we have not yet formulated experiments to directly measure the cognitive efficacy of our experimental system, we believe that our semantically-driven VAI workflows and the integration of visual methods and interaction provides some useful ideas about how to extend current frameworks for visual analytics systems. © 2015 IEEE.","Analytics; Geo-located search; Interaction; Visualization","Cognitive systems; Computer graphics; Data visualization; Enterprise resource management; Flow visualization; Geographical distribution; Integration; Semantics; Smartphones; Space platforms; Telephone sets; Visualization; Analytics; Application specific; Geo-located search; Interaction; Layered system architecture; Smart-phone applications; Visual analytics systems; Visual data exploration; Search engines",2-s2.0-84958547469

The key objectives of the project are to develop, implement, and demonstrate in the course of missions at sea the efficacy of a number of innovative systems to assist human divers during the execution of demanding scientific and commercial activities in hazardous underwater environments. At the core of CADDY is the development of an underwater robot that plays the role of a buddy diver and a surface robot to improve guidance, monitoring, assistance, and safety of the diver's mission. The present paper gives a brief summary of the work done during the first year of the project towards the development and testing of the systems required for coordinated surface / underwater vehicle operations.

For example, by combining the meanings of ""bite,"" ""dog,"" and ""man,"" we can think about a dog biting a man, or a man biting a dog. Here, in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we identify a region of left mid-superior temporal cortex (lmSTC) that flexibly encodes ""who did what to whom"" in visually presented sentences. We find that lmSTC represents the current values of abstract semantic variables (""Who did it?"" and ""To whom was it done?"") in distinct subregions. Experiment 1 first identifies a broad region of lmSTC whose activity patterns (i) facilitate decoding of structuredependent sentence meaning (""Who did what to whom?"") and (ii) predict affect-related amygdala responses that depend on this information (e.g., ""the baby kicked the grandfather"" vs. ""the grandfather kicked the baby""). Experiment 2 then identifies distinct, but neighboring, subregions of lmSTC whose activity patterns carry information about the identity of the current ""agent"" (""Who did it?"") and the current ""patient"" (""To whom was it done?""). These neighboring subregions lie along the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus and the lateral bank of the superior temporal gyrus, respectively. At a high level, these regions may function like topographically defined data registers, encoding the fluctuating values of abstract semantic variables. This functional architecture, which in key respects resembles that of a classical computer, may play a critical role in enabling humans to flexibly generate complex thoughts.","Cognitive architecture; Compositionality; Comprehension; FMRI; PBEC","amygdaloid nucleus; Article; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; multivoxel pattern analysis; nonhuman; pattern recognition; priority journal; superior temporal gyrus; superior temporal sulcus; temporal cortex; adult; brain mapping; comprehension; computer simulation; female; image processing; interpersonal communication; language; male; Monte Carlo method; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; reading; semantics; speech; temporal lobe; young adult; Adult; Brain Mapping; Communication; Comprehension; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Language; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Monte Carlo Method; Reading; Semantics; Speech; Temporal Lobe; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84941711125

This idea is typically framed in terms of top-down influences within a cortical control hierarchy, where prefrontal-basal ganglia loops gate multiple input-output channels, which in turn can activate or sequence motor primitives expressed in (pre-)motor cortices. Here we advance a new hypothesis, based on the notion of programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme, on how the PFC can flexibly bias the selection of sensorimotor patterns depending on internal goal and task contexts. In this approach, multiple elementary behaviors representing motor primitives are expressed by a single multi-purpose neural network, which is seen as a reusable area of ""recycled"" neurons (interpreter). The PFC thus acts as a ""programmer"" that, without modifying the network connectivity, feeds the interpreter networks with specific input parameters encoding the programs (corresponding to network structures) to be interpreted by the (pre-)motor areas. Our architecture is validated in a standard test for executive function: the 1-2-AX task. Our results show that this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers, supporting the realization of multiple goals.

Designing a suitable controller to correct the beam motion to increase the beam stability at a point becomes significant. This paper presents an investigation on the performance of two types of controller designed for aiming a laser beam to be at a particular spot under dynamic disturbances generated at the transmitter. The experimental nonlinear input–output data mapping is used as the principal components for the controller design. The first design is based on the Taguchi method while the second is the artificial neural network—cognitive method. These controllers process the beam pointing (beam location) information from an opto-electronic position detector and then generate the necessary outputs to steer the beam with fast steering mirror. Conceptually, the controller design problem is addressed with looking the position error information to decide the level of nonlinear static output map for generating the correction control information. The pipelined-parallel architecture of both controllers are developed in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and installed at the receiver station. Evidence of the suitability and the effectiveness of the proposed controller in terms of prediction exactness, response to impulse, scintillation, Q-factor and bit error rate are provided through experimental results obtained from the 155 Mbps FSOC data link set-up established for the horizontal range of 0.5 km at an altitude of 15.25 m. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Beam wandering; Neural-controller; Nonlinearity; Scintillation and Bit error rate; Taguchi’s method","Adaptive control systems; Adaptive optics; Altitude control; Bit error rate; Controllers; Decision making; Design; Errors; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Integrated circuit design; Laser beams; Neural networks; Parallel architectures; Q factor measurement; Scintillation; Taguchi methods; Beam wandering; Cognitive decision makings; Free Space Optical communication; Free space optical communication systems; Neural controller; Nonlinearity; Principal Components; S-method; Optical communication",2-s2.0-84938949891

Besides this, the social aspect of metacognition helps humans in monitoring their cognitive activities based on their peers experience and knowledge. Inspired by this, we propose HumanCog: A generic 3-layer architecture for solving optimization problems. HumanCog functions in a way that mimics human cognitive and metacognitive (self as well as social) behavior.

The proposed repeater features a Spectrum Sensing (SS) intelligence capability and utilizes such intelligence in a complementary fashion in comparison to its existing counterpart (e.g., Cognitive Radio) by detecting the active channels within the assigned spectrum. This intelligence allows the proposed repeater to carry out selective amplification of the active channels in contrast to the full amplification in conventional AF repeaters. Furthermore, the performance of a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) based two hop cellular network utilizing the proposed repeater is evaluated in terms of the system throughput.

In order to infer the contributions and connectivity of underlying neuronal sources within the brain, it is necessary to reconstruct sensor data at the source level. Several approaches to this reconstruction have been developed, thereby solving the so-called implicit inverse problem Michel et al. (Clin Neurophysiol 115:2195–2222, 2004). However, a unifying premise against which to validate these source reconstructions is seldom available. The dataset provided in this work, in which brain activity is simultaneously recorded on the scalp (non-invasively) by electroencephalography (EEG) and on the cortex (invasively) by electrocorticography (ECoG), can be of a great help in this direction. These multimodal recordings were obtained from a macaque monkey under wakefulness and sedation. Our primary goal was to establish the connectivity architecture between two sources of interest (frontal and parietal), and to assess how their coupling changes over the conditions. We chose these sources because previous studies have shown that the connections between them are modified by anaesthesia Boly et al. (J Neurosci 32:7082–7090, 2012). Our secondary goal was to evaluate the consistency of the connectivity results when analyzing sources recorded from invasive data (128 implanted ECoG sources) and source activity reconstructed from scalp recordings (19 EEG sensors) at the same locations as the ECoG sources. We conclude that the directed connectivity in the frequency domain between cortical sources reconstructed from scalp EEG is qualitatively similar to the connectivity inferred directly from cortical recordings, using both data-driven (directed transfer function) and biologically grounded (dynamic causal modelling) methods. Furthermore, the connectivity changes identified were consistent with previous findings Boly et al. (J Neurosci 32:7082–7090, 2012). Our findings suggest that inferences about directed connectivity based upon non-invasive electrophysiological data have construct validity in relation to invasive recordings. © 2015 The Author(s)","Brain connectivity; Directed transfer function; Dynamic causal modeling",,2-s2.0-84941011580

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with cognitive impairment. There is currently a paucity of data evaluating the impact of medications on sleep architecture and cognition in untreated OSAS. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and medications on cognition by a screening questionnaire called the Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument (MCFSI). Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review on consecutive adults (age > 18 years) with OSAS seen in Medical University of South Carolina Sleep Clinic between January 1, 2012 and May 8, 2013, for whom the Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument (MCFSI) score was available and who were not on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The correlation between different medications, sleep study variables, and MCFSI scores was studied. Results: Univariate analysis revealed that many medications had significant correlations with MCFSI scores, including antidepressants (p = 0.05), antipsychotics (p = 0.01), anxiolytics (p = 0.005), statins (p = 0.077) and narcotics (p = 0.006). The mean percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (p = 0.04) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (p = 0.01) were also significantly correlated with MCFSI scores. Multivariate analysis revealed that Epworth Sleepiness Scale and use of antipsychotics, narcotics, and anxiolytics correlated with higher MCFSI scores (worse cognition) and conversely that statin use was associated with improved cognition. Conclusions: Medications have a significant impact on cognitive function in OSAS. Thus, medication use should be considered in future studies of cognitive function in patients with OSAS. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cognition; Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument; Medications; Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome","antidepressant agent; antihypertensive agent; anxiolytic agent; gabapentin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hypnotic agent; insulin; narcotic agent; neuroleptic agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; psychotropic agent; adult; apnea hypopnea index; Article; cognition; Epworth sleepiness scale; female; human; Mail In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument; major clinical study; male; medical record review; polysomnography; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; questionnaire; REM sleep; respiratory disturbance index; retrospective study; sleep disordered breathing; aged; chemically induced; Cognition Disorders; drug effects; drug interaction; mass screening; middle aged; neuropsychological test; questionnaire; risk factor; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; statistical model; statistics; Adult; Aged; Cognition Disorders; Drug Interactions; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Likelihood Functions; Logistic Models; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Polysomnography; Psychotropic Drugs; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Statistics as Topic; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84940963147

If evolutionary psychology turns out to be well-founded, then the existing superstructure of the social and behavioral sciences, the Standard Social Science Model, have to be dismantled. To be effective researchers, psychologists needs to become at least minimally acquainted with the principles of organic design. One reason why cognitive psychologists arbitrarily limit their scope is the folk psychological distinction made between knowledge acquisition on the one hand and motivation, emotion, and preferences on the other.

This paper explores the power-robustness tradeoffs inherent in the design of a wearable eye tracker, and proposes a novel staged architecture that enables graceful adaptation across the spectrum of real-world illumination. We propose CIDER, a system that operates in a highly optimized low-power mode under indoor settings by using a fast Search-Refine controller to track the eye, but detects when the environment switches to more challenging outdoor sunlight and switches models to operate robustly under this condition. Our design is holistic and tackles a) power consumption in digitizing pixels, estimating pupillary parameters, and illuminating the eye via near-infrared, b) error in estimating pupil center and pupil dilation, and c) model training procedures that involve zero effort from a user. We demonstrate that CIDER can estimate pupil center with error less than two pixels (0.6°), and pupil diameter with error of one pixel (0.22mm).

PMD classically results from a duplication of a genomic segment encompassing the entire PLP1 gene. Since the PLP1 gene is located in Xq22, PMD affects mostly boys. Methods and results: Here we report the case of a girl with typical PMD. Copy number analysis of the PLP1 locus revealed a duplication of the entire gene and FISH analysis showed that the extra copy of the PLP1 gene was actually inserted in chromosome 1p36. This insertion of an additional copy of PLP1 in an autosome led to a functional duplication irrespective of the X-inactivation pattern. Subsequent overexpression of PLP1 was the cause of the PMD phenotype observed in this girl. Further sequencing of the breakpoint junction revealed a microhomology and thus suggested a replication based mechanism (such as FoSTeS or MMBIR). Conclusion: This case emphasizes the susceptibility of the PLP1 locus to complex rearrangement likely driven by the Xq22 local genomic architecture. In addition, careful consideration should be given to girls with classical PMD clinical features since they usually experience complex PLP1 genomic alteration with a distinct risk of inheritance.",,"Article; autosome; case report; child; chromosome 1p; chromosome 1p36; chromosome breakage; chromosome Xq22.2; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene; gene dosage; gene duplication; gene insertion; gene locus; gene overexpression; gene rearrangement; gene replication; gene sequence; genetic screening; genetic susceptibility; human; molecular pathology; Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease; phenotype; PLP1 gene; preschool child; sequence homology; X chromosome; X chromosome inactivation; chromosome 1; gene duplication; gene expression regulation; genetics; microarray analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease; PLP1 protein, human; proteolipid protein; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1; Female; Gene Duplication; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Microarray Analysis; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Myelin Proteolipid Protein; Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease; X Chromosome Inactivation",2-s2.0-84940546735

We argue that instance-based learning satisfies the conditions for intuitive decision-making described in Kahneman and Klein (2009), separates automatic from deliberative processes, and provides a general mechanism for the study of intuitive decision-making. To better understand the role of the environment in decision-making, we describe biases as arising from three sources: the mechanisms and limitations of the human cognitive architecture, the information structure in the task environment, and the use of heuristics and strategies to adapt performance to the dual constraints of cognition and environment.

Cognitive control is often conceptualized as a hierarchical decision process, wherein decisions made at higher, more abstract levels of control asymmetrically influence lower-level decisions. These influences could evolve sequentially across multiple levels of a hierarchical decision, consistent with much prior evidence for central bottlenecks and seriality in decision-making processes. However, here, we show that multiple levels of hierarchical cognitive control are processed primarily in parallel. Human participants selected responses to stimuli using a complex, multiply contingent (third order) rule structure. A response deadline procedure allowed assessment of the accuracy and timing of decisions made at each level of the hierarchy. In contrast to a serial decision process, error rates across levels of the decision mostly declined simultaneously and at identical rates, with only a slight tendency to complete the highest level decision first. Simulations with a biologically plausible neural network model demonstrate how such parallel processing could emerge from a previously developed hierarchically nested frontostriatal architecture.

However, a systematic development of a coherent theoretical and experimental framework is missing. To investigate the neurophysiological reactions related to the appreciation of ambiances, we recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in an immersive virtual reality during the appreciation of interior designs. Such data have been analyzed according to the working hypothesis that appreciated environments involve embodied simulation mechanisms and circuits mediating approaching stimuli. EEG recordings of 12 healthy subjects have been performed during the perception of three-dimensional interiors that have been simulated in a CAVE system and judged according to dimensions of familiarity, novelty, comfort, pleasantness, arousal and presence. A correlation analysis on personal judgments returned that scores of novelty, pleasantness and comfort are positively correlated, while familiarity and novelty are in negative way. Statistical spectral maps reveal that pleasant, novel and comfortable interiors produce a de-synchronization of the mu rhythm over left sensorimotor areas. Interiors judged more pleasant and less familiar generate an activation of left frontal areas (theta and alpha bands), along an involvement of areas devoted to spatial navigation. An increase in comfort returns an enhancement of the theta frontal midline activity. Cerebral activations underlying appreciation of architecture could involve different mechanisms regulating corporeal, emotional and cognitive reactions. Therefore, it might be suggested that people’s experience of architectural environments is intrinsically structured by the possibilities for action. © 2015, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Architecture; Electroencephalography; Embodiment; Spatial navigation; Virtual reality","adult; alpha rhythm; ambiance; arousal; Article; comfort; computer simulation; conation; depth perception; electroencephalography; electroencephalography phase synchronization; embodiment; emotionality; environment; familiarity; furniture; human; human experiment; motivation; mu rhythm; nerve stimulation; neurophysiology; normal human; novelty; personal experience; pleasantness; presence; priority journal; psychophysiology; sensorimotor cortex; spatial orientation; stimulus response; theta rhythm; virtual reality; attention; brain mapping; computer interface; emotion; evoked response; female; male; motivation; perception; physiology; spectroscopy; statistics; Adult; Attention; Brain Mapping; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Environment; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Perception; Spectrum Analysis; Statistics as Topic; User-Computer Interface",2-s2.0-84941416377

A key component is the cingulo-opercular (CO) network composed of anterior insula/operculum, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. Its function has been particularly difficult to characterize due to the network's pervasive activity and frequent co-activation with other control-related networks. We previously suggested this network to underlie intrinsically maintained tonic alertness. Here, we tested this hypothesis by separately manipulating the demand for selective attention and for tonic alertness in a two-factorial, continuous pitch discrimination paradigm. The 2 factors had independent behavioral effects. Functional imaging revealed that activity as well as functional connectivity in the CO network increased when the task required more tonic alertness. Conversely, heightened selective attention to pitch increased activity in the dorsal attention (DAT) network but not in the CO network. Across participants, performance accuracy showed dissociable correlation patterns with activity in the CO, DAT, and fronto-parietal (FP) control networks. These results support tonic alertness as a fundamental function of the CO network.

Objective This paper describes a functional reference architecture for autonomous driving, along with various considerations that influence such an architecture. The functionality is described at the logical level, without dependence on specific implementation technologies. Method Engineering design has been used as the research method, which focuses on creating solutions intended for practical application. The architecture has been refined and applied over a 5 year period to the construction of prototype autonomous vehicles in three different categories, with both academic and industrial stakeholders. Results The architectural components are divided into categories pertaining to (i) perception, (ii) decision and control, and (iii) vehicle platform manipulation. The architecture itself is divided into two layers comprising the vehicle platform and a cognitive driving intelligence. The distribution of components among the architectural layers considers two extremes: one where the vehicle platform is as ""dumb"" as possible, and the other, where the vehicle platform can be treated as an autonomous system with limited intelligence. We recommend a clean split between the driving intelligence and the vehicle platform. The architecture description includes identification of stakeholder concerns, which are grouped under the business and engineering categories. A comparison with similar architectures is also made, wherein we claim that the presence of explicit components for world modeling, semantic understanding, and vehicle platform abstraction seem unique to our architecture. Conclusion The concluding discussion examines the influences of implementation technologies on functional architectures and how an architecture is affected when a human driver is replaced by a computer. The discussion also proposes that reduction and acceleration of testing, verification, and validation processes is the key to incorporating continuous deployment processes. © 2016.","Autonomous driving; E/E architecture; Functional architecture; Reference architecture","Semantics; Architectural components; Architectural layers; Architecture description; Autonomous driving; Autonomous Vehicles; Functional architecture; Reference architecture; Semantic understanding; Vehicles",2-s2.0-84954271784

The present fMRI study (n= 18) employed the likelihood cueing recognition task to elucidate the role of functional connectivity (fcMRI) networks in supporting memory control processes engaged by these unexpected events. Conventional task-evoked BOLD analyses recovered a memory control network similar to that previously reported, comprising medial prefrontal, lateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal regions. These were split by their differential affiliation to distinct fcMRI networks (“conflict detection” and “confirmatory retrieval” networks). Subsequent ROI analyses clarified the functional significance of this connectivity differentiation, with “conflict” network-affiliated regions specifically sensitive to cue strength, but not to response confidence, and “retrieval” network-affiliated regions showing the opposite pattern. BOLD time course analyses corroborated the segregation of memory control regions into “early” conflict detection and “late” retrieval analysis, with both processes underlying the allocation of memory control. Response specificity and time course findings were generalized beyond task-recruited ROIs to clusters within the large-scale fcMRI networks, suggesting that this connectivity architecture could underlie efficient processing of distinct processes within cognitive tasks.

I argue that the available data can best be accommodated by theoretical models which assume that conceptual knowledge is underpinned by a flexible, multilevel architecture that includes not only low-level modality-specific systems for perception, action, and emotion, but also high-level cross-modal convergence/divergence zones, as well as the statistical co-occurrence patterns of word-forms across discourses.

Second tier users share the same resources with the first tier user and they form a single input multiple output multiple access channel to their intended base station while causing interference to the first tier user. Near-optimum allocation of transmission powers maximizing the aggregate communication rate under individual transmission power constraints and a constraint on the total interference power at the first tier user is obtained by considering low-complexity signal decoders without interference cancelation at the second tier base station.

Magic gets to the very heart of some theoretical and methodological difficulties encountered in the social and natural sciences, especially to do with issues of rationality. This book examines magic head-on, not through its instrumental aspects but as an orientation of consciousness. Magical consciousness is affective, associative and synchronistic, shaped through individual experience within a particular environment. This work focuses on an in-depth case study using the anthropologist's own experience gained through years of anthropological fieldwork with British practitioners of magic. As an ethnographic view, it is an intimate study of the way in which the cognitive architecture of a mind engages the emotions and imagination in a pattern of meanings related to childhood experiences, spiritual communications and the environment. Although the detail of the involvement in magical consciousness presented here is necessarily specific, the central tenets of modus operandi is common to magical thought in general, and can be applied to cross-cultural analyses to increase understanding of this ubiquitous human phenomenon. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

However, our understanding of how probabilistic computations could be organized in the brain, and how the observed connectivity structure of cortical microcircuits supports these calculations, is rudimentary at best. In this study, we investigate statistical inference and self-organized learning in a spatially extended spiking network model, that accommodates both local competitive and large-scale associative aspects of neural information processing, under a unified Bayesian account. Specifically, we show how the spiking dynamics of a recurrent network with lateral excitation and local inhibition in response to distributed spiking input, can be understood as sampling from a variational posterior distribution of a well-defined implicit probabilistic model. This interpretation further permits a rigorous analytical treatment of experience-dependent plasticity on the network level. Using machine learning theory, we derive update rules for neuron and synapse parameters which equate with Hebbian synaptic and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity rules in a neural implementation. In computer simulations, we demonstrate that the interplay of these plasticity rules leads to the emergence of probabilistic local experts that form distributed assemblies of similarly tuned cells communicating through lateral excitatory connections. The resulting sparse distributed spike code of a well-adapted network carries compressed information on salient input features combined with prior experience on correlations among them. Our theory predicts that the emergence of such efficient representations benefits from network architectures in which the range of local inhibition matches the spatial extent of pyramidal cells that share common afferent input.

Evidence suggests that social processes are impaired in individuals at ultra high-risk for the development of psychosis (UHR). Understanding these phenomena in UHR youth may clarify disease etiology and social processes in a period that is characterized by significantly fewer confounds than schizophrenia. Furthermore, understanding social processing deficits in this population will help explain these processes in healthy individuals. The current study examined resting state connectivity of the salience (SN) and default mode networks (DMN) in association with facial emotion recognition (FER), an integral aspect of social processes, as well as broader social functioning (SF) in UHR individuals and healthy controls. Consistent with the existing literature, UHR youth were impaired in FER and SF when compared with controls. In the UHR group, we found increased connectivity between the SN and the medial prefrontal cortex, an area of the DMN relative to controls. In UHR youth, the DMN exhibited both positive and negative correlations with the somatosensory cortex/cerebellum and precuneus, respectively, which was linked with better FER performance. For SF, results showed that sensory processing links with the SN might be important in allowing for better SF for both groups, but especially in controls where sensory processing is likely to be unimpaired. These findings clarify how social processing deficits may manifest in psychosis, and underscore the importance of SN and DMN connectivity for social processing more generally. © 2015 Pelletier-Baldelli et al.

However, the functional contribution of specific rostral and caudal sub-regions remains elusive. Here we investigate the impact of disrupting rostral and caudal target regions on cognitive control processes, using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Participants performed three different task-switching conditions that assessed differences in the degree of complexity of cognitive control processes, after temporally disrupting rostral, or caudal target regions, or a control region. Disrupting the rostral lateral frontal region specifically impaired behavioral performance of the most complex task-switching condition, in comparison to the caudal target region and the control region.

In audition, preceding context can bias the perception of speech and non-speech stimuli. Here, we develop a neuronal network model that can account for how context affects the perception of pitch change between a pair of successive complex tones. We focus especially on an ambiguous comparison—listeners experience opposite percepts (either ascending or descending) for an ambiguous tone pair depending on the spectral location of preceding context tones. We developed a recurrent, firing-rate network model, which detects frequency-change-direction of successively played stimuli and successfully accounts for the context-dependent perception demonstrated in behavioral experiments. The model consists of two tonotopically organized, excitatory populations, E<inf>up</inf> and E<inf>down</inf>, that respond preferentially to ascending or descending stimuli in pitch, respectively. These preferences are generated by an inhibitory population that provides inhibition asymmetric in frequency to the two populations; context dependence arises from slow facilitation of inhibition. We show that contextual influence depends on the spectral distribution of preceding tones and the tuning width of inhibitory neurons. Further, we demonstrate, using phase-space analysis, how the facilitated inhibition from previous stimuli and the waning inhibition from the just-preceding tone shape the competition between the E<inf>up</inf> and E<inf>down</inf> populations. In sum, our model accounts for contextual influences on the pitch change perception of an ambiguous tone pair by introducing a novel decoding strategy based on direction-selective units. The model's network architecture and slow facilitating inhibition emerge as predictions of neuronal mechanisms for these perceptual dynamics. Since the model structure does not depend on the specific stimuli, we show that it generalizes to other contextual effects and stimulus types. © 2015 Huang, Englitz, Shamma and Rinzel.","Adaptation; Auditory illusion; Context; Neuromechanistic modeling; Shepard tone","Audition; Complex networks; Network architecture; Neurons; Phase space methods; Signal encoding; Adaptation; Auditory illusion; Behavioral experiment; Context; Perceptual ambiguities; Phase-space analysis; Shepard tone; Spectral distribution; Neural networks; acoustics; adaptation; analysis; Article; artificial neural network; ascending ambiguous tone; auditory stimulation; cognition; cognitive bias; comparative study; connectome; context dependence; controlled study; descending ambiguous tone; excitatory population; experimental design; facilitation; feedback system; firing rate network model; hearing; inhibitory population; inhibitory synapse; just preceding tone; neuronal network model; neurophysiology; neuroscience; phase space analysis; pitch change perception; pure tone audiometry; Shepard tone; spectral distribution; statistical distribution; statistical model; statistical parameters; synapse; three variable winner take all model",2-s2.0-84940182220

Coordinate-based meta-analysis has been utilized to discover the brain regions that are consistently activated across experiments. However, within-experiment co-activation relationships, which can reflect the underlying functional relationships between different brain regions, have not been widely studied. In particular, voxel-wise co-activation, which may be able to provide a detailed configuration of the co-activation network, still needs to be modeled. To estimate the voxel-wise co-activation pattern and deduce the co-activation network, a Co-activation Probability Estimation (CoPE) method was proposed to model within-experiment activations for the purpose of defining the co-activations. A permutation test was adopted as a significance test. Moreover, the co-activations were automatically separated into local and long-range ones, based on distance. The two types of co-activations describe distinct features: the first reflects convergent activations; the second represents co-activations between different brain regions. The validation of CoPE was based on five simulation tests and one real dataset derived from studies of working memory. Both the simulated and the real data demonstrated that CoPE was not only able to find local convergence but also significant long-range co-activation. In particular, CoPE was able to identify a 'core' co-activation network in the working memory dataset. As a data-driven method, the CoPE method can be used to mine underlying co-activation relationships across experiments in future studies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Coordinate-based meta-analysis; CoPE; Functional co-activation; Working memory","Article; basal ganglion; brain region; calculation; coactivation probability estimation; controlled study; inferior frontal gyrus; inferior parietal lobule; insula; kernel method; mathematical computing; middle frontal gyrus; Monte Carlo method; neuroimaging; normal distribution; priority journal; simulation; statistical model; statistical significance; supplementary motor area; working memory; functional neuroimaging; human; image processing; meta analysis (topic); nerve cell network; physiology; procedures; short term memory; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Memory, Short-Term; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Models, Statistical; Nerve Net",2-s2.0-84936777446

This architecture has applications in both military and civilian domains, including operations research and data mining. One of the most computationally challenging aspects of CECEP is mining domain knowledge captured in cognitive domain ontologies (CDOs). This requires massively linked knowledge databases to be searched based on a large set of constraints to generate intelligent decisions. The solution search for CDOs is a kind of Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Due to the unique nature of the CDO-to-CSP mapping, generic constraint solvers are inefficient. We introduce a novel high performance path based forward checking CSP algorithm to solve CDOs and compare it to a commonly utilized CSP solving application.

We manipulated the probability of congruence between a cue and a delayed reach target to investigate, in an unbiased way, whether congruence probability interacts with reach trajectory.

The Von Neumann bottleneck is an important issue for such tasks, and emerging memory devices offer an opportunity to overcome this issue by fusing computing and memory, in nonvolatile instant on/off systems. A vision for accomplishing this is to use brain-inspired architectures, which excel at inference and do not differentiate between computing and memory. In this work, we use a neuroscience-inspired model of learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, to develop a bioinspired approach for programming memory devices, which naturally gives rise to an inference engine. The method is then adapted to different memory devices, including multivalued memories (cumulative memristive device, phase-change memory) and stochastic binary memories (conductive bridge memory, spin transfer torque magnetic tunnel junction). By means of system-level simulations, we investigate several applications, including image recognition and pattern detection within video and auditory data. We compare the results of the different devices. Stochastic binary devices require the use of redundancy, the extent of which depends tremendously on the considered task. A theoretical analysis allows us to understand how the various devices differ, and ties the inference engine to the machine learning algorithm of expectation-maximization. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate an exceptional robustness of the inference engine with respect to device variations and other issues. A theoretical analysis explains the roots of this robustness. These results highlight a possible new bioinspired paradigm for programming emerging memory devices, allowing the natural learning of a complex inference engine. The physics of the memory devices plays an active role. The results open the way for a reinvention of the role of memory, when solving inference tasks. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Inference; memory devices; neural networks","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Data storage equipment; Engines; Image recognition; Inference engines; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Maximum principle; Memristors; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Stochastic systems; Tunnel junctions; Bio-inspired approach; Conductive-bridge memory; Expectation - maximizations; Inference; Magnetic tunnel junction; Spike timing dependent plasticities; Spin transfer torque; System level simulation; Phase change memory",2-s2.0-84937232492

However, 25 million years of evolution separate humans and macaques from their last common ancestor, and this has likely substantially impacted the function of the cortical networks underlying cognitive processes, such as attention. We examined the homology of frontoparietal networks underlying attention by comparing functional MRI data from macaques and humans performing the same visual search task. Although there are broad similarities, we found fundamental differences between the species. First, humans have more dorsal attention network areas than macaques, indicating that in the course of evolution the human attention system has expanded compared with macaques. Second, potentially homologous areas in the dorsal attention network have markedly different biases toward representing the contralateral hemifield, indicating that the underlying neural architecture of these areas may differ in the most basic of properties, such as receptive field distribution. Third, despite clear evidence of the temporoparietal junction node of the ventral attention network in humans as elicited by this visual search task, we did not find functional evidence of a temporoparietal junction in macaques. None of these differences were the result of differences in training, experimental power, or anatomical variability between the two species. The results of this study indicate that macaque data should be applied to human models of cognition cautiously, and demonstrate how evolution may shape cortical networks.","Attention; Cortex; FMRI; Human; Monkey","animal experiment; Article; brain mapping; brain region; cognition; dorsal attention network; frontoparietal cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; Macaca; nonhuman; priority journal; receptive field; task performance; ventral attention network; adult; animal; animal behavior; attention; brain; brain cortex; female; male; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; physiology; procedures; reaction time; species difference; young adult; Macaca; Adult; Animals; Attention; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Cognition; Female; Humans; Macaca; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Parietal Lobe; Reaction Time; Species Specificity; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84938152531

More importantly, formal analysis of cognitive models is not possible without a well-defined semantics. In prior work we have defined an abstract operational semantics for ACT-R's production system that is suitable for model analysis. It abstracts from details like timings and conflict resolution methods. However, to describe the behavior of ACT-R implementations a more refined semantics is needed. In this paper, we first introduce a new very abstract operational semantics for ACT-R that serves as formal base to compare different semantics. We define an improved version of the abstract semantics as an instance of our new very abstract semantics. Furthermore, we present a more refined operational semantics that also captures details from actual ACT-R implementations. We show that the refined semantics is sound w.r.t. the abstract semantics.

This significant challenge was explored in relation to word reading, where sophisticated computational-cognitive models exist but have made limited contact with neural data. Using distortion-corrected functional MRI and dynamic causal modeling, we investigated the interactions between brain regions dedicated to orthographic, semantic, and phonological processing while participants read words aloud. We found that the lateral anterior temporal lobe exhibited increased activation when participants read words with irregular spellings. This area is implicated in semantic processing but has not previously been considered part of the reading network. We also found meaningful individual differences in the activation of this region: Activity was predicted by an independent measure of the degree to which participants use semantic knowledge to read. These characteristics are predicted by the connectionist Triangle Model of reading and indicate a key role for semantic knowledge in reading aloud. Premotor regions associated with phonological processing displayed the reverse characteristics. Changes in the functional connectivity of the reading network during irregular word reading also were consistent with semantic recruitment. These data support the view that reading aloud is underpinned by the joint operation of two neural pathways. They reveal that (i) the ATL is an important element of the ventral semantic pathway and (ii) the division of labor between the two routes varies according to both the properties of the words being read and individual differences in the degree to which participants rely on each route. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

This chapter highlights developmental changes in sleep architecture and outlines four broad conceptual considerations that are helpful for understanding sleep problems: the two process model emphasizes how the homeostatic and circadian processes work together; the vigilance model emphasizes the need for safety; the 3P model highlights the importance of collecting information about predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors. The accruing evidence for the prevalence and importance of sleep as a risk factor for, and as contributing to, problems relating to affect regulation, cognitive functioning, obesity, behavioural problems and suicide is reviewed. Core components of a sleep assessment are offered. Given that psychosocial treatments for sleep disturbance in children and youth offer simple and powerful tools for clinicians, we describe these methods in detail and also discuss other treatment approaches. In the final section we highlight opportunities for future research in this area, including at the public policy level. © 2015 by JohnWiley & Sons, Ltd.

The first tier made up of body sensors connected to a gateway and the communication technology used in this tier is UWB. The third tier of the architecture is the communication link between the mobile vehicle and the hospital, which is a cognitive radio enabled communications system.

SHARP1/DEC2 has been shown to control sleep length in humans and sleep architecture is also altered in double mutant mice (S1/2-/-). Because of the importance of sleep for memory consolidation, we investigated the role of SHARP1 and SHARP2 in cognitive processing. S1/2-/- mice show enhanced cortex (Cx)-dependent remote fear memory formation as well as improved reversal learning, but do not display alterations in hippocampus (Hi)-dependent recent fear memory formation. SHARP1 and SHARP2 single null mutants do not display any cognitive phenotype supporting functional redundancy of both factors. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed elevated insulin-related growth factor 2 (IGF2) signaling and increased phos-phorylation of MAPK and S6 in the Cx but not the Hi of S1/2-/- mice. No changes were detected in single mutants. Moreover, adeno-associated virus type 2-mediated IGF2 overexpression in the anterior cingulate cortex enhanced remote fear memory formation and the analysis of forebrain-specific double null mutants of the Insulin and IGF1 receptors revealed their essential function for memory formation. Impaired fear memory formation in aged S1/2-/- mice indicates that elevated IGF2 signaling in the long term, however, has a negative impact on cognitive processing. In summary, we conclude that the bHLH transcription factors SHARP1 and SHARP2 are involved in cognitive processing by controlling Igf2 expression and associated signaling cascades. Our analyses provide evidence that the control of sleep and memory consolidation may share common molecular mechanisms.","Aging; Cortex; Insulin-like signaling; MAPK signaling; Memory consolidation","insulin receptor; mitogen activated protein kinase; regulator protein; S6 kinase; somatomedin B; somatomedin C receptor; transcription factor; transcription factor SHARP1; transcription factor SHARP2; unclassified drug; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; Bhlhb3 protein, mouse; Bhlhe40 protein, mouse; homeodomain protein; insulin receptor; mitogen activated protein kinase; somatomedin B; somatomedin binding protein 5; somatomedin C receptor; transcription factor; aged; aging; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal tissue; anterior cingulate; Article; biochemical analysis; brain function; circadian rhythm; cognition; controlled study; enzyme phosphorylation; fear; forebrain; gene overexpression; hippocampus; learning; long term memory; memory consolidation; molecular biology; mouse; mutant; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; transcription regulation; animal; brain cortex; C57BL mouse; gene expression; genetics; knockout mouse; long term memory; metabolism; phosphorylation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; signal transduction; time factor; Western blotting; Adeno-associated virus - 2; Mus; Phos; Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Blotting, Western; Cerebral Cortex; Gene Expression; Homeodomain Proteins; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5; Insulin-Like Growth Factor II; Memory, Long-Term; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Receptor, Insulin; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-84936805629

This recognition is corroborated by inquiries into the neurobiological correlates of addiction, which has indicated that different manifestations of addictive pathology share common neural mechanisms. This review of the literature will explore the feasibility of the somatic marker hypothesis as a unifying explanatory framework of the decision-making deficits that are believed to be involved in addiction development and maintenance. The somatic marker hypothesis provides a neuroanatomical and cognitive framework of decision making, which posits that decisional processes are biased toward long-term prospects by emotional marker signals engendered by a neuronal architecture comprising both cortical and subcortical circuits. Addicts display markedly impulsive and compulsive behavioral patterns that might be understood as manifestations of decision-making processes that fail to take into account the long-term consequences of actions. Evidence demonstrates that substance dependence, pathological gambling, and Internet addiction are characterized by structural and functional abnormalities in neural regions, as outlined by the somatic marker hypothesis. Furthermore, both substance dependents and behavioral addicts show similar impairments on a measure of decision making that is sensitive to somatic marker functioning. The decision-making deficits that characterize addiction might exist a priori to addiction development; however, they may be worsened by ingestion of substances with neurotoxic properties. It is concluded that the somatic marker model of addiction contributes a plausible account of the underlying neurobiology of decision-making deficits in addictive disorders that is supported by the current neuroimaging and behavioral evidence.

The existence of an advanced energy management system is essential for the operation of an autonomous polygeneration microgrid. So far, energy management systems based on a centralized management and control have been developed for the autonomous polygeneration microgrid topology based on computational intelligence approaches. A decentralized management and control energy management system can have important benefits, when taking into consideration the autonomous character of these microgrids. This paper presents the design and investigation of a decentralized energy management system for the autonomous polygeneration microgrid topology. The decentralized energy management system gives the possibility to control each unit of the microgrid independently. The most important advantage of using a decentralized architecture is that the managed microgrid has much higher chances of partial operation in cases when malfunctions occur at different parts of it, instead of a complete system breakdown. The designed system was based on a multi-agent system and employed Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for its implementation. It was then compared through a case study with an existing centralized energy management system. The technical performance of the decentralized solution performance is on par with the existing centralized one, presenting improvements in financial and operational terms for the implementation and operation of an autonomous polygeneration microgrid. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","Decentralized energy management; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps; Microgrids; Multi agent systems; Polygeneration","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Cognitive systems; Desalination; Electric power distribution; Energy management; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Potable water; Topology; Advanced energy management system; Decentralized architecture; Decentralized energy; Decentralized energy management system; Distributed intelligence; Fuzzy cognitive map; Micro grid; Poly-generation; Energy management systems",2-s2.0-84933520959

Hence, the first CR is also referred to as full cognitive radio. However, due to its difficult implementation, the FCC and Simon Haykin separately proposed a very simplified definition, in which CR mainly detects a single parameter, spectrum occupancy, and is also called spectrum sensing cognitive radio. With the rapid development of wireless communications, the infrastructure of a wireless system becomes much more complicated, while the functionality at every node is desired to be as intelligent as possible, say selforganized capability approaching 5G cellular networks. It is then interesting to reconsider Mitola's definition and think whether one could, besides obtaining the on/off status of the licensed user only, achieve more parameters in a cognitive way. In this article, we propose a new cognitive architecture targeting multiple parameters for future cellular networks, which is one step further toward full cognition compared to most existing CR research.

In this architecture, the former is the conventional cellular network, whereas the latter incorporates a range of shorter range cells. Femtocells are designed to coexist alongside macrocells, providing spatial frequency reuse, higher spectrum efficiency, and cover areas where macrocells cannot. Femtocells positioned in the macrocell considerably improve the indoor coverage and provide better user experience. However, interference between the two layers is imminent; therefore, ways to manage it must be employed to efficiently avoid problems such as coverage holes in the macrocells. Essential limits of capacity and attainable data rates also mainly depend on the interference faced by a femtocell network. Recently, cognitive radio (CR), which has the ability to sense its environment and accordingly alter its characteristics, e.g., transmission parameters, has been merged with femtocells to exploit the capabilities of the former in the latter. CR-enabled femtocells in a two-tier network can sense the environment and opportunistically allocate both licensed and unlicensed frequency bands to user equipments to avoid interference. This paper examines interference mitigation in femtocells using CR and provides comprehensive survey of different CR-enabled interference mitigation schemes. Presented schemes such as power control, spectrum access, antenna, and joint schemes are classified before they are compared for pros and cons.

These deficits could serve as effective tools for understanding the genetic architecture of schizophrenia. This study investigated whether genetic variants associated with cognitive impairments aggregate in functional gene networks related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of a range of cognitive phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia were performed in 411 healthy subjects. We attempted to replicate the GWAS data using 257 patients with schizophrenia and performed a meta-analysis of the GWAS findings and the replicated results. Because gene networks, rather than a single gene or genetic variant, may be strongly associated with the susceptibility to schizophrenia and cognitive impairments, gene-network analysis for genes in close proximity to the replicated variants was performed. We observed nominal associations between 3054 variants and cognitive phenotypes at a threshold of P &lt; 1.0 × 10- 4. Of the 3054 variants, the associations of 191 variants were replicated in the replication samples (P &lt;. 05). However, no variants achieved genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis (P &gt; 5.0 × 10- 8). Additionally, 115 of 191 replicated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have genes located within 10 kb of the SNPs (60.2%). These variants were moderately associated with cognitive phenotypes that ranged from P = 2.50 × 10- 5 to P = 9.40 × 10- 8. The genes located within 10 kb from the replicated SNPs were significantly grouped in terms of glutamate receptor activity (false discovery rate (FDR) q = 4.49 × 10- 17) and the immune system related to major histocompatibility complex class I (FDR q = 8.76 × 10- 11) networks.

Hence, the current approach of macrocell mobile networks, where there is no differentiation between indoors and outdoors, needs to be reconsidered. We envision 60 GHz mmWave picocell architecture to support highspeed indoor and hotspot communications. We envisage the 5G indoor network as a combination of, and interplay between, 2.4/5 GHz having robust coverage and 60 GHz links offering a high data rate. This requires intelligent coordination and cooperation. We propose a 60 GHz picocellular network architecture, called CogCell, leveraging ubiquitous WiFi. We propose to use 60 GHz for the data plane and 2.4/5GHz for the control plane. The hybrid network architecture considers an opportunistic fall-back to 2.4/5 GHz in case of poor connectivity in the 60 GHz domain. Further, to avoid the frequent re-beamforming in 60 GHz directional links due to mobility, we propose a cognitive module, a sensor- assisted intelligent beam switching procedure, that reduces communication overhead.

The present study aimed to design and test a theory-based point-of-purchase intervention for coffee shops that reduced the calorie content of customers' purchases by reducing the need for executive function (EF) at the moment of choice. Methods: Key facets of EF were identified by a multidisciplinary group and used to develop a point-of-purchase intervention (signage). This intervention was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a public coffee shop on consumer purchases of &gt;20,000 snacks and drinks over 12 weeks. A sample of customers (n = 128) was recruited to complete an embedded cross-sectional study measuring EF strength, dietary intentions, typical purchases, and purchases made after exposure to the intervention. Results: The proportion of snack purchases that were high in calorie reduced significantly (t(10) = 2.34, p = .04) in intervention weeks relative to control. High calorie drink purchases were also lower in intervention than control weeks, however, this difference was not significant (t(10) = 1.56, p = .15). On average, customers purchased items containing 66 calories &lt; usual after exposure to the intervention. The magnitude of the intervention's positive effect on customer behavior increased as EF strength decreased (β=.24, p = .03).

The user demands are progressively rampant, while application requirements continue to expand in both range and diversity. Future wireless networks, therefore, must be equipped with the ability to handle numerous, albeit challenging, requirements. Network reconfiguration, considered as a prominent network paradigm, is envisioned to play a key role in leveraging future network performance and considerably advancing current user experiences. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of reconfigurable wireless networks and an in-depth analysis of reconfiguration at all layers of the protocol stack. Such networks characteristically possess the ability to reconfigure and adapt their hardware and software components and architectures, thus enabling flexible delivery of broad services, as well as sustaining robust operation under highly dynamic conditions. The paper offers a unifying framework for research in reconfigurable wireless networks. This should provide the reader with a holistic view of concepts, methods, and strategies in reconfigurable wireless networks. Focus is given to reconfigurable systems in relatively new and emerging research areas such as cognitive radio networks, cross-layer reconfiguration, and software-defined networks. In addition, modern networks have to be intelligent and capable of self-organization. Thus, this paper discusses the concept of network intelligence as a means to enable reconfiguration in highly complex and dynamic networks. Key processes in network intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and context awareness, are presented to illustrate how these methods can take reconfiguration to a new level. Finally, the paper is supported with several examples and case studies showing the tremendous impact of reconfiguration on wireless networks. © 2015 IEEE.","Cognitive radio networks; context awareness; cross-layer reconfiguration; learning; machine-to-machine communications; network intelligence; reconfigurable networks; software-defined networks","Automation; Cognitive radio; Cognitive systems; Complex networks; Wireless networks; Cognitive radio network; Context- awareness; Cross layer; learning; Machine-to-machine communications; Network intelligence; Reconfigurable network; Software-defined networks; Network layers",2-s2.0-85027949618

German syntax seems to challenge this assumption, because verb position depends on tense and aspect. To examine how German speakers link these elements, a structural priming study was performed which varied syntactic structure, verb position (encoded by tense and aspect), and verb overlap. Abstract structural priming was found, both within and across verb position, but priming was larger when the verb position was the same between prime and target. Priming was boosted by verb overlap, but there was no interaction with verb position. The results can be explained by a lemma model where tense and aspect are linked to structural choices in German. Since the architecture of this lemma model is not consistent with results from English, a connectionist model was developed which could explain the cross-linguistic variation in the production system. Together, these findings support the view that language learning plays an important role in determining the nature of structural priming in different languages. © 2014 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.","Connectionist neural network; German dative alternation; Learning; Lemma; Sentence production; Structural priming","adolescent; adult; artificial neural network; female; human; language; learning; linguistics; male; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Language; Learning; Linguistics; Male; Neural Networks (Computer); Young Adult",2-s2.0-84936944967

Philosophical work on brain phenomena, and their explanation, will need to be highly sensitive to the precise parameters of these empirical findings. We are neither our neurons (the neuron is not an epistemic subject), our genes (we have no special cells), nor our synapses (we are not an electrochemical control room). Our brain is not computational because the neuron changes with each connection, modifying in turn the architecture of the connections. A material process of change in the strength of the connections that might explain how simple brain matter becomes Higher-Order Thought. We are not 'brains in a vat' because we are immersed in a socio-cultural environment where experience shapes us through a Darwinian process of 'creative destruction-selection.' We are therefore our connectome, which seems to be our pragmatic identity, a mixed material-mental form, or rather, a set of 'intentions in action'. The findings of recent experimental studies confirm this view. The enhancement of abstract reasoning, both inductive and deductive, in new tasks of problem-solving makes intelligence fluid, not directly dependent on our experience, our historical-evolutionary baggage: A process that could be defined as 'value-coding,' which Darwin called 'forgotten reasons.' The study, then, of global intelligence (both fluid and crystallized) refutes the hypothesis of higher cognitive abilities being related to connections that are highly and permanently connected. On the contrary, the level of intelligence is correlated with the ability to transfer information to distant areas of the brain by weak connections, that are flexible and adaptable. This shows that the secret of intelligence lies in the plasticity of the adaptation processes, in the ability to incorporate in the present act the variability of the past history of the mind, in other words, a 'flexible nested brain mind'. As a corollary, neuroscience now encompasses plausible theories in many domains, including the mind, especially since the weight of evidence indicates that mental processes actually are processes of the brain. In short, the mind is not a non-physical entity.","Brain; Connectome; Evolution; Intelligence; Materialism",,2-s2.0-85012070658

While he believes that cognitive science can only explain the lower faculties of the mind, evolutionary psychology seizes on the notion of modularity and transforms it into the radical claim that the mind is modular all the way up. By comparison, recent approaches that take cognition to be embodied and situated have renewed the radical criticism of faculties or modules that was dominant from the nineteenth century onward. The concept of module is a naturalized successor of the traditional concept of faculty, as this chapter shows, and the debate about modules is centrally a debate about the possibility of naturalizing the mind. © Oxford University Press 2015.

In the latter case, an agent may take advantage of the cooperative collision avoidance, given that it possesses recursive cognition, i.e., the agent’s decisions depend on the decisions made by humans that in turn depend on the agent’s decisions. To deal with this high-level cognitive skill, we propose a neural network architecture implementing Prediction-for-CompAction paradigm. The network predicts possible human–agent collisions and compacts the time dimension by projecting a given dynamic situation into a static map. Thereby emerging compact cognitive map can be readily used as a “dynamic GPS” for planning actions or mental evaluation of the convenience of cooperation in a given context. We provide numerical evidence that cooperation yields additional room for more efficient navigation in cluttered pedestrian flows, and the agent can choose path to the target significantly shorter than a robot treated by humans as a functional machine. Moreover, the navigation safety, i.e., the chances to avoid accidental collisions, increases under cooperation. Remarkably, these benefits yield no additional load to the mean society effort. Thus, the proposed strategy is socially compliant, and the humanoid agent can behave as “one of us.” © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cognition; Compact cognitive maps; Decision making; Dynamic GPS; Navigation in dynamic situations; Nonlinear dynamics","Cognitive systems; Compaction; Decision making; Dynamics; Global positioning system; Mobile agents; Mobile robots; Navigation; Network architecture; Cognition; Cognitive maps; Cooperative collision avoidance; Functional machines; Human-like agents; Navigation safety; Numerical evidence; Social environment; Robots; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; cognition; computer simulation; human; physiology; procedures; social environment; spatial orientation; Cognition; Computer Simulation; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated; Social Environment; Spatial Navigation",2-s2.0-84929949782

Correlations between network properties and clinical variables were tested. Both the PD and control groups showed small-world architecture in brain functional networks. However, the PD patients had lower clustering coefficient and local efficiency relative to control subjects, indicating disrupted topologic organization and a shift toward randomization in their functional brain network. At node and connection level, reduced node centralities and connectivity strength were found mainly in temporal-occipital regions and also in sensorimotor regions of PD patients. In PD patients, altered global network properties correlated with cognitive function, while motor impairment was correlated with local connection changes.

Concepts from Scherer’s appraisal model and stimulation evaluation checks, along with a framework of emotion contexts proposed by Coulson (An everything but framework for modelling emotion.

In the wake of the recent shift of emphasis to user experience, the cognition-based action cycle is deemed inadequate to explicate affective experiences, such as happiness, joy and surprise.

We characterized the sleep-wake cycle in the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD, which overexpresses a mutant human form of amyloid precursor protein resulting in high levels of β-amyloid and plaque formation by 3 months of age. Polysomnographic recordings in freely-moving mice were conducted to study sleep-wake cycle architecture at 3, 7 and 11 months of age and corresponding levels of β-amyloid in brain regions regulating sleep-wake states were measured. At all ages, TgCRND8 mice showed increased wakefulness and reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the resting and active phases. Increased wakefulness in TgCRND8 mice was accompanied by a shift in the waking power spectrum towards fast frequency oscillations in the beta (14-20 Hz) and low gamma range (20-50 Hz). Given the phenotype of hyperarousal observed in TgCRND8 mice, the role of noradrenergic transmission in the promotion of arousal, and previous work reporting an early disruption of the noradrenergic system in TgCRND8, we tested the effects of the alpha-1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, prazosin, on sleep-wake patterns in TgCRND8 and non-transgenic (NTg) mice. We found that a lower dose (2 mg/kg) of prazosin increased NREM sleep in NTg but not in TgCRND8 mice, whereas a higher dose (5 mg/kg) increased NREM sleep in both genotypes, suggesting altered sensitivity to noradrenergic blockade in TgCRND8 mice. Collectively our results demonstrate that amyloidosis in TgCRND8 mice is associated with sleep-wake cycle dysfunction, characterized by hyperarousal, validating this model as a tool towards understanding the relationship between β-amyloid overproduction and disrupted sleep-wake patterns in AD. © 2015 Colby-Milley et al.

Methods: Women with morbid obesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2] were recruited for a treatment of supported exercise paired with either a cognitive–behavioral or an educational approach to eating change over 6 months. They were classified as either successful with (i.e., at least 5 % loss; n = 40) or failed at (no loss, or weight gain; n = 43) weight loss. Discriminate function analysis incorporated theory-based models of 1 (self-efficacy), 5 (self-efficacy, self-regulation, mood, physical self-concept, body satisfaction), and 3 (self-efficacy, self-regulation, mood) psychosocial predictors at both month 6, and change from baseline–month 6. Results: All three models significantly discriminated weight-loss success/failure (66, 88, and 87 % for success; and 81, 87, and 88 % for failure, respectively). Self-regulation had the strongest correlations within the multi-predictor models (0.90–0.96), and all variables entered were above the standard of 0.30 set for relevance.

International contributors present cutting-edge research from cognitive and developmental psychology, neuropsychology, psycholinguistics and computer science, and discuss how this contributes to neuropsycholinguistics, a term coined by Jean-Luc Nespoulous, to whom this book is dedicated. Chapters illustrate how researchers with different methods and theoretical backgrounds can contribute to a unified vision of the study of language cognition. Reinterpreting neuropsycholinguistics through the lens of each research field, the book demonstrates important attempts to adopt a comprehensive view of speech and language pathology. Divided into three sections the book covers: linguistic mechanisms and the architecture of language the relationship between language and other cognitive processes the assessment of speech and language disabilities and compensatory mechanisms. Neuropsycholinguistic Perspectives on Language Cognition presents a unique contribution to cognitive science and language science, from linguistics to neuroscience.

The overarching purpose of the presented study was to explore available tools for integrating intelligent tutoring communications in game-based learning platforms and to examine theory-based techniques for delivering explicit feedback in such environments. The primary tool influencing the design of this research was the open-source Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), a modular domain-independent architecture that provides the tools and methods to author, deliver, and evaluate intelligent tutoring technologies within any instructional domain. Influenced by research surrounding social cognitive theory and cognitive load theory, the resulting experiment tested varying approaches for utilizing an Embodied Pedagogical Agent (EPA) to function as a tutor during interaction in a game-based training environment. Conditions were authored to assess the tradeoffs between embedding an EPA directly in a game, embedding an EPA in GIFT's browser-based Tutor-User Interface (TUI), or using audio prompts alone with no social grounding. The resulting data supported the application of using an EPA embedded in GIFT's TUI to provide explicit feedback during a game-based learning event. Analyses revealed conditions with an EPA situated in the TUI to be as effective as embedding the agent directly in the game environment.","Cognitive load; Explicit feedback; Game-based training; Generalized intelligent framework for tutoring; Intelligent tutoring systems; Pedagogical agents","Cognitive systems; Computer aided instruction; Education; Education computing; Intelligent agents; Teaching; User interfaces; Cognitive loads; Explicit feedback; Game-based trainings; Generalized intelligent framework for tutoring; Intelligent tutoring system; Pedagogical agents; Game theory",2-s2.0-84930934391

Developing robotic systems with mental simulation and imitation learning abilities for such tasks seems a promising way to enhance robot performance as well as to enable interactions with humans in a social context. In spite of important advances in artificial intelligence and smart robotics, current robotic systems lack the flexibility and adaptability that humans so naturally exhibit. Here we present and study a neural architecture that captures some critical visuo-spatial transformations that are required for the cognitive processes of mental simulation and imitation. The results show that our neural model can perform accurate, flexible and robust 3D unimanual and bimanual actual/imagined reaching movements while avoiding extreme joint positions and generating kinematics similar to those observed with humans. In addition, using visuo-spatial transformations, the neural model was able to observe/imitate bimanual arm reaching movements independently of the viewpoint, distance and anthropometry between the demonstrator and imitator. Our model is a first step towards developing a more advanced neurally-inspired hierarchical architecture that integrates mental simulation and sensorimotor processing as it learns to imitate dexterous bimanual arm movements. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bimanual reaching movements; Internal models; Inverse kinematics; Mental simulation; Motor learning; Movement imitation; Neural network models","Artificial intelligence; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Inverse kinematics; Kinematics; Network architecture; Internal models; Mental simulation; Motor learning; Movement imitation; Neural network model; Reaching movements; Robotics",2-s2.0-84930628469

Abnormalities in white matter tracts that interconnect brain regions may be directly relevant to this pathophysiological process. As a complex mental disorder with high heritability, mapping abnormalities in patients and their first-degree relatives may help to disentangle the risk factors for schizophrenia. We established a weighted network model of white matter connections using diffusion tensor imaging in 25 nuclear families with schizophrenic probands (19 patients and 41 unaffected parents) and two unrelated groups of normal controls (24 controls matched with patients and 26 controls matched with relatives). The patient group showed lower global efficiency and local efficiency. The decreased regional efficiency was localized in hubs such as the bilateral frontal cortices, bilateral anterior cingulate cortices, and left precuneus. The global efficiency was negatively correlated with cognition scores derived from a 5-factor model of schizophrenic psychopathology. We also found that unaffected parents displayed decreased regional efficiency in the right temporal cortices, left supplementary motor area, left superior temporal pole, and left thalamus. The global efficiency tended to be lower in unaffected parents. Our data suggest that (1) the global efficiency loss in neuroanatomical networks may be associated with the cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia; and (2) genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia may influence the anatomical organization of an individual’s brain networks. © 2015, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","diffusion tensor imaging; network analysis; small-world architecture; tractography; white matter","chlorpromazine; neuroleptic agent; adult; anterior cingulate; Article; brain function; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; drug substitution; female; frontal cortex; genetic association; human; imaging software; male; mental patient; nerve cell network; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; neuropathology; nuclear family; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; parent; precuneus; psychopharmacotherapy; schizophrenia; superior temporal gyrus; supplementary motor area; temporal cortex; thalamus; vulnerable population; white matter; young adult; biological model; brain; brain mapping; nerve cell network; pathology; procedures; risk factor; schizophrenia; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Parents; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; White Matter; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84930273378

Individuals at a lower level of moral reasoning judge moral issues mainly based on self-interest (personal interests schema) or based on adherence to laws and rules (maintaining norms schema), whereas individuals at the post-conventional level judge moral issues based on deeper principles and shared ideals. However, the extent to which moral development is reflected in structural brain architecture remains unknown. To investigate this question, we used voxel-based morphometry and examined the brain structure in a sample of 67 Master of Business Administration (MBA) students. Subjects completed the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2) which measures moral development in terms of cognitive schema preference. Results demonstrate that subjects at the post-conventional level of moral reasoning were characterized by increased gray matter volume in the entromedial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, compared with subjects at a lower level of moral reasoning. Our findings support an important role for both cognitive and emotional processes in moral reasoning and provide first evidence for individual differences in brain structure according to the stages of moral reasoning first proposed by Kohlberg decades ago. © 2015 Prehn et al.

Among hormones closely related to the nervous system, thyroid hormones (THs) are critical for the development and function of the CNS; not only for neuronal cells but also for glial development and differentiation. Any impairment of TH supply to the developing CNS causes severe and irreversible changes in the overall architecture and function of the human brain, leading to various neurological dysfunctions. In the adult brain, impairment of THs, such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, can cause psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression. Although impact of hypothyroidism on synaptic transmission and plasticity is known, its effect on glial cells and related cellular mechanisms remain enigmatic. This mini-review article summarizes how THs are transported into the brain, metabolized in astrocytes and affect microglia and oligodendrocytes, demonstrating an example of glioendocrine system.

The key insight is that current deliberate cued retrieval mechanisms require the agent to have knowledge of when and what to retrieve - knowledge that may be missing or incorrect. Spontaneous uncued retrieval eliminates these requirements through automatic retrievals that use the agent's problem solving context as a heuristic for relevance, thus supplementing deliberate cued retrieval. Using constraints derived from this insight, we sketch the space of spontaneous retrieval mechanisms and describe an implementation of spontaneous retrieval in Soar together with an agent that takes advantage of that mechanism. Empirical evidence is provided in the Missing Link word-puzzle domain, where agents using spontaneous retrieval out-perform agents without that capability, leading us to conclude that spontaneous retrieval can be a useful mechanism and is worth further exploration.

We hypothesized that cognitive impairment may result from dysfunction in large-scale brain networks, particularly those involved in attentional control. Methods: Using a case-control design, this study includes women with a history of invasive ductal or lobular triple-negative breast cancer who completed standard adjuvant chemotherapy within 2 years of study entry. Women who reported cognitive impairment by the Global Rating of Cognition question were considered to be cases (n = 15). Women who reported no cognitive impairment were considered to be controls (n = 13). All enrolled participants were eligible for MRI investigation and underwent resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Results: Women who self-reported cognitive impairment were found to have disrupted resting-state functional connectivity, as measured by MRI, when compared to women who did not self-report cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that some women may be more sensitive to the standard treatments for breast cancer and that this increased sensitivity may result in functional connectivity alterations in the brain networks supporting attention and executive function.

Without existing knowledge, learning either needs to be explorative and, thus, slow or-to be more efficient-it needs to rely on supervision, which may not always be available. However, once some knowledge base exists an agent can make use of it to improve learning efficiency and speed. This happens for our children at the age of around three when they very quickly begin to assimilate new information by making guided guesses how this fits to their prior knowledge. This is a very efficient generative learning mechanism in the sense that the existing knowledge is generalized into as-yet unexplored, novel domains. So far generative learning has not been employed for robots and robot learning remains to be a slow and tedious process. The goal of the current study is to devise for the first time a general framework for a generative process that will improve learning and which can be applied at all different levels of the robot's cognitive architecture. To this end, we introduce the concept of structural bootstrapping-borrowed and modified from child language acquisition-to define a probabilistic process that uses existing knowledge together with new observations to supplement our robot's data-base with missing information about planning-, object-, as well as, action-relevant entities. In a kitchen scenario, we use the example of making batter by pouring and mixing two components and show that the agent can efficiently acquire new knowledge about planning operators, objects as well as required motor pattern for stirring by structural bootstrapping. Some benchmarks are shown, too, that demonstrate how structural bootstrapping improves performance. © 2015 IEEE.","Fast learning; generative model; knowledge acquisition","Benchmarking; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Robots; Cognitive architectures; Fast learning; Generative mechanism; Generative model; Language acquisition; Learning efficiency; Missing information; Probabilistic process; Robot programming",2-s2.0-84933498327

In this paper, we conduct the first detailed, empirical performance comparison of three representative routing protocols for CRNs, under the same realistic set of assumptions. Our extensive simulation study shows that the performance of routing protocols in CRNs is affected by a number of factors, in addition to PU activity, some of which have been largely ignored by the majority of previous works.

In the white region, SUs can exploit spatial spectrum opportunities and transmit at any time by taking advantage of their long distances from the primary users (PUs), without causing severe interference to PUs. Moreover, the existence condition of the transition zone between the gray region and the white region is theoretically analyzed, where power control should be implemented in SUs. Closed-form bounds of three regions are obtained, which can be used in space-time spectrum sensing and access in CRNs. Finally, we provide numerical results to evaluate the relations among the key parameters in the three regions. © 2014 IEEE.","Cognitive Radio (Cr) Networks; Space-Time Spectrum Holes; Three Regions","Transportation; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio networks (CRNs); Existence conditions; Numerical results; Space time; Spectrum utilization; Three Regions; Transition zones; Cognitive radio",2-s2.0-84933049377

To become effective teammates, robots must possess profound understanding of an environment, be able to reason about the desired commands and goals within a specific context, and be able to communicate with human teammates in a clear and natural way. To address these challenges, we have developed an intelligence architecture that combines cognitive components to carry out high-level cognitive tasks, semantic perception to label regions in the world, and a natural language component to reason about the command and its relationship to the objects in the world. This paper describes recent developments using this architecture on a fielded mobile robot platform operating in unknown urban environments.

Previous hybrid analog CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in situ plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit simulations.

However, in order to behave differently in response to someone else's race, you must first categorise that person as other-race. The current study investigates the process of race-categorisation. Two groups of participants, Asian and Caucasian, rapidly classified facial images that varied from strongly Asian, through racially intermediate, to strongly Caucasian. In agreement with previous findings, there was a difference in category boundary between the two groups. Asian participants more frequently judged intermediate images as Caucasian and vice versa. We fitted a decision model, the Ratcliff diffusion model, to our two choice reaction time data. This model provides an account of the processes thought to underlie binary choice decisions. Within its architecture it has two components that could reasonably lead to a difference in race category boundary, these being evidence accumulation rate and a priori bias. The latter is the expectation or prior belief that a participant brings to the task, whilst the former indexes sensitivity to race-dependent perceptual cues. Whilst we find no good evidence for a difference in a priori bias between our two groups, we do find evidence for a difference in evidence accumulation rate. Our Asian participants were more sensitive to Caucasian cues within the images than were our Caucasian participants (and vice versa). These results support the idea that differences in perceptual sensitivity to race-defining visual characteristics drive differences in race categorisation. We propose that our findings fit with a wider view in which perceptual adaptation plays a central role in the visual processing of own and other race. © 2015 The Authors.","Adaptation; Cognitive modelling; Diffusion model; Other-race; Perception; Race categorisation","adult; Article; Asian; association; Caucasian; classification; controlled study; decision support system; face; female; human; male; perception; priority journal; race; race categorization; race diffusion model; response time; ancestry group; decision making; pattern recognition; perception; photostimulation; physiology; recognition; theoretical model; young adult; Adult; Continental Population Groups; Decision Making; Face; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Recognition (Psychology); Social Perception; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84925248768

This is still far from reaching the US National Healthy People 2020 goal of 90% hospitals vaccination rates. The reported increase in coverage is attributed to the growing number of healthcare facilities with vaccination requirements with average rates of 96.5%. However, a few other public health interventions stir so much controversy and debate as vaccination mandates. The opposition stems from the belief that a mandatory flu shot policy violates an individual right to refuse unwanted treatment. This article outlines the historic push to achieve higher vaccination rates among healthcare professionals and a number of ethical issues arising from attempts to implement vaccination mandates. It then turns to a review of cognitive biases relevant in the context of decisions about influenza vaccination (omission bias, ambiguity aversion, present bias etc.) The article suggests that a successful strategy for policy-makers and others hoping to increase vaccination rates is to design a ""choice architecture"" that influences behavior of healthcare professionals without foreclosing other options.

We tested the idea that these two tasks - place recognition and heading retrieval - might be mediated by distinct cognitive systems in mice. Previous work has shown that numerous species, including young children and rodents, use the geometric shape of local space to regain their sense of direction after disorientation, often ignoring nongeometric cues even when they are informative. Notably, these experiments have almost always been performed in single-chamber environments in which there is no ambiguity about place identity. We examined the navigational behavior of mice in a two-chamber paradigm in which animals had to both recognize the chamber in which they were located (place recognition) and recover their facing direction within that chamber (heading retrieval). In two experiments, we found that mice used nongeometric features for place recognition, but simultaneously failed to use these same features for heading retrieval, instead relying exclusively on spatial geometry. These results suggest the existence of separate systems for place recognition and heading retrieval in mice that are differentially sensitive to geometric and nongeometric cues. We speculate that a similar cognitive architecture may underlie human navigational behavior. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

To determine the precise chronology for sleep physiology alterations and other sensory, motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms of HD, the same R6/1 HD transgenics and their wild-type littermates were recorded monthly for sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) together with a wide range of behavioral tests according to a longitudinal plan. We found an early and progressive deterioration of both sleep architecture and EEG brain rhythms in R6/1 mice, which are correlated timely with their spatial working memory impairments. Sleep fragmentation and memory impairments were accompanied by the loss of delta (1-4Hz) power in the transgenic mice, the magnitude of which increased with age and disease progression. These precocious sleep and cognitive impairments were followed by deficits in social behavior, sensory and motor abilities. Our data confirm the existence and importance of sleep physiology alterations in the widely used R6/1 mouse line and highlight their precedence over other plethoric phenotypic changes.

Such information is required to be able to navigate to goal locations, and is vitally important for any embodied agent, or model thereof, for reaching goals in a spatially extended environment. In this paper, a number of computationally implemented cognitive models of spatial memory are reviewed and compared. Three categories of models are considered: symbolic models, neural network models, and models that are part of a systems-level cognitive architecture. Representative models from each category are described and compared in a number of dimensions along which simulation models can differ (level of modeling, types of representation, structural accuracy, generality and abstraction, environment complexity), including their possible mapping to the underlying neural substrate. Neural mappings are rarely explicated in the context of behaviorally validated models, but they could be useful to cognitive modeling research by providing a new approach for investigating a model's plausibility. Finally, suggested experimental neuroscience methods are described for verifying the biological plausibility of computational cognitive models of spatial memory, and open questions for the field of spatial memory modeling are outlined. © 2015.","Computational cognitive modeling; Spatial memory models","Complex networks; Mapping; Neural networks; Cognitive architectures; Computational cognitive modeling; Environment complexity; Neural network model; Neural substrates; Spatial informations; Spatial memory; Three categories; Cognitive systems; accuracy; ACT R S model; allocentric spatial memory; artificial neural network; BBB model; border cell; boundary vector cell; brain cell; brain mapping; Casimir model; CLARION model; cognition; computational cognitive model; computer model; computer simulation; DP model; egocentric spatial memory; grid cell; head direction cell; human; Hybrid Spatial Semantic Hierarchy model; learning; LIDA model; machine learning; medical research; memory; motivation; navigation space; NAVIGATOR model; neural mapping; neuroanatomy; neurophysiology; nonhuman; perceptual wayfinding model; place cell; precuneus; reinforcement learning; retrosplenial cortex; Review; reward based learning; robotics; simultaneous localization and mapping approach; SNN model; space; spatial memory; spatial representation; state dependent learning; structural accuracy; symbolic spatial memory model; animal; biological model; brain; cognition; physiology; spatial orientation; Animals; Brain; Cognition; Humans; Models, Neurological; Spatial Memory; Spatial Navigation",2-s2.0-84922255856

It has been realized that the network architecture, algorithms, and protocols cannot be simply designed without considering the socio-economic aspects involved. In this article, we consider the economic issues in cognitive cellular networks from the perspectives of game theoretic modeling and mechanism design.

We performed a family-based low-density genome-wide association analysis of age at onset (AAO) in AD (244 patients and their relatives) using Illumina 6 K single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) panel and the FBAT-logrank statistic. We observed 10 SNPs associated with AAO in AD with p &lt; 2 × 10−3. The most significant hit within a known gene, the neuronal protein astrotactin 2 (ASTN2), was SNP rs1334071 (p = 8.74 × 10−4). ASTN2 has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including cognitive disorders, autism and schizophrenia. We then conducted a replication study focusing on ASTN2 gene in a Canadian sample of 791 AD patients and 782 controls using the logrank test. Five ASTN2 SNPs (highest association is rs16933774 with p = 0.0053) showed associations with AAO in this Canadian sample (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of SNP rs16933774 showed that the AAO of AD in individuals heterozygous for AG genotype of rs16933774 (median of AAO = 68.5 years) was approximately 4.5 years earlier than those individuals having the AA genotype (median of AAO = 73 years). In conclusion, a significant association of ASTN2 genetic variants with AAO of AD in two independent samples demonstrates a role for ASTN2 in the pathogenesis of AD.

Instead, it seems that humans can process nonsymbolic ratio magnitudes via perceptual routes and without recourse to conscious symbolic algorithms, analogous to the processing of whole number magnitudes.

In order to study potential language differences in the neural networks that support reading skill, we collected fMRI data from readers of alphabetic (English) and morpho-syllabic (Chinese) writing systems during two reading tasks. In one, participants read short stories under conditions that approximate natural reading, and in the other, participants decided whether individual stimuli were real words or not. Prior work comparing these two writing systems has overwhelmingly used meta-linguistic tasks, generally supporting the conclusion that the reading system is organized differently for skilled readers of Chinese and English. We observed that language differences in the reading network were greatly dependent on task. In lexical decision, a pattern consistent with prior research was observed in which the Middle Frontal Gyrus (MFG) and right Fusiform Gyrus (rFFG) were more active for Chinese than for English, whereas the posterior temporal sulcus was more active for English than for Chinese. We found a very different pattern of language effects in a naturalistic reading paradigm, during which significant differences were only observed in visual regions not typically considered specific to the reading network, and the middle temporal gyrus, which is thought to be important for direct mapping of orthography to semantics. Indeed, in areas that are often discussed as supporting distinct cognitive or linguistic functions between the two languages, we observed interaction. Specifically, language differences were most pronounced in MFG and rFFG during the lexical decision task, whereas no language differences were observed in these areas during silent reading of text for comprehension. © 2015 Wang et al.

Recent research has demonstrated an APOE e{open}4-mediated modulation of intrinsic functional brain networks in cognitively normal individuals. However, it remains largely unknown whether and how APOE e{open}4 affects the brain's functional network architecture in patients with AD. Using resting-state functional MRI and graph-theory approaches, we systematically investigated the topological organization of whole-brain functional networks in 16 APOE e{open}4 carriers and 26 matched noncarriers with AD at three levels: global whole-brain, intermediate module, and regional node/connection. Neuropsychological analysis showed that the APOE e{open}4 carriers performed worse on delayed memory but better on a late item generation of a verbal fluency task (associated with executive function) than noncarriers. Whole-brain graph analyses revealed that APOE e{open}4 significantly disrupted whole-brain topological organization as characterized by (i) reduced parallel information transformation efficiency; (ii) decreased intramodular connectivity within the posterior default mode network (pDMN) and intermodular connectivity of the pDMN and executive control network (ECN) with other neuroanatomical systems; and (iii) impaired functional hubs and their rich-club connectivities that primarily involve the pDMN, ECN, and sensorimotor systems. Further simulation analysis indicated that these altered connectivity profiles of the pDMN and ECN largely accounted for the abnormal global network topology. Finally, the changes in network topology exhibited significant correlations with the patients' cognitive performances.

Within current computational models of word recognition, there are a number of different approaches to the representation of lexical knowledge. Structural lexical representations, found in original theories of word recognition, have been instantiated in modern localist models. However, such a representational scheme lacks neural plausibility in terms of economy and flexibility. Connectionist models have therefore adopted distributed representations of form and meaning. Semantic representations in connectionist models necessarily encode lexical knowledge. Yet when equipped with recurrent connections, connectionist models can also develop attractors for familiar forms that function as lexical representations. Current behavioural, neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence shows a clear role for semantic information, but also suggests some modality- and task-specific lexical representations. A variety of connectionist architectures could implement these distributed functional representations, and further experimental and simulation work is required to discriminate between these alternatives.

The contribution of this study is two-fold. On one hand, it allows to explicitly handle decision-making problems with numerical features, where the target object could activate multiple regions at the same time. On the other hand, in such granular networks the three-way decision rules are used to design the topology of the map, addressing in some sense the inherent limitations in the expression and architecture of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. Moreover, we propose a learning methodology using Harmony Search for adjusting the model parameters, leading to a parameter-free decision model where the human intervention is not required. A comparative analysis with standard classifiers and recently proposed rough recognition models is conducted in order to show the effectiveness of the proposal. © 2015.","Fuzzy Cognitive Maps; Rough Cognitive Networks; Three-way decision rules","Cognitive systems; Decision making; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Rough set theory; Semantics; Cognitive network; Comparative analysis; Decision rules; Decision-making problem; Discrete attributes; Fuzzy cognitive map; Inherent limitations; Reasoning mechanism; Decision theory",2-s2.0-84949255636

The results have been obtained during the ongoing FP7 European funded project Intelligent Surgical Robotics (I-SUR). The main goal of the project is to demonstrate that autonomous robotic surgical systems can carry out simple surgical tasks effectively and without major intervention by surgeons. To fulfil this goal, we have developed innovative solutions (both in terms of technologies and algorithms) for the following aspects: fabrication of soft organ models starting from CT images, surgical planning and execution of movement of robot arms in contact with a deformable environment, designing a surgical interface minimizing the cognitive load of the surgeon supervising the actions, intra-operative sensing and reasoning to detect normal transitions and unexpected events. All these technologies have been integrated using a component-based software architecture to control a novel robot designed to perform the surgical actions under study.

In order to detect the presence of primary users, one of the fundamental tasks that a CR equipment has to perform is spectrum sensing process. In this paper, a hybrid spectrum sensing architecture is proposed, which consists of the concatenation of a sequential energy detection (SED) and a cyclostationary-based (CB) detector. The former sensing method is performed to reduce spectrum sensing time, when the SNR is very high (resp. very low), while the latter sensing detector is performed whenever the SED does not guarantee the required quality of detection (i.e. moderate SNR regime).

In the presence of strong blockers, the intermodulation distortion can deteriorate the spectrum sensing performance by causing false alarms and degrading the detection probability. We theoretically analyze the impact of third-order non-linearities on the detection and false alarm probabilities for both energy detectors and cyclostationary detectors under front-end LNA non-linearities. We show that degradation of the detection performance due to nonlinearities of both energy and cyclostationary detection is strongly dependent on the modulation type of the blockers. We then propose two DSP-enhanced receiver architectures to compensate the impact of nonlinearities. The first approach is a post-processing technique which compensates for nonlinearities effect on the test statistic by adapting the sensing time and detection threshold. The second approach is a pre-processing method that compensates by correcting received samples prior to computing the test statistic. This approach is based on adaptively estimating the intermodulation distortion, weighting it by a scalar constant and subtracting it from the subband of interest. We propose a method to adaptively compute the optimal weighting coefficient and show that it depends on the power and modulation of the blockers. Our results show that the pre-processing sample-based compensation method is more effective and that clear dynamic range extension can be obtained by using intermodulation compensation without resorting to increasing the sensing time.

It plays a crucial role in higher cognitive processes and is an endophenotype for several disorders. However, the genetic underpinnings of complex relational processing have not been investigated. Using the classical twin model, we estimated the heritability of RC and genetic overlap with intelligence (IQ), reasoning, and working memory in a twin and sibling sample aged 15-29 years (N = 787). Further, in an exploratory search for genetic loci contributing to RC, we examined associated genetic markers and genes in our Discovery sample and selected loci for replication in four independent samples (ALSPAC, LBC1936, NTR, NCNG), followed by meta-analysis (N>6500) at the single marker level. Twin modelling showed RC is highly heritable (67%), has considerable genetic overlap with IQ (59%), and is a major component of genetic covariation between reasoning and working memory (72%). At the molecular level, we found preliminary support for four single-marker loci (one in the gene DGKB), and at a gene-based level for the NPS gene, having influence on cognition. These results indicate that genetic sources influencing relational processing are a key component of the genetic architecture of broader cognitive abilities.

The path shape and timing implicitly embeds aspects of the architecture behind this process. Here, locomotion paths were investigated during a simple task of walking to and from a goal, by looking at the evolution of the position of the human on a horizontal (x,y) plane. We found that the path while walking to a goal was not the same as that while returning from it. Forward-return paths were systematically separated by 0.5-1.9m, or about 5% of the goal distance. We show that this path separation occurs as a consequence of anticipating the desired body orientation at the goal while keeping the target in view. The magnitude of this separation was strongly influenced by the bearing angle (difference between body orientation and angle to goal) and the final orientation imposed at the goal. This phenomenon highlights the impact of a trade-off between a directional perceptual apparatus - eyes in the head on the shoulders - and and physiological limitations, in the formation of human locomotion paths.

These recoded signals are launched by a transmitting power which is the harvested energy per a time interval. Based on the energy harvesting architectures that have been studied, two operation protocols are proposed: UCCN with Power Splitting architecture (UCCN-PS), and UCCN with Time Switching architecture (UCCN-TS). The best cooperative relay in both protocols is taken to be the one that satisfies the following conditions: maximum harvested energy, and maximum decoding capacity. As a result of the best relay selection, the signal quality of the selected link from the best relay to the destination is enhanced by the maximum harvested energy. The system performance of the secondary network in the UCCN-PS and UCCN-TS protocols is analyzed and evaluated by the exact closed-form outage probabilities and throughput analyses over Rayleigh fading channels. The Monte Carlo simulation method is performed to verify the theoretical expressions. Evaluations based on outage probability and throughput show that the system performance of the secondary network in the UCCN-PS and UCCN-TS protocols improves when the number of cooperative relays and the interference constraint increase as well as when the primary receiver is farther from the transmitting nodes such as the source and relays of the secondary network. In addition, the throughput performance of the UCCN-PS protocol outperforms that of the UCCN-TS protocol. Finally, the effects of the power splitting ratio, energy harvesting time, energy conversion efficiency, target Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and location of cooperative relays on the system performance of the secondary network are presented and discussed.

In this review article, we propose that the learning process during the cognitive training can be facilitated by an assistive system monitoring cognitive workloads using electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers, and the brain connectome approach can provide additional valuable biomarkers for facilitating leaners' learning processes. For the purpose, we will introduce studies on the cognitive training interventions, EEG biomarkers for cognitive workload, and human brain connectome. As cognitive overload and mental fatigue would reduce or even eliminate gains of cognitive training interventions, a real-time monitoring of cognitive workload can facilitate the learning process by flexibly adjusting difficulty levels of the training task. Moreover, cognitive training interventions should have effects on brain sub-networks, not on a single brain region, and graph theoretical network metrics quantifying topological architecture of the brain network can differentiate with respect to individual cognitive states as well as to different individuals' cognitive abilities, suggesting that the connectome is a valuable approach for tracking the learning progress. Although only a few studies have exploited the connectome approach for studying alterations of the brain network induced by cognitive training interventions so far, we believe that it would be a useful technique for capturing improvements of cognitive functions. © 2015 Taya, Sun, Babiloni, Thakor and Bezerianos.","Biomarkers; Brain connectome; Cognitive training; Electroencephalography (EEG); Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)","brain development; brain function; cognition; cognitive therapy; connectome; dysthymia; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; learning; learning disorder; myelination; nerve cell network; neurofeedback; neuromodulation; neurophysiological monitoring; Review; short term memory",2-s2.0-84928106373

In this paper, I seek to broaden out the study of polysemy within this tradition by tackling it from three slightly different angles. I argue that polysemy can also arise from the non-linguistic knowledge to which words facilitate access. This phenomenon I refer to as conceptual polysemy. I illustrate this with an analysis of the lexical item book. Moreover, polysemy also arises from distinct, albeit related, conventionalised sense-units associated with the same linguistic form: the phenomenon I refer to as lexical polysemy. I illustrate with an analysis of the polysemy exhibited by the form in. And finally, semantic relatedness can be discerned as arising from different word forms which, at least on first blush, appear to share a common semantic representation. This phenomenon I refer to as inter-lexical polysemy. I illustrate with a case study involving an analysis of the prepositional forms in and on. In presenting my account of these three types of polysemous phenomena, I introduce a contemporary account of lexical representation: the Theory of Lexical Concepts and Cognitive Models, or LCCM Theory for short (Evans, 2006, 2009, 2010b, 2013). This provides a common theoretical architecture which facilitates a joined-up account of these specific phenomena, and of polysemy more generally. Finally, the paper introduces a new construct within the theory-the notion of a meaning spectrum-which facilitates analysis of aspects of lexical and inter-lexical polysemy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Conceptual polysemy; Inter-lexical polysemy; LCCM Theory; Lexical polysemy; Meaning spectrum; Polysemy; The Theory of Lexical Concepts and Cognitive Models",,2-s2.0-84925521318

Methods: Since 2003, COGS has completed studies using a family-based ascertainment strategy (COGS-1), and a case-control ascertainment strategy (COGS-2) (cumulative "". n"". >. 4000). Results: COGS-1 family study confirmed robust deficits in, and heritability of, these endophenotypes in schizophrenia, and provided evidence for a coherent genetic architecture underlying the risk for neurocognitive and neurophysiological deficits in this disorder. COGS-2 case-control findings, many reported herein, establish a foundation for fine genomic mapping and other analyses of these endophenotypes and risk genes for SZ. Several reports in this Special Issue compare findings of endophenotype deficits generated by fundamentally different COGS-1 vs. COGS-2 ascertainment strategies. Despite the expectation that family-based and case-control designs would establish demographically and potentially biologically distinct patient cohorts, findings generally revealed comparable patterns of endophenotype deficits across studies. The COGS-2 case-control design facilitated the accrual of a larger ""n"", permitting detailed analyses of factors moderating endophenotype performance. Some COGS-2 endophenotypes not assessed in COGS-1 are also reported, as is a new factor analytic strategy for identifying shared vs. unique factors among the COGS endophenotypes which can be used to develop composite variables with distinct genetic signatures. Discussion: The path to date of COGS-1 endophenotype and genetic findings, followed by replication and extension in COGS-2, establishes benchmarks for endophenotype deficits in SZ and their moderation by specific factors, and clear expectations for informative findings from upcoming COGS-2 genetic analyses. © 2014.","Consortium; Endophenotype; Genetics; Neurocognition; Neurophysiology; Schizophrenia","adult; case control study; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; endophenotype; female; gene mapping; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; heritability; human; intermethod comparison; male; medical research; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; risk factor; schizophrenia; family; genetic predisposition; genetics; multicenter study (topic); pathophysiology; schizophrenia; United States; Endophenotypes; Family; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Schizophrenia; United States",2-s2.0-84925944254

Although the ubiquity of ensemble representations is well established, the large-scale cognitive architecture of this process remains poorly defined. We address this using an individual differences approach. In a series of experiments, observers saw groups of objects and reported either a single item from the group or the average of the entire group. High-level ensemble representations (e.g., average facial expression) showed complete independence from low-level ensemble representations (e.g., average orientation). In contrast, low-level ensemble representations (e.g., orientation and color) were correlated with each other, but not with high-level ensemble representations (e.g., facial expression and person identity). These results suggest that there is not a single domain-general ensemble mechanism, and that the relationship among various ensemble representations depends on how proximal they are in representational space. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Ensemble mechanisms; Ensembles; Individual differences; Summary statistics","adolescent; adult; facial expression; facial recognition; human; individuality; oculography; pattern recognition; physiology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Eye Movement Measurements; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Humans; Individuality; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84926343349

In this review, we revisit from a neuropsychological viewpoint Hering vs. Helmholtz' hypotheses on binocular coordination. Specifically, we reexamine the behavior and the neural bases of saccade-vergence movement, to move the gaze in both direction and depth under natural conditions. From the psychophysical viewpoint, neo-Heringian and neo-Helmholtzian authors have accumulated arguments favoring distinct conjugate (for saccades) and disconjugate (for vergence) systems, as well as advocating for monocularly programmed eye movements. From the neurophysiological viewpoint, which reports brain cell recordings during the execution of a given task, neo-Heringian and neo-Helmholtzian physiologists have also provided arguments in favor of both hypotheses at the level of the brainstem premotor circuitry. Bridging the two, we propose that Hering and Helmholtz were both right. The emphasis placed by the latter on adaptive processes throughout life cycle is compatible with the importance of neurobiological constraints pointed out by the former.

Sleep disorders reported in ASD include, among others, increased bedtime resistance, insomnia, parasomnia, sleep disordered breathing, morning rise problems, and daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography studies show that children with ASD have altered sleep architecture including shorter total sleep time and longer sleep latency than typically developing peers. Sleep-related problems have been shown to affect overall autism scores, social skills decits, stereotypic behavior, and cognitive performance. Additionally, problematic sleep in children with ASD has been associated with higher levels of parental stress. Underlying causes specically related to sleep disorders are not fully known. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are commonly associated with sleep problems in these patients. Children with ASD and GI symptoms have been found to have a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances compared with typically developing peers who do not have GI symptoms. Treatment approaches to children with sleep disorders are varied and range from lifestyle modications and behavioral interventions to drug therapies and surgical interventions. Physicians should take into account GI disorders as possible underlying causes of sleep-related problems in children with ASD.

We consider data on implanted patients during stimulation as well as during resting state, which indicates basic long-term reorganisation of brain functional architecture. On the basis of our analysis of neuroimaging literature and considering our own studies, we indicate that auditory recovery in deaf patients after cochlear implantation partly relies on visual cues. The brain develops mechanisms of audio-visual integration as a strategy to achieve high levels of speech recognition. It turns out that this neuroimaging evidence is in line with behavioural findings of better audiovisual integration in these patients. Thus, strong visually and audio-visually based rehabilitation during the first months after cochlear implantation would significantly improve and fasten the functional recovery of speech intelligibility and other auditory functions in these patients.

We, thus, combined task-dependent meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) with task-independent resting-state (RS) connectivity analysis to delineate the neural network of the self, across both states. Given psychological evidence implicating the self's interdependence on social information, we also delineated the neural network underlying conceptual other-processing. To elucidate the relation between the self-/other-networks and their function, we mined the MACM metadata to generate a cognitive-behavioral profile for an empirically identified region specific to conceptual self, the pregenual anterior cingulate (pACC), and conceptual other, posterior cingulate/precuneus (PCC/PC). Mining of 7,200 published, task-dependent, neuroimaging studies, using healthy human subjects, yielded 193 studies activating the self-related seed and were conjoined with RS connectivity analysis to delineate a differentiated self-network composed of the pACC (seed) and anterior insula, relative to other functional connectivity. Additionally, 106 studies activating the other-related seed were conjoined with RS connectivity analysis to delineate a differentiated other-network of PCC/PC (seed) and angular gyrus/temporoparietal junction, relative to self-functional connectivity. The self-network seed related to emotional conflict resolution and motivational processing, whereas the other-network seed related to socially oriented processing and contextual information integration. Notably, our findings revealed shared RS connectivity between ensuing self-/other-networks within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting self-updating via integration of self-relevant social information. We, therefore, present initial neurobiological evidence corroborating the increasing claims of an intricate self-network, the architecture of which may promote social value processing.

In modest terms, constructivism is making meaning (Learning) from novel stimuli combined with experiential knowledge (Piaget, 1967). This process is repeated over a lifetime, from birth until death. This theoretical perspective uses an analogous approach to learning in that human development may be construed as reflection on personal memory from experiences previously learned to gain meaning. Many regard Jean Piaget (1967) as the founding father of constructivist theory and he referred to this process as schemata. Schemata are the cognitive contexts that aid people in organization and interpretation of information from the environment, in which they live (Piaget, 1967). The Russian philosopher Vygotsky (1987) expanded Piaget's original theorem and stated that only through social interaction could meaning or learning be accomplished and coined this approach to learning as Social Constructivism. Jeromy Bruner (1996) added to Social Constructivist thought with the introduction of Didactic Constructivism. When two or more people share different viewpoints of the same stimuli and learn by engagement through conversation on-topic, didactic constructivism is the theoretical perspective at work (Bruner, 1996). To this point in time, these three main divisions or evolutions to constructivist theory, architecture educational systems and have become a mainstay in the design of the modern classroom. Since the introduction of the World Wide Web people from every walk of life turned to the internet for information to access an array of topics spanning countless arenas (Füllsack, 2013). This interface between man and machine requires no social contact, needs no didactic interface, and may be considered novel stimuli to provide the means to learning through a technological transfer of information. Technological Constructivism (Eberwein, 2010) is literally, making meaning from technology. The discoveries from the explorations in this literature review may provide increased understanding on the continuing progression of constructivist theory and provide exploration of implications for further research into the evolution of technology as an enhancement for modern educational practices.

In the case of motor control, we show that there are synergies of this architecture with the Equilibrium-Point hypothesis, leading to novel ways to solve the motor error and distal learning problems. In particular, the presence of desired equilibrium lengths for muscles provides a way to know when the error is increasing, and which corrections to apply. In the context of Threshold Control Theory and Perceptual Control Theory we show how to extend our model so it implements anticipative corrections in cascade control systems that span from muscle contractions to cognitive operations. © 2015 Verduzco-Flores and O’Reilly.","Cerebellum; Complex spikes; Equilibrium point; Motor learning; Reaching","Brain; Cognitive systems; Combinatorial optimization; Control theory; Errors; Muscle; Cerebellum; Complex spikes; Equilibrium point; Motor learning; Reaching; Cascade control systems; algorithm; Article; biological model; cerebellum; climbing fiber; distal learning problem; error; human; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical model; motor control; motor error; motor error problem; muscle contraction; parameters; perceptual control theory; prediction; redundancy problem; sensory error; simulation; theory; threshold control theory",2-s2.0-84927626837

The cerebellum is involved in both motor and non-motor functions, and the “cognitive dysmetria” and “dysmetria of thought” models propose that abnormalities of the cerebellum may contribute to schizophrenia signs and symptoms. The cerebellum and cerebral cortex are reciprocally connected via a modular, closed-loop network architecture, but few schizophrenia neuroimaging studies have taken into account the topographical and functional heterogeneity of the cerebellum. In this study, using a previously defined 17-network cerebral cortical parcellation system as the basis for our functional connectivity seeds, we systematically investigated connectivity abnormalities within the cerebellum of 44 schizophrenia patients and 28 healthy control participants. We found selective alterations in cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity. Specifically, schizophrenia patients showed decreased cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity in higher level association networks (ventral attention, salience, control, and default mode networks) relative to healthy control participants. Schizophrenia patients also showed increased cerebro-cerebellar connectivity in somatomotor and default mode networks, with the latter showing no overlap with the regions found to be hypoconnected within the same default mode network. Finally, we found evidence to suggest that somatomotor and default mode networks may be inappropriately linked in schizophrenia. The relationship of these dysconnectivities to schizophrenia symptoms, such as neurological soft signs and altered sense of agency, is discussed. We conclude that the cerebellum ought to be considered for analysis in all future studies of network abnormalities in SZ, and further suggest the cerebellum as a potential target for further elucidation, and possibly treatment, of the underlying mechanisms and network abnormalities producing symptoms of schizophrenia. © 2015 Shinn, Baker, Lewandowski, Öngür and Cohen.","Association cortex; Cerebellum; Functional connectivity; Motor; Networks; Schizophrenia","neuroleptic agent; 17 network cerebral cortical parcellation system; adult; aged; Article; brain cortex; cerebellum; cerebellum disease; cerebro cerebellar functional connectivity; clinical article; connectome; control network; controlled study; default mode network; female; functional neuroimaging; human; image analysis; male; nerve cell network; pathophysiology; salience network; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; schizophreniform disorder; somatomotor network; ventral attention network",2-s2.0-84933671105

Following the logic of the speech chain, descriptions of production have often exhibited a clear analogy to accounts of perception. This reciprocality is especially evident in explanations that rely on reafference to control production, on articulation to inform perception, and on strict parity between produced and perceived form to provide invariance in the relation between abstract linguistic objects and observed expression. However, a causal account of production and perception cannot derive solely from this hopeful analogy. Despite sharing of abstract linguistic representations, the control functions in production and perception as well as the constraints on their use stand in fundamental disanalogy. This is readily seen in the different adaptive challenges to production – to speak in a single voice – and perception – to resolve familiar linguistic properties in any voice. This acknowledgement sets descriptive and theoretical challenges that break the symmetry of production and perception. As a consequence, this recognition dislodges an old impasse between the psychoacoustic and motoric accounts in the regulation of production and perception. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","language system architecture; speech perception; speech production","acoustics; Article; human; linguistics; repetition priming; speech; speech perception; task performance; tongue; vignette; word recognition",2-s2.0-84938406902

Although the genetic component of obesity is clear from the heritability studies, the genetic basis remains largely elusive. Successes have been achieved in identifying the causal genes for monogenic obesity using animal models and linkage studies, but these approaches are not fruitful for polygenic obesity. The developments of genome-wide association approach have brought breakthrough discovery of genetic variants for polygenic obesity where tens of new susceptibility loci were identified. However, the common SNPs only accounted for a proportion of heritability. The arrival of NGS technologies and completion of 1000 Genomes Project have brought other new methods to dissect the genetic architecture of obesity, for example, the use of exome genotyping arrays and deep sequencing of candidate loci identified from GWAS to study rare variants. In this review, we summarize and discuss the developments of these genetic approaches in human obesity. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"antidiabetic agent; insulin; leptin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; proinsulin; adipogenesis; body weight; childhood obesity; cognitive defect; copy number variation; developmental disorder; energy expenditure; ethnic difference; ethnic group; exome; feeding behavior; gene locus; gene mutation; gene technology; genetic association; genetic heterogeneity; genetic model; genetic variability; genomics; genotype; genotype environment interaction; glucose homeostasis; heritability; human; hyperactivity; hyperglycemia; hyperphagia; hypogonadism; hypopigmentation; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; next generation sequencing; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; phenotype; physical activity; Prader Willi syndrome; priority journal; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism; animal; biological model; genetic predisposition; genetics; obesity; Animals; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Genotype; Humans; Models, Genetic; Obesity",2-s2.0-84925538091

Cognitive models are notoriously hard to evaluate, especially based on behavioral measures alone. Neuroimaging data can provide additional constraints, but this requires a mapping from model components to brain regions. Although such mappings can be based on the experience of the modeler or on a reading of the literature, a formal method is preferred to prevent researcher-based biases. In this paper we used model-based fMRI analysis to create a data-driven model-brain mapping for five modules of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We then validated this mapping by applying it to two new datasets with associated models. The new mapping was at least as powerful as an existing mapping that was based on the literature, and indicated where the models were supported by the data and where they have to be improved. We conclude that data-driven model-brain mappings can provide strong constraints on cognitive models, and that model-based fMRI is a suitable way to create such mappings. © 2015 Borst et al.",,"adaptive control of throught rational model; Article; brain mapping; brain region; cognition; controlled study; data analysis; data driven brain mapping; formal model; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; image analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical model; mental performance; neuroimaging; nonbiological model; prediction; process design; process development; stimulus response; task performance; validation process; biological model; brain; cognition; diagnostic imaging; female; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; radiography; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Neurological; Neuroimaging; Radiography",2-s2.0-84929094232
