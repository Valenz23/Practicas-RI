A 4-year fixed field experiment was conducted to analyse the effect of introducing leguminous green manure (LGM) to different cropping systems on soil water, residual nitrate, soil quality and economic benefits to compare their sustainability using a comprehensive scoring system. The main treatments of the experiment were different cropping systems, leguminous green manure-winter wheat (LGM-WW) and leguminous green manure-spring maize-winter wheat (LGM-SM-WW) with summer fallow-winter wheat (SF-WW) as control. LGM late incorporation, early mulch and early incorporation were sub-treatments for LGM-WW while stalk mulch, incorporation and move-away were the sub-treatments for LGM-SM-WW to study the effects of different LGM managements. Compared with SF-WW, LGM-WW decreased average soil water storage before wheat seeding by 11% and increased residual nitrate storage after wheat harvest by 77% while they were not significantly changed for LGM-SM-WW. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content of LGM-WW and LGM-SM-WW in the 0–20-cm layer significantly increased when using legume as mulch. The economic benefits of LGM-SM-WW were 2 times greater than those of the other 2 cropping systems. The scoring system indicates that the total score of LGM-WW ranged from 11.85 to 12.78, which was even lower than that of SF-WW (13.07). On the contrary, the total score of LGM-SM-WW ranged from 16.46 to 18.49. In conclusion, the scoring system determined that the optimum cropping system for sustainable dryland agriculture is leguminous green manure-spring maize-winter wheat with legume stalk mulch. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Economic benefits; Leguminous green manure; Residual nitrate; Scoring system; Soil organic carbon; Spring maize; Winter wheat","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Fertilizers; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Soils; Sustainable development; Economic benefits; Green manures; Scoring systems; Soil organic carbon; Spring maize; Winter wheat; Manures; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",2-s2.0-85032815599

Urban green spaces have a multitude of functions: Maintaining ecological processes and resulting services, e.g. providing habitat for animals and plants, providing a beneficial city microclimate as well as recreational space for citizens. Regarding these requirements, currently existing assessment procedures for green spaces have some major shortcomings, which are discussed in this paper. It is argued why a more detailed spatial level as well as a distinction between natural and artificial varieties of structural elements is justified and needed and how the assessment of urban green spaces benefits from the multidimensional perspective that is applied.

These characteristics have raised the demand for plastic materials that will continue to grow over the coming years. However, with increased plastic materials production, comes increased plastic material wastage creating a number of challenges, as well as opportunities to the waste management industry. The present overview highlights the waste management and pollution challenges, emphasising on the various chemical substances (known as “additives”) contained in all plastic products for enhancing polymer properties and prolonging their life. Despite how useful these additives are in the functionality of polymer products, their potential to contaminate soil, air, water and food is widely documented in literature and described herein. These additives can potentially migrate and undesirably lead to human exposure via e.g. food contact materials, such as packaging. They can, also, be released from plastics during the various recycling and recovery processes and from the products produced from recyclates. Thus, sound recycling has to be performed in such a way as to ensure that emission of substances of high concern and contamination of recycled products is avoided, ensuring environmental and human health protection, at all times. © 2017","Additives; Environmental fate; Migration; Plastics; Recycling; Toxicity","Additives; Chemical contamination; Elastomers; Environmental impact; Food additives; Packaging materials; Plastic products; Plastics; Recycling; Toxicity; Waste management; Chemical substance; Environmental fate; Food contact material; Migration; Plastic materials; Plastics production; Polymer properties; Recycled products; Plastic recycling; antioxidant; chemical compound; monomer; oligomer; plastic; plasticizer; polymer; stabilizing agent; additive; chemical compound; environmental fate; environmental impact assessment; plastic; polymer; recovery; recycling; toxicity; waste disposal; waste management; air pollution; degradation; environmental impact; food contamination; human; marine environment; miscibility; pollution; prophylaxis; recycling; Review; soil pollution; waste disposal; waste management; water contamination",2-s2.0-85031759735

Here, we address this caveat by evaluating the effects of non-native tree species, in comparison to native ones, on several categories of cultural services, i.e., recreation and ecotourism, aesthetics, inspiration, and cultural heritage. We propose an indicator-based approach that includes the use of a meta-analysis statistics, the odds ratio, to evaluate photographic, internet and catalogue data, and to infer on the effects of non-native trees on cultural services. We apply our approach to the Iberian Peninsula, exploring potential environmental and socio-economic predictors of non-native tree effects across NUTS-2 administrative regions. Overall, non-native tree effects differed among categories of cultural services and varied with the data type. Non-native trees increased recreation and ecotourism services, when considering data from official tourism entities, but not from nature route users. Data from inventories of urban parks and catalogues of ornamental plant dealers suggested that non-native trees decreased aesthetics services, particularly in Spain, but not in Portugal. Non-native trees also increased cultural heritage services, but no significant effects were observed on inspiration services. Overall, non-native trees showed higher increases in cultural services across regions with lower levels of development (in terms of income, employment and education) and life satisfaction. We suggest that management should emphasise awareness on non-native trees, including the risks involved in promoting the expansion of potentially invasive species. Efforts to raise awareness should prioritise official tourism entities and ornamental plant dealers, with a special focus on less developed regions. Our proposed approach represents a pioneer assessment of the relations between non-native trees and cultural ecosystem services, supporting strategic management in Iberia.

The Alien Game is a digital game developed to train the EF subskill of shifting. High school students (N = 82; age range 14–18 years; average = 15.5 years) were asked to play the Alien Game for 20 min per week for 6 consecutive weeks. Two EF measures were administered before and after this intervention: the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) task (a measure of shifting) and the Flanker task (a measure of inhibition).

Here, we propose a method of estimating synoptic-scale density index distribution of mammals, including non-game and non-pest species, by using roadkill records collected by municipalities. In order to correct biases caused by location, environment and traffic density to roadkill data, we constructed an animal density index model by using environmental factors as land use and climates, and fitted to roadkill records taking into account road types as delegate of traffic density. Since alien species are expanding geographic ranges and some native species were historically extinct regionally, we considered a regional factor not predictable by environment. We then estimated density indices over the research area for nine animals. Geographical distribution of density indices in nine mammal species were obtained. Density index maps of three of four animals agreed (AUC > 0.7) with the data on previous presence/absence maps. The exception was that the red fox was distributed over almost of all the research area on previously published maps, but we found that its density was low in southern Pacific areas. The species was considered as endangered in some prefectures there, and it clearly showed the importance of our density index estimation. Significant differences in the regional factor explained ongoing range expansion of alien species (masked palm civet and raccoon) and the historical regional extinction of sika deer.

It is poorly understood, however, whether these two disturbances interact with the functional identity of recipient native plants to drive community change. We performed combined studies in the fields and greenhouse to examine whether nutrient enrichment may trigger the invasion of Phragmites australis in wetlands through competitive advantage over native Melaleuca ericifolia. Chemical characterizations of rhizosphere water were distinguished in two different nutrient enriched wetlands associated with and without Phragmites over the seasons. Significant changes in rhizosphere water were observed in invaded area compared to uninvaded area at both sites. High nitrogen (NO3 −), phosphorous (PO4 3 −), dissolved organic carbon, phenolics contents, with low pH were found in invaded areas compared to uninvaded areas. Total biomass of Phragmites was positively regressed with rhizosphere water nitrogen (NO3 −) and phosphorous (PO4 3 −) content. Nutrient addition significantly enhanced the growth and competitive ability of Phragmites over Melaleuca. In contrast, Melaleuca was significantly less competitive than Phragmites. There was a significantly positive correlation between the growth of Phragmites grown alone and its competitive ability. The findings in greenhouse studies coupled with characteristics of Phragmites and its' rhizosphere chemistry in the nutrient enriched fields suggest that nutrient enrichment may enhance Phragmites invasion through correspondingly increasing growth and maintaining inherent competitive advantages of Phragmites. Nutrient management could limit the vigorous growth of Phragmites in wetlands and thereby reduce invasion through competitive advantages over natives, which might have important management implications for wetland managers. © 2017","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Nutrient enrichment; Phragmites australis; Plant invasion; Wetland","Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Biodiversity; Carbon; Competition; Ecology; Ecosystems; Greenhouses; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Soils; Wetlands; Chemical characterization; Dissolved organic carbon; Functional identities; Management implications; Nutrient enrichments; Phragmites australis; Plant invasion; Positive correlations; Nutrients; dissolved organic matter; nitrogen; organic carbon; phenol derivative; phosphorus; anthropogenic effect; aquatic ecosystem; biodiversity; biological invasion; ecosystem management; grass; growth; nutrient enrichment; perennial plant; plant community; wetland; aerial plant part; Article; biomass; chemical analysis; competitive ability; controlled study; environmental enrichment; field experiment; greenhouse; Melaleuca; native species; nonhuman; nutrient management; Phragmites australis; plant community; plant growth; priority journal; rhizosphere; seasonal variation; species invasion; wetland; Melaleuca; Melaleuca ericifolia; Phragmites; Phragmites australis",2-s2.0-85021247184

While population-specific attributes are acknowledged to play a critical role in the success and impact of biological invasions in general, our knowledge of the causes and consequences of cryptic invasions is largely neglected. Cryptic invasions are inherently difficult to recognize and, despite being likely widespread, often go undetected. In this review, we analyse the sources, mechanisms, and consequences of cryptic invasions. Using a bibliometric survey, we first quantify the relative proportion of study questions, taxa, and geographic regions. We then highlight the value of comparative information from archived specimens in uncovering the occurrence and timing of cryptic invasions. We examine the mechanisms of cryptic invasions and emphasise the role of anthropogenic environmental changes on the arrival of cryptic invaders. We then discuss the role of interspecific biological interactions in the success of cryptic invasions and the role of hybridization between native and non-native lineages in cryptic invasions. We examine the competitive advantage of some invasive lineages in key physiological, ecological or sexually-selected traits. We argue that cryptic invasions, often undetected, may trigger subsequent rapid range expansions. We suggest that cryptic invasions are much more common than currently acknowledged. We highlight the role of coevolved associations (host-parasite, mutualism, herbivory), inherently population-specific, in the impacts of cryptic invasions on local communities. Finally, we outline a framework to manage intraspecific cryptic invasions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometric; Biological invasions; Conspecific invader; Invasiveness","Environmental engineering; Pollution; Bibliometric; Biological interactions; Biological invasion; Competitive advantage; Conspecific invader; Environmental change; Invasiveness; Non-native species; Competition; biological invasion; competition (ecology); environmental change; human activity; invasive species; invasiveness; population dynamics; survey; bibliometrics; biogeographic region; biogeography; environmental change; herbivory; intraspecific hybridization; introduced species; native species; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; Review; species invasion; symbiosis; taxon",2-s2.0-85021158595

A cruise was conducted in 10–19 May 2011 to investigate the species and distribution of total dissolved inorganic arsenic (TDIAs: [TDIAs] = [As(V)] + [As(III)]) revealing links between the hydrographic dynamics and biological/chemical reactions in the Baltic Sea. In addition, long-term (2002 − 2010) time-series investigations of particulate arsenic in the Gotland Basin were also conducted in February every year for monitoring purposes. The behavior of TDIAs was non-conservative due to the removal and regeneration processes occurring in the Baltic Sea. Biological scavenging plays a dominant role as sink for TDIAs, with removal amount of 3.1 ± 1.6 nmol/L above the pycnocline of the Baltic Sea. Significant regeneration of TDIAs was observed below the pycnocline of the Baltic Sea, which was closely related to hypoxia. The decomposition of organic arsenic and release from the sediment by desorption of As-bearing Fe and Mn oxides were thought to be two major sources for TDIAs regeneration. The median concentration of TDIAs (8.4 nmol/L) was much lower than in most marginal seas and oceans, including the near-bottom water around a chemical weapon dumpsite (13.9 nmol/L). The hypoxia in the deep water contributed to the increase in As(III) concentrations based on the relationship between As(III)/TDIAs ratio and apparent oxygen utilization. If the difference of As(III) profiles (1981 and 2011) actually represents a long-term increase in As(III) concentrations and a shoaling of the As(III) chemocline, these factors could enhance the toxic effects and extend the residence time of arsenic and, hence, potentially have negative impacts on fisheries and ecosystem health in the Baltic Sea. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Arsenic; Baltic Sea; Chemical weapon dump; Hypoxia; Inorganic species","Chemical warfare; Ecology; Ecosystems; Manganese; Oceanography; Residence time distribution; Anthropogenic activity; Apparent oxygen utilizations; Baltic sea; Chemical weapons; Environmental disruption; Hypoxia; Inorganic species; Regeneration process; Arsenic; arsenic; iron; manganese oxide; water; arsenic; biogeochemistry; chemical weapon; concentration (composition); decomposition; human activity; marine pollution; pollution effect; toxicity; Article; Baltic Sea; biogeochemistry; concentration (parameters); dumping; ecosystem health; ecosystem regeneration; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; fishery; hazardous waste site; oxygen consumption; priority journal; scavenging system; sediment; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Gotland Basin",2-s2.0-85029539218

The current study attempts to determine the habitat suitability and threat of a selected group of plants viz, RET and endemic species. This is realized in light of LULC change and forest fragmentation over a period of ∼100 years to understand the possible conservation strategies in the study area. Historical maps and satellite images from 1920 to 2015 were used to develop the LULC and fragmentation maps. MaxEnt species distribution model were used to simulate the distribution of RET and endemic species. Our study reveals that, by and large, the Eastern Ghats have lost 15.83% of its forest area over a span of ∼100 years. For the study period from 1920 to 2015, it is estimated that about 7.92% of forest area was converted into agriculture, and up to 3.80% into scrub/grassland respectively.

In this study CARLIT was applied for the first time in the Levantine Sea, along the Lebanese shoreline in order to test the suitability of this method in the peculiar ecological conditions of the Levantine Sea and have a first assessment of its ecological status. The choice of proper reference sites is a focal point in the fulfillment of the WFD. In order to ensure accurate calculation of the ecological status of the Lebanese coast, the calculations of the reference conditions (RC) were performed using the values calculated in the Lebanese reference area, the Northwestern (NW) Mediterranean RC proposed in the first application of the CARLIT method and the Adriatic Sea RC. The results showed that the calculated ecological quality ratio values (EQR) based on Lebanese RC is particularly important when considering the principle of the WFD to reach and maintain a good Ecological Status. Overall, the EQR values were well correlated with anthropogenic pressures, as assessed by the LUSI and MA-LUSI indexes.

Previous studies have shown that the reorganization of interactions among co-occurring species can modulate their chances to adapt to novel environmental conditions. Moreover, empirical evidence has shown that these ecological dynamics typically facilitate the persistence of groups of species rather than entire communities. However, so far, we have no systematic methodology to identify those groups of species with the highest or lowest chances to adapt to new environments through a reorganization of their interactions. Yet, this could prove extremely valuable for developing new conservation strategies. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to estimate the effect of the reorganization of interactions on the adaptability of a group of species, within a community, to novel environmental conditions. We introduce the concept of the adaptation space of a group of species based on a feasibility analysis of a population dynamics model. We define the adaptation space of a group as the set of environmental conditions that can be made compatible with its persistence thorough the reorganization of interactions among species within the group. The larger the adaptation space of a group, the larger its likelihood to adapt to a novel environment. We show that the interactions in the community outside a group can act as structural constraints and be used to quantitatively compare the size of the adaptation space among different groups of species within a community. To test our theoretical framework, we perform a data analysis on several pairs of natural and artificially perturbed ecological communities. Overall, we find that the groups of species present in both control and perturbed communities are among the ones with the largest adaptation space. We believe that the results derived from our framework point out towards new directions to understand and estimate the adaptability of species to changing environments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Changing environments; Feasibility; Network reorganization; Species coexistence","adaptation; coexistence; community ecology; environmental change; environmental conditions; feasibility study; population dynamics; adaptation; Article; community; conceptual framework; environmental change; feasibility study; nonhuman; organismal interaction; population dynamics; priority journal; simulation",2-s2.0-85032330630

At sites where P. undulatum removal has occurred over a 1–14 year period, species richness, canopy cover and functionality were compared against nearby invaded and remnant temperate Eucalyptus bushland, so as to gauge the direction and magnitude of community change over time. There are four main findings: (1) Low levels of native and non-native species richness and canopy cover were recorded at communities impacted by dense P. undulatum populations; (2) very low densities of P. undulatum at all cleared areas after removal; (3) removing P. undulatum caused an increase in species richness, particularly for native species; and (4) over time, management intervention lead to increasing similarity in community composition and function between cleared areas and remnant controls. Our case study demonstrates how the Passenger-Driver hypothesis (PDH) can be used effectively to understand the mechanisms at play between native and exotic drivers of community composition and function.

The disruption of critical phases in the plant life cycle may ultimately have negative impacts on plant recruitment and the survival of plant populations. Here, for the first time we compared the seed removal and recruitment of Araucaria angustifolia, a critically endangered and relictual gymnosperm species, in multiple sites, including continuous and fragmented forest areas in the Brazilian Atlantic subtropical forest. Our sampling included seed removal experiment monitored by camera traps and surveys of A. angustifolia recruitment. We found that seed survival and recruitment were related to the density of adult A. angustifolia. Therefore the formation of large and dense groves, which is a characteristic of pristine Araucaria moist forests endangered by forest fragmentation and selective logging, may be an attempt to satiate seed predator communities. Additionally, forest fragmentation and the introduction of wild boar decreased seed survival to very low, and forest fragmentation decreased recruitment by fourfold on average. Increase protection and recuperation of Araucaria moist forests and the eradication of the invasive wild boar where possible are necessary measures for increasing seed survival rates and the recruitment of this relictual conifer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Araucariaceae; Cyanocorax chrysops; Dasyprocta azarae; Neotropics; Scatter-hoarding; Sus scrofa","Forestry; Araucariaceae; Cyanocorax chrysops; Dasyprocta azarae; Neotropics; Sus scrofa; Seed; coniferous tree; gymnosperm; habitat fragmentation; invasive species; Neotropical Region; recruitment (population dynamics); removal experiment; seed dispersal; selective logging; survival; Ecology; Forests; Logging; Seeds; Softwoods; Survival; Araucaria; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]; Animalia; Araucaria; Araucaria angustifolia; Araucariaceae; Coniferophyta; Cyanocorax chrysops; Dasyprocta azarae; Gymnospermae; Sus scrofa",2-s2.0-85032376429

Spearman rank correlation, Principal Component Analysis, and Mann-Kendall trend tests were applied to long-term time series of water quality data during the period 1990–2015 in order to investigate the relationships between water quality parameters and the main factors controlling them. Results show that air temperature, considered as a proxy of climatic change, has a significant impact, in particular in the Adige and Ebro: positive trends of water temperature and negative of dissolved oxygen are correlated with upward trends of air temperatures. The aquatic ecosystems of these rivers are, therefore, experiencing a reduction in oxygen, which may exacerbate in the future given the projected further increase in temperature. Furthermore, monthly streamflow has been shown to reduce in the Ebro, thereby reducing the beneficial effect of dilution, which appears evident from the observed upward patterns of chloride concentrations and electrical conductivity. Upward trends of chloride and biological oxygen demand in the Adige and Sava, and of phosphate in the Adige appears to be related to increasing human population density, whereas phosphates in the Sava and biological oxygen demand in the Ebro are highly correlated with agricultural land use, considered as a proxy of the impact of agricultural practises. The present study shows the complex relationships between drivers and observed changes in water quality parameters. Such analysis can represent, complementary to a deep knowledge of the investigated systems, a reliable tool for decision makers in river basin planning by providing an overview of the potential impacts on the aquatic ecosystem of the three basins. © 2017 The Authors","European river basins; Principal Component Analysis; Spearman rank correlation; Water quality drivers; Water quality trends","Agriculture; Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric temperature; Biochemical oxygen demand; Chemical analysis; Chlorine compounds; Decision making; Dissolved oxygen; Ecology; Ecosystems; Indicators (chemical); Land use; Oxygen; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Rivers; Stream flow; Time series analysis; Water quality; Water resources; Watersheds; Biological oxygen demand; Chloride concentrations; Electrical conductivity; Quality driver; River basins; Spearman rank correlation; Water quality parameters; Water quality trends; Quality control",2-s2.0-85028056233

Methods for plastic analyses in sediments can potentially be adjusted for application to soil; yet, the applicability of these methods for soil needs to be tested. Consequently, the current data base on soil pollution with plastic is still poor. Soils may receive plastic inputs via plastic mulching or the application of plastic containing soil amendments. In compost up to 2.38–1200 mg plastic kg− 1 have been found so far; the plastic concentration of sewage sludge varies between 1000 and 24,000 plastic items kg− 1. Also irrigation with untreated and treated wastewater (1000–627,000 and 0–125,000 plastic items m− 3, respectively) as well as flooding with lake water (0.82–4.42 plastic items m− 3) or river water (0–13,751 items km− 2) can provide major input pathways for plastic into soil. Additional sources comprise littering along roads and trails, illegal waste dumping, road runoff as well as atmospheric input. With these input pathways, plastic concentrations in soil might reach the per mill range of soil organic carbon.

Carcerality refers to social and political systems that formally and informally promote discipline, punishment, and incarceration. Guided by Critical Race Theory, I examine interview data from 15 undocumented Asian Americans to show that the portrayal of undocumented student exceptionalism that typically characterizes the discourse on their experiences obscures the centrality of carcerality in shaping how young people with undocumented status navigate their lives. The narratives of undocumented Asian Americans represent a shift in undocumented discourse as these students de-emphasized their academic mobility, demonstrated a hyper-awareness of punitive immigration policies, and were traumatized by and practiced nondisclosure in response to deportation threats. However, while these students developed resistance strategies that they believed would both physically and psychologically protect their presence in the US, some reinforced white supremacist perceptions of the illegality of other undocumented immigrants. Undocumented Asian American experiences illuminate the nuanced relationship between the criminalization of undocumented immigrants, race, and education, and how a legacy of carcerality is vital to deciphering the contemporary educational experiences of undocumented students in the US. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Asian American; carcerality; critical race theory; immigration; model minority; Undocumented student","immigrant; immigration; international migration; minority group; perception; social theory; student; United States",2-s2.0-84992523475

However, management can be contentious and create conflicts, especially when stakeholders who benefit from alien species are different from those who incur costs. Such conflicts of interests mean that management strategies can often not be implemented. There is, therefore, increasing interest in engaging stakeholders affected by alien species or by their management. Through a facilitated workshop and consultation process including academics and managers working on a variety of organisms and in different areas (urban and rural) and ecosystems (terrestrial and aquatic), we developed a framework for engaging stakeholders in the management of alien species. The proposed framework for stakeholder engagement consists of 12 steps: (1) identify stakeholders; (2) select key stakeholders for engagement; (3) explore key stakeholders' perceptions and develop initial aims for management; (4) engage key stakeholders in the development of a draft management strategy; (5) re-explore key stakeholders' perceptions and revise the aims of the strategy; (6) co-design general aims, management objectives and time frames with key stakeholders; (7) co-design a management strategy; (8) facilitate stakeholders' ownership of the strategy and adapt as required; and (9) implement the strategy and monitor management actions to evaluate the need for additional or future actions. In case additional management is needed after these actions take place, some extra steps should be taken: (10) identify any new stakeholders, benefits, and costs; (11) monitor engagement; and (12) revise management strategy. Overall, we believe that our framework provides an effective approach to minimize the impact of conflicts created by alien species management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biological invasions; Conflicts of interests; Environmental management; Invasive species management; Perceptions; Stakeholder ownership","biological invasion; conflict management; environmental management; introduced species; ownership; perception; socioeconomic impact; stakeholder; Article; conceptual framework; consensus; consultation; decision making; environmental management; introduced species; organization and management; perception; species invasion; workshop",2-s2.0-85030831946

In this study, we tested and compared three sampling and three DNA extraction methods using the crayfish Procambarus clarkii as model species. Based on existing and newly developed primers, we were able to identify this species from tissue DNA and filtered eDNA samples from water of aquaria kept in the laboratory as well as water from natural ponds. The species could be positively identified in field and laboratory samples, though effectiveness differed greatly. Results in our study seemed to be highly dependent on primer choice, DNA extraction method, and the type of sample (tissue or filter). Our results showed that both an adapted phenol:chlorophorm:isoamyl alcohol protocol and a MasterPure extraction kit provided the most reliable results to detect the species based on tissue and filtered eDNA samples. The results are promising, but also highlight the necessity for a standardized protocol for each step of the eDNA-based monitoring process.

Variant propagation can occur by neutral means—akin to drift in biological evolution—or through selection, whereby individuals are biased in what variants they adopt. An important bias concerns social meaning, and sociolinguistic theory distinguishes between variants that are primarily associated with a particular social group (such as working-class people or Texans) and variants primarily associated with a perceived trait of the group (such as toughness). In the former case, variants are hypothesized to propagate neutrally; in the latter case, provided the trait is socially relevant to adopters, variants are hypothesized to be subject to selection and to propagate more readily. To test this hypothesis we conducted an experimental study in which groups of four participants played a game that involved instant messaging in an artificial “alien language” with two dialects. Each player was assigned to one of two alien species, the weaker Wiwos or the tougher Burls. The social meaning of one feature of the Burl dialect was manipulated, and the results strongly supported the hypothesis: Variants from the Burl dialect were used by Wiwos in all conditions, but when associated primarily with “tougher aliens”, the rate of adoption was significantly greater than when they were associated primarily with “Burls”. When toughness was made irrelevant to the game, the effect of association disappeared, emphasizing the importance of social relevance in the propagation of behavioral variants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial language experiment; Cultural evolution; Experimental semiotics; Language change; Sociolinguistics",,2-s2.0-85032178012

Until now, no one fish-based IBI − sensitive, useful in a large geographical context, simple and easily applied −has been employed in species-poor Mediterranean basins. Various attempts to develop such an index have generally failed to achieve all these objectives. In this paper, the applicability of the index was enhanced through several modifications to the metrics used in the original IBI-J, and a new version of the index was also developed which included an additional metric recommended by the author of the IBI-J. In the IBI-G each of the five metrics that make up the IBI (percentage of individuals with anomalies, age structure of native fish population, relative native fish density, loss of native species and alien fish pressure) were validated and adjusted to the specificities of a typical Mediterranean fish community. Both, IBI-J and IBI-G, are robust and coherent assessment tools, highly sensitive to the main pressure gradients observed in the study area, as demonstrated by its correlation with many pressure indicators (biotic and habitat indexes, habitat variables and physico-chemical parameters). It points to the real possibility of extending the same methodology to similar basins for the purposes of monitoring, management and ecological assessment, especially in contexts relating to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). In addition, this new index does not need undisturbed reference sites, a completely unreal requisite in Mediterranean basins, where there is a general scarcity of pristine sites to be used as reference conditions.

To achieve this, a pilot scale ball mill was considered and a campaign of simulations and experimental tests was carried out in dry grinding conditions, considering variables such as the rotation speed of the mill, the type of particle to be grinded, and the mill filling level. For each simulation, spectral analysis of torque data generated by DEM software was performed. The results obtained from simulations and subsequent torque data processing show the possibility of characterizing the load torque of ball mills in the frequency domain without the influence of components alien to the grinding process.

We investigated bryophyte species pools in tree stands of six species: Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus robur, Q. rubra and Robinia pseudoacacia in two substratum groups: epigeic and epiphytic species. We assessed beta-diversity among tree stand types and bryophyte guilds. We also analyzed impacts of light availability, pH and C/N ratios of bark and soil, annual litterfall and bark water capacity of the main tree species, on bryophyte species pools among tree stands and species groups, using canonical correspondence analysis. Our study revealed tree species effects on bryophyte species richness, beta-diversity and composition. Main mechanisms connected with tree species effects were light availability and substratum C/N ratio, as well as substratum pH and bark water capacity. We confirmed that tree species traits connected with C/N ratios and light availability affect bryophyte species composition. Guilds of bryophytes responded differently to tree species effects on ecosystem properties and their turnover differed between tree stands. Influence of the factors studied on species pools was similar to those reported from mature woodlands. Presence of many woodland specific bryophytes has shown restoration success ca. 30 years after afforestation of post-industrial land. Different tree species provided different habitats for bryophytes, and therefore decisions regarding what tree species to plant affect restoration success and the future bryophyte species pool. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bryophyte species diversity; Carbon:nitrogen ratio; Epiphytes; Light availability; Novel ecosystems; Ordination; Post-industrial; Spoil heap","Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecology; Ecosystems; Lakes; Plants (botany); Reforestation; Restoration; Bryophyte species; Epiphytes; Light availability; Novel ecosystems; Ordination; Post-industrial; Spoil heap; Forestry; Alnus glutinosa; Betula pendula; bryophytes; Pinus sylvestris; Quercus robur; Robinia pseudoacacia",2-s2.0-85032704130

We quantified the distribution and abundance of H. stipulacea, and its associated macroinvertebrate fauna, in sampling stations and transects around the island of Carriacou (a nearby dependency of Grenada) in early 2016. Halophila stipulacea occurred in extensive monospecific stands (average bottom cover, 62%), or smaller mixed stands with native seagrass (Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, Halodule wrightii), at 1–5 m depth in large bays along the leeward (west) coast. It was sparsely distributed on the more wave-exposed east and south coasts, usually in mixed patches with native seagrass. In leeward bays, H. stipulacea has largely replaced the native seagrass H. wrightii, providing a novel biogenic habitat for various filter-feeding invertebrates living within the turf-like leaf canopy (e.g., sponges, ascidians, bivalves, ophiuroids), and sea urchins (mainly Tripneustes ventricousus) and a microphagous sea star (Oreaster reticulatus) that graze upon it. Populations of the sea star consisted mainly of juveniles indicating the seagrass may serve as a nursery habitat for this endangered species.

To provide insights for a better distribution of tree diversity in a socially segregated city, we evaluated spatial segregation in the abundance and diversity of trees by socioeconomic group and their change over a 12-year period in Santiago, Chile. Two hundred vegetation plots were sampled across Santiago in 2002 and 2014. We found that overall abundance and diversity of urban trees for the entire city were stable over 12 years, whereas species richness and abundance of native tree species increased. There was segregation in tree species richness and abundance by socioeconomic group, with wealthier areas having more species and greater abundance of trees (for all tree species and native species) than poorer ones. Tree community composition and structure varied with socioeconomic group, but we found no evidence of increased homogenization of the urban forest in that 12 years. Our findings revealed that although tree diversity and abundance for the entire city did not change in our 12-year period, there were important inequities in abundance and diversity of urban trees by socioeconomic group. Given that 43% of homes in Santiago are in the lower socioeconomic areas, our study highlights the importance of targeting tree planting, maintenance and educational programs in these areas to reduce inequalities in the distribution of trees. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Biotic homogenization; Hotspot; Tree density; Urban environmental segregation; Urban forest; Vegetation",,2-s2.0-85032744696

Combating invasion thus requires an understanding of what socioeconomic factors, in addition to ecological factors, may slow an invasive species or facilitate its spread. However, few studies have examined associations between invasive species and multi-scale socioeconomic and environmental factors, which may influence residents’ decisions to control invaders. We combine spatially explicit social and environmental datasets, and we apply gradient boosting regression to examine the socioeconomic, land use, and environmental factors associated with the distribution of albizia (Falcataria moluccana), an invasive tree species, in Hawaii. We find that environmental factors are the dominant controls on albizia cover at the landscape scale, but socioeconomic variables lead to a modest improvement in the ability to predict albizia distribution at the housing subdivision scale. At the subdivision scale, albizia is more common on properties with absentee and/or less-wealthy landowners. Albizia is also more common on smaller properties and non-agricultural land.

Though microplastics are known to sorb organic contaminants from water, the interaction mechanisms between microplastics and organic chemicals are not yet well understood. Here we investigated the partition characteristics of phenanthrene (Phe) in three mass-produced plastic particles, including polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinylchloride (PVC)， and one natural sediment, as a comparison. The sorption kinetics of Phe onto microplastics and natural sediment were successfully described by the pseudo-second-order model (R2 &gt; 0.992), while the equilibrium data were best-fitted to the Langmuir isotherm (R2 &gt; 0.995). Compared with natural sediment, microplastics exhibited higher capacities for Phe which followed an order of PE &gt; PS &gt; PVC. As the aqueous concentration of pyrene (Pyr) increased, both uptakes and distribution coefficients (Kd) of Phe within the solids decreased, with natural sediment giving the largest decline. Although proportions of Phe desorbed from the contaminated microplastics were low, due to the high Phe uptake, microplastics released larger amounts of the sorbed Phe to water than the natural sediment during the desorption process.

We have previously demonstrated that estradiol exerts a protective effect on lung edema and cytokine release caused by intestinal IR in male rats. Materials and methods We investigated the role of estradiol on the generation of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1) in a female rat model of intestinal IR. Blood and bone marrow leukocytes were also quantified. Seven-days-ovariectomized rats were subjected to intestinal IR by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for 45 min. After reperfusion of the tissue for 2 h, the rats were sacrificed. Lung tissue was collected, cultured for 24 h and assayed. Results We observed a significant increase in serum levels of IL-10, CINC-1, uric acid and circulating, but not bone marrow, leukocyte numbers. In addition, intestinal IR induced a significant increase in the ex-vivo lung levels of IL-1β, IL-10, and VEGF. Treatment with 17β-estradiol before the induction of intestinal IR prevented the systemic release of IL-10, CINC-1, and uric acid, but it did not affect the leukocytosis. In addition, 17β-estradiol significantly prevented the ex-vivo release of IL-1β and VEGF from lung tissue. Conclusions We demonstrated that intestinal IR interferes with lung homeostasis, priming the tissue to generate proinflammatory mediators for at least 24 h postischemia. Furthermore, our data confirm that the inflammatory responses caused by intestinal IR are estradiol mediated. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","17β-Estradiol; Cytokines; Inflammation; Intestinal ischemia and reperfusion; Lung; Uric acid",,2-s2.0-85028349842

Because biological processes are difficult to directly record over large areas, abiotic characteristics are used as surrogate parameters. In this work, the Mediterranean Sea was classified into homogeneous spatial areas based on abiotic variables. Eight parameters were selected based on salinity, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, sea-wave heights and depth variables. The parameters were gathered in grid points of 0.5° spatial resolution in the open sea and 0.125° in coastal areas. The typologies were obtained by data mining the eight parameters throughout the Mediterranean and combining two clustering techniques: self-organizing maps and the k-means algorithm. The result is a division of the Mediterranean Sea into seven typologies. For these typologies, the classification recognizes differences in temperature, salinity and radiation. In addition, it separates coastal from deep areas. The influence of river discharges and the entrance of water from other seas are also reflected. These results are consistent with the ecological requirements of the five studied seagrasses (Posidonia oceanica, Zostera marina, Zostera noltei, Cymodocea nodosa, Halophila stipulacea), supporting the suitability of the resulting classification and the proposed methodology.

We developed a method that leverages TLS collections with machine learning techniques to model and map canopy cover and biomass of several classes of short-stature vegetation across large plots. We collected high-definition TLS scans of 26 1-ha plots in desert grasslands and big sagebrush shrublands in southwest Idaho, USA. We used the Random Forests machine learning algorithm to develop decision tree models predicting the biomass and canopy cover of several vegetation classes from statistical descriptors of the aboveground heights of TLS points. Manual measurements of vegetation characteristics collected within each plot served as training and validation data. Models based on five or fewer TLS descriptors of vegetation heights were developed to predict the canopy cover fraction of shrubs (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 7%), annual grasses (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 21%), perennial grasses (R2 = 0.36, RMSE = 12%), forbs (R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 6%), bare earth or litter (R2 = 0.49, RMSE = 19%), and the biomass of shrubs (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 175 g) and herbaceous vegetation (R2 = 0.61, RMSE = 99 g) (all values reported are out-of-bag). Our models explained much of the variability between predictions and manual measurements, and yet we expect that future applications could produce even better results by reducing some of the methodological sources of error that we encountered. Our work demonstrates how TLS can be used efficiently to extend manual measurement of vegetation characteristics from small to large plots in grasslands and shrublands, with potential application to other similarly structured ecosystems. Our method shows that vegetation structural characteristics can be modeled without classifying and delineating individual plants, a challenging and time-consuming step common in previous methods applying TLS to vegetation inventory. Improving application of TLS to studies of shrub-steppe ecosystems will serve immediate management needs by enhancing vegetation inventories, environmental modeling studies, and the ability to train broader datasets collected from air and space. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Carbon; Classification; Land cover; Lidar; Machine learning; Point cloud; Rangelands; Remote sensing; Structure from motion (SfM); Vegetation type","Artificial intelligence; Biomass; Carbon; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optical radar; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Seebeck effect; Surveying instruments; Land cover; Point cloud; Rangelands; Structure from motion; Vegetation type; Vegetation; algorithm; environmental modeling; grass; lidar; machine learning; phytomass; shrub; shrubland; vegetation cover; vegetation structure; Idaho; United States; Artemisia tridentata; Poaceae",2-s2.0-85030456606

Reference or minimally disturbed sites to evaluate the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) for each river type were selectedpreviously to the development and selection of the most appropriate metrics or biotic index based on benthic communities for the assessment of the ecological quality of the rivers. In this frame, 42 European metrics and indices, were tested against a) their response to three quality gradients (undisturbed, slightly disturbed and disturbed), b) their acquisition of a low interquartile coefficientand c) a low Spearman's correlation between the metrics and indices. Hence, 9 metrics and indices were examined for their response to human pressures and the Hellenic Evaluation System 2 (HESY2) was selectedand successfully intercalibrated with the assessment methods of the other countries, using the option of indirect comparison based on near-natural reference sites (reference benchmarking). This index showed a significant correlation with some anthropogenic pressures (e.g. P-PO4 3−, artificial and agricultural areas) in all IC types. HESY2 estimates also more than 86% of the moderate samples correctly and beside this, it provides a precise, explicit and simply applicable assessment of the ecological quality status in Greek streams and rivers. HESY2 is applied for the assessment of the ecological quality in Greek running waters and will be further justified considering the results of the forthcoming National Monitoring Program (2017–2022). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomonitoring; Intercalibration; Macroinvertebrates; Reference conditions; Typology; Water quality","Ecology; Environmental regulations; Integrated circuits; Rivers; Water; Water conservation; Water quality; Biomonitoring; Intercalibration; Macroinvertebrates; Reference condition; Typology; Quality control; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; benthos; environmental quality; index method; macroinvertebrate; reference sample; river water; streamwater; typology; water quality; Europe; Greece; Mediterranean Region",2-s2.0-85029914796

Aiming to increase knowledge in urban biodiversity we compared the diversity of vascular plants and soil microbial communities (fungi and bacteria) in two contrasting typologies of urban green spaces (public gardens and remnant forests) in the city of Coimbra (Portugal). We found 252 taxa of vascular plants of which 58% were native and 42% exotic. Although overall diversity indices were similar in both typologies of green spaces, species richness and percentage cover of native taxa were significantly higher in forests than in gardens. Overall, plant communities in the two typologies of green spaces were distinct. We found high variability among gardens, which is consistent with vegetation in gardens being determined by man rather than by competitive or successional processes. Interestingly, the disparity between gardens and forests was also visible for both bacterial and fungal communities indicating an association between above and below-ground communities. We showed that, due to their origin, remnant forests harbour plant taxa with high conservation and ecological values. It also showed that gardens have higher percentage of exotic species, which led us to conclude that native plant species should be given more emphasis in these spaces. City planners should promote urban development by incorporating an ecological perspective into their management plans to enhance human health and global environmental quality. © 2017","Conservation; Ecological value; Quality of life; Soil microbial communities; Urban green spaces; Vascular plants","Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Tracheophyta",2-s2.0-85032739910

Until the twenty-first century, biology was mainly an analytical science and has now reached a point where it merges with engineering science, paving the way for synthetic biology. One of the objectives of synthetic biology is to try to change the chemical compositions of living cells, that is, to create an artificial biological diversity, which in turn fosters a new sub-field of synthetic biology, xenobiology. In particular, the genetic code in living systems is based on highly standardized chemistry composed of the same “letters” or nucleotides as informational polymers (DNA, RNA) and the 20 amino acids which serve as basic building blocks for proteins. The universality of the genetic code enables not only vertical gene transfer within the same species but also horizontal gene transfer across biological taxa, which require a high degree of standardization and interconnectivity. Although some minor alterations of the standard genetic code are found in nature (e.g., proteins containing non-conical amino acids exist in nature, and some organisms use alternated coding systems), all structurally deep chemistry changes within living systems are generally lethal, making the creation of artificial biological system an extremely difficult challenge. In this context, one of the great challenges for bioscience is the development of a strategy for expanding the standard basic chemical repertoire of living cells. Attempts to alter the meaning of the genetic information stored in DNA as an informational polymer by changing the chemistry of the polymer (i.e., xeno-nucleic acids) or by changes in the genetic code have already yielded successful results. In the future this should enable the partial or full redirection of the biological information flow to generate “new” version(s) of the genetic code derived from the “old” biological world. In addition to the scientific challenges, the attempt to increase biochemical diversity also raises important ethical and philosophical issues. Although promotors of this branch of synthetic biology highlight the many potential applications to come (e.g., novel tools for diagnostics and fighting infection diseases), such developments could also bring risks affecting social, political, and other structures of nearly all societies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Ethics; New-to-nature; Non-canonical amino acids; Philosophy; Synthetic biology; Xenobiology",,2-s2.0-85032574683

However, most biotic and hydromorphological indices that have been developed for implementing the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) are characterized by limited spatial and temporal scales of application. In addition, the indices based on the biological quality elements defined by the WFD are sensitive to water quality but not to hydromorphological alterations. To overcome these limitations, alternative hydromorphological and biotic indices have recently been developed. In this study we compared the results obtained with the Morphological Quality Index (MQI) to those of three biotic indices, the Odonate River Index (ORI) and two BQE-based indices, in seven rivers of northern Italy. MQI and ORI resulted highly and significantly correlated, and alterations of river functionality and continuity were the most relevant impacts affecting dragonfly assemblages. Conversely, no significant relationships were found between the MQI and both BQE-based indices and assemblages. The significant correlation between MQI and ORI can be explained by the correspondence of the spatial scale of application (i.e. the whole river corridor). In contrast, the lack of correlation between the BQE-based indices and MQI can probably be attributed to the different spatial scales at which the indices work. The results of this study underline the importance of evaluating the lateral dimension of the river corridor and the need to apply reach-scale indices to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of river corridor conditions and to define appropriate management actions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biological quality elements; Dragonflies; Hydromorphology; River management; River restoration; Water Framework Directive","Environmental regulations; Restoration; Water conservation; Water quality; Dragonflies; Hydromorphology; River management; River restoration; Water Framework Directives; Rivers; assessment method; biotic factor; dragonfly; index method; management practice; river basin; river management; stream; water quality; Italy; Anisoptera (dragonflies)",2-s2.0-85029573730

Decline complexes involve multiple biotic and abiotic factors, which combine to reduce host vigor. In order to investigate forest decline, it is necessary to take a systems approach by considering biotic agents and their interactions with environmental factors, as unfavorable conditions may predispose host trees to pests and diseases. AOD affected trees have lesions in the phloem caused by necrogenic bacteria associated with galleries of the two-spotted oak buprestid (Agrilus biguttatus). Here, we test the extent to which AOD is influenced by environmental predisposition factors traditionally associated with oak decline. These are often factors that reduce water availability. During 2013 and 2014 extensive surveys were undertaken, which systematically visited oak woodlands across England and Wales. These locations were used in conjunction with reports from landowners, which have been collected from 2006 onwards. In total 544 locations have been used to assess relationships with soil type, climatic factors and pollutant deposition, notably atmospheric nitrogen, using logistic regression models. The resulting model has been used to produce a detailed risk map for England and Wales and predictions have been validated using the locations of an independent dataset of A. biguttatus sightings collected by entomologists. This spatial study re-emphasises the importance of predisposition factors in decline syndromes and suggests avenues for future management and mitigation. © 2017",,"Location; Maps; Regression analysis; Abiotic factors; Atmospheric nitrogen; Climatic factors; England and Wales; Environmental factors; Logistic regression models; Systems approach; Water availability; Forestry; Agrilus biguttatus; Buprestidae",2-s2.0-85032835692

Surface waters of the Meuse river network were over-saturated in CO2, CH4, N2O with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, acting as sources of these greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, although the dissolved gases also showed marked seasonal and spatial variations. Seasonal variations were related to changes in freshwater discharge following the hydrological cycle, with highest concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O during low water owing to a longer water residence time and lower currents (i.e. lower gas transfer velocities), both contributing to the accumulation of gases in the water column, combined with higher temperatures favourable to microbial processes. Inter-annual differences of discharge also led to differences in CH4 and N2O that were higher in years with prolonged low water periods. Spatial variations were mostly due to differences in land cover over the catchments, with systems dominated by agriculture (croplands and pastures) having higher CO2, CH4, N2O levels than forested systems. This seemed to be related to higher levels of dissolved and particulate organic matter, as well as dissolved inorganic nitrogen in agriculture dominated systems compared to forested ones. Groundwater had very low CH4 concentrations in the shallow and unconfined aquifers (mostly fractured limestones) of the Meuse basin, hence, should not contribute significantly to the high CH4 levels in surface riverine waters. Owing to high dissolved concentrations, groundwater could potentially transfer important quantities of CO2 and N2O to surface waters of the Meuse basin, although this hypothesis remains to be tested. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Land use; Methane; Meuse river; Nitrous oxide","Agriculture; Aquifers; Biological materials; Catchments; Dissolution; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Land use; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Rivers; Runoff; Surface waters; Agricultural land use; Atmospheric equilibrium; Catchment land covers; Dissolved concentrations; Dissolved inorganic nitrogens; Meuse rivers; Nitrous oxide; Particulate organic matters; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; fresh water; ground water; methane; nitrous oxide; organic matter; organic nitrogen; surface water; agricultural land; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); discharge; land use; methane; nitrous oxide; seasonal variation; spatial variation; surface water; agricultural land; Article; atmosphere; Belgium; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; gas diffusion; greenhouse gas; particulate matter; priority journal; river; summer; water cycle; water pollution; winter; Belgium; Meuse River",2-s2.0-85028707684

The aim is to provide a method for assessing the contribution to, and valuing, multiple ES provided by urban greenery that can be readily applied in routine planning processes. The framework is unique as it recognizes that an urban greenery comprises several components and functions that can contribute to multiple ecosystem services in one or more ways via different functional traits (e.g. foliage characteristics) for which readily measured indicators have been identified. The framework consists of five steps including compilation of an inventory of indicator; application of effectivity factors to rate indicators' effectiveness; estimation of effects; estimation of benefits for each ES; estimation of the total ES value of the ecosystem. The framework was applied to assess ecosystem services provided by trees, shrubs, herbs, birds, and bees, in green areas spanning an urban gradient in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Habitat degradation and species introductions are major threats to global biodiversity, and riverine fish are among the most threatened taxa in the world. Our interest was whether the presence of non-native species can affect native fish sensitivity to water quality deterioration in a large region in northeastern Spain (99,700 km2, 15 catchments, 530 sites). We used a ‘base model’ with geographical and hydro-morphological variables, which are the major shaping factors in rivers. We tested whether water pollution, non-native species, or their interaction provided an improved understanding of patterns of distributions and health measurements of the twelve most common native species. There was little evidence that variation in native species abundance, where they occurred, the presence of diseases and changes in mean fish length or body condition was affected by water deterioration, the presence of non-native species, or their interaction. The disease rate and occurrence of native species might be affected, to a minor degree, by water quality changes and the presence of non-native species. Environmental conditions between sites with and without non-native fish differed in the condition of riparian areas and in water quality. Based on presence-absence data and changes in abundances through weighted average equations we also derived potential safe levels of salinization, nutrient pollution, and pH for the native fish. Overall, additive effects of stressors prevail over interactions, and the restoration of natural hydro-morphology in rivers is likely to be the most effective management approach to improving the prospects for the native fish fauna. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic invasions; Ecological surprises; Freshwater fish; Hydromorphological alterations; Multiple stressors; Stressor interactions","Biodiversity; Catchments; Deterioration; Ecology; Fish; Forestry; Pollution; River pollution; Rivers; Water quality; Aquatic invasions; Ecological surprises; Freshwater fishes; Hydromorphological alterations; Multiple stressors; Water pollution; environmental stress; fluvial geomorphology; freshwater ecosystem; geomorphological response; introduced species; native species; river engineering; water pollution; Article; body constitution; body height; freshwater fish; native species; nonhuman; nutrient; pH; population abundance; priority journal; riparian ecosystem; river ecosystem; salinization; Spain; species distribution; species invasion; water pollution; water quality; Spain",2-s2.0-85022054191

However, non-raptor birds are also poisoned (rodenticide exposure resulting in adverse effects including mortality) by rodenticides through consumption of the rodenticide bait and contaminated prey. A literature search for rodenticide incidents (evidence of exposure to a rodenticide, adverse effects, or exposure to placebo baits) involving non-raptor birds returned 641 records spanning the years 1931 to 2016. The incidents included 17 orders, 58 families, and 190 non-raptor bird species. Nineteen anticoagulant and non-anticoagulant rodenticide active ingredients were associated with the incidents. The number of incidents and species detected were compared by surveillance method. An incident was considered to have been reported through passive surveillance if it was voluntarily reported to the authorities whereas the report of an incident found through field work that was conducted with the objective of documenting adverse effects on birds was determined to be from active surveillance. More incidents were reported from passive surveillance than with active surveillance but a significantly greater number of species were detected in proportion to the number of incidents found through active surveillance than with passive surveillance (z = 7.61, p < 0.01). Results suggest that reliance on only one surveillance method can underestimate the number of incidents that have occurred and the number of species that are affected. Although rodenticides are used worldwide, incident records were found from only 15 countries. Therefore, awareness of the breadth of species diversity of non-raptor bird poisonings from rodenticides may increase incident reportings and can strengthen the predictions of harm characterized by risk assessments. © 2017","Anticoagulant rodenticide; Non-anticoagulant rodenticide; Non-target species; Surveillance method","brodifacoum; bromadiolone; chlorophacinone; colecalciferol; coumachlor; coumafen; coumatetralyl; cyanide; difenacoum; difethiolone; diphenadione; flocoumafen; fluoroacetamide; fluoroacetate sodium; phosphorus; rodenticide; strychnine; thallium; unclassified drug; warfarin; zinc phosphide; bird; contaminated animal; dietary intake; environmental exposure; health impact assessment; intoxication; nonhuman; Note; prey; priority journal; risk assessment; rodenticide poisoning; species diversity; Aves; Raptores",2-s2.0-85025073099

Several models, primarily based on spatially explicit Lotka–Volterra competition dynamics, have been developed to understand this phenomenon. In general, the goal of these models is to relate fundamental life history traits, for example dispersal ability and competition strength, to the rate of spread of the invasive species, which is also the rate at which the invasive species displaces its native competitor. Stage-structure is often an important determinant of population dynamics, but it has received little attention within the context of Lotka–Volterra invasion models. For many species, behaviors like dispersal and competition depend on life-stage. To describe the processes of invasion in these species, it is important to understand how behaviors that vary as a function of life-stage can impact spread rate. In this paper, we develop a spatially explicit, stage-structured Lotka–Volterra competition model. By comparing spread speed predictions from this model to spread speed predictions from an analogous single-stage model, we are able to determine when stage-structure is important and how stage-dependent behavior can alter the characteristics of an invasion. © 2017","Invasion; Lotka–Volterra competition; Spread speed; Stage-structure","competition (ecology); dispersal; invasive species; life history trait; population dynamics; population modeling; Article; controlled study; intermethod comparison; interspecific competition; intraspecific competition; life history; mathematical model; prediction; priority journal; species invasion",2-s2.0-85029040552

Although omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have a beneficial potential pharmacological effect of preventing these psychophysiological symptoms, no clinical data is yet available. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Japanese accident survivors. Methods A total of 83 participants received either omega-3 PUFAs (1470 mg docosahexaenoic acid and 147 mg eicosapentaenoic acid per day) or placebo within 10 days of the accidental injury. After 12-week supplementation, participants performed script-driven imagery of their traumatic event during monitoring of their heart rate and skin conductance. Results Analysis revealed that heart rate during both rest and script-driven imagery was significantly lower in the omega-3 group than the placebo group, whereas baseline heart rate was comparable between the two groups. Limitations The present trial was conducted at a single-center in Japan and psychophysiological symptoms of PTSD in most participants were not serious. Conclusion These findings suggest that post-trauma supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs might be effective for the secondary prevention of psychophysiological symptoms of PTSD. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Arachidonic acid; Autonomic nerve; Aversive memory; Fish oil; n-3; Physiologic measures","docosahexaenoic acid; icosapentaenoic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; placebo; accidental injury; adult; Article; controlled study; diet supplementation; double blind procedure; drug effect; female; heart rate; human; imagery; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; secondary prevention; skin conductance; survivor; symptomatology; therapy effect",2-s2.0-84973545838

The abandonment of traditional land use, and especially the reduction in grazing pressure at high elevations, triggered secondary succession in treeless grassland areas, and favored the upward shift of anthropogenic treelines in some cases. We investigated this process in four anthropogenic treeline ecotone sites in the Central Apennines, Italy, populated by European black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.). The upward treeline shift was controlled by microsite topography and the proximity to plantations acting as seed source. We found a 50% probability of producing cones in trees with basal diameters of 15–25 cm, heights of 2–5 m and ages of 20–25 years. The role played by climate on growth and the recruitment processes seems to be secondary, or could be masked by human-shaped processes. The presence of reproductive age trees at the treeline, mainly growing on debris-rich and steep slope sites, could indicate that the recruitment process will increase in future, leading to patchy tree patterns at different elevations. The high growth and encroachment rates observed at these human-shaped treelines would indicate that general growth dynamics are speeding up, including the tree colonization of treeless areas. These succession processes could cause a significant long-term decline in plant diversity in species-rich grasslands. Nonetheless, tree encroachment could increase forest protection against landslides and avalanches in the context of global change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic treeline; Black pine; Mediterranean mountains; Pasture abandonment; Pine recruitment","Land use; Plants (botany); Seed; Vegetation; Black pines; Mediterranean mountains; Pasture abandonment; Pine recruitment; Treeline; Forestry; Pinus nigra",2-s2.0-85030864480

Litterfall and its decomposition rate are considered the most important ecological processes for soil restoration during stand development on such initial forest habitats. These processes allow development of a functional ecosystem and productive forest stands. Moreover, the pedogenesis process on such “soilless”’ habitats can be significantly improved and accelerated by tree species selection during afforestation. The main aim of the study was to determine litter decomposition rates of nine tree species used for afforestation of a lignite mine spoil heap. We assumed that leaf litter decomposition rates would differ among tree species studied and that the site conditions would significantly influence this process. Our study was conducted on the spoil heap of the lignite open cast mine in Bełchatów, central Poland. We studied leaf litter decomposition of Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus robur, Q. rubra and Robinia pseudoacacia in pure stands of these species (home stands), and litter decomposition of Acer pseudoplatanus, A. glutinosa, Fagus sylvatica, Prunus serotina, Q. rubra, and R. pseudoacacia in Scots pine stands. We used the litterbag method. The experiments lasted for three years and the samples were collected every three months. Leaf litter decomposition calculated for home stands after three years of decomposition was 94.4% of the initial leaf mass for A. glutinosa, 70.9% for R. pseudoacacia, 70.1% for P. sylvestris, 68.3% for B. pendula, 66.9% for Q. rubra and 61.5% for Q. robur. In Scots pine stands, after three years of the experiment, 92.3% of the initial leaf mass decomposed for P. serotina, 85.7% for A. glutinosa, 83.5% for A. pseudoplatanus, 65.2% for R. pseudoacacia, 50.9% for Q. rubra and 40.1% for F. sylvatica. A. glutinosa, R. pseudoacacia and Q. rubra leaves decomposed significantly faster in home stands than in Scots pine stands. Site aspect significantly influenced litter decomposition of the species studied, with higher rates mostly on the western slope. Our study revealed that the decision on tree species used for afforestation might shorten the period needed for soil restoration and achievement of sustainability of novel ecosystems. Proper selection of main and admixture tree species for afforestation of the post-mining sites might reduce the renewal period of the soilless and newly created habitats, which may provide noticeable ecological and economical effects during stand management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Decay rate; Home-field advantage; Litterbags; Scots pine stands; Site aspect; Spoil heap","Conservation; Decay (organic); Ecology; Ecosystems; Lignite; Plants (botany); Reforestation; Restoration; Decay rate; Home-field advantage; Litterbags; Scots pine stands; Site aspect; Spoil heap; Forestry; afforestation; coniferous tree; decomposition; forest soil; leaf litter; lignite; litterfall; mine; opencast mining; pedogenesis; soil improvement; spoil heap; sustainability; Belchatow; Lodzkie; Poland [Central Europe]; Acer pseudoplatanus; Alnus glutinosa; Betula pendula; Fagus sylvatica; Pinus sylvestris; Prunus serotina; Quercus robur; Robinia pseudoacacia",2-s2.0-85030762188

One confounding factor when interpreting eDNA sampling evidence is that eDNA can be present in the water in the absence of living target organisms, originating from excreta, dead tissue, boats, or sewage effluent, etc. In the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), electric fish dispersal barriers were built to prevent non-native Asian carp species from invading Lake Michigan, and yet Asian carp eDNA has been detected above the barriers sporadically since 2009. In this paper the influence of stream flow characteristics in the CAWS on the probability of invasive Asian carp eDNA detection in the CAWS from 2009 to 2012 was examined. In the CAWS, the direction of stream flow is mostly away from Lake Michigan, though there are infrequent reversals in flow direction towards Lake Michigan during dry spells. We find that the flow reversal volume into the Lake has a statistically significant positive relationship with eDNA detection probability, while other covariates, like gage height, precipitation, season, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and chlorophyll concentration do not. This suggests that stream flow direction is highly influential on eDNA detection in the CAWS and should be considered when interpreting eDNA evidence. We also find that the beta-binomial regression model provides a stronger fit for eDNA detection probability compared to a binomial regression model. This paper provides a statistical modeling framework for interpreting eDNA sampling evidence and for evaluating covariates influencing eDNA detection. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Beta-binomial regression; Environmental DNA; Hydrology; Invasive carp","Dissolved oxygen; Effluents; Hydrology; Probability; Regression analysis; Sampling; Sewage; Stream flow; Aquatic invasive species; Beta-binomial regression; Chlorophyll concentration; Detection probabilities; Dissolved oxygen concentrations; Flow charac-teristics; Invasive carp; Statistical modeling; Lakes; chlorophyll; dissolved oxygen; cyprinid; detection method; DNA; hydrology; invasive species; modeling; regression analysis; streamflow; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; carp; concentration (parameters); DNA determination; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; flow rate; geographic distribution; hydrology; Illinois; nonhuman; pH measurement; priority journal; seasonal variation; water supply; water temperature; Chicago; Great Lakes [North America]; Illinois; Lake Michigan; United States; Cyprinidae; Hypophthalmichthys nobilis",2-s2.0-85021436151

Using two vegetative generations of the invasive clonal species Alternanthera philoxeroides, we investigated the effects of maternal and offspring herbivory by Planococcus minor on the integrative defense strategy of plants. Herbivory severely inhibited leaf, stolon and root growth, as well as the production of primary metabolites (soluble sugars, starch, and total non-structural carbohydrates in stolons), and decreased average leaf area and specific leaf area of the second-generation A. philoxeroides. The changes in growth measures of the first-generation A. philoxeroides with herbivory were consistent with that of the second generation. By contrast, herbivory basically did not affect the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate compounds in the roots, and even increased the concentrations of N and total phenols in taproots. Furthermore, herbivory-induced maternal effects also reduced the growth of the second-generation plants. The results suggest that A. philoxeroides is capable of adapting to herbivory by P. minor, mainly via the allocation of available resources in belowground organs, and that the herbivory effect can persist across vegetative generations. These features may potentially improve the regeneration and tolerance of A. philoxeroides after a short-term herbivory. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Alternanthera philoxeroides; Asexual reproduction; Defense strategy; Foliar herbivory; Maternal effect; Planococcus minor","Carbohydrates; Chemical compounds; Metabolites; Plants (botany); Alternanthera philoxeroides; Asexual reproduction; Defense strategy; Herbivory; Maternal effects; Planococcus minor; Network security; carbohydrate; phenol derivative; starch; sugar; defense behavior; growth rate; herbivory; plant; weed; adaptation; Alternanthera philoxeroides; Article; carbohydrate analysis; clonal species; controlled study; growth inhibition; herbivory; leaf area; leaf growth; maternal herbivory; metabolite; nonhuman; offspring herbivory; physical tolerance; Planococcus (insect); Planococcus minor; plant defense; plant growth; plant insect interaction; plant regeneration; plant root; plant stem; priority journal; root growth; stem elongation; stolon; Alternanthera philoxeroides",2-s2.0-85021238597

We evaluated the effects of sampling effort (transect length) on fish metrics, such as species richness and two fish indices (the new European Fish Index EFI + and a regional index, IBICAT2b), in the mainstem of a large Mediterranean river. For this purpose, we sampled by boat electrofishing five sites each with 10 consecutive transects corresponding to a total length of 20 times the river width (European standard required by the Water Framework Directive) and we also analysed the effect of sampling area on previous surveys. Species accumulation curves and richness extrapolation estimates in general suggested that species richness was reasonably estimated with transect lengths of 10 times the river width or less. The EFI + index was significantly affected by sampling area, both for our samplings and previous data. Surprisingly, EFI + values in general decreased with increasing sampling area, despite the higher observed richness, likely because the expected values of metrics were higher. By contrast, the regional fish index was not dependent on sampling area, likely because it does not use a predictive model. Both fish indices, but particularly the EFI +, decreased with less forest cover percentage, even within the smaller disturbance gradient in the river type studied (mainstem of a large Mediterranean river, where environmental pressures are more general). Although the two fish-based indices are very different in terms of their development, methodology, and metrics used, they were significantly correlated and provided a similar assessment of ecological status. Our results reinforce the importance of standardization of sampling methods for bioassessment and suggest that predictive models that use sampling area as a predictor might be more affected by differences in sampling effort than simpler biotic indices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological status; European fish index EFI +; Index of biotic integrity; Non-native species;  Human impact","Ecology; Environmental regulations; Fish; Forestry; Rivers; Water conservation; Ecological status; Fish indices; Human impact; Index of biotic integrity; Non-native species; Importance sampling; anthropogenic effect; bioindicator; conservation status; electrofishing; fish; freshwater ecosystem; Index of Biotic Integrity; land use change; Mediterranean environment; sampling; Article; community ecology; controlled study; ecological assessment; ecological status; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental impact; environmental parameters; environmental pressure; environmental temperature; forest cover; human impact; IBICAT2b Index; land use; land use change; Mediterranean river; new European Fish Index; nonbiological model; nonhuman; parameters; population abundance; precipitation; predictive model; priority journal; river; river transect length; sampling; species accumulation; species composition; species density; species richness; standardization; temperature dependence; water temperature; Europe",2-s2.0-85021912470

However, riverine and nonriverine freshwaters have often been assessed separately and their interdependence and connection has not been considered appropriately in prevailing freshwater conservation planning. To address the representation and persistence of freshwater ecosystems in conservation assessment, we integrated riverine and nonriverine freshwater wetlands as broad-scale conservation surrogates and incorporated longitudinal, lateral and vertical connectivity rules in a conservation planning for the freshwater wetlands in the North China Plain (NCP). We also considered interbasin connectivity by incorporating conservation features of key transferring nodes of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWD) in the NCP to safeguard their unique ecosystem services of regulating interbasin freshwater. Three scenarios (i.e., 2D, 3D and interbasin scenario) were developed by incorporating different multiple conservation targets, and their spatial priorities and cost-efficiency in freshwater conservation were compared. We applied systematic conservation framework and modified Marxan to accommodate these multidirectional and interbasin connectivity targets in our freshwater conservation assessment. The results indicated that the existing conservation system covered approximately 20% of the freshwater wetlands in the NCP, and there were still considerable conservation gaps that need to be filled. The optimal scenarios could substantially improve the representation, complementarity and persistence for the conservation of freshwater ecosystems, but would not significantly increased overall costs.

Much less attention has focused on the possibility of disturbance interactions that buffer ecological change. In this review, we discuss and classify evidence for interactions between two forest disturbances common in eastern North America—wind damage and fire—focusing on studies where forest wind damage precedes fire. Interaction mechanisms are classified according to how they influence ecosystem resistance to and resilience from subsequent disturbances and whether interactions have synergistic or antagonistic effects. Several important generalizations emerge from this synthesis of disturbance interactions. First, buffering interactions between wind damage and fire may be more important when fire intensity is low. Second, wind–fire interactions related to changes in fuel may vary with climatic conditions, with regional differences, and with intensity or severity of individual disturbances. Third, both amplifying and buffering effects may co-occur in a spatial mosaic through a variety of interaction mechanisms. In this respect, the concept of ecosystem response to multiple disturbances parallels that of classical models of successional pathways. It is useful to conceptualize ecosystem response to compounded disturbances as a diverse collection of individual, co-occurring mechanisms of interaction rather than considering multiple disturbances to be wholly amplifying or wholly buffering. Future studies on wind–fire disturbances that explicitly examine mechanisms of interactions and the factors that govern them will aid in understanding these ecologically important and ubiquitous forest disturbances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Blowdown; Compounded disturbances; Disturbance interactions; Fire; Interaction mechanisms; Wind damage","Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Antagonistic effects; Blow down; Compounded disturbances; Eastern north america; Ecological disturbance; Interaction mechanisms; Regional differences; Wind damage; Fires; buffering; disturbance; ecosystem response; forest ecosystem; forest fire; storm damage; North America",2-s2.0-85032859274

The presence of these products, designed to modulate human physiology and behaviour, has created concern over whether PhACs similarly affect aquatic organisms. Though laboratory studies are beginning to address the effects of individual PhACs on fish behaviour, few studies have assessed the effects of exposure to complex, realistic wastewater effluents on fish behaviour. In this study, we exposed a wild, invasive fish species—the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus)—to treated wastewater effluent (0%, 50% or 100% effluent dilutions) for 28 days. We then determined the impact of exposure on fish aggression, an important behaviour for territory acquisition and defense. We found that exposure to 100% wastewater effluent reduced the number of aggressive acts that round goby performed. We complimented our behavioural assay with measures of pharmaceutical uptake in fish tissues. We detected 11 of 93 pharmaceutical compounds that we tested for in round goby tissues, and we found that concentration was greatest in the brain followed by plasma, then gonads, then liver, and muscle. Fish exposed to 50% and 100% effluent had higher tissue concentrations of pharmaceuticals and concentrated a greater number of pharmaceutical compounds compare to control fish exposed to no (0%) effluent. Exposed fish also showed increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in liver tissue, suggesting that fish were exposed to planar halogenated/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHHs/PAHs) in the wastewater effluent. Our findings suggest that fish in effluent-dominated systems may have altered behaviours and greater tissue concentration of PhACs.

Abstract: Brassica nigra (2n = 16, BB) represents the diploid Brassica B genome which carries many useful genes and traits for breeding but received limited studies. To dissect the B genome from B. nigra, the triploid F1 hybrid (2n = 26, CCB) obtained previously from the cross B. oleracea var. alboglabra (2n = 18, CC) × B. nigra was used as the maternal parent and backcrossed successively to parental B. oleracea. The progenies in BC1 to BC3 generations were analyzed by the methods of FISH and SSR markers to screen the monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) with each of eight different B-genome chromosomes added to C genome (2n = 19, CC + 1B1−8), and seven different MAALs were established, except for the one with chromosome B2 which existed in one triple addition. Most of these MAALs were distinguishable morphologically from each other, as they expressed the characters from B. nigra differently and at variable extents. The alien chromosome remained unpaired as a univalent in 86.24% pollen mother cells at diakinesis or metaphase I, and formed a trivalent with two C-genome chromosomes in 13.76% cells. Transmission frequency of all the added chromosomes was far higher through the ovules (averagely 14.40%) than the pollen (2.64%). The B1, B4 and B5 chromosomes were transmitted by female at much higher rates (22.38–30.00%) than the other four (B3, B6, B7, B8) (5.04–8.42%). The MAALs should be valuable for exploiting the genome structure and evolution of B. nigra. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,"Chromosomes; Brassica oleracea; Genome chromosomes; Genome structures; Monosomic alien addition lines; Morphological analysis; Pollen mother cells; SSR markers; Transmission frequencies; Genes",2-s2.0-85029004907

However, the genetic resources of these species remain dramatically understudied, putting at risk their future availability from in situ and ex situ sources. Here we assess the distribution of genetic diversity of the four rice CWRs known to occur in Colombia (O. glumaepatula, O. alta, O. grandiglumis, and O. latifolia). Furthermore, we estimated the degree of overlap between areas with suitable habitat for cultivated and wild rice, both under current and predicted future climate conditions to assess the potential spatiotemporal scale of potential gene flow from GM rice to its CWRs. Results: Our findings suggest that part of the observed genetic diversity and structure, at least of the most exhaustively sampled species, may be explained by their glacial and post-glacial range dynamics. Furthermore, in assessing the expected impact of climate change and the potential spatiotemporal scale of gene flow between populations of CWRs and GM rice we find significant overlap between present and future suitable areas for cultivated rice and its four CWRs. Climate change is expected to have relatively limited negative effects on the rice CWRs, with three species showing opportunities to expand their distribution ranges in the future. Conclusions: Given (i) the sparse presence of CWR populations in protected areas (ii) the strong suitability overlap between cultivated rice and its four CWRs; and (iii) the complexity of managing and regulating areas to prevent alien gene flow, the first priority should be to establish representative ex situ collections for all CWR species, which currently do not exist. In the absence of studies under field conditions on the scale and extent of gene flow between cultivated rice and its Colombian CWRs, effective in situ conservation might best be achieved through tailor-made management plans and exclusion of GM rice cultivation in areas holding the most genetically diverse CWR populations. This may be combined with assisted migration of populations to suitable areas where rice is unlikely to be cultivated under current and future climate conditions. © 2017, The Author(s).","Alien gene flow; Climate change; Colombia; Crop wild relatives; Genetic diversity; Habitat suitability; Rice cultivation",,2-s2.0-85017594550

Historical factors relating to plant introduction appeared to be as important as environmental factors in determining which species occurred in which park, while within parks canopy cover and altitude were generally most influential. Spread away from trails was only evident in open habitats, including natural savannas in Baluran National Park, threatened by invasion of Acacia nilotica.

Here we have investigated if bacterial TatA, or chimeric pea/E. coli TatA derivatives, are capable of replacing thylakoidal TatA in function. While authentic E. coli TatA does not show any transport activity in thylakoid transport experiments, TatA chimeras comprising the transmembrane helix (TMH) of pea TatA are fully active. For minimal catalytic activity it is even sufficient to replace three residues within TMH of E. coli TatA by the corresponding pea residues. Almost any further substitution within TMH gradually raises transport activity in the thylakoid system, while functional characterization of the same set of TatA derivatives in E. coli yields essentially inverse catalytic activities.

Since Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae) has become an important pest in North America and Europe (i.e., in 2008), the global production of soft thin-skinned fruits has faced severe production losses. In the southern Neotropical region, however, the first record of D. suzukii occurred in 2013 in the south of Brazil. It has also been recorded in Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile. Despite its recent occurrence in the southern Neotropical region, the fast dispersion of D. suzukii has inspired local research efforts in an attempt to mitigate the consequences of this insect pest invasion. In this forum, we explore the current status of D. suzukii in southern Neotropical regions, discussing its future perspectives. Additionally, we attempt to draft activities and a research agenda that may help to mitigate the losses caused by D. suzukii in native and commercial soft-skinned fruits produced in this region. Currently, D. suzukii appears to be well established in the south of Brazil, but considering the entire southern Neotropical region, the invasion panorama is still underinvestigated. The lack of studies and regulatory actions against D. suzukii has contributed to the invasion success of this species in this region.

In central Europe, some vascular plant species demonstrate confinement to the corridors of large rivers. They are termed river corridor plants (RCPs). RCPs are an important component of regional biodiversity and include a high proportion of threatened species, thus they deserve attention. Here we examine: (1) the detailed distribution pattern of RCPs within a river valley, (2) the habitat preferences of RCP species, and (3) the correlation between the richness of RCP species and selected variables. The studied variables include: river bed proximity, distance from the river mouth, floodplain coverage, richness of native, red listed and invasive species, and number of habitats considered to be of Europaean Community importance. Surveys were conducted in 10 transects running perpendicularly to the San River bed (Poland, central Europe). Each transect was divided into 14 plots (1 km × 1 km). In each plot, the site locations of RCPs as well as their habitats were recorded. The occurrence of all vascular plant species in a particular plot was also noted. The richness and abundance of RCP species depended on the distance from the river and the floodplain coverage in a plot. The plots located in the vicinity of the river were the richest in RCP species and usually harbored the largest number of native, red-listed and invasive species. They were also characterized by the largest number of habitats considered to be of importance to the European Community. RCP species differed in the degree of confinement to habitats regarded as typical for them. Some of the RCP species were recorded only within typical habitats while others were found in several different types of habitats, including anthropogenic ones. Knowledge concerning the RCP distribution pattern and its correlates can make restoration initiatives in river valleys more effective. While implementing conservation measures in river valleys, one should keep in mind that: (1) hotspots of RCP and invasive species spatially overlap and (2) anthropogenic linear elements occurring within river valleys constitute important habitats for some RCP species. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alien plants; Floodplain; Linear landscape elements; Plant invasions; River valley management; Threatened plants","Banks (bodies of water); Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Floods; Landforms; Plants (botany); Alien plants; Flood plains; Landscape elements; Plant invasion; River valley; Threatened plants; Rivers; abundance; biodiversity; biological invasion; endangered species; floodplain; habitat selection; human activity; introduced species; invasive species; landscape structure; native species; population distribution; ria; river bed; river management; species richness; San River; Tracheophyta",2-s2.0-85027530590

We identified three different taxa over less than 200 km2: the autochthonous P. perezi, along with the alien P. ridibundus and P. kurtmuelleri, which have suddenly become invasive. As a consequence, the latter hybridizes and may now form a novel hybridogenetic complex with P. perezi, which could actively promote its replacement. This exceptional situation makes a textbook application of genetics to early-detect, monitor and understand the onset of biological invasions before they pose a continental-wide threat.

Numerical results show that generalist predators are more likely to succeed in alien invasion by reducing the threshold size of the spatial domain of initial invasion, below which invasion fails. © 2017, The Author(s).","free boundary; generalist predator-prey model; long-time behaviour",,2-s2.0-85029842742

In this study, we analyzed the structure of copepod assemblages and cross-shelf patterns based on functional traits and indicator value analysis. Copepod samples were collected from 54 stations distributed along the inner, middle, and outer continental shelves covering a wide geographical area (20,100 km2). Overall, 38 species were identified: 20 Calanoida, 14 Cyclopoida, and 4 Harpacticoida. Copepod density was the highest in the inner shelf profile, with richness and diversity being higher on the outer shelf close to the shelf break. The results suggest that there is a gradient of zooplankton distribution even on narrow (&lt;50 km) continental shelves. The cluster analysis of the stations showed a tendency to form three groups largely corresponding to physical location. Two major functional groups were identified, sorted by spawning strategy. These were subdivided according to the trophic regime and feeding strategy. Temora turbinata (alien species), Clausocalanus furcatus, and Ditrichocorycaeus amazonicus (native species) were found to be ecological indicators. These species have different functional traits and distinct cross-shelf distributions, where the alien species dominates the turbid coastal waters, and C. furcatus is an indicator of outer-shelf waters. Thus, these species can be considered ecological indicators of the different continental shelf waters. The results indicate that it is necessary to understand the functional diversity and ecological indicators of copepods, considering their importance for the basis of marine food webs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Continental shelf; Functional diversity; Invasive species; Zooplankton","Cluster analysis; Continental shelves; Ecological indicators; Ecosystem functioning; Functional diversity; Invasive species; Outer continental shelves; Zooplankton; Zooplankton distributions; Ecology; Calanoida; Clausocalanus furcatus; Copepoda; Cyclopoida; Harpacticoida; Temora turbinata",2-s2.0-85027853462

Here, we reported a resource of large-scale molecular markers for tracking alien introgressions in wheat based on transcriptome sequences. By aligning A. cristatum unigenes with the Chinese Spring reference genome sequences, we designed 9602 A. cristatum expressed sequence tag-sequence-Tagged site (EST-STS) markers for PCR amplification and experimental screening. As a result, 6063 polymorphic EST-STS markers were specific for the A. cristatum P genome in the single-receipt wheat background. A total of 4956 randomly selected polymorphic EST-STS markers were further tested in eight wheat variety backgrounds, and 3070 markers displaying stable and polymorphic amplification were validated. These markers covered more than 98% of the A. cristatum genome, and the marker distribution density was approximately 1.28 cM. An application case of all EST-STS markers was validated on the A. cristatum 6 P chromosome. These markers were successfully applied in the tracking of alien A. cristatum chromatin.

Epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in mediating ecological plasticity. In particular, DNA methylation has been the focus of attempts to understand the mechanism of phenotypic plasticity. The relationship between temperature and DNA methylation and how it affects the adaptability of invasive insects remain unknown. To investigate the temperature resistance role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) in MED, we cloned and sequenced BtDnmt1 homology and identified its functions under various temperature conditions. The full-length cDNA of MED BtDnmt1 homology was 5,958 bp and has a 4,287 bp open reading frame that encodes a 1,428-amino-acid protein. BtDnmt1 mRNA expression levels were significantly down-regulated after feeding with dsRNA.

The aim was to evaluate the effect of a potential competition between the invasive Halimeda incrassata, the native Posidonia oceanica and Dasycladus vermicularis, by means of antioxidant-related biomarkers in waters of Mallorca. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes–catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd)-, the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde as indicator of lipid peroxidation were evaluated. The concentration of 3,6,7-trihydroxycoumarin (THC) was measured in D. vermicularis. P. oceanica biomarkers were not altered while D. vermicularis coexisting with the invader showed higher GSH levels (46%) and antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase 74%, SOD 65%, GPx 86% and GRd 98%), although without lipid damage. H. incrassata showed higher malondialdehyde and GSH levels (30% and 31%, respectively), and catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activities (51%, 35% and 84%, respectively) in presence of P. oceanica respect to being alone; and higher superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase in the presence of D. vermicularis (22% and 42%, respectively). THC concentration in D. vermicularis was significantly higher (53%) in samples competing with H. incrassata. Altogether, native P. oceanica meadows seem unaffected by the alien H. incrassata-which suffered oxidative stress competing with the other species-; whereas increased antioxidant capacities were evidenced in D. vermicularis, possibly as an adaptation mechanism to the new stressful situation that reflect differences in the physiological activities of the three species.

Although non-native invasive plants frequently occur in disturbed natural vegetation bordering crop fields, their impact on crop pollination has not been studied. We investigated whether an invasive plant (Lantana camara) influences flower visitation to mango (Mangifera indica), a pollinator-dependent crop, and whether the invasive supports mango pollinators when mango is not flowering. We surveyed insect flower-visitation in mango orchards bordering natural vegetation and within adjacent natural vegetation, with and without L. camara present, before, during and after mango flowering. We used these data to calculate the indirect effect of L. camara on mango through shared flower visitors before, during and after mango flowering, and the effects of the invasive on crop productivity. Lantana camara had a positive effect on mango flower visitation at low to medium mango flower density, but not at high mango flower densities. Although L. camara and mango shared flower visitor species, the frequency with which these flower visitor species visited the crop and the invasive differed markedly before, during and after mango flowering. Furthermore, the potential indirect effect of L. camara on mango via shared visitors was greatest when mango was flowering, but significantly lower before and after mango flowering, suggesting that the invasive is unimportant in the diet of mango flower visitors when the crop is not flowering. Contrary to findings in previous studies using native species in mango fields, there was a trend (not significant) for lower mango fruit production in fields with L. camara. This suggests that Lantana does not contribute to an increase in successful pollination of mango. Although our focal alien invasive plant species facilitated flower visitation of crops, it had no effect on mango production, and provided little support to mango flower visitor species that live longer than the crop's flowering period. Given that L. camara is detrimental to grazing and was not associated with increased mango production, the removal of this invasive is advisable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Competition vs. facilitation; Crop pollination; Flower visitors; Indirect effects; Plant-plant interactions; Pollination networks","competition (ecology); crop plant; facilitation; field margin; flower visiting; flowering; fruit production; insect; orchard; pollination; Hexapoda; Lantana; Lantana camara; Mangifera indica",2-s2.0-85032389254

Soil samples were collected in A. dealbata invaded plots and adjacent areas and screened for seeds, which were then quantified and germinated at 25 °C. A subset of seeds was first exposed to 60 °C to assess the effect of high soil temperature on dormancy breaking. Variables influencing differences between sites were explored with generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution. Inside A. dealbata invaded plots the seed bank averaged 4608 seeds/m2, reaching up to 62,747 seeds/m2; in adjacent areas, up to 14 m from the plots, only 9 seeds/m2 were found. Seed bank densities were mostly influenced by stoniness, number of fires in the last 10 years, and density of trees and roots.

The presence of V. velutina in Great Britain was first confirmed in September 2016. The likely dynamics following an initial incursion are uncertain, especially the risk of continued spread, and the likely success of control measures. Here we extrapolate from the situation in France to quantify the potential invasion of V. velutina in Great Britain. We find that, without control, V. velutina could colonise the British mainland rapidly, depending upon how the Asian hornet responds to the colder climate in Britain compared to France. The announcement that a second hornet had been discovered in Somerset, increases the chance that the invasion first occurred before 2016. We therefore consider the likely site of first invasion and the probabilistic position of additional founding nests in late 2016 and early 2017.

Here, we hypothesized that the regional decline of native A. rufus is connected with the spread of invasive A. vulgaris, and tested whether this can be linked to hybridization between the two species by analyzing 625 Arion sp. along altitudinal transects in three regions in Switzerland. In each region, we observed clear evidence of different degrees of genetic admixture, suggesting recurrent hybridization beyond the first generation. We found spatial differences in admixture patterns that might reflect distinct invasion histories among the regions. Our analyses provide a landscape level perspective for the genetic interactions between invasive and native animals during the invasion.

Design: All ESRD patients presenting to the hospital's main ED were identified during a 4-week consecutive enrollment period. Consenting patients completed two surveys-an ethnographic questionnaire and the validated kidney disease quality of life-36 (KDQOL-36) instrument. Setting: The study was conducted at a large county hospital in Dallas, Texas. In 2013, the hospital recorded >50,000 ED visits and administered approximately 6,000 dialysis treatments to ED patients. Participants: 88 of 101 unfunded patients presenting to the ED during the study period consented to participate, resulting in an 87.1% response rate. 65 of these patients were undocumented immigrants. Main Outcome Measures: Quantitative scores for the 5 subscales of the KDQOL-36 were calculated for the study population. Results: Measures of physical and mental health in our study population were lower than those published for scheduled dialysis patients. 79.5% of our patients lost employment due to their dialysis requirements. At least 71.4% of the study patients were unaware that they required dialysis before immigrating to the United States. Conclusions: Quality of life scores were found to be low among our population of undocumented emergent dialysis patients. Our data also provide some evidence that availability of dialysis at no cost is not a primary driver of illegal immigration of ESRD patients to the United States.","Chronic/therapy; Emigrants; Immigrants; Kidney Failure; Kidney Failure, Chronic/ethnology; Quality of Life; Renal Dialysis; Undocumented Immigrants","adult; aged; Article; emergency treatment; emergency ward; end stage renal disease; ethnographic research; female; hemodialysis patient; human; Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 36; major clinical study; male; quality of life; quality of life assessment; renal replacement therapy; tertiary care center",2-s2.0-85013499531

The measurements are conducted using a test fixture for the proper excitation of the balanced devices, and its effects are removed by shifting the measurement plane to the plane of the device under test. The accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated through the measurement of the impedance of a balanced dipole antenna, and is complemented by the measurement of the RFID ASIC chip. The experimental characterization of the impedance of an RFID tag antenna constitutes a secure way to achieve conjugate matching between the 2 devices (ie, the antenna and the RFID chip), and finally enhance the reading range of the RFID tags.

We collected flower heads from populations in Spain and Chile along a rainfall gradient. Seeds from all populations were planted in reciprocal transplant trials in Spain and Chile to explore their performance in the native and invasive range. We scored plant biomass, reproductive investment and fruit dimorphism. We observed strong plasticity, where plants grown in the invasive range had much greater biomass, flower head size and seed output, with a higher proportion of wind-dispersed fruits, than those grown in the native range. We also observed a significant ecotype effect, where the exotic populations displayed higher proportions of wind-dispersed fruits than native populations.

These grasses compete for resources and fuel anthropogenic wildfires. In 2012, a bulldozer from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority cleared a 570-m trail from a state road into a mature dry forest section of Guánica Forest to control a wildfire. We monitored colonization by a non-native invasive grass (Megathyrsus maximus), a highly invasive tree (Leucaena leucocephala), and a native grass (Uniola virgata), as well as natural regeneration, along the bulldozer trail. We determined whether bulldozing facilitated colonization by these species into the forest and the extent of spread. Results: Distance from propagule source and temporal variations strongly influenced colonization by our three focal species. Megathyrsus maximus invaded along the trail from source populations by the state road. The establishment of new colonies of M. maximus seedlings went as far as 570 m inside the forest (i.e., at the end of the bulldozer trail), but we found most new colonies within 270 m of the road. Leucaena leucocephala exhibited a similar spreading pattern. Before disturbance, Uniola virgata was distributed widely across the forest, but the highest densities were found in areas near the latter portion (> 401 m) of the bulldozer trail. Subsequently, the species formed new clumps along more than half of the trail (250 to 570 m), apparently colonizing from undisturbed patches nearby. Conclusions: Bulldozing facilitated the invasion of non-native vegetation. The projected community assemblage will be more fire-prone than before since M. maximus carries fire across the landscape better than U. virgata, emphasizing the capacity of invasive plant colonization to alter local ecological processes after only a single wildfire and bulldoze event. Our results provide a valuable baseline for short-term vegetation response to anthropogenic disturbances in tropical semi-deciduous dry forests. © 2017, The Author(s).","Bulldozing; Grass invasions; Leucaena leucocephala; Megathyrsus (Panicum) maximus; Tropical dry forest; Uniola virgata; Wildfire","Ecology; Ecosystems; Fires; Plants (botany); Reforestation; Roads and streets; Transportation; Tropics; Vegetation; Bulldozing; Grass invasions; Leucaena leucocephala; Panicum; Tropical dry forest; Uniola virgata; Wildfire; Forestry; anthropogenic source; colonization; environmental disturbance; grass; invasive species; native species; ruderal; tree; tropical forest; wildfire; Guanica Forest; Puerto Rico; Leptochloopsis virgata; Leucaena leucocephala; Nica; Panicum; Poaceae",2-s2.0-85032208392

Potential severity of the impacts of non-native species is assessed for effective conservation managements. However, such risk assessment is often difficult, and underestimating possible harm can cause substantial issues. Here, we document catastrophic decline of a soil ecosystem in the Ogasawara Islands, a UNESCO World Heritage site, due to predation by non-native land nemertine Geonemertes pelaensis of which harm has been previously unnoticed. This nemertine is widely distributed in tropical regions, and no study has shown that it feeds on arthropods. However, we experimentally confirmed that G. pelaensis predates various arthropod groups. Soil fauna of Ogasawara was originally dominated by isopods and amphipods, but our surveys in the southern parts of Hahajima Island showed that these became extremely scarce in the areas invaded by G. pelaensis. Carnivorous arthropods decreased by indirect effects of its predation. Radical decline of soil arthropods since the 1980s on Chichijima Island was also caused by G. pelaensis and was first recorded in 1981. Thus, the soil ecosystem was already seriously damaged in Ogasawara by the nemertine.

The empirical analysis employs difference-in-difference estimation using data obtained from a relatively small but unique survey of migrant workers from four of the A8 countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Lithuania) and two other East European countries (Ukraine and Bulgaria), carried out one month before and six to eight months after EU enlargement in May 2004.

It presents an opportunity to investigate the interaction of sensory modalities by removal of one of the modes. Superficially similar to sex pheromone-based mating disruption in moths, ant trail pheromone disruption lacks an equivalent mechanistic understanding of how the ants respond to an oversupply of their trail pheromone. Since significant compromise of one sensory modality essential for trail following (chemotaxis) has been demonstrated, we hypothesised that other sensory modalities such as thigmotaxis could act to reduce the impact on olfactory disruption of foraging behaviour. To test this, we provided a physical stimulus of thread to aid trailing by Argentine ants otherwise under disruptive pheromone concentrations. Trail following success was higher using a physical cue. While trail integrity reduced under continuous over-supply of trail pheromone delivered directly on the thread, provision of a physical cue in the form of thread slightly improved trail following and mediated trail disruption from high concentrations upwind.

Soft-release translocations involve holding animals on site for a period prior to release, whereas hard-release translocations involve immediate release of animals into a new environment. Evaluating the relative impacts of hard and soft release on site fidelity of released individuals can be informative, especially when comparing between translocated and resident animals. We monitored the movement, dispersal, and home range of both translocated (hard and soft released) and resident Jewelled Geckos (Naultinus gemmeus) for three weeks during winter using radiotelemetry. We also monitored a hard-released group during summer and incorporated data from a previously published soft- versus hard-release translocation of Jewelled Geckos undertaken in spring. In winter, soft-released geckos dispersed less than hard-released geckos and both soft-released and resident geckos had significantly smaller home ranges than those hard released. Further, area occupied by soft-released geckos remained constant during the tracking period but increased 20-fold for hard-released geckos. Mean dispersal distances were not influenced by season or the amount of time in an enclosure prior to soft release (i.e., four months yielded similar results to nine months).

In this study we investigated the influence of shrub-related microsites on post-dispersal pine seed survival in dry Mediterranean shrubland. We present a novel approach investigating the survival of single seeds in the context of long-distance wind dispersal. In four dry shrubland sites of central Israel, we placed seeds of Pinus halepensis in different microsites associated with Sarcopoterium spinosum shrubs: under canopy, at two margins and in between shrubs. We monitored the seed persistence monthly, replacing seeds removed by granivores. We also compared seed survival in burned vs. unburned areas. Logistic regression showed that seeds placed under shrubs had significantly higher survival rates than elsewhere. In unburned sites survival was higher than in burned sites and remained higher under shrub canopies. We show that these effects were substantial by considering the length of the season through which seeds need to persist.

The former is distributed over the whole species area and has been genetically analyzed, and the latter is endemic to Spain and North Africa and has not been genetically evaluated. In this study, to clarify the genetic variation and delineation of the two subspecies from a biosystematic viewpoint, morphological variation among 23 accessions of subsp. geniculata and three of subsp. gibberosa and chromosome pairing at meiosis and fertility in their intra- and inter-subspecific F1hybrids were examined. A principal component analysis based on the 11 spike characteristics clearly divided the 26 accessions into two groups representing the two subspecies. The inter-subspecific F1hybrids showed significantly lower frequencies of chromosome pairing, significantly higher frequencies of multivalents, and significantly lower fertilities relative to those of the intra-subspecific F1hybrids.

We here tested whether pooling of eDNA samples can be used to evaluate biodiversity of freshwater fishes in four satellite lakes of Lake Biwa, Japan. Fish communities detected by eDNA metabarcoding of the mitochondrial 12S region were compared between the individual and pooled samples. In the individual samples, 31, 22, 33, and 31 fish lineages (proxies for species) were observed at the respective sites, within which moderate spatial autocorrelation existed. In the pooled samples, 30, 20, 29, and 27, lineages were detected, respectively, even after 15 PCR replicates. Lineages accounting for < 0.05% of the total read count of each site's individual samples were mostly undetectable in the pooled samples. Moreover, fish communities detected were similar among PCR replicates in the pooled samples. Because of the decreased detection rates, the pooling strategy is unsuitable for estimating fish species richness. However, this procedure is useful potentially for among-site comparison of representative fish communities. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"biodiversity; freshwater fish; human; Japan; lake; mitochondrion; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; species richness",2-s2.0-85032809290

In predatory insects, the ability to exploit habitats for oviposition and the physiological response to prey availability differs between species. Those species that respond more readily to environmental changes may confer to their offspring a competitive advantage over other species. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the invasive Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) makes better use of information from a plant-prey (Vicia faba - Aphis fabae) system compared to the native Oenopia conglobata. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays revealed that both species used olfactory cues from the system, but H. axyridis exhibited a more complete response. This species was also attracted by plants previously infested by aphids, indicating the capacity to exploit volatile synomones induced in plants by aphid attack. Oocyte resorption was investigated when different olfactory stimuli were provided under prey shortage and the readiness of new oogenesis was measured when prey was available again. H. axyridis exhibited higher plasticity in oogenesis related to the presence/absence of plant-aphid volatiles.

In the Bakken oilfield of western North Dakota, dispersed reclamation activity and increased traffic may provide many opportunities for weeds to spread. To determine the potential for disturbance and reclamation to increase resident weed populations and introduce new weed species, we tracked twenty-one weed (non-native/ruderal/invasive) species over a four-year period after the installation of a 1.8 km livestock water pipeline and subsequent land reclamation on a historic ranch in western North Dakota. We included areas of historic (early 20th century homestead) and recent (prairie dog town) landscape disturbances and tracked weed frequency and density in the disturbed pipeline and in the directly adjacent intact prairie. Most of the weeds in the pipeline were non-persistent populations of naturalized species. Our data show that although naturalized weeds may respond positively to disturbance, they can quickly return to pre-disturbance levels. However, disturbance may have resulted in the introduction of one new noxious weed, Hyoscyamus Niger (black henbane). Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass), an invasive, non-native perennial grass that reduces native plant diversity and forage value, was also introduced. This study demonstrates the importance of prevention of weed dispersal during disturbance and reclamation, contamination-free seed sources, and post-reclamation follow up to control any weeds that may have been introduced as a result of pipeline development.","Agropyron cristatum; Homestead; Invasion; Leafy spurge; Prairie dog town",,2-s2.0-85031800290

Based on a two-season garden cultivation experiment, we showed that the hybrid produces more generative ramets than vegetative ones and the number of generative ramets increases from one season to another with an increasing number of stem buds located on the caudices. We also revealed a spontaneous seedling recruitment by the hybrid during cultivation in the garden. Based on the seed germination test under laboratory conditions, we evidenced that the hybrid can reach a higher final germination percentage than S. canadensis but a lower one than S. virgaurea. Based on field studies conducted in 35 populations in Poland, the hybrid formed the largest populations in tree plantations and on abandoned fields, reaching 16.5 and 15.7 ramet clusters on average, respectively. The most abundant populations were found on abandoned fields; however, the mean number of ramets per cluster did not differ remarkably among habitats (H = 6.5, p = 0.163).

Alternatively, available soil nitrogen and potassium contents were significantly higher under B. pilosa than under B. bipinnata in full sun, indicating that the strong invasiveness of B. pilosa could result from rapid nutrient mobilizations by B. pilosa.

Changes in nutritional status, possibly induced by A. dealbata, primarily shaped rhizosphere soil communities. Despite a high degree of geographic variability in the diversity and composition of microbial communities, invasive A. dealbata populations shared a core of bacterial and fungal taxa, some of which are known to be involved in N and P cycling, while others are regarded as plant pathogens.

However, there are very few studies on the biodiversity and regeneration of native species in human-modified forests which are rich in exotic trees. Our research aim is to evaluate the regeneration status and biodiversity of two adjacent human-modified forests. The two forests have distinct overstorey exotic species richness prior to abandonment: one is an exotic tree plantation low in species richness, and the other is an exotic arboretum high in species richness. The original management practices of the two forests have been neglected for more than 20 years. A primary forest was selected as a reference forest to compare their diversity and regeneration status. We asked: (1) Is there a structural difference among the three forests? (2) What are the proportions of native saplings in the human-modified forests? (3) Are the introduced exotic species able to naturalize? Results: We recorded 1316 individuals from 88 species, belonging to 69 genera and 34 families in the three forests [each sampled 16 quadrats (10 m × 5 m)]. Both human-modified forests were similar in their height structure, diameter structure, and sapling density, but differed in species diversity (characterized by rarefaction curves) and floristic composition (indicated by a quantitative similarity index). In the arboretum, only 50% of the sapling individuals were native. Surprisingly, when sampling efforts were standardized, the arboretum had higher native sapling species richness than the exotic species-poor plantation. Moreover, both human-modified forests had conserved a few rare and endemic species. Nevertheless, some exotic species in the arboretum had escaped to the nearby plantation. Conclusions: After 20 years of abandonment, the two human-modified forests had converged in structure, but not in diversity patterns of native saplings. This could be due to that the diversity of exotic overstorey composition can influence the natural regeneration of understorey plants. Our study also raised concerns about conserving native species and managing naturalized exotic species in these human-modified forests. © 2017, The Author(s).","Arboretum; Forest composition; Forest structure; Plantation; Regeneration; Secondary forest; Species diversity refuge",,2-s2.0-85028727138

Gastropod herbivory reduced the positive effect of disturbance on seedling recruitment, particularly for exotic species. Rodent herbivory had weak positive effects on seedling recruitment at undisturbed sites, irrespective of species origin. This effect was likely driven by their strong negative effect on productivity. Interactive effects between both herbivore guilds became only evident for species richness and composition. How many species established themselves depended on disturbance, but was independent of species origin.

Ant composition and abundance were similar between areas, but some species interacted more with exotic seeds in low disturbed areas. Ant foraging type predicted ant–seed interactions since the abundance of seed harvesters was positively correlated to interactions with P. speciosa, and that of generalists and predators, with interactions with C. thoermeri. The high interaction of ants with exotic seeds in low invaded areas suggests that ant activity could influence plant invasion, either by predating or dispersing seeds of invasive plants. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Formicidae; Granivory; Patagonia; Plant invasion; Road disturbance","assembly rule; biological invasion; disturbance; generalist; granivory; interspecific interaction; invasive species; native species; plant community; plant-insect interaction; seed; steppe; Patagonia; Carduus thoermeri; Formicidae",2-s2.0-85028987980

Islands are frequently also important sites for recreation, cultural activities, and industrial development, all of which facilitate the establishment of invasive species. Surveillance is employed on islands to detect the establishment of invasive species after their arrival, leading to decisions about follow-up actions. Unless surveillance is prioritised according to risk of establishment of invasives, it may be infeasible to implement efficiently over large tracts of publicly accessible land, especially in data-deficient areas. The key biosecurity problem for many regions is one of prioritizing sites for surveillance activities and identifying invasive species most likely to disperse to, and establish, and proliferate on those sites. We created a series of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), linked by Java computing code and the freely available GeNIe application to automate the creation and computation of species- and site-specific biosecurity BBNs. The BBNs require data on island attributes, recreational or industrial visitor load, infrastructure, habitat availability, and animal behaviour and dispersal via swimming, flying, human movement, land bridges, or flood plumes. We used this biosecurity BBN to estimate the risk of 11 invasive faunal species arriving and establishing on 600 islands along the Pilbara coastline, Western Australia. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify nodes within the BBNs that required refined data inputs. Propagule pressure was the node with the greatest influence over the number of arrivals. Other nodes such as the number of visitors to islands and swimming capabilities of invasive animals greatly influenced the model results. Across the 11 species studied, our models predicted one arrival per 300 visitors. The biosecurity BBN can be used to identify the islands at highest risk from establishment of invasive species within any archipelago/s, and the invasive species most likely to establish on each island. © 2017","Biosecurity; Dispersal; Invasive species; Island; Risk assessment; Surveillance","Animals; Landforms; Monitoring; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Space surveillance; Testbeds; Bio-security; Dispersal; Habitat availability; Industrial development; Invasive species; Island; Propagule pressures; Publicly accessible; Bayesian networks; Bayesian analysis; computer simulation; dispersal; environmental planning; fauna; introduced species; island biogeography; numerical model; prediction; risk assessment; animal behavior; animal dispersal; Article; Bayesian Belief Network; biosecurity risk; controlled study; fauna; flying; geographic distribution; island (geological); mathematical phenomena; nonhuman; population migration; prediction; priority journal; risk assessment; software; species difference; species habitat; species invasion; swimming; Western Australia; Australia; Pilbara; Western Australia; Animalia",2-s2.0-85020189136

Trophic flexibility has been proposed as a mechanism facilitating invasion, with more flexible species better able to invade. The termite hunting needle ant Brachyponera chinensis was introduced from East Asia to the United States where it disrupts native ecosystems. We show that B. chinensis has expanded dietary breadth without shifting trophic position in its introduced range. Transect sampling of ants and termites revealed a negative correlation between the abundance of B. chinensis and the abundance of other ants in introduced populations, but this pattern was not as strong in the native range. Both termite and B. chinensis abundance were higher in the introduced range than in native range. Radiocarbon (14C) analysis revealed that B. chinensis has significantly younger 'diet age', the time lag between carbon fixation by photosynthesis and its use by the consumer, in the introduced range than in the native range, while stable isotope analyses showed no change. These results suggest that in the introduced range B. chinensis remains a termite predator but also feeds on other consumer invertebrates with younger diet ages such as herbivorous insects.

Contrasting outcomes of competitive displacement have occurred between Liriomyza trifolii and L. sativae in different geographical regions following their introduction. Various factors have been advanced in an attempt to explain these different competitive outcomes, although none of these explanations have addressed the effects of niche differences. We conducted field cage experiments to compare the feeding and habitat niches of the two leafminer species and their primary parasitoid, Opius biroi, when occurring together on kidney bean. A wider spatiotemporal niche breadth was found in L. trifolii (0.3670) than in L. sativae (0.3496). With respect to the parasitoid, the proportional niche similarity between L. sativae and the parasitoid was 0.3936 but only 0.0835 for L. trifolii, while similar results were found for niche overlap, indicating that stronger trailing behaviour and parasitic effects of O. biroi occurred in L. sativae.

To illustrate this fact, we propose a simple statistical approach based on our knowledge of the Universe and the Milky Way, the Solar System, and the evolution of life on Earth permitting us to obtain the order of magnitude of the distance between Earth and bodies inhabited by more or less evolved past or present life forms, and the consequences of this probability for the detection of associated biosignatures. We thus show that the probability of the existence of evolved extraterrestrial forms of life increases with distance from the Earth while, at the same time, the number of detectable biosignatures decreases due to technical and physical limitations.

This paper presents the perceptions of pastoralist communities in southern Afar, Ethiopian lowlands, on one invasive species, Prosopis juliflora. The socio-cultural impacts are assessed, and the manner in which they interact with other drivers of vulnerability, including political marginalisation, sedentarisation and conflict, is explored. The research studied 10 communities and undertook semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. These results were supported by interviews with community leaders and key informants. The benefits and costs were analysed using the asset-based framework of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework and the subject-focused approach of Wellbeing in Development. The results demonstrate that the costs of invasive species are felt across all of the livelihood capital bases (financial, natural, physical, human and social) highlighted within the framework and that the impacts cross multiple assets, such as reducing access through blocking roads. The concept of Wellbeing in Development provides a lens to examine neglected impacts, like conflict, community standing, political marginalisation and cultural impoverishment, and a freedom of definition and vocabulary to allow the participants to define their own epistemologies. The research highlights that impacts spread across assets, transcend objective and subjective classification, but also that impacts interact with other drivers of vulnerability. Pastoralists report deepened and broadened conflict, complicated relationships with the state and increased sedentarisation within invaded areas. The paper demonstrates that biological invasions have complex social and cultural implications beyond the environmental and economic costs which are commonly presented. Through synthesising methodologies and tools which capture local knowledge and perceptions, these implications and relationships are conceptualised. © 2017, The Author(s).","Ethiopia; Invasive species; Pastoralism; Socio-cultural impacts; Sustainable livelihoods; Well-being",,2-s2.0-85028660413

Additionally, by performing environmental niche modelling we assessed the potential and realized niche of P. perna along its entire native distributional range and the environmental factors that best explain its realized distribution. Perna perna showed evidence of panmixia across >4,000 km despite several oceanographic breaking points detected by LPS. This is probably the result of a combination of life history traits, continuous habitat availability and stepping-stone dynamics. Moreover, the niche modelling framework depicted minimum sea surface temperatures (SST) as the major factor shaping P. perna distributional range limits along its native areas.

We developed a novel mirror box illusion to investigate whether motoric, but not spatial, visuomotor congruence is sufficient for inducing multisensory integration, and importantly, if biomechanical constraints encoded in the body schema influence multisensory integration. Participants placed their hands in a mirror box in opposite postures (palm up, palm down), creating a conflict between visual and proprioceptive feedback for the hand behind the mirror. After synchronous bimanual hand movements in which the viewed and felt movements were motorically congruent but spatially in the opposite direction, participants felt that the hand behind the mirror rotated or completely flipped towards matching the hand reflection (illusory displacement), indicating facilitation of multisensory integration by motoric visuomotor congruence alone. Some wrist rotations are more difficult due to biomechanical constraints. We predicted that these biomechanical constraints would influence illusion effectiveness, even though the illusion does not involve actual limb movement. As predicted, illusory displacement increased as biomechanical constraints and angular disparity decreased, providing evidence that biomechanical constraints are processed in multisensory integration. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85023180802

Specimens were collected from six different localities in urban areas in the eastern part of Penang Island. The six populations exhibited high pairwise genetic differentiation (FST), ranging from 0.42 to 1.00 and low gene flow (Nm), ranging from 0.00 to 0.69, except for populations of CSA and CH (FST = 0.0, Nm = − 1813.68).

After US populations were shown to originate from Northern China, others have tried to source BMSB populations now in Canada, Switzerland, Italy, France, Greece, and Hungary. Due to selection of different molecular markers, however, integrating all the datasets to obtain a broader picture of BMSB's expansion has been difficult. To address this limitation we focused on a single locus, the barcode region in the cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial gene, and analyzed representative BMSB samples from across its current global range using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach.

In the past three decades, two species of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci complex, Middle East-Asia Minor 1 and Mediterranean, have invaded many countries. Their rapid and widespread invasions are partially due to their ability to infest a wide range of host plants. In this study, we determined the transcriptome and phenotypic changes of one Mediterranean whitefly population during its adaptation to tobacco, an unsuitable host plant. After several generations on tobacco, whiteflies showed increased survival and fecundity. High-throughput RNA sequencing showed that genes involved in muscle contraction and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly up-regulated after adaptation. Whiteflies reared on tobacco were further found to have increased body volume and muscle content and be trapped by tobacco trichomes in a lower frequency. On the other hand, gene expression in endosymbionts of whitefly did not change significantly after adaptation, which is consistent with the lack of cis-regulatory element on endosymbiont genomes.

When the species are not reproductively isolated, hybridization is an important possible outcome of these secondary contacts, influencing the fate of both the native and non-native species. Such a situation is exemplified by the introduction of the warm-temperate tunicate Ciona robusta, native to Asia, into the European native range of its cold-temperate congener Ciona intestinalis. Despite an old divergence (ca. 4 Mya), the two species lack reproductive isolation with fertile F1-hybrids produced in laboratory. However, a recent population genomic study showed that hybrids are extremely rare in the wild and back-crossed individuals are absent, suggesting the existence of reproductive barriers between the two species in nature. Post-zygotic mechanisms like selection against hybrids by the environment were thus hypothesized. Because the two species have only been recently reclassified, data on their respective ecology and their hybrids are lacking. To investigate these environmental effects, we carried out 21 experimental crosses and examined survival and individual growth rate of ca. 1900 F1-juveniles produced with intra- and inter-specific crosses. Four treatments combining two temperatures (12 °C and 17 °C) and two salinity levels (25 and 35), representative of conditions found in nature, were applied to one-week old juveniles. After 28 days, a high survival rate was observed in the three F1 categories, with no difference between hybrids and parental species. As expected based on biogeography studies and field monitoring of the two species, the results showed that C. robusta performed particularly well in warm temperature with standard salinity condition. F1-hybrids did not show outbreeding depression, with growth rates similar to or higher than F1-C. intestinalis. Altogether the two species performed well under the tested environmental conditions, and post-zygotic ecological effects alone are unlikely to be effective against hybridization between the native and non-native species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biological invasions; Ciona intestinalis; Ciona robusta; Fitness; Hybridization","biological invasion; fitness; growth rate; hybrid; hybridization; invasive species; invertebrate; juvenile; native species; reproductive isolation; salinity; survival; temperature effect; Asia; Europe; Ascidiacea; Ciona; Ciona intestinalis; Mya",2-s2.0-85030834945

Frequent burning and grazing are required to maintain the savanna vegetation structure. However, in conservation areas, fire suppression is promoted to avoid wildfires; whereas domestic livestock grazing is considered a strong interfering factor for tree establishment, due to trampling and browsing. In tropical forests which were converted to savannas, competitive exotic grasses have often replaced the native grasses. Where exotic grasses are present, aboveground biomass accumulation and thus man-induced fire risk are high and potentially undermine tree recruitment. On the long-term, the savanna state may shift into a grass-dominated state with little tree cover, generating unfavorable conditions from a livelihood perspective. We examined this problem in a human-induced pine savanna in the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. Smallholder farmers highly valued this savanna for both livestock production and resin extraction from the fire resistant pine Pinus oocarpa. However, fire suppression and the presence of exotic grasses are reducing the tree recruitment. The main research question was to what degree can cattle grazing replace fire in its role of biomass removal and thereby stimulate pine recruitment and maintain the desired savanna state. We determined current savanna extension in the region and interviewed farmers to reconstruct past savannazation processes and expansion of exotic grasses. We related adult species-specific tree density to the herbaceous-grass cover, and pine and oak seedling and sapling densities to understory vegetation cover, canopy closure, and cattle grazing history. Finally, a field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of livestock grazing on survival and growth of planted pine saplings. The savanna currently covers 20% of the study site; it is the result of past slash-and-burn agriculture and selective logging, which have favored the expansion of several exotic grass species. In savannas where exotic grasses are abundant, sapling density was lower compared to sites with a native grass cover. While livestock grazing seemed to increase pine seedling density likely as a consequence of reduced grass cover, pine sapling survival however, was significantly reduced by livestock trampling. By seeking a balance between the livestock's benefits and adverse effects on pine recruitment, farmers may develop an integrated management system adapted to their specific biotic rangeland conditions. It should allow forage production, while controlling the negative effects of exotic grasses on pine recruitment, thus maintaining a productive pine savanna system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Exotic grasses; Induced pine savanna; Landscape trap; Livestock grazing; Resin extraction; Small-holder farmers","aboveground biomass; biosphere; cattle; coniferous tree; grass; growth; livestock farming; montane forest; native species; rangeland; savanna; smallholder; subtropical region; survival; tropical forest; vegetation cover; vegetation structure; wildfire; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]; Sepultura Biosphere Reserve; Bos; Pinus oocarpa; Poaceae",2-s2.0-85031733802

When considered in isolation, we know that beneficial microbes can enhance an exotic plant’s invasive ability and that herbivorous insects often decrease an exotic plant’s likeliness of success. However, the effect of these partners on plant fitness has not been well characterized when all three species coevolve. We use computational evolutionary modeling of a trait-based system to test how microbes and herbivores simultaneously coevolving with an invading plant affect the invaders’ probability of becoming established. Specifically, we designed a model that explores how a beneficial microbe would influence the outcome of an interaction between a plant and herbivore. To model novel interactions, we included a phenotypic trait shared by each species. Making this trait continuous and selectable allows us to explore how trait similarities between coevolving plants, herbivores and microbes affect fitness. Using this model, we answer the following questions: (1) Can a beneficial plant-microbe interaction influence the evolutionary outcome of antagonistic interactions between plants and herbivores? (2) How does the initial trait similarity between interacting organisms affect the likelihood of plant survival in novel locations? (3) Does the effect of tripartite interactions on the invasion success of a plant depend on whether organisms interact through trait similarity [Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH)] or dissimilarity (Biotic Resistance Hypothesis)? We found that it was much more difficult for plants to invade under the ERH but that beneficial microbes increase the probability of plant survival in a novel range under both hypotheses. To our knowledge, this model is the first to use tripartite interactions to explore novel species introductions. It represents a step towards gaining a better understanding of the factors influencing establishment of exotic species to prevent future invasions. © 2017, The Author(s).","BioSquare; Computational modeling; Evolutionary dynamics; Plant invasion; Plant microbiome; Plant-herbivore; Tripartite interactions","Hexapoda",2-s2.0-85021839327

We measured the plant community and ecosystem function in a restored forest and field (L. maackii removal and seeding of native plants) and in a control forest (L. maackii dominating), along an urban riparian stretch, five through seven years after L. maackii restoration. We found that removing L. maackii, along with modest efforts to re-introduce native grasses and forbs, can result in a shift in the plant community and some ecosystem properties and processes. Restored sites had higher species richness, greater available soil nitrogen, and faster nitrogen mineralization rates. We also found lower soil pH and that more soil organic matter accumulated over time in the restored treatments.

Our study showed that the increase of spring temperature induced morphological modifications for all species, while a 3 °C warming induced changes in carbohydrates composition for native species in spring, and modification of carbohydrate content for invasive species at both seasons. Patterns of carbohydrate content group the two invasive species together, possibly highlighting common physiological mechanisms. Moreover, the increase of spring temperature favoured the apical and/or lateral growth solely for invasive species. Hence, the invasive species specific response to warming suggests that higher temperature may favour their growth in spring, which might allow them to colonise the water column earlier than natives.

Previous population dynamics models have assumed that the impact of frequency-dependent reproductive interference depends on the relative abundances of species. However, this assumption could be an oversimplification inappropriate for making quantitative predictions. Therefore, a more general model to forecast population dynamics in the presence of reproductive interference is required. Here we developed a population dynamics model to describe the absolute density dependence of reproductive interference, which appears likely when encounter rate between individuals is important. Our model (i) can produce diverse shapes of isoclines depending on parameter values and (ii) predicts weaker reproductive interference when absolute density is low. These novel characteristics can create conditions where coexistence is stable and independent from the initial conditions. We assessed the utility of our model in an empirical study using an experimental pair of seed beetle species, Callosobruchus maculatus and Callosobruchus chinensis. Reproductive interference became stronger with increasing total beetle density even when the frequencies of the two species were kept constant.

They are valuable for the oxygen and carbon dioxide household and generate habitats especially for small fish and other small organisms. However, problems for the maintenance of water bodies can result from mass occurrences of these plants. Invasive neophytes - such as members of the Elodea genus - are particularly problematic in this regard. Aquatic plants need to be harvested regularly to ensure that water bodies remain usable and to safeguard flood protection for flowing water bodies. Energy can be produced from the harvested material by anaerobic digestion in biogas plants. Therefore, it is beneficial to know the best time for harvesting in this context. Methods: To identify the best time for harvesting, samples of the Elodea stock in the river Parthe in Leipzig-Schönefeld were taken each week over the course of the two hydrological years 2015 and 2016. The composition of these samples was analyzed in the laboratory. In the second hydrological year, three samples from surface areas of 1 m2 were also harvested once each month in order to determine the biomass yield per unit area. Results: The best harvesting time for energy production from Elodea biomass in Germany is in the summer months (June to September). During this period, the specific yield of 0.5–0.7 kg VS/m2 is relatively high and the Elodea biomass contains the highest fractions of volatile solids (80.1 ± 2.3%), high contents of plant nutrients (N 35.9 ± 4.0 g/kg TS; P 6.1 ± 1.4 g/kg TS; and K 47.7 ± 8.0 g/kg TS), and low concentrations of heavy metals (Cr ≤8.9 mg/kg TS, Cd ≤0.9 mg/kg TS, Cu ≤120 mg/kg TS, Ni ≤30 mg/kg TS, Pb ≤8.6 mg/kg TS, and Zn ≤439 mg/kg TS). Conclusions: Energy production from Elodea biomass is feasible. This biomass also provides the nutrients and trace elements necessary for the digestion in the anaerobic process. © 2017, The Author(s).","Aquatic biomass; Aquatic macrophytes; Biogas production; Elodea canadensis; Elodea nuttallii; Hydrological year; Neophyte; Waterweed","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biomass; Cadmium; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Copper; Flood control; Harvesting; Heavy metals; Lead; Nutrients; Trace elements; Aquatic macrophytes; Biogas production; Elodea canadensis; Elodea nuttallii; Hydrological years; Neophyte; Waterweed; Aquatic ecosystems; anaerobic digestion; aquatic ecosystem; aquatic plant; biogas; biomass; carbon dioxide; energy resource; freshwater environment; invasive species; macrophyte; nutrient dynamics; oxygen; sampling; Germany; Leipzig; Saxony; Elodea; Elodea canadensis; Elodea nuttallii",2-s2.0-85019706552

Moench selected for the present study from two contrasting habitats: Roadside and oak forest. Effect of seed position within a plant and of soil nutrients on seed mass, germination and seedlings growth were studied. Within an individual plant, seed mass decreased with umbel order and seeds from the central umbellet of the umbel were lighter than those from the outer edge, suggesting that variation in seed mass within an individual plant was due to the position effect. There was a significant relationship between seed mass and total germination. Covariate analysis showed the differences between sites in seed macronutrient contents were caused by respective differences in seed mass and soil macronutrients. This indicates substantial variation in the amount of reserves initially available for seedling growth. In conclusion, phenotypically-based variation in seed mass may arise from soil conditions, maternal traits or combination of the two. High variability in seed mass of P. oreoselinum favours its widespread geographic distribution. These results suggest that with respect to germination characteristics large seeds from primary order have a competitive advantage over small seeds produced on secondary umbels because they have higher overall germination. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"Apiaceae; forest; geographic distribution; germination; habitat; macronutrient; nonhuman; plant growth; position effect; seed weight; soil treatment; umbel",2-s2.0-85019429017

Here, we hypothesise that microorganisms engineer their habitat, causing a substantial change to the information content embedded in geophysical measures (e.g., particle size and space-filling capacity). After proving this hypothesis, we introduce and test a systematic method that exploits this change in information content to detect microbial colonization in geophysical systems. Effectiveness and robustness of this method are tested using a mineral sediment suspension as a model geophysical system; tests are carried out against 105 experiments conducted with different suspension types (i.e., pure mineral and microbially-colonized) subject to different abiotic conditions, including various nutrient and mineral concentrations, and different background entropy production rates.

These features also present different challenges in control design and aircraft operation. An accurate mathematical model is unlikely to be available meaning optimal control methods become difficult to apply. Furthermore, their reduced weight and inertia mean they are significantly more vulnerable to environmental disturbances such as wind gusts. Larger disturbances require more control actuation, meaning small UAVs are far more susceptible to actuator saturation. Failure to account for this can lead to controller windup and subsequent performance degradation. In this work, numerical simulations are conducted comparing a baseline Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller to integral augmentation and Disturbance Observer Based Control (DOBC). An anti-windup scheme is added to the DOBC to attenuate windup effects due to actuator saturation. A range of external disturbances are applied to demonstrate performance. The simulations conduct manoeuvres which would occur during landing, statistically the most dangerous flight phase, where fast disturbance rejection is critical. Validation simulations are then conducted using commercial X-Plane simulation software. This demonstrates that DOBC with anti-windup provides faster disturbance rejection of both modelling errors and external disturbances. © 2017, The Author(s).","Anti-windup; Disturbance observer; External disturbance; UAV","Actuators; Aircraft control; Computer software; Controllers; Fighter aircraft; Fixed wings; Flight simulators; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Anti-windup; Disturbance observer; Disturbance-observer-based controls; Environmental disturbances; External disturbances; Linear quadratic regulator controllers; Optimal control methods; Performance degradation; Disturbance rejection",2-s2.0-85015818928

Drawing on theoretical developments from contemporary narratology, I argue that we need to move away from a binary understanding of narrative as something an entity (the self) strictly is or is not; rather, we need to see narrative as an attribute admitting of degrees. I suggest that the relation between narrative and embodiment should be seen along these lines, proposing three levels of the narrativity of embodied experiencing: 1) the unnarratable, 2) the narratable and 3) the narrative.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed the evolutionary relationship of these proteins with homologs from Coleopterans or other insects, and led to the identification of putative aggregation pheromone receptors in B. longissima. Comparative expression analysis performed by calculating FPKM values were also validated using quantitative real time-PCR (qPCR). The results revealed that all ORs and antennal IRs, two IR co-receptors (BlonIR8a and BlonIR25a) and one SNMP (BlonSNMP1a) were predominantly expressed in antennae when compared to abdomens, and approximately half of the OBPs (19) and CSPs (7) were enriched in antennae. These findings for the first time reveal the identification of key molecular components in B. longissima olfaction and provide a valuable resource for future functional analyses of olfaction, and identification of potential targets to control this quarantine pest. © The Author(s) 2017.",,,2-s2.0-85020406177

Some specialists, however, can flexibly track the shifts in host-plant phenology, allowing them to obtain sufficient resources and therefore to benefit from rising temperatures. Here, we investigated the effects of experimental warming on the life history of an invasive, specialist lace bug (Corythucha ciliata) and on the leaf expansion of its host plant (Platanus × acerifolia) in two spring seasons under field conditions in Shanghai, China. We found that a 2 °C increase in mean air temperature advanced the timing of the expansion of host leaves and of the activities of overwintering adult insects in both years but did not disrupt their synchrony. Warming also directly increased the reproduction of overwintering adults and enhanced the development and survival of their offspring. These results indicate that C. ciliata can well track the earlier emergence of available resources in response to springtime warming. Such plasticity, combined with the direct effects of rising temperatures, may increase the insect's population size and outbreak potential in eastern China under climate warming. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"adult; air temperature; China; ciliate; climate; field study; human; imago; leaf growth; life history; nonhuman; overwintering; phenology; plasticity; population size; progeny; spring; warming",2-s2.0-85032819735

Recent studies suggest that predation of macroinvertebrates by signal crayfish can affect the performance of freshwater biomonitoring tools used to assess causes of ecological degradation. Given the reliance on biomonitoring globally, it is crucial that the potential influence of invasive species is better understood. Crayfish are also biogeomorphic agents, and therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether sediment-biomonitoring tool outputs changed following signal crayfish invasions, and whether these changes reflected post-invasion changes to deposited fine sediment, or changes to macroinvertebrate community compositions unrelated to fine sediment. A quasi-experimental study design was employed, utilising interrupted time series analysis of long-term environmental monitoring data and a hierarchical modelling approach. The analysis of all sites (n = 71) displayed a small, but statistically significant increase between pre- and post-invasion index scores for the Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates (PSI) index biomonitoring tool (4.1, p <  0.001, 95%CI: 2.1, 6.2), which can range from 0 to 100, but no statistically significant difference was observed for the empirically-weighted PSI (0.4, p = 0.742, 95%CI: − 2.1, 2.9), or fine sediment (− 2.3, p = 0.227, 95%CI: − 6.0, 1.4). Subgroup analyses demonstrated changes in biomonitoring tool scores ranging from four to 10 percentage points. Importantly, these subgroup analyses showed relatively small changes to fine sediment, two of which were statistically significant, but these did not coincide with the expected responses from biomonitoring tools. The results suggest that sediment-biomonitoring may be influenced by signal crayfish invasions, but the effects appear to be context dependent, and perhaps not the result of biogeomorphic activities of crayfish. The low magnitude changes to biomonitoring scores are unlikely to result in an incorrect diagnosis of sediment pressure, particularly as these tools should be used alongside a suite of other pressure-specific indices. © 2017 The Authors","Biogeomorphology; Deposited fine sediment; Ecological assessment; Interrupted time series analysis; Invasive species; Macroinvertebrates","Ecology; Harmonic analysis; Shellfish; Time series analysis; Water; Biogeomorphology; Ecological assessment; Fine sediments; Invasive species; Macroinvertebrates; Sediments; biomonitoring; crayfish; deposition; invasive species; macroinvertebrate; morphology; sediment; time series analysis; Article; biological monitoring; controlled study; crayfish; effect size; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental impact; environmental parameters; fine sediment; freshwater environment; habitat; habitat heterogeneity; nonhuman; Pacifastacus leniusculus; population abundance; priority journal; Proportion of Sediment sensitive Invertebrates index; quasi experimental study; reliability; sediment; sediment biomonitoring; sediment pressure; species composition; species invasion; time series analysis; Europe; Astacoidea; Invertebrata; Pacifastacus leniusculus",2-s2.0-85019865955

Number and attachment strength of byssal threads can be adjusted according to external factors such as hydrodynamic forces or predators, but it is unknown whether mytilid mussels distinguish between substrata of different quality for byssus attachment in different habitat types. In field studies, we examined the attachment strength of the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus growing on Pacific hard- and soft-bottom shores in Chile and of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis from an Atlantic rocky shore in France and a sedimentary shore in the North Sea (Germany), respectively. In additional laboratory experiments, we studied mussel substratum selectivity of both bivalve species from soft and hard bottoms by offering living versus dead, barnacle-fouled vs. unfouled, and firmly attached vs. loose conspecifics. In the field, attachment strength of P. purpuratus on hard bottoms was substantially higher than on soft bottoms even though mussels produced more byssus in the latter habitat. In contrast, blue mussels M. edulis showed only a slightly reduced attachment strength on soft compared to hard bottoms. In the soft-bottom habitat, fouled individuals from the edge of a blue mussel bed were especially strongly attached. In the byssus attachment behavior experiments, P. purpuratus from both habitats showed a significant preference for living conspecifics and those from soft bottoms preferred firmly attached conspecifics. Blue mussels had no preference for particular conspecifics except those from soft-bottom habitats, which preferred fouled over clean mussels. In general, in the choice experiments hard-bottom M. edulis produced more byssus. Our results confirmed that mytilid mussels may show active substratum choice for byssus attachment, which depends on mussel species and habitat type. The results suggest that mussels are adapted to a particular habitat type, with P. purpuratus showing lower adaptation to soft-bottom areas while M. edulis shows successful strategies for both environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Attachment strength; Byssus production; Mytilid mussels; Selective behavior; Substratum choice","adaptation; bivalve; coastal zone; conspecific; habitat type; predator; rocky shore; soft-bottom environment; Chile; France; Germany; North Sea Coast [Germany]; Bivalvia; Mytilidae; Mytilus edulis; Thoracica",2-s2.0-85029797708

Post-introduction dispersal may occur naturally or via human transport, but for many organisms, assessing the relative contribution of each of these factors is difficult using traditional methods. Here, we explored the genetic patterns associated with the spread of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) among 21 populations in the Pearl River basin and 2 peripheral populations in the Yangtze River basin. We found the genetic diversity of P. clarkii in the Pearl River basin was somewhat lower than in the Yangtze River basin. We also found (1) there was significant genetic differentiation between populations, (2) genetic differentiation was not related to geographic distance (i.e., isolation by distance), and (3) a Bayesian assignment analysis revealed three distinct genetic clusters and genetic admixture. Our results therefore provide evidence that human-mediated multiple introductions occurred in the Pearl River basin.

Some limpet species achieve remarkable sizes, which in the most extreme cases can surpass 35 cm in shell length. In this review, we focus on giant limpets, which are defined as those with a maximum shell size surpassing 10 cm. According to the scientific literature, there are a total of 14 species across five genera that reach these larger sizes. Four of these species are threatened or in danger of extinction. Inhabiting the intertidal zones, limpets are frequently affected by anthropogenic impacts, namely collection by humans, pollution and habitat fragmentation. In the case of larger species, their conspicuous size has made them especially prone to human collection since prehistoric times. Size is not phylogeny-dependent among giant limpets, but is instead related to behavioural traits instead. Larger-sized species tend to be nonmigratory and territorial compared to those that are smaller. Collection by humans has been cited as the main cause behind the decline and/or extinction of giant limpet populations. Their conspicuously large size makes them the preferred target of human collection. Because they are protandric species, selectively eliminating larger specimens of a given population seriously compromises their viability and has led to local extinction events in some cases. Additionally, sustained collection over time may lead to microevolutionary responses that result in genetic changes. The growing presence of artificial structures in coastal ecosystems may cause population fragmentation and isolation, limiting the genetic flow and dispersion capacity of many limpet species. However, when they are necessitated, artificial structures could be managed to establish marine artificial microreserves and contribute to the conservation of giant limpet species that naturally settle on them. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation; Endangered species; Harvesting; Limpets; Molluscs","Docoglossa; Mollusca; Patellidae; animal; body size; ecosystem; environmental protection; gastropod; physiology; sea; Animals; Body Size; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Gastropoda; Oceans and Seas",2-s2.0-85008318958

We used a 16S gene rRNA amplicon sequencing approach to study potentially zoonotic bacterial communities in invasive and native rodents sampled along two well-defined independent invasion routes. We found that individual host factors (body mass and sex) were important drivers of these bacterial infections in rodents. We observed that the bacterial communities varied along invasion routes and differed between invasive and native rodents, with native rodents displaying higher overall bacterial diversity than invasive rodents. Differences in prevalence levels for some bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) provided support for ecological processes connecting parasitism and invasion success.

Niche conservatism should be tested only within appropriate, similar, environmental spaces that are accessible to both species or populations being compared, thus avoiding model extrapolation related to model transfers.

We simulated pollinator extinctions in pollination networks by using a hybrid model that combined a recently developed stochastic coextinction model (SCM) for plant extinctions and a topological model (TCM) for animal extinctions. Our model accounted for variation in interaction strengths and included empirical estimates of plant dependence on pollinators to set seeds. The stochastic nature of such model allowed us determining plant survival to single (and multiple) extinction events, and identifying which pollinators (keystone species) were more likely to trigger secondary extinctions. Consistently across three different pollinator removal sequences, plant robustness was lower than in a pure TCM, and plant survival was more determined by dependence on the mutualism than by interaction strength. As expected, highly connected and dependent plants were the most sensitive to pollinator loss and collapsed faster in extinction cascades. We predict that the relationship between dependence and plant connectivity is crucial to determine network robustness to interaction loss.

At one locality, microsporidium Chytridiopsis sp. was detected in almost 15% of the O. laricis beetles. Protozoan pathogen Gregarina sp. was found in O. laricis beetles at three localities, but its incidence did not exceed 5%. Chytridiopsis sp., Gregarina sp., and neogregarine Mattesia sp. were detected in O. erosus beetles at one of three localities. No pathogen was found in O. nobilis. The genus Mattesia was reported in an Orthotomicus species for the first time. The incidence of pathogens and nematodes in the three Orthotomicus species seemed unrelated to the beetle species: the deposition of eggs singly or in clusters, the ability to outbreak, or the beetle distribution range. A literature review and the current results indicated that the number of pathogens detected in a particular species of pine bark beetle is related mainly to the number of specimens examined. © 2017, Bulletin of Insectology.

We analyzed the diversity and composition of the flora of 70 domestic gardens in seven localities in Bogotá Colombia, which represent different periods of expansion of the city. Floristic composition and diversity were related to the origin and use of plants, the urbanization history, and the income of owners. We recorded 4110 individuals belonging to 238 species. The mean species richness per garden was 15.4, with older localities having significantly higher species richness. The similarity among the localities, which evaluated the distinctness of assemblages, ranged from 0.42 to 0.50. Plants from the Neotropical region and exotic plants were the most abundant in all gardens. The most common use was ornamental, and use depended on the socioeconomic status of the owner. The lower-income homes cultivated larger proportions of edible and medicinal plants. Gardens at the oldest localities, with the largest number of native species, contribute to the conservation of flora because they contain the largest number of native species. Furthermore, domestic gardens are good sources of employment for gardeners and are useful places to keep senior citizens active, helping these citizens relieve stress, maintain good health and teach young people the cultural uses of plants. The receptivity of the homeowners to the study opens the door to future research and conservation programs in the city. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Biodiversity use; Colombia; Green areas; Option values; Urban vegetation","biodiversity; community composition; conservation management; flora; floristics; garden; greenspace; socioeconomic status; species diversity; species richness; urban ecosystem; urbanization; vegetation structure; Bogota; Colombia",2-s2.0-85031750195

We chose an understudied cross kingdom interaction to experimentally evaluate the effect of fruit infection by fungi on both vertebrate (mammals and birds) fruit preferences and on ecologically relevant fruit traits (volatile compounds, toughness, etc). Our well-replicated field experiments revealed that, in contrast to previous studies, frugivorous mammals and birds consistently preferred infested over intact fruits. This was concordant with the higher level of attractive volatiles (esters, ethanol) in infested fruits. This investigation suggests that vertebrate frugivores, fleshy-fruited plants, and microbes form a tripartite interaction in which each part could interact positively with the other two (e.g. both orange seeds and fungal spores are likely dispersed by mammals). Such a mutualistic view of these complex interactions is opposed to the generalized idea of competition between frugivorous vertebrates and microorganisms. Thus, this research provides a new perspective on the widely accepted plant evolutionary dilemma to make fruits attractive to mutualistic frugivores while unattractive to presumed antagonistic microbes that constrain seed dispersal. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85025136287

Our inability to manage invasive species stems in part from a lack of understanding of the processes that control their successful establishment and spread. To date, studies have largely considered how above-ground processes control native/invasive plant interactions. Emerging research from terrestrial and wetland ecosystems demonstrates that below-ground processes under microbial control can determine the outcome of interactions between native and invasive plants. Whether sediment microbes modify the success of invasive macrophytes in marine ecosystems is untested, despite marine sediment microbes controlling many ecological processes (e.g. nutrient cycling) comparable to those in terrestrial ecosystems. We first show that sediment bacterial communities differ between the native seagrass Zostera capricorni and the invasive alga Caulerpa taxifolia and that those differences relate to functional changes in sulfur cycling between the macrophytes. Second, by experimentally manipulating the microbial communities we show that intact microbial communities in Z. capricorni sediments provide biotic resistance by reducing C. taxifolia fragment growth 119% compared to when they are inactive, and intact microbial communities in C. taxifolia sediments have positive feedbacks by increasing fragment growth 200%. Thus, similar to terrestrial ecosystems, microorganisms appear to indirectly control the success of invasive macrophytes in marine ecosystems. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85028502109

Much of the controversy is related to the identity and taxonomic status of Broussonetia kaempferi var. australis, a name treated as a synonym in the floras of Taiwan and yet accepted in the floras of China. At the generic level, the monophyly of Corner (Gard Bull Singap 19:187–252, 1962)’s concept of Broussonetia has not been tested. In recent studies of Broussonetia of Japan, lectotypes of the genus were designated and three species (B. kaempferi, Broussonetia monoica, and Broussonetia papyrifera) and a hybrid (B. ×kazinoki) were recognized. Based on the revision and molecular phylogenetic analyses, this article aims to clarify these issues. Results: Herbarium studies, field work, and molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that all Taiwanese materials identifiable to B. kaempferi var. australis are conspecific with B. monoica of Japan and China. Molecular phylogenetic analyses showed that Broussonetia sensu Corner (Gard Bull Singap 19:187–252, 1962) contains two clades corresponding to sect. Broussonetia and sect. Allaeanthus, with Malaisia scandens sister to sect. Broussonetia. Conclusions: Based on our analyses, B. kaempferi var. australis is treated as a synonym of B. monoica and that B. kaempferi is not distributed in Taiwan. To correct the non-monophyly of Broussonetia sensu Corner (Gard Bull Singap 19:187–252, 1962), Broussonetia is recircumscribed to contain only sect. Broussonetia and the generic status of Allaeanthus is reinstated. © 2017, The Author(s).","Allaeanthus; Broussonetia monoica; Broussonetia ×kazinoki; Dorstenieae; Lectotype; Neotype; Paper mulberry genus; Taxonomy",,2-s2.0-85013412154

Whitefly saliva is thought to contain proteins that modulate plant defences and facilitate feeding. A predicted secreted protein, laccase 1 (LAC1), was found in the salivary gland transcriptome of B. tabaci and might be existed in the watery saliva of B. tabaci. As LAC1 has a potential role in detoxification of secondary plant compounds in insects, we speculated that it may participate in the insect's response to plant defences. Here, we cloned the complete cDNA of LAC1 and found that (1) LAC1 was highly expressed in the salivary gland (SG) and midgut; (2) LAC1 transcript level in head (containing SG) was 2.1 times higher in plant-fed than in diet-fed whiteflies and 1.6 times higher in the head and 23.8 times higher in the midgut of whiteflies that fed on jasmonic acid (JA)-sprayed plants than on control plants; and (3) silencing LAC1 decreased the survival rate of plant-fed whiteflies but had a marginal effect on whiteflies raised on an artificial diet. These results indicate that LAC1 enables whiteflies to overcome the chemical defences of host plants and might act as an effector in saliva. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85020880179

However, assessing multiple pressures on aquatic ecosystems and understanding their combined impact on the ecological status is challenging, especially at the large scale, though crucial to the planning of effective policies. Here, for the first time, we quantify multiple human pressures and their relationship with the ecological status for all European rivers. We considered ecological data collected across Europe and pressures assessed by pan-European models, including pollution, hydrological and hydromorphological alterations. We estimated that in one third of EU's territory rivers are in good ecological status. We found that better ecological status is associated with the presence of natural areas in floodplains, while urbanisation and nutrient pollution are important predictors of ecological degradation.

To meet the growing demand for animal products, silvopastoral systems (SPS) can be an alternative as they have greater biodiversity and offer more environmental services than conventional cattle ranching systems. This paper aims to describe the implementation of SPS by traditional farmers in a rural settlement in southeastern Brazil, and the impacts on biodiversity of native plants. SPS were implemented by farmers in three selected areas that were cleared with a tractor. The impacts on the community and populations of native plants were estimated through vegetation sampling before and after the implementation of the SPS. Direct observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted to describe the implementation of the system and to understand the criteria employed to spare species, to manage native plants and the advantages of these systems according to farmers’ perceptions. Before the implementation, 1038 trees from 50 species and 29 botanical families were surveyed in the three areas. The tractor cleared on average 72 % of the trees, decreasing the number of trees ha−1 from 692 to 180 and reducing tree richness in 43 %. On average, 89 % of the removed trees had diameter ranging from 5 to 10 cm, indicating farmers’ preference in sparing the thickest trees. Farmers also spare useful species that have socio-economic importance, such as timber, fruit trees, fodder and medicine. According to the farmers, the advantages of the SPS are the high concentration of useful species, the environmental services provided and the increase in livestock production. The system described has great potential to ensure food security, generating socio-economic benefits for farmers and contributing to biodiversity conservation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agroforestry system; Cattle; Cerrado; Geraizeiros; Livestock","agroforestry; biodiversity; cattle; cerrado; deforestation; environmental impact; farmers attitude; food security; livestock farming; native species; pastoralism; perception; questionnaire survey; ranching; savanna; social impact; traditional knowledge; Brazil; Animalia; Bos",2-s2.0-84976471987

As expected, the patients estimated that they could reach further while wearing their prosthesis, showing an embodiment of their prosthesis in their judgement. Yet, the real reaching space was found to be smaller with their prosthesis than with their healthy limb, showing a large error between reachability judgement and actual capacity. An overestimation was also found on the healthy side (comparatively to healthy subjects) suggesting a bilateral modification of body representation in amputated patients. Finally, a correlation was found between the quality of integration of the prosthesis and the way the body representation changed. This study therefore illustrates the multifaceted nature of the phenomenon of prosthesis integration, which involves its incorporation as a tool, but also various specific subjective aspects. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85022342692

Despite that, little effort has been devoted to documenting cases of culturally-related biodiversity loss. Here, we investigate the cultural domestication of the European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) in western Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) and the effects of long-Term poaching of wild populations (1990-2016) on range distribution, socio-economic value, international trading and potential collateral damage on Afro-Palearctic migratory birds. On average, we found that the European goldfinch lost 56.7% of its distribution range in the region which led to the increase of its economic value and establishment of international trading network in western Maghreb. One goldfinch is currently worth nearly a third of the average monthly income in the region. There has been a major change in poaching method around 2010, where poachers started to use mist nets to capture the species. Nearly a third of the 16 bird species captured as by-catch of the European goldfinch poaching are migratory, of which one became regularly sold as cage-bird. These results suggest that Afro-Palearctic migratory birds could be under serious by-catch threat. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"Algeria; domestication; Morocco; nonhuman; Palearctic; population model; songbird; species; Tunisia",2-s2.0-85018774186

Virgin gynes (reproductive females) produced this sex pheromone in the sixth intersegmental sternal glands of their abdomens. The active compounds were 4-oxo-octanoic acid (4-OOA, 10.4 μg bee-1) and 4-oxo-decanoic acid (4-ODA, 13.3 μg bee-1) at a 0.78 ratio of 4-OOA/4-ODA. We synthesized these compounds and showed that male antennae were highly sensitive to them. Moreover, males were only strongly attracted to a 4-OOA/4-ODA blend at the natural ratio produced by gynes.

To assess impacts on nitrogen (N) cycling, we quantified litter decomposition and N dynamics of grass litter in native grass and A. gayanus invaded savanna using destructive in situ grass litter harvests and litterbag incubations (soil surface and aerial position). Only 30% of the A. gayanus in situ litter decomposed, compared to 61% of the native grass litter, due to the former being largely comprised of highly resistant A. gayanus stem. In contrast to the stem, A. gayanus leaf decomposition was approximately 3- A nd 2-times higher than the dominant native grass, Alloteropsis semilata at the surface and aerial position, respectively. Lower initial lignin concentrations, and higher consumption by termites, accounted for the greater surface decomposition rate of A. gayanus. N flux estimates suggest the N release of A. gayanus litter is insufficient to compensate for increased N uptake and N loss via fire in invaded plots. Annually burnt invaded savanna may lose up to 8.2% of the upper soil N pool over a decade.

These insects live in close association with bacterial symbionts that affect host fitness and adaptation to the environment. In the current study, we surveyed the infection of whitefly populations in Southeast Europe by various bacterial symbionts and performed phylogenetic analyses on the different symbionts detected. Arsenophonus and Hamiltonella were the most prevalent symbionts in all three whitefly species. Rickettsia was found to infect mainly B. tabaci, while Wolbachia mainly infected both B. tabaci and S. phillyreae. Furthermore, Cardinium was rarely found in the investigated whitefly populations, while Fritschea was never found in any of the whitefly species tested. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a diversity of several symbionts (e.g., Hamiltonella, Arsenophonus, Rickettsia), which appeared in several clades. Reproductively isolated B. tabaci and T. vaporariorum shared the same (or highly similar) Hamiltonella and Arsenophonus, while these symbionts were distinctive in S. phillyreae. Interestingly, Arsenophonus from S. phillyreae did not cluster with any of the reported sequences, which could indicate the presence of Arsenophonus, not previously associated with whiteflies. In this study, symbionts (Wolbachia, Rickettsia, and Cardinium) known to infect a wide range of insects each clustered in the same clades independently of the whitefly species.

However, the molecular basis of olfaction in C. formicarius remains unknown. In this study, we produced antennal transcriptomes from males and females of C. formicarius using high-throughput sequencing to identify gene families associated with odorant detection. A total of 54 odorant receptors (ORs), 11 gustatory receptors (GRs), 15 ionotropic receptors (IRs), 3 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 33 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), and 12 chemosensory proteins (CSPs) were identified.

Several approaches, such as small-scale, community-based conservation projects aiming to generate benefits for the community, have been applied to alleviate poverty and at the same time promote conservation. In Madagascar such projects are considered a promising alternative as large-scale conservation often fails. However, few evaluations to date have analyzed both ecological and socioeconomic aspects. Our study focuses on the ecological and socioeconomic aspects of a small-scale, community-based conservation project, called “Park Bandro”, at Lake Alaotra, Madagascar. At first glance, the area seems to conserve its natural flora and fauna. However, closer examination shows that the park suffers from isolation, disconnectivity and illegal activities, while its management suffers from an unequal distribution of benefits and a lack of recognition at community level. We use our results to discuss where challenges arise and to draw recommendations which will be relevant beyond Lake Alaotra. We show that institutional settings can foster the detachment of local management associations from the community and facilitate elite capture. Existing conflicts of interests and a lack of transparency in administration hinders long-term success.

We are focusing on comparisons between continental and introduced populations to clarify whether the current genetic patterns in introduced populations can reflect recovery from a past bottleneck and predict its invasive potential. A second objective is to narrow down the geographic source of the introduction and confirm their origin from a single introduction pulse. We found comparable microsatellite genetic diversity featuring many island-specific alleles, but reduced mitochondrial haplotype diversity in the islands. Additionally, both markers showed signals of population expansion and homogeneously distributed variation in the introduced range, in contrast to structured continental populations. The addition of mitochondrial sequences to the microsatellite dataset in the Approximate Bayesian Computation analyses (Diyabc) favors a single introduction pulse from the Northern Manabí area; a scenario that is in agreement with the haplotype network. An origin from higher elevation habitats provides clues about the environmental amplitude of the naturalized populations.

Navigation profoundly affects aquatic ecosystems. To facilitate navigation, rivers are trained and developed, and the direct effects of navigation include chemical and biological impacts (e.g., inputs of toxic substances and dispersal of non-native species, respectively). Furthermore, propagating ships create hydrodynamic alterations, often simply summarized as waves. Although ship-induced waves are recognized as influential stressors, knowledge on their effects is poorly synthesized. We present here a review on the effects of ship-induced waves on the structure, function and services of aquatic ecosystems based on more than 200 peer reviewed publications and technical reports. Ship-induced waves act at multiple organizational levels and different spatial and temporal scales. All the abiotic and biotic components of aquatic ecosystems are affected, from the sediment and nutrient budget to the planktonic, benthic and fish communities. We highlight how the effects of ship-induced waves cascade through ecosystems and how different effects interact and feed back into the ecosystem finally leading to altered ecosystem services and human health effects. Based on this synthesis of wave effects, we discuss strategies for mitigation.

This decline has recently been on the increase due to the spread of some tropical herbivorous fishes. This new phenomenon has drawn attention to the effects of fish herbivory in temperate areas, which have been assumed to be negligible compared to that of invertebrates, such as sea urchins. In this study, the impact of a Mediterranean native herbivorous fish (Sarpa salpa, salema) was assessed on the canopy-forming seaweed Cystoseira amentacea var. stricta. Cystoseira amentacea forms belts in the infralittoral fringe of wave-exposed shores, which has so far been considered a refuge from fish herbivory. To test the effects of salema feeding on natural C. amentacea belts, an innovative herbivore deterrent device was conceived. Salema had a significant effect on C. amentacea by decreasing algal size, biomass and fertility, by up to 97%. The results suggest that the contribution of salema feeding to the loss of Cystoseira forests in the Mediterranean may have been overlooked. In addition, the analysis of temporal and spatial patterns of salema landings in the Mediterranean Sea suggests that salema abundance may have increased recently. Thus, along with invertebrate herbivory and anthropogenic stressors, fish herbivory may also represent a potential threat to algal forests in temperate areas. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"biomass; canopy; exposure; feeding; fertility; herbivore; herbivory; invertebrate; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; seaweed",2-s2.0-85025145249

Information on the response of seedling to anticipated water availability is urgently needed in regions where tree seedlings may experience more frequent water deficits. In this paper, we focused on the influence of water deficit on different species (larch vs. birch) and origins (xeric vs. mesic). Methods: Prince Rupprecht’s larch (Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii (Mayr) Pilg.) and white birch (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) from northern China were selected to represent the xeric origin. Eastern larch (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall) from eastern Canada were selected to represent the mesic origin. For each species, half of seedlings were assigned to a well-watered treatment (WW, 75% water holding capacity (WHC) and the other half to a low-watered treatment (LW, 35% WHC). After 20 weeks of treatment, we collected data on morphological indexes of shoot height, root collar diameter, total leaf area and total root area; measured photosynthetic rate (Asat), transpiration rate (E), photosynthetic water-use efficiency (WUE) and apparent chlorophyll concentration (Chl); harvested seedlings and measured biomass allocation of leaf, stem and root. Results: We found that reduced photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and increased water-use efficiency were physiological responses of the four species to drought, and the responses varied among the species. All larch seedlings appeared no leaf shedding, survived through the drought treatment and showed a longer duration and high tolerance to drought. In low-watered conditions, survival rate, biomass, shoot height, root collar diameter, total leaf area, total root area and chlorophyll concentration of birch seedlings were significantly decreased. The response of seedlings to water deficits also differed according to the seed origins. Xeric origin of Prince Rupprecht’s larch was more affected than mesic origin of eastern larch, mainly because Prince Rupprecht’s larch originated in a narrower range of mountainous regions, resulting in lower adaptation of this species to water deficits, whereas eastern larch was distributed widely along coastal regions, contributing to higher phenotypic plasticity to variable soil conditions. Similarly, higher plasticity of paper birch may be responsible for its better performance in the low-watered treatment than white birch. Conclusions: Larch seedlings were less sensitive to water deficit than birch seedlings. Larch seedlings were characteristics of a conservative water-use strategy, whereas birch seedlings responded with a profligate water-use strategy. Plasticity or adaptation of seedlings outweighs the seed origins in determining their drought responses. © 2017, The Author(s).","Climate change; Species origin; Species traits; Water deficit","Chlorophyll; Climate change; Drought; Efficiency; Forestry; Physiological models; Transpiration; Chlorophyll concentration; Phenotypic plasticity; Physiological response; Root-collar diameters; Species origin; Species traits; Water deficits; Water holding capacity; Plants (botany); climate change; comparative study; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; drought stress; forestry; physiological response; seedling; Betula papyrifera; Betula pendula; Betula platyphylla; Larix; Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii; Larix laricina",2-s2.0-85026655668

These results illustrate how powerful public participation in science can be and suggest citizen science is positioned to revolutionize mosquito-borne disease surveillance worldwide. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"Aedes albopictus",2-s2.0-85032171285

We examined the effect of elevation on this relationship and on its spatial non-stationarity. We found that higher woody plant diversity reduced SSPF. Higher woody plant diversity strengthened the asynchrony of species responses to spatial heterogeneity of forest habitats, which contributed to SSFP, but reduced two factors that enhanced SSFP: Species dominance and the spatial stability of the dominant species. The percentage of variation in SSFP explained by diversity measures was highest for the Shannon-Wiener index, lowest for functional dispersion, and intermediate for species richness. The correlations of woody plant diversity with SSFP became stronger with elevation and varied among plots, indicating that the spatial non-stationarity existed in the biodiversity-SSFP relationship. These correlations became weaker in most cases after controlling for elevation. Our results suggest that in the subtropical mountain forest higher woody plant diversity has a spatially destabilising effect on forest productivity, particularly at higher elevations. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"biodiversity; forest; geographically weighted regression; habitat; nonhuman; productivity; species dominance; species richness; woody plant",2-s2.0-85028301916

To better understand the molecular mechanism of exoskeleton formation, development and reconstruction, the transcriptome of the entire developmental process in Litopenaeus vannamei, including nine early developmental stages and eight adult-moulting stages, was sequenced and analysed using Illumina RNA-seq technology. A total of 117,539 unigenes were obtained, with 41.2% unigenes predicting the full-length coding sequence. Gene Ontology, Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and functional annotation of all unigenes gave a better understanding of the exoskeleton developmental process in L. vannamei. As a result, more than six hundred unigenes related to exoskeleton development were identified both in the early developmental stages and adult-moulting. A cascade of sequential expression events of exoskeleton-related genes were summarized, including exoskeleton formation, regulation, synthesis, degradation, mineral absorption/reabsorption, calcification and hardening. This new insight on major transcriptional events provide a deep understanding for exoskeleton formation and reconstruction in L. vannamei.

Exploring the molecular basis of RFI is essential to facilitate the genetic breeding of feed efficiency in L. vannamei. However, few studies have been reported in this aspect. In this study, we sequenced muscle transcriptomes of a high-efficiency group, a low-efficiency group and a control group originating from two families, and compared the gene expression patterns between each extreme group and the control group.

Species richness, evenness, Shanon-Wiener index had significantly higher values in low degree of Phragmites density in all populations. Higher densities had the lowest diversity, with Shannon-Wiener index = 0, Simpson's index = 1 indicating its mono-specificity. Significant alterations in soil properties associated with different degrees of Phragmites density were noticed. These had interactive effects (population × density) on water content, dehydrogenase activity, microbial biomass (C, N, P) but not on pH, electrical conductivity, phenolics, organic carbon, spore density. Furthermore, the study elucidated decrease of competitive abilities of native plants, by interfering with formation of mycorrhizal associations, biomass.

Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models were used to anticipate global range expansion as influenced by environmental conditions, and by the possibility of cooperative invasion of CPB and its wild host SR. The results indicate that both CPB and SR can occupy warm areas of North America, South Africa, Europe, China, and Australia. Future climate conditions may promote CPB expansion into northern regions and SR into the circumpolar latitudes.

The AM fungi were abundant and diverse. AM fungal diversity was significantly higher in grassland than in forest or arable land. Significant differences in AM fungal community composition were found among different land use types. The relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in forest and grassland were positively related to glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), soil organic carbon, macroaggregates, and the unprotected and physically protected carbon, while the AM fungal community in arable soils was dominated by a few OTUs which were positively linked to soil pH.

Increasing abundances of tropical herbivores on temperate reefs could accelerate declines in habitat-forming seaweeds with devastating consequences for these important marine ecosystems. Here we document an expansion of rabbitfish (Siganus fuscescens), a tropical herbivore, on temperate reefs in Western Australia following a marine heatwave and demonstrate their impact on local kelp forests (Ecklonia radiata). Before the heatwave there were no rabbitfish and low rates of kelp herbivory but after the heatwave rabbitfish were common at most reefs and consumption of kelp was high. Herbivory increased 30-fold and kelp abundance decreased by 70% at reefs where rabbitfish had established. In contrast, where rabbitfish were absent, kelp abundance and herbivory did not change. Video-analysis confirmed that rabbitfish were the main consumers of kelp, followed by silver drummers (Kyphosus sydneyanus), a temperate herbivore.

This article examines the increased reliance on interpreters and the nature of their involvement in criminal justice proceedings. It will explore the relationship between interpreters and defendants, on the one hand, and between interpreters, counsels, and judges, on the other. Drawing on empirical data stemming from a research project on foreign national defendants conducted in Birmingham's criminal courts, we explore issues of trust and reliability underpinning the intervention of court interpreters and the implications of these interventions for the defendant's case. The use of interpreters aims first and foremost to ensure the defendant's right to defense. Yet, as we show, their intervention is often propelled or hindered by instrumental, procedural, or logistical reasons, intimately linked to the rapid transformation of the demography of defendants and the privatization of services related to the criminal justice system. © 2017 by The Regents of the University of California.

Here, we experimentally test effects of warming, mammalian herbivory and fertilization on tundra species richness and investigate how plant functional traits affect losses and gains. We show that herbivory reverses the impact of warming on diversity: in the presence of herbivores warming increases species richness through higher species gains and lower losses, while in the absence of herbivores warming causes higher species losses and thus decreases species richness. Herbivores promote gains of short-statured species under warming, while herbivore removal and fertilization increase losses of short-statured and resource-conservative species through light limitation. Our results demonstrate that both rarity and traits forecast species losses and gains, and mammalian herbivores are essential for preventing trait-dependent extinctions and mitigate diversity loss under warming and eutrophication. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"eutrophication; herbivore; herbivory; nutrient availability; plant community; plant-herbivore interaction; rarity; species diversity; species richness; tundra; eutrophication; fertilization; herbivore; herbivory; human; mammal; nonhuman; species richness; tundra; warming; Mammalia",2-s2.0-85028756008

Environmentally induced shifts in growth and development in species with complex life cycles determine the timing of transitions between subsequent life stages, as well as body condition at transformation, which greatly determine survival at later stages. Here we show that spadefoot toad larvae surviving pond drying and predators experienced marked alterations in growth and development, and in their fat reserves, oxidative stress, and relative telomere length. Tadpoles accelerated development but reduced growth and consumed more fat reserves when facing pond drying. However, oxidative stress was buffered by increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and telomeres remained unchanged. Predators caused opposite effects: They reduced larval density, hence relaxing competition and allowing faster development and enhanced growth of survivors. Tadpoles surviving predators metamorphosed bigger and had larger fat bodies, increasing their short-term survival odds, but showed signs of oxidative stress and had shorter telomeres. Developmental acceleration and enhanced growth thus seemed to have different physiological consequences: Reduced fat bodies and body size compromise short-term survival, but are reversible in the long run, whereas telomere shortening is non-reversible and could reduce long-term survival. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85027145798

Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) we investigated FC in the cortical parts of the default mode network (DMN) during resting-state in patients with current MDD. Additionally, we used qualitative and quantitative measures of psychological processes (e.g., state/trait rumination, mind-wandering) to investigate their contribution to differences in FC between depressed and non-depressed subjects. Our results indicate that 40% of the patients report spontaneous rumination during resting-state. Depressed subjects showed reduced FC in parts of the DMN compared to healthy controls.

In particular, question as to whether animal movement is predominantly diffusive or superdiffusive has been a focus of discussion and controversy. We consider this problem using a theory of stochastic motion based on the Langevin equation with non-Wiener stochastic forcing that originates in animal's response to environmental noise. We show that diffusive and superdiffusive types of motion are inherent parts of the same general movement process that arises as interplay between the force exerted by animals (essentially, by animal's muscles) and the environmental drag. The movement is superballistic with the mean square displacement growing with time as 〈x2(t)〉 ∼ t4 at the beginning and eventually slowing down to the diffusive spread 〈x2(t)〉 ∼ t. We show that the duration of the superballistic and superdiffusive stages can be long depending on the properties of the environmental noise and the intensity of drag. Our findings demonstrate theoretically how the movement pattern that includes diffusive and superdiffusive/superballistic motion arises naturally as a result of the interplay between the dissipative properties of the environment and the animal's biological traits such as the body mass, typical movement velocity and the typical duration of uninterrupted movement. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"acceleration; biological trait; motion; muscle; noise; theoretical study",2-s2.0-85032588077

To improve our understanding of seabirds and marine plastic in this region, we completed a synthesis of the published and grey literature to obtain information on all known documented cases of plastic ingestion and nest incorporation by this group. We found that of 69 seabird species that commonly occur in the northeastern Atlantic, 25 had evidence of ingesting plastic. However, data on plastic ingestion was available for only 49% of all species, with 74% of investigated species recorded ingesting plastic.

In a no-change climate scenario these stocks recovered under sustainable management scenarios due to the cumulative effect of reduced fishing and predation mortalities cascading through the food-web. However, rising temperature jeopardised boreal stenothermal species: Causing severe declines in grey seals, cod, herring and haddock, while eurythermal species were not affected.

Understanding the successional changes of AM fungal communities in afforested zones over time is of primary interest in forest ecology. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) has been widely planted on the Loess Plateau of China to prevent soil erosion. We sampled fine roots and rhizosphere soils in black locust plantations consisting of stands of 0, 11, 23, 35 and 46 years of age to measure soil properties, AM fungal colonization level, and spore density and to describe the composition of AM fungal communities in roots and soils using 454 sequencing. With increasing stand age, AM fungal spore density and soil NO3-N and available K contents increased, dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activities decreased, and soil catalase activity and the level of root colonization by arbuscules and hyphae first increased and then decreased. Roots and soils hosted different AM fungal diversity and communities. In soils, AM fungal diversity and community composition did not vary with stand age. In roots, the relative abundance of Claroideoglomus, together with Chao1 richness and OTU richness, peaked at the intermediate stage (35 years) and then declined, and the relative abundance of Glomus decreased linearly with tree age, whereas the relative abundance of the dominant genus Rhizophagus did not vary with stand age.

It can cause considerable yield losses when epidemics occur. Use of genetic resistance is the most effective approach to control the disease. To determine the genomic regions responsible for PM resistance in a set of U.S. winter wheat and identify DNA markers in these regions, we conducted a genome-wide association study on a set of 185 U.S. winter wheat accessions using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from 90 K wheat SNP arrays. We identified significant SNP markers linked to nine quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers linked to three QTLs for PM resistance. Most of the QTLs in the US winter wheat population have been reported previously, but some such as these on chromosomes 1A, 6A and 1B have not been reported previously, and are likely new QTLs for PM resistance in U.S. winter wheat.

Consideration of relationships, distributions, type localities, phenotypic data, and type specimens clearly indicates that the names R. mearnsi and S. albotuberculata refer to the same lineage, and we recognize the oldest available name (Sanguirana mearnsi) for this species. We also define the central Philippine lineage (from Negros, Masbate, and Panay islands) as a distinct new species. Long confused with S. everetti, the new taxon is readily diagnosed and biogeographically restricted to the West Visayan faunal region. The new multilocus estimate of phylogeny and our multivariate analysis of morphological variation demonstrate that the new species is closely related and phenotypically most similar to northern Philippine Sanguirana luzonensis, to the exclusion of S. everetti, the southern species with which it previously was confused. Morphological characters distinguishing the new species include body size, the absence of infracloacal tubercles, the presence of smooth dorsal skin without dorsolateral folds or dermal asperities, its degree of sexual size dimorphism, uniquely stratified flank coloration, bright white subarticular tubercles, bold pectoral patches, dark transverse bars on the limbs, and various body proportions. Recognition of this new species further emphasizes the predictable nature of island bank-structured endemism in the Philippines and demonstrates that the country's vertebrate diversity remains underestimated. The new species is relatively rare, patchily distributed and, with so little natural forest remaining in the central Philippines, it constitutes an immediate conservation concern.

Wild pigs are a highly successful invasive species that cause extensive damage to agriculture and native plant and animal communities. Lethal control is the most common management strategy used to reduce wild pig populations and their damage, and many lethal strategies rely on luring wild pigs to a specific location. Most commonly, a food commodity such as corn or maize (Zea mays) is used for attracting wild pigs to a site, but baiting with food is sometimes prohibited under wildlife laws, and visitation can be variable due to availability of alternative foods, level of harassment by humans, and acceptance of novel food source, devices, and activity. Wild pigs are highly adaptable with refined senses that enable them to interact with their environment and conspecifics in a complex manner. Wild and domestic pigs share keen senses, though differences exist due to suppressed stimuli, evolutionary gains and losses, or other factors related to needs for survival and fitness. Wild pigs routinely rely on acute olfaction to locate food, detect predators, and communicate with conspecifics. A pig’s sense of taste is also considered to be refined and more acute than that of humans. An abundance of evaluations regarding various attractants for wild pigs has been conducted over the last several decades; yet, a scarcity of conclusive results on which attractants to use when and where still exists. As such, we undertook a comprehensive review of available information on potential attractants that could be used to aid management strategies of wild pigs such as hunting/shooting, trapping, pharmaceutical delivery, or density estimation. To complete this review, we assimilated and synthesized the most relevant literature, provide recommendations, and identify attractant evaluation needs for the enhancement of the global management of wild pigs. © 2017, US Government (outside the USA).","Attractant; Bait; Lure; Sus scrofa; Wild pigs",,2-s2.0-85032270168

Fungal diversity in the surface soil was much higher than that in the subsurface soil (P < 0.001), and communities differed significantly between the two layers (P = 0.001). Neither soil properties nor dispersal limitation could explain variation in the surface-soil fungal community. For the subsurface, by contrast, soil, climate and space explained 27% of variation in fungal community. Collectively, these results point to high dispersal rates and absence of edaphic effects in the surface-soil fungal community assemblage in Ngari drylands.

Although these interactions have received much attention in both ecology and evolution, their temporal aspects are little explored. Here we review studies on the circadian organization of pollination-related traits in bees and flowers. Research, mostly with the honeybee, Apis mellifera, has implicated the circadian clock in key aspects of their foraging for flower rewards. These include anticipation, timing of visits to flowers at specified locations and time-compensated sun-compass orientation. Floral rhythms in traits such as petal opening, scent release and reward availability also show robust daily rhythms. However, in only few studies was it possible to adequately determine whether these oscillations are driven by external time givers such as light and temperature cycles, or endogenous circadian clocks. The interplay between the timing of flower and pollinator rhythms may be ecologically significant. Circadian regulation of pollination-related traits in only few species may influence the entire pollination network and thus affect community structure and local biodiversity.

Forest experts were asked to score the six most important ES indicators and biodiversity for forest stands with either exotic or native tree species. Average scores and their variation were used to form an optimal forest portfolio (proportions of the five stand types). Quantitative indicators of ES were used to calculate the reference portfolio. Portfolios based on expert opinions (49% Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 51% native Nothofagus and mixed Pseudotsuga) did not differ significantly from portfolios based on quantitative indicators (51% Eucalyptus plus Pinus, 49% Nothofagus, mixed Pseudotsuga and Acacia). Both portfolios offer good protection against low achievement levels and prevent the degradation of important ES and biodiversity, while pure stands showed low achievement levels for specific ES. We conclude that integrating expert knowledge into forest planning may well support considering ES and biodiversity.

Chinese tallow [Triadica sebifera (L.) Small] is a highly invasive tree species in southeastern US forests, prairies, and wetlands, and effectively managing this invasive species is a significant challenge for scientists and land managers. In this review, we synthesize the literature on invasion ecology and management of Chinese tallow. Our review suggests that the invaded range of Chinese tallow is currently limited by dispersal in many areas and by low temperatures and low soil moisture, and by high soil salinity and frequent flooding in others, but these barriers may be overcome by increased dispersal, phenotypic plasticity, and/or rapid evolution. Invasions by Chinese tallow are facilitated by both the invasiveness of the species and the invasibility of the recipient communities. Invasiveness of Chinese tallow has been attributed to fast growth, high fecundity, a persistent seed bank, aggressive resprouting, abiotic stress tolerance, and the ability to transform fire maintained ecosystems. Some of these traits may be enhanced in invasive populations. Anthropogenic and natural disturbances, lack of herbivore pressure, and facilitation by soil microbes enhance the intensity of Chinese tallow invasions. Biological control of Chinese tallow is being developed. Treatments such as herbicides, prescribed fire, and mechanical control can effectively control Chinese tallow at the local scale. A combination of these treatments improves results. However, a proactive management approach would simultaneously achieve invasion control and promote subsequent ecological restoration, especially in the context of legacy effects, secondary invasions, and/or variable ecosystem responses to different control treatments. Future research should clarify the roles of species invasiveness and community invasibility, increase our understanding of the effects of Chinese tallow in invaded communities, and develop viable management regimes that are effective in both controlling or reducing the probability of Chinese tallow invasion and restoring desired native communities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Biology; Ecology; Forestry; Soil moisture; Soils; Abiotic stress tolerances; Ecological restoration; Environmental change; Management implications; Natural disturbance; Phenotypic plasticity; Proactive management; Secondary invasions; Ecosystems; angiosperm; biological control; ecosystem function; environmental change; forest management; invasive species; invasiveness; literature review; phenotypic plasticity; prescribed burning; restoration ecology; Ecosystems; Eucalyptus Microcorys; Forests; Management; Plasticity; Triadica sebifera",2-s2.0-85029176269

Our objective was to test the effects on pine sapling growth of a simple, quick, and novel silvicultural procedure involving local buckthorn stem removal. We identified 75 five-year-old pine saplings in a Durham, NH, forest regeneration area that was clear-cut in 2009 and which was heavily invaded by buckthorn. All selected pine saplings were surrounded primarily by glossy buckthorn. Around each of 50 of these pine saplings, a 1 m radius was cleared (‘cut only’ treatment) and for half of these there was a follow-up herbicide application (‘cut + herbicide’ treatment). Remaining saplings were untreated controls. After one growing season, pines responded to treatment with increased terminal leader biomass (+75%), basal stem diameter (+12%) and bark starch (+140%). Treated pines displayed even greater diameter increase (+29%) after two growing seasons. None of these variables differed across the two treatments. Height of treated pines did not differ from controls, even after the second growing season. When herbicide was used, there were 86% fewer buckthorn sprouts in treated areas, but pine mortality was five times greater (n = 5) than in the cut only treatment (n = 1). Our results show that, regardless of herbicide use, those pines cleared of surrounding vegetation and not subject to post-treatment mortality exhibited increased vigor and growth, suggesting a greater potential to eventually outgrow competing buckthorn and thus more rapidly reach commercial size. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Competition; Herbicide; Invasive species; Logging; New Hampshire; White pine silviculture","Competition; Herbicides; Logging (forestry); Reforestation; Vegetation; Weed control; Forest regeneration; Growing season; Growth response; Herbicide application; Invasive species; New Hampshire; Untreated control; White pine; Forestry; clearcutting; competition (ecology); coniferous tree; dicotyledon; forest management; growing season; growth response; herbicide; invasive species; regeneration; sapling; silviculture; Competition; Harvesting; Herbicides; Pinus Strobus; Plants; Silviculture; Durham [North Carolina]; North Carolina; United States; Frangula alnus; Pinus strobus; Rhamnaceae",2-s2.0-85028859228

The conservation status of Colombian TDFs is critical; currently, these forests only occupy eight percent of their original cover. Evidence shows that TDFs have a low probability of natural regeneration and may require ecological restoration. Seeds are central to the existence, permanence, and dynamics of plant communities in forests. Seeds exhibit a varied set of traits that exerts control on plant communities by limiting or facilitating plant establishment. According to previous research, in TDFs, most seeds are small, dry, and wind-dispersed, with a high drought tolerance (orthodox storage behavior). In this study, available information on the fruits and seeds of tree species distributed in Colombian TDFs was synthesized. Twelve Colombia TDFs datasets were selected, which included species’ individual occurrences and diameters at breast height. For each TDF, the most important species were selected, and the literature was searched for their seed storage behaviors, dispersal syndromes, and general fruit and seed attributes. In contrast to initial expectations, the search results suggested that the most common dispersal syndrome of the most important species was animal dispersal, followed by wind dispersal. Thirty-nine species were found that were not currently naturally established and should be introduced by active restoration. Most of these species had capsule and drupe fruits. The most common dispersal syndrome was animal dispersal, and the most common seed storage behavior was orthodox. Dominance of animal-dispersed species exacerbates fragmentation and habitat loss in TDFs, making available niches difficult to colonize and reducing the ability of seeds to reach degraded sites. Orthodox germination of seeds can facilitate seed storage in ex situ germoplasm banks to overcome low seed availability and/or forest soil seed bank. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Late successional forest; Late successional species; Orthodox seeds; Seed bank","Agronomy; Animals; Conservation; Cultivation; Ecology; Forestry; Fruits; Reforestation; Restoration; Soils; Desiccation tolerance; Diameters at breast heights; Dispersal syndromes; Ecological restoration; Late successional forest; Late-successional species; Natural regeneration; Seed bank; Seed; conservation status; data set; desiccation; diameter; dry forest; fruit; germination; regeneration; restoration ecology; seed bank; seed dispersal; seed dormancy; species occurrence; tolerance; tropical region; zoochory; Colombia; Ecology; Forests; Fruits; Germination; Probability; Reforestation; Tropical Atmospheres; Colombia; Animalia",2-s2.0-85028910552

Besides direct mortality, the surviving burned trees become more vulnerable following fire and may be attacked by wood boring insects (Coleoptera), which may further affect tree vigor and give rise to massive dispersing offspring affecting surrounding areas. In the first spring after a wildfire that occurred in July 2013 in a cork oak stand in central Portugal, we set up different types of insect traps (interception, emergence and aggregation pheromone traps), and monitored them for up to 16 months. Fire occurrence had a great impact on cork oak trees attractiveness to xylophagous insects, which increased significantly with increasing fire severity. Living unburned trees located close to the fire edge were clearly avoided, while burned trees with no regeneration were the most attractive. Four species of ambrosia beetles, represented nearly 90% of all xylophagous insects captured in interception and emergence traps, namely Platypus cylindrus (Platypodinae), Xyleborus monographus, Xyleborinus saxeseni and Xyleborus dryographus (Scolytinae). Therefore, the presence of ambrosia beetles in recently burned forests should be carefully assessed, and their control should focus on preventing colonization and the spread of infestation. Forest management should primarily focus on increasing tree vigor, and on reducing the factors that may increase burn severity if a fire occurs. In the first years after a wildfire, it is advisable to avoid any activities that are likely to increase stress of burned and neighbouring unburned trees, such as cork extraction, branch pruning and soil ploughing. Additionally, post-fire logging and removal of dead trees before the next spring (when first emergences start to occur), and the use of pheromone traps, are other possible measures to reduce the number of beetles in these situations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ambrosia beetles; Forest pests; Oak; Platypodinae; Scolytinae; Wildfire","Biodiversity; Fires; Reforestation; Ambrosia beetles; Forest pest; Platypodinae; Scolytinae; Wildfire; Forestry; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Platypodini; Platypus cylindrus; Quercus suber; Scolytinae; Xyleborinus saxeseni; Xyleborus dryographus; Xyleborus monographus",2-s2.0-85028395722

We estimated primary microplastic concentrations from personal care products and laundry, and identified potential sources and routes of transmission into the region. Estimates showed the levels of microplastic pollution released into the region from ships and scientific research stations were likely to be negligible at the scale of the Southern Ocean, but may be significant on a local scale.

Furthermore, our predictions of primary microplastic concentrations from local sources were five orders of magnitude lower than levels reported in published sampling surveys (assuming an even dispersal at the ocean surface). Sea surface transfer from lower latitudes may contribute, at an as yet unknown level, to Southern Ocean plastic concentrations.

Although multiple mechanisms of submerged macrophyte expansion have been described, the relative contribution of each of these in shallow lake environments has been largely overlooked. In this study we analyzed the spatial spread and patterning during seasonal growth of a globally invasive submerged macrophyte, Potamogeton crispus, in a shallow urban lake (Lake Monger, Western Australia). We used underwater and aerial imagery to estimate the spatial pattern of the P. crispus bed. By comparing the spatial extent of the bed at different times during the growing season, we found linear expansion rates two orders of magnitude higher than those previously estimated through rhizome elongation. We formulated a deterministic mathematical model that accounted for the ability of P. crispus to spread through rhizomes and fragments broken off by the feeding activities of aquatic birds, to assess the contribution of fragment dispersal to the emergent patterns of the submerged macrophyte bed. In addition to accounting for dispersal from fragments, the model also accounted for a hypothesized feedback between macrophyte-induced thermal stratification and central dieback. Comparison of our model results against field data indicated that the model accurately represented the spatial spread of the macrophyte bed when fragment dispersal was included. When fragment dispersal was not included in the model, the spatial spread of the bed was largely underestimated, suggesting that fragment dispersal may well account for the fast seasonal spread of this species. The model also captured the formation of a ring-shaped pattern in spatial macrophyte distribution suggesting that both fragment dispersal and the feedback between stratification and dieback are necessary to reproduce the spatial structure of the macrophyte bed. Our results highlight the potential important role of fragment dispersal in facilitating colonization and submerged macrophyte invasion in shallow lakes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fragment dispersal; Pattern formation; Plant-induced dieback; Potamogeton crispus; Shallow lakes","Aerial photography; Dissolved oxygen; Estimation; Plants (botany); Urban growth; Fragment dispersal; Pattern formation; Plant-induced dieback; Potamogeton; Shallow lakes; Lakes; biological development; biological invasion; colonization; dieback; dispersal; growth; invasive species; lake ecosystem; macrophyte; numerical model; range expansion; reproductive strategy; seasonality; shallow water; shape; spatial distribution; submerged vegetation; urban area; Aves; Potamogeton crispus",2-s2.0-85029162831

Here, field samplings were conducted in winter and summer in five coastal systems of the Apulia region (SE Italy), three located on the Ionian Sea (Mar Piccolo, Torre Colimena, and Spunderati) and two on the Adriatic Sea (Acquatina and Alimini Grande). Captured blue crabs were weighed and had their δ13C and δ15N isotopic signatures measured; their trophic level (TL) was estimated using the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis as isotopic baseline. C. sapidus abundances varied greatly across systems and seasons, and in Adriatic systems the species was not collected in winter. Trophic levels showed significant spatial and temporal variations, although with no general pattern. In winter, the Mar Piccolo population showed the highest TL values; the lowest estimates were in Torre Colimena and Spunderati, where crabs showed δ13C signatures significantly higher than mussels, suggesting the contribution of 13C-enriched plant material in the diet. In summer, with the exception of the Mar Piccolo, Ionian populations increased their trophic level; both Adriatic populations were characterized by the lowest TL estimates. The analysis performed at the individual scale further indicated body weight-related changes in trophic level. For the Torre Colimena population, in particular, a hump-shaped pattern was observed in both seasons. The present study highlighted a considerable spatial and temporal trophic flexibility of C. sapidus at the population scale, while at the individual scale size-related shifts in trophic level were observed. The ability of the blue crab to vary its energy sources in relation with season, local environmental conditions, and ontogenetic stage is emphasized, suggesting that it may represent a key determinant of its invasion success. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Callinectes sapidus; Food web; Invasive species; Ontogenetic diet shift; Trophic level","biological invasion; bivalve; carbon isotope; crab; dietary shift; food web; invasive species; isotopic analysis; nitrogen isotope; ontogeny; stable isotope; trophic level; trophic structure; Adriatic Sea; Ionian Sea; Italy; Mar Piccolo; Mediterranean Sea; Puglia; Puglia; Taranto; Callinectes sapidus; Decapoda (Crustacea); Mytilus galloprovincialis",2-s2.0-85015624447

Thus, the denaturation of globular proteins seems to lead to a more consistent blend before the injection-molding process. However, when myofibrillar proteins are used, the processability of the dough-like material increases after using either SS or U additives.

The objectives of the SI are to synthesise, hypothesise and illustrate the impacts of global change on estuaries and coastal seas through learning lessons from the past, discussing the current and forecasting for the future. It is highlighted here that establishing impacts and assigning cause to the many pressures of global change is and will continue to be a formidable challenge in estuaries and coastal seas, due in part to: (1) their complexity and unbounded nature; (2) difficulties distinguishing between human-induced changes and natural variations and; (3) multiple pressures and effects. The contributing authors have explored a number of these issues over a range of disciplines. The complexity and connectivity of estuaries and coastal seas have been investigated through studies of physicochemical and ecological components, whilst the human imprint on the environment has been identified through a series of predictive, contemporary, historical and palaeo approaches. The impact of human activities has been shown to occur over a range of spatial and temporal scales, requiring the development of integrated management approaches. These 30 articles provide an important contribution to our understanding and assessment of the impacts of global change. The authors highlight methods for essential management/mitigation of the consequences of global change and provide a set of directions, ideas and observations for future work. These include the need to consider: (1) the cumulative, synergistic and antagonistic effects of multiple pressures; (2) the importance of unbounded boundaries and connectivity across the aquatic continuum; (3) the value of combining cross-disciplinary palaeo, contemporary and future modelling studies and; (4) the importance of shifting baselines on ecosystem functioning and the future provision of ecosystem services. © 2017","Anthropocene; Climate change; Coastal seas; Coasts; Environmental change; Estuaries; Global change",,2-s2.0-85032641862

To better understand migration patterns, gene flow and adaptation in invaded regions, we studied the genetic structure of D. suzukii collected across Italy, where it was first observed in 2008. In particular, we analysed 15 previously characterised Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers to estimate genetic differentiation across the genome of 278 flies collected from nine populations. Results: The nine populations showed high allelic diversity, mainly due to very high heterozygosity. The high Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) index values (ranging from 0.68 to 0.84) indicated good discrimination power for the markers. Negative fixation index (F IS) values in seven of the populations indicated a low level of inbreeding, as suggested by the high number of alleles. STRUCTURE, Principal Coordinate and Neighbour Joining analysis also revealed that the Sicilian population was fairly divergent compared to other Italian populations. Moreover, migration was present across all populations, with the exception of the Sicilian one, confirming its isolation relative to the mainland. Conclusions: This is the first study characterising the genetic structure of the invasive species D. suzukii in Italy. Our analysis showed extensive genetic homogeneity among D. suzukii collected in Italy. The relatively isolated Sicilian population suggests a largely human-mediated migration pattern, while the warm climate in this region allows the production of soft fruit, and the associated D. suzukii reproductive season occurring much earlier than on the rest of the peninsula. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bottleneck; Gene flow; Human trade; Population structure; Spotted wing drosophila; SSR markers","allele; animal experiment; climate; Drosophila; gene flow; gene structure; genetic marker; genetic variability; genome; heterozygosity; human; inbreeding; invasive species; Italian (citizen); Italy; nonhuman; population structure; rest; season; simple sequence repeat; wing",2-s2.0-85032749305

Drawing on ethnographic research of Melbourne-based festivals, this article explores the cultural meanings of getting “trashed” or “wasted” on psychedelic drugs within the outdoor festival environment. The partygoers' temporary retreat into nature ties into the theme of an exile that traces back to the 1960s and still pervades psychedelic culture.

A deeper problem is that immigration control itself is inconsistent with important liberal values–notably the values of freedom and equality.

The second strategy is to establish the democratic community’s prima facie right to determine the shape of its future, including membership and the right to exclude. First, I argue that Miller’s conception of global equality of opportunity is overly narrow and that his objections to the principle, to the metric and to what counts as feasible political action misfire against other, more plausible, accounts. Second, I argue that his democratic interpretation of collective self-determination does not solve the pressing question concerning the morally justified scope and content of self-determination and the moral limits of the right to exclude. I conclude by questioning Miller’s general strategy: whether theories of immigration should be engaged in an exercise of shifting the burden of proof between open and closed borders. By contrast, I argue that a more desirable task for the political philosophy of immigration is to find ways in which the joint requirement of global equality of opportunity and collective self-determination can be coherently upheld. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","global fair equality of opportunity; justified constraints on the right to exclude; moral arbitrariness of birthplace; personal autonomy and political belonging; right to collective self-determination",,2-s2.0-84990181462

Cladosporium/Fusarium/Leptosphaeria-group, Alternaria, Helminthosporium airborne fungal spores and airborne fungal fragments regularly recorded (frequency 100% of days). Cladosporium accounted for 81.09% of the outdoor fungal spores. The airborne fungal fragments have been identified as abundant in our geographic area.

We examine the drivers shaping establishment of alien birds in Australia in the framework of the human activity hypothesis and the biotic acceptance hypothesis (the “rich get richer” model of biotic invasion), and directly compare our results to Europe. Location: Continental Australia, Tasmania, Continental Europe, United Kingdom. Methods: We use compiled atlas data on alien bird richness in continental Australia and Tasmania together and separately, records of known alien bird introduction events compiled from various sources and a suite of biogeographic variables to evaluate drivers of alien bird richness at a 50-km resolution in Australia. We use hierarchical portioning and spatial generalized linear models to quantify the relative contribution of each environmental variable to alien bird richness. We then compare our results directly to those from a previous continental-scale study in Europe and in the UK. Results: We identify 24 established alien bird species across Australia (including nearshore islands and Tasmania) and present a detailed map of alien bird richness in Australia. We discover that in Australia, native bird species richness and land cover heterogeneity are the strongest predictors of alien bird richness at a 50-km resolution, supporting the “rich get richer” model of species invasion. Main conclusions: Our results are contrary to Europe, where the human activity hypothesis was best supported. By performing a cross-continental comparison of drivers of alien bird richness, we show that processes shaping alien establishment and spread can vary across continents with variable human impact history and should be examined on a case-by-case basis before endorsing general hypotheses. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Alien species; Australia; biotic invasions; birds; Europe; human activity","anthropogenic effect; avifauna; biological invasion; bird; environmental factor; human activity; introduced species; land cover; map; native species; species richness; Australia; Tasmania; United Kingdom; Aves",2-s2.0-85028997945

We supplemented these data with year of first record, when available. We used descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to analyse taxonomic, spatial and temporal patterns in establishment records and the global flows of alien species. We used generalized linear mixed models to relate spatial variation in the number of established species richness with variables describing geographical, environmental and human factors. Results: Our database covers 86% of the terrestrial area of the world. We identified 78 alien amphibian and 198 alien reptile species established in at least one of our 359 study regions. These figures represent about 1.0% of the extant global amphibian and 1.9% of the extant global reptile species richness. The flows of amphibians were dominated by exchanges between and within North and South America, and within Europe (59% of all links). For reptiles, the network of global flows of established alien species was much more diverse, with every continental region being both a donor and a recipient of similar importance. The number of established alien amphibians and reptiles has grown slowly until 1950 and strongly increased thereafter. Our generalized linear mixed models revealed that insularity, climatic conditions, and socio-economic development significantly influenced the distributional patterns for both groups.

Therefore, it is crucial to disentangle which differences in weed communities are mediated by management practices in order to establish management that promotes weed covers that enhance benefits while reducing negative effects on the orchards. In irrigated orchards of the Mediterranean area, management is dominated by irrigation (flood/drip) and weed control (mechanical/chemical). To identify how differences in irrigation and weed control modify weed communities in orchards, floristic surveys were carried out in mowed and herbicide-treated plots on drip and flood irrigated orchards. Weed community structure was evaluated in terms of species cover, diversity and the prominence of alien species for each management regime from a floristic and a functional approach. Results showed that irrigation system is the main factor influencing weed community structure. Compared to drip, flood irrigation is associated with a denser weed community with higher presence of alien weeds. Similarly, environmental conditions created by irrigation determine taxonomical and functional composition of weed communities and modulate the effect of weed control methods Flooding favours alien species, C4, perennial grasses, clonal species, zoochorous and hydrochorous and wind-pollinated species, whereas drip irrigation selects mostly native C3 forbs, non-clonal, wind-dispersed and insect pollinated species. Therefore, this study provides insights into how modernizing irrigation method from a flood to a drip system can promote vegetative cover that maximizes benefits to the orchards and the environment while minimizing negative effects of the weeds and prominence of alien species within the weed community. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alien plants; Biological traits; Ecosystem services; Irrigation; Perennial crops; Weed control","biodiversity; C3 plant; community composition; community structure; drip irrigation; ecosystem service; environmental conditions; flooding; grass; herbicide; introduced species; irrigation system; orchard; perennial plant; vegetation cover; weed; weed control; Mediterranean Region; Hexapoda; Poaceae",2-s2.0-85029500922

Low climatic suitability may be limiting the current invasion potential of many alien ornamental species. However, with ongoing disturbance and climate change, this barrier may be reduced for some species. Here, we tested how colonization ability (a prerequisite for invasion) of frequently planted alien ornamentals depends on disturbance and heating, and on their species characteristics. We sowed seeds of 37 non-naturalized alien herbaceous garden-plant species into native grassland plots with and without disturbance, and with and without infrared-heating lamps. To assess whether their responses differ from those within the regional wild flora, we also sowed 14 native species and 12 naturalized alien species. During 2 years, we assessed the likelihoods of germination, first-year survival, second-year survival and flowering of these 63 study species. The heating treatment, which also reduced soil moisture, decreased all measures of colonization success, but more so for sown native species than for the non-naturalized and naturalized alien ones. The disturbance treatment increased colonization success, and because heating decreased productivity of the undisturbed grassland plots, it also increased invasibility of these plots. Average colonization success of non-naturalized aliens was reduced by heating, but some species were not affected or performed even better with heating, particularly those with an annual life span and a high seed mass. Winter hardiness improved colonization ability of non-naturalized aliens, but this advantage was reduced in the heated plots. Synthesis. Disturbance increased and heating decreased the absolute colonization success of most of the 63 species sown. However, heating had stronger adverse effects on the resident grassland and sown native species than either type of sown alien species. Together, these results suggest that some alien plants may have greater colonization success relative to native plants under a warmer climate. © 2017 The Authors.

Indeed, a number of studies, including a highly cited meta-analysis, have concluded that the trend for such interactions is competitive. Here we provide evidence that publication bias and study design have obscured our ability to assess the pollinator-mediated impacts of alien plants. In a meta-analysis of 76 studies, we demonstrate that alien/native status does not predict the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions among plants. Moreover, we found no evidence that similarity in floral traits or phylogenetic distance between species pairs influences the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions. Instead, we report that aspects of study design, such as distance between the control and nearest neighbour, and/or the arrangement of study plants better predict the impact of a neighbour than does alien/native status. Our study sheds new light on the role that publication bias and experimental design play in the evaluation of key patterns in ecology. We conclude that, due to the absence of clear, generalisable pollinator-mediated impacts of alien species, management schemes should base decisions on community-wide assessments of the impacts of individual alien plant species, and not solely on alien/native status itself. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","Competition; experimental design; facilitation; invasive species; phylogenetic meta-regression; pollinator-mediated interactions; publication bias; seed set; visitation","experimental design; facilitation; interspecific competition; introduced species; native species; phylogenetics; plant; plant-pollinator interaction; seed set",2-s2.0-85031506700

Yet in marine reserve no take zones (NTZs) or reefs at depths of &gt;18 m) where commercial fishing is either not permitted or impractical, alternative methods of lionfish control are required. This study evaluates the potential for conservation volunteers to act as citizen scientists monitoring invasive lionfish populations and to support removal efforts in Bacalar Chico Marine Reserve (BCMR), Belize. Two underwater visual census techniques were trialled with conservation volunteers, each with associated benefits and drawbacks. A log of opportunistic lionfish sightings on SCUBA dives has been used to record sightings per unit effort (SPUE) data 2011–2015. In 2014, more rigorous lionfish focused searches (lionfish-adapted belt transects) were introduced. Opportunistic lionfish sightings contributed to a five year SPUE dataset that suggests that lionfish population growth rate has slowed in BCMR, where a lionfish removal program was also carried out by conservation volunteers over the same timeframe. However, lionfish focused searches showed that the mean density in 2014 was high (mean = 27.05 ± 8.77 fish ha-1, 1–30 m) relative to lionfish populations in their native ranges, particularly at sites at depths &gt; 18m (mean = 43.39 ± 13.76 fish ha-1, 18–30 m).

The knowledge of both the specific traits underlying the capacity of a pathogen to become invasive, and the attributes predisposing an environment to invasion are to be thoroughly understood in order to deal with forest invasions. This paper summarizes the historical knowledge on this subject. Many aspects of the ecological processes underlying alien forest pathogens invasions are still unknown, which raises several scientific issues that need further study. The introduction of invasive forest pathogens to areas where naïve hosts are found, is mainly due to global plant trade. Rapid transportation and reduced delivery times increase the chances of survival of pathogen propagules and of their successful establishment in new environments. In forest pathogens, the reproduction mode seems not to be a crucial determinant of invasiveness, as highly destructive pathogens have a variety of reproductive strategies. The most important drivers of forest pathogen invasions appear to be (a) great adaptability to new environmental conditions; (b) efficient dispersal over long and short distances, possibly assisted by the capacity to form novel associations with endemic and/or alien insect vectors; (c) the ability to exchange genetic material or hybridize with resident or alien species. Moreover, these features interact with some key traits of the invaded environment, e.g. environmental variability and biodiversity richness. Host resistance and natural enemies may occur as a result of rapid selection/adaptation after the epidemic phase of invasion. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Disease spread; Economic impact; Invasibility; Invasion pathways; Invasiveness; Novel insect-fungus associations; Pathogen hybridization","biodiversity; biological invasion; disease transmission; economic impact; environmental conditions; forest ecosystem; fungus; hybridization; insect; invasive species; pathogen; reproductive strategy; Fungi; Hexapoda",2-s2.0-85021082498

Harmonia axyridis is particularly abundant in spring in the valleys of central Chile, but there is a dramatic decline in its abundance during the hot summer months. This study reports the occurrence of this invasive alien species in the summer at high altitudes (3578 m a.s.l.) in the Andes, which is the highest record worldwide.

In the aquarium and aquatic ornamental plant trades lies the potential for importing freshwater molluscs and dispersing them. We surveyed 37 pet shops and 24 aquatic plant nurseries throughout Israel in search for freshwater molluscs. The survey yielded 29 taxa, of which 15 are offered for sale (deliberate introduction) and 14 are stowaways (accidental introduction). The species offered for sale are alien species not yet established in Israeli natural systems, whereas the stowaways are mainly established species that have already invaded and maintain stable populations in natural habitats. Six species were documented for the first time in Israel. Taxon richness was not correlated with any geographic or socioeconomic variable. We attribute this to the small size of Israel, which enables people from different locations and social classes to travel easily across the country to buy plants or pets.

In order to understand the impact and efficacy of protected area it is highly desirable to monitor the habitat for assessing the conservation status. Earth observation data is useful to monitor the changing extent of habitats and threats over time. The present work has considered the forest cover change and fragmentation (1930–1975–1985–1995–2005–2013) as the potential indicators to evaluate the conservation effectiveness for 175 protected areas of India.

Using direct measurements of plant density and composition and of ecosystems processes, we evaluate how ecosystem structure, above-ground net primary production (ANPP), and above-ground and soil nutrient pools compare over 25 years since fire and C4 grass invasions disrupted seasonally dry Hawaiian woodlands. We compare structure and function between primary woodland that has never burned and is largely native species-dominated, with sites that had been the same woodland type but burned in alien-grass-fuelled fires in the 1970s and 1980s. The sites have not experienced fires since 1987. We report here that woody plant composition and structure continue to be dramatically changed by the initial invasions and fires that occurred 25 years ago and invaders continue to dominate in burned sites. This is reflected in continued low plant carbon pools in burned compared to unburned sites. Yet ANPP and N storage, which were dramatically lower in the initial decade after invasive-grass fuelled fires, have increased and are now indistinguishable from values measured in intact woodlands. Soil carbon pools were resilient to both invasion and fire initially and over time. Above-ground net primary production has recovered because of invasion of burned sites by a non-native N-fixing tree rather than because of recovery of native species. This invasive N-fixing tree is unlikely to return C storage of the invaded sites to those of unburned woodland because of its tissue and growth characteristics and its interactions with invasive grasses. It does not facilitate native species but rather promotes a persistent invasive grass/N-fixer savanna. Synthesis. We conclude that fire, an unusual disturbance in this system, has perpetuated the dominance of these sites by invasive species and that despite the dramatic recovery of above-ground net primary production and N pools, the ecosystem continues to be in a distinctly different state than the pre-fire, pre-Melinis community. Thus, despite the absence of further disturbance (fire), there is no evidence that succession towards the original ecosystem is occurring. The fact that N pools and above-ground net primary production recover because of a new invader (Morella faya), highlights the unpredictability of ecosystem trajectories in the face of altered regional species pools. © 2017 The Authors.

Data were collected from front page newspaper articles and analysis was developed using the techniques of critical discourse analysis. Drawing on Foucault’s (1977) theoretical understanding of the enmeshment of power relations in discourse as well as Blumer’s (1958) group position model, we develop and test five hypotheses about the role of news elites in constructing this social group.

These species are relatively easy to control because of some of their intrinsic characteristics and because they are highly visible and easy to eliminate. Many Pinaceae species have been well studied because of their use in forestry and their invasive behavior in many countries. The impacts of invasive Pinaceae are not only ecological, but also economic and social. We review the ecology and management of Pinaceae invasions and explore how restoration of invaded areas should be addressed. There are many ways to prevent invasions and to deal with them. Planting less invasive species, better site selection, and invasion monitoring are used successfully in different parts of the world to prevent invasion. Mechanical and chemical methods are used effectively to control Pinaceae invasions. Control is more effective at the early stages of invasion. Old invasions are more problematic as their elimination is more expensive, and the restoration of native vegetation is challenging. In some areas, native vegetation cannot thrive after Pinaceae have been removed, and weeds colonize cleared areas. More attention is needed to prevent the initiation and spread of invasions by focusing control interventions at early stages of invasion. Finding new ways of dealing sustainably with conflicts of interest between foresters and conservationists is crucial. Non-native Pinaceae are important parts of the economies and landscapes in several countries and they will continue to play such a role in the future. Despite the numerous challenges facing Pinaceae invasion management, several approaches can be successful at controlling them. Proper application of current techniques and development of more efficient ones is needed if the goal of maximizing benefits and minimizing negative impacts is to be achieved. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Herbicides; Impacts; Management; Pinus; Restoration; Southern Hemisphere; Tree invasions","biological invasion; coniferous tree; conservation management; conservation planning; environmental impact assessment; environmental restoration; herbicide; invasive species; native species; plantation; site selection; Southern Hemisphere; sustainability; Pinaceae",2-s2.0-85021143589

The evolutionary mechanisms determining LVP, however, are poorly understood, and thus, it is unknown whether innate LVPs differ between eastern North American (ENA), European and East Asian species. Here we monitored LVP in 2014-2015 in 396 Northern Hemisphere woody species grown in a common garden. We found that ENA species, under the same conditions, have three weeks (11%) shorter vegetation periods than their European and East Asian relatives, because their leaves flushed 9 ± 4 and 13 ± 4 days later and senesced 9 ± 4 and 11 ± 4 days earlier. LVPs of species introduced from Eurasia into ENA are therefore longer than those of native species, suggesting that the spread of non-natives might alter seasonal forest productivity in ENA. LVP between naturalized invasive and non-invasive species, however, did not differ, rejecting the common assumption that longer leaf presentation generally fosters invasive success. A likely explanation for the shorter LVP of ENA species is that region's uniquely high inter-annual temperature variation.

The geographical range of the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is expanding, both through human mediated vectors and by natural dispersal. The species is now spreading in Scandinavia. In order to optimize the management of the oyster, including targeted monitoring and mitigation activities, knowledge on the present and future distribution and impact on the ecosystem is important. The development of the population and the potential impacts on native ecosystems were analyzed, based on the present scientific knowledge on the distribution in Scandinavia, data on new settlements and existing literature. Data was first evaluated by 14 experts (including the authors) during a workshop, relating the current status of habitats where Pacific oysters are found in Scandinavia (Low energy rock, Littoral sand and mudflats, Littoral biogenic reefs, Sublittoral sand and Sublittoral biogenic reefs) to a predicted development, thereafter assessed in relation to impact on the habitats. The assessment was done as a function of climate change in a long-term IPCC climate scenario (A1B). We conclude that Littoral biogenic reefs are at risk to obtain the highest expected increase, while all other habitats are at risk of low to moderate development of the oyster populations. Accordingly, Littoral Biogenic reefs was assessed as the habitat type at risk of the largest ecosystem effects as high densities of oysters already exist in these areas, and the densities are expected to increase rapidly until reaching a threshold density. Low energy rock and Littoral sand and mud were assessed as being subjected to moderate to high ecosystem effects. Sub-littoral sand and Sub-littoral biogenic reefs were assessed as currently being at risk of moderate ecosystem effects as there are low densities of oysters in these habitats, although densities in sublittoral biogenic reefs has the potential to increase.

It has been targeted for biological control due to the costly and inefficient nature of physical and chemical control methods. Determining the origin of weed populations has been increasingly recognised as an important component of successful biological control programmes, and may be important for the biological control of S. campanulata due to the high degree of morphological variability within the species, as well as the broad native distribution. Genetic matching, using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR's), and morphological data found support for invasive Pacific Island S. campanulata plants originating from West Africa. Pacific and West African plants were genetically most similar, and were differentiated from native plants from East/Central Africa by PCA and Bayesian-clustering (STRUCTURE) analyses. Genetic data was corroborated by morphological data which showed that West African and Pacific Islands plants had more sparsely pubescent leaves compared to plants from East/Central Africa. Populations in South Africa, where the plant is introduced but not problematic, originated from a different source population than those in the Pacific Islands, probably in East/Central Africa. A greater sampling effort is required before the origin of the South African populations can be determined with certainty.

The global trade in P4Ps is both voluminous and highly diverse, but there is little detailed knowledge about its diversity and dynamics. This makes it difficult to assess the risks associated with this trade and to prioritise high-risk commodities (genus-origin combinations) for detailed inspection or regulation. Using the ISEFOR database, this paper describes the diversity and dynamics of P4P imports into the EU, based on genus-level data for lots imported into fourteen Member States that provided this data for different periods between 2005 and 2014, totalling over 30Bn plants and over 7500 commodities. There was great variety, as well as complementarity, in terms of the imported genera, origins and commodities among the countries. Two-thirds of the imported commodities changed every year. Based on the 10-year data from the Netherlands, the greatest importer of live plants in the dataset, we developed a risk categorisation approach for prioritising the highest risk commodities, based on risk associated information concerning the imported genus and the history of trade with respect to the exporting countries, genera and type of plant material traded. Application of this risk categorisation led to the identification of a modest number of commodities that represent elevated risk, to which more inspection resources can be allocated while lower-risk commodities could be subject to less-intensive phytosanitary inspections. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG Switzerland.","Biosecurity; Harmful organisms; International trade; Pathway risk analysis; Plants for planting; Prioritisation","commodity market; data set; European Union; geographical variation; international trade; introduced species; plantation; regulatory framework; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; vegetation dynamics; Netherlands",2-s2.0-85020315119

Based on an analysis of documents published by EU institutions and independent organizations, I argue that these technological innovations fundamentally alter the nature of national borders. I discuss how new technologies of vision are deployed to transcend the physical limits of territories. In the last twenty years, EU member states and institutions have increasingly relied on various forms of remote tracking, including the use of drones for the purposes of monitoring frontier zones. In combination with other facets of the EU border management regime (such as transnational databases and biometrics), these technologies coalesce into a system of governance that has enabled intervention into neighboring territories and territorial waters of other states to track and target migrants for interception in the “prefrontier.” For jurisdictional reasons, this practice effectively precludes the enforcement of legal human rights obligations, which European states might otherwise have with regard to these persons. This article argues that this technologically mediated expansion of vision has become a key feature of post–cold war governance of borders in Europe.

Environmental niche modelling was used to quantify the effects of wind on the habitat distribution of these invasive plants on a global scale and across 14 biomes. Wind had a negative effect on the habitat distribution of invasive plants in tropical and subtropical moist biomes, and a positive effect in Temperate Conifer Forests, Boreal Forests/Taiga, Temperate Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands, and Montane Grasslands and Shrublands. We concluded that wind affected the habitat distribution of wind-dispersed invasive plants over a large scale, and this effect varied across different biomes.

Here, the desiccation tolerance for different life stages of the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida was determined to test the likelihood of air-exposed transport. Water content, photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm) as well as the capacity to release viable spores were monitored for mature sporophylls during a five-day exposure to air conditions. For newly settled spores (16 h post-release) and developing gametophytes (30 h post-release) survival and growth were observed after 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h of desiccation. Additionally, spore settlement and desiccation survival (after 3, 12 and 48 h) were determined for seven-day-old gametophytes growing on different rope materials (hemp, polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon) in high (99% relative air humidity, RH) and typical (59% RH) air humidity conditions. Viable spores were released from mature sporophylls after three days of desiccation. < 0.4% of spores and gametophytes survived air exposure. Of those surviving, however, individual gametophytes could endure 12 h of desiccation. These specimens exhibited enhanced average lengths, growing up to 70% larger than control gametophytes. Attached to ropes, gametophytes survived 48 h of desiccation; settlement and desiccation survival did not differ between rope materials. Overall, this study demonstrates that air-exposed transport, especially the translocation of mature sporophylls, represents a potential spread mechanism for the invasive U. pinnatifida.

The giant African land snail Achatina (Lissachatina) fulica is one such invader where its impact in natural ecosystems remains completely untested. On Christmas Island (Indian Ocean), A. fulica has become established across large tracts of rainforest following the impacts of invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes) in mutualism with non-native scale insects. Yellow crazy ants facilitate the secondary invasion of A. fulica by extirpating native red land crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis) that are normally effective predators of A. fulica. We used a multifaceted approach to investigate some potential impacts of abundant A. fulica in invaded rainforest. Over the course of a wet season, diel activity transects showed that A. fulica consumed detrital material almost exclusively. However, stable isotope analysis did not confidently identify A. fulica as a predominantly detritivorous species. We found no statistically significant treatment effects of A. fulica exclusion on standing leaf litter and seedling recruitment processes during a 6-month manipulative field study. However, litter cover and biomass did remain slightly higher where A. fulica were excluded, albeit with overlapping confidence intervals with control plots. Our study constitutes the first empirical test for impact of A. fulica in a natural ecosystem and suggests that for Christmas Island rainforest, this species is not a damaging invader.

Common to most definitions are the following elements: the probability of a future event; and the consequences of the event, usually with respect to some predefined human value. Risk analysis includes elements of risk assessment (quantification of risk), uncertainty (of the event and its consequences), risk management (reducing risk to an acceptable level), and development of policy to balance finite resources with uncertainty and risk tolerance. When biological invasion and its risk are jointly examined, it is common that the consequences of invasion are not explicitly quantified, but understood to be sufficiently negative that it must be minimized to the extent possible. Risk analysis then becomes quantification of the probabilities of an introduction (event) and that the introduction leads to establishment, and the uncertainty of those probabilities. I describe a risk analysis framework for the Asian gypsy moth—a known invader—in its pathway. The framework uses the available information regarding the transportation route of the vector (ships), and a phenology model that estimates vector contamination (propagule size), the probability of introduction, and the probability of initial establishment given an introduction. Reducing propagule pressure is arguably the most important factor in reducing biological invasion; propagule pressure can be reduced by inspection and sanitation of the pathway vector (e.g., ships, trucks, humans) at the point(s) of departure and at the point of entry. I demonstrate how the risk analysis framework can be used to more efficiently target incoming ships for inspection and propagule pressure reduction. © 2017, Her Majesty the Queen in Rights of Canada as represented by: the Minister of Natural Resources.","Asian gypsy moth; International trade; Introduction; Pathway risk analysis; Phenology; Propagule pressure","biological invasion; forest ecosystem; international trade; introduced species; invasive species; moth; phenology; policy approach; propagule; risk assessment; Lymantria",2-s2.0-85019725952

We conducted an in-depth review of the traits of successful invasive forest insects and the ecological processes involved in insect invasions across the universal invasion phases (transport and arrival, establishment, spread and impacts). Most forest insect invasions are accidental consequences of international trade. The dominant invasion ‘pathways’ are live plant imports, shipment of solid wood packaging material, “hitchhiking” on inanimate objects, and intentional introductions of biological control agents. Invading insects exhibit a variety of life histories and include herbivores, detritivores, predators and parasitoids. Herbivores are considered the most damaging and include wood-borers, sap-feeders, foliage-feeders and seed eaters. Most non-native herbivorous forest insects apparently cause little noticeable damage but some species have profoundly altered the composition and ecological functioning of forests. In some cases, non-native herbivorous insects have virtually eliminated their hosts, resulting in major changes in forest composition and ecosystem processes. Invasive predators (e.g., wasps and ants) can have major effects on forest communities. Some parasitoids have caused the decline of native hosts. Key ecological factors during the successive invasion phases are illustrated. Escape from natural enemies explains some of the extreme impacts of forest herbivores but in other cases, severe impacts result from a lack of host defenses due to a lack of evolutionary exposure. Many aspects of forest insect invasions remain poorly understood including indirect impacts via apparent competition and facilitation of other invaders, which are often cryptic and not well studied. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Biogeographic patterns; Biotic resistance; Establishment; Impacts; Invasibility; Invasion pathways; Invasiveness; Spread; Transport","apparent competition; biocontrol agent; biogeography; biological control; biological invasion; biotic factor; detritivory; ecological approach; ecological impact; facilitation; forest ecosystem; herbivore; host plant; insect; invasibility; invasive species; invasiveness; life history; parasitoid; pest resistance; predator; spatial distribution; Formicidae; Hexapoda",2-s2.0-85025143922

We end with a section addressing the analysis of monitoring data, including methods to evaluate survey performance and characterize and communicate uncertainty. Although the body of science supporting EDM implementation is already substantial, research and information needs (many already actively being addressed) include: better data to support risk assessments that guide choice of taxa and locations to monitor; improved understanding of spatiotemporal scales for sample collection; further development of DNA target markers, reference barcodes, genomic workflows, and synergies between DNA-based and morphology-based taxonomy; and tools and information management systems for better evaluating and communicating survey outcomes and uncertainty. © 2017","DNA-based taxonomy; Early-detection monitoring; Morphological taxonomy; Survey design; Uncertainty characterization","advanced technology; aquatic organism; detection method; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; governance approach; implementation process; invasive species; investment; morphology; optimization; prioritization; research work; risk assessment; survey method; taxonomy; uncertainty analysis; DNA barcoding; genetic marker; government; information system; introduced species; invasive species; investment; lake; monitoring; morphology; nonhuman; risk assessment; target organism; uncertainty; workflow; Great Lakes [North America]",2-s2.0-85025176027

Economics is key for understanding invasion processes, impacts, and decision-making. Biological invasions are driven by and affect economic activities at multiple scales and stages of an invasion. Bioeconomic modeling seeks to inform how resources can be optimally allocated across invasion management activities—including prevention, surveillance programs for early detection and management, and controlling invasion populations and spread—to minimize the long-term costs and damages. Economic analysis facilitates understanding of decisions by public and private decision-makers, gaps between these, and the design of policies to achieve socially desirable outcomes. Private decision-makers may undercontrol invasions relative to socially optimal levels, because they generally account for their own costs and benefits of control but less often for broader ecosystem impacts or future spread across the landscape. Economic analysis considers approaches for increasing private invasion management and evaluates feedbacks between ecological and economic systems that can affect policy outcomes. Future research should continue evaluation and design of control strategies across the biosecurity continuum and across species to enhance cost-effectiveness, better incorporate uncertainty into policy design, increase focus on incentives and behavioral tools to influence private behaviors that affect invasion spread, and incorporate invasive species consideration within broader systems-focused science. In addition, challenges in valuing biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts and the costs and effectiveness of control measures are key data gaps. Greater collaboration between decision-makers and researchers will facilitate development and communication of usable economic research. © 2017, The Author(s).","Bioeconomics; Cost-efficiency; Forest biosecurity; Policy design; Prevention and control","biodiversity; biological invasion; biosafety; cost analysis; decision making; ecological economics; economic analysis; ecosystem service; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental restoration; forest management; forest resource; invasive species; management practice; policy approach; project design",2-s2.0-85015683429

The grass/fire cycle is a feedback process between invasive annual grasses and fire frequency that often leads to the formation of alternative vegetation states dominated by the invasive grasses. However, other components of fire regimes, such as burn severity, also have the potential to produce long-term vegetation transformations. Our goal was to evaluate the influence of both fire frequency and burn severity on the transformation of woody-dominated communities to communities dominated by invasive grasses in major elevation zones of the Mojave Desert of western North America. We used a chronosequence design to collect data on herbaceous and woody cover at 229 unburned reference plots and 578 plots that burned between 1972 and 2010. We stratified the plots by elevation zone (low, mid, high), fire frequency (1–3 times) and years post-fire (YPF; 1–5, 6–10, 11–20 and 21–40 YPF). Burn severity for each plot was estimated by the difference normalized burn ratio. We identified two broad post-fire successional pathways. One was an outcome of fire frequency, resulting in a strong potential transformation via the grass/fire cycle. The second pathway was driven by burn severity, the critical aspect being that long-term transformation of a community could occur from just one fire in areas that burned at high or sometimes moderate severity. Dominance by invasive grasses was most likely to occur in low-and high-elevation communities; cover of native herbaceous species was often greater than that of invasive grasses in the mid-elevation zone. Synthesis. Invasive grasses can dominate a site that burned only one time in many decades at high severity, or a site that burned at low severity but multiple times in the same time period. However, high burn severity may predispose areas to more frequent fire because they have relatively high cover of invasive annual grass, suggesting burn severity and fire frequency have both independent and synergistic effects. Resilience in vegetation structure following fire in many arid communities may be limited to a narrow window of low burn severity in areas that have not burned in many decades. Published 2017.

Pathway control appears to be particularly effective for microscopic organisms such as mites, nematodes, and fungi that are difficult to see with the naked eye. However, taxonomic and ecological information on such organisms is scarce, sometimes causing time lags or failure in eradication programs. Several groups of mites, nematodes, and fungi commonly share a habitat with insects or use them as dispersal agents (phoresy). Some exotic mites and nematodes are introduced simultaneously with exotic insects, sometimes in wood materials. In Japan, mites, nematodes, and fungi have been collected from lucanid beetles introduced as pets from Southeast Asia. While no lethal nematode species have been collected from lucanid beetles, one hemolymph-sucking mite species, inhabiting the sub-elytral space of its native host, is able to easily switch to the Japanese beetle, Dorcus rectus, killing the insect. Yeasts have also been reported on exotic beetles and laboulbeniomycetes have been found on mites associated with the beetles, although their interactions are unknown. Despite the lack of information available about other mites, nematodes, and fungi associated with intentionally and unintentionally introduced forest insects, our analysis of insect species listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that unintentional introductions of the microscopic organisms are quite common as a consequence of the existence of symbiotic relationships such as phoresy and parasitism. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Fungi; Mite; Nematoda; Phoresy; Symbiont","beetle; biological invasion; dispersal; fauna; flora; forest ecosystem; fungus; insect; international trade; introduced species; mite; nematode; parasitism; phoresy; symbiont; wood; Japan; Southeast Asia; Acari; Coleoptera; Dorcus rectus; Fungi; Hexapoda; Laboulbeniomycetes; Lucanidae; Nematoda; Popillia japonica",2-s2.0-85025684302

CBC has been carried out widely over a variety of target organisms, but most commonly against insects, using parasitoids and predators and, occasionally, pathogens. Until 2010, 6158 introductions of parasitoids and predators were made against 588 insect pests, leading to the control of 172 pests. About 55% of these introductions were made against pests of woody plants. Establishment rates of natural enemies and success rates were higher in CBC projects targeting pests of woody plants than other pests. This review aims to answer the questions most commonly asked regarding CBC against insect pests, with particular emphasis on tree pests. The topics covered include, among others: variations in rates of successes among different systems, different target insect groups and different agents; temporal trends in CBC practices and successes; economic and environmental benefits; risks and ways to mitigate the risks; CBC against native pests; accidental successes through the adoption of the invasive pests by native natural enemies or accidentally introduced agents; and prospects and constraints for the practice of CBC in the future.

We evaluated the quality of the taxonomic information given in live fish import permits issued by the Costa Rican Ministry of Environment between 1998 and 2004.

We test this prediction using regional angiosperm assemblages that have been heavily invaded by exotic species and relating patterns of phylogenetic relatedness to potential environmental drivers—temperature and precipitation. Location: California, USA. Methods: Using a massive, dated phylogeny of angiosperm plants, we assessed differences in phylogenetic structure between native, naturalized exotic and full floras of 35 bioregions in California. We quantified phylogenetic relatedness using the net relatedness index (NRI) and the nearest taxon index (NTI) at varying phylogenetic extent. We measured changes in phylogenetic structure using a metric (phylogenetic relatedness anomaly), which is calculated as the phylogenetic relatedness of the full flora of a bioregion minus that of the native flora of the bioregion. We assessed correlations between phylogenetic structure measures and temperature or precipitation. Results: In general, introduction of exotic species decreased phylogenetic clustering when considering NRI but increased phylogenetic clustering when considering NTI. However, patterns of phylogenetic relatedness for some families were opposite to those for other families (e.g., NRI anomalies for Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae were opposite to those for Brassicaceae, Asteraceae and all angiosperms combined). Native communities were more phylogenetically clustered in dry regions, while exotic phylogenetic structure was less clearly related to climate. Main conclusions: Exotic species tend to come from clades that are poorly represented but not completely absent from the native flora. Within families, NTI patterns tended to be fairly similar between native and exotic species, suggesting shared responses to the environment, particularly temperature and precipitation, in these two groups. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","angiosperms; community assembly; Darwin's naturalization conundrum; niche conservatism; niche convergence; phylogenetic structure","Amaranthaceae; Asteraceae; Brassicaceae; Caryophyllaceae; Fabaceae; Magnoliophyta; Poaceae",2-s2.0-85028959727

As in other parts of the world, invasions of non-native insect pests in this region are increasing due to increased trade as well as inadequate quarantine regulations and implementation. Some of these invasions result in substantial socio-economic and environmental losses. In addition, new host associations of native insects on the non-native tree hosts continue to occur. Identification of these insect pests is becoming increasingly difficult due to declining taxonomic expertise, and a lack of resources and research capacity hinders the widespread and effective deployment of resistant trees and biological control agents. The necessity to engage with an extremely diverse stakeholder community also complicates implementing management strategies. We propose that a regional strategy is needed for developing regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where limited resources can be optimized and shared risks managed collectively. This strategy should look beyond the standard recommendations and include the development of an inter-regional phytosanitary agency, exploiting new technologies to identify insect pests, and the use of “citizen science” projects. Local capacity is also needed to develop and test trees for pest tolerance and to deploy biological control agents. Ideally, research and capacity development should, at least initially, be concentrated in centres of excellence to reduce costs and optimize efforts. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Acacia mearnsii; Africa; Eucalyptus spp; Insect pest management; Invasive insects; Pinus spp; Tectona grandis","biological control; biological invasion; coniferous tree; economic development; environmental disturbance; evergreen tree; invasive species; management practice; native species; pest control; pest resistance; plantation forestry; policy development; potential biocontrol agent; research work; socioeconomic conditions; stakeholder; Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Acacia mearnsii; Eucalyptus; Hexapoda; Tectona grandis",2-s2.0-85021155483

There is a growing interest in including forest management practices to control or manage invasives. Rather than adhere to traditional silvicultural practices, invasive species management approaches should be tailored to the specific circumstances, e.g. invasion intensity, long-term management goals, and role of the invasive, e.g., defoliator, direct mortality agent, host stressor. Pre-emptive silvicultural approaches correspond well with ecological principles of maintaining host vigor, both in plantations and natural forests. As invasive species dominate some ecosystems and influence ecosystem processes, the use of silviculture as a restoration tool gains importance. Restoration following invasive species damage may involve shifts in species composition (non-hosts) to maintain or create resilient forest communities. Evidence of successful use of silviculture to minimize damage from invasive species remains limited, and although dwarfed by other control efforts, such as biological control, silvicultural practices should be integrated into comprehensive management of invasive species.

But forests are increasingly affected by a variety of human influences, especially those resulting from biological invasions. Species invading forests include woody and herbaceous plants, many animal species including mammals and invertebrates, as well as a variety of microorganisms such as fungi, oomycetes, bacteria and viruses. These species have diverse ecological roles including primary producers, herbivores, predators, animal pathogens, plant pathogens, decomposers, pollinators and other mutualists. Although most non-native species have negligible effects on forests, a few have profound and often cascading impacts. These impacts include alteration of tree species composition, changes in forest succession, declines in biological diversity, and alteration of nutrient, carbon and water cycles. Many of these result from competition with native species but also trophic influences that may result in major changes in food web structure. Naturally regenerating forests around the world have been substantially altered by invading species but planted forests also are at risk. Non-native tree species are widely planted in many parts of the world for production of wood and fibre, and are chosen because of their frequently exceptional growth in their new environment. This greater growth is due, in part, to escape from herbivores and pathogens that exist in their native ranges. Over time, some pest species can “catch-up” with their hosts, leading to subsequent declines in forest productivity. Other impacts result when native herbivores or pathogens adapt to exotic trees or when novel associations form between pathogens and vectors. Additionally, planted non-native trees are sometimes invasive and can have substantial adverse effects on adjacent natural areas. Management of invasions in forests includes prevention of arrival, eradication of nascent populations, biological control, selection for resistance in host trees, and the use of cultural practices (silviculture and restoration) to minimize invader impacts. In the future, the worlds’ forests are likely to be subject to increasing numbers of invasions, and effective management will require greater international cooperation and interdisciplinary integration. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).","Decomposer; Enemy release; Herbivore; Predator; Producer; Resistance","biological invasion; decomposition; enemy release hypothesis; forest ecosystem; herbivore; human activity; interdisciplinary approach; international cooperation; management practice; native species; pest resistance; pest species; predator; producer-scrounger interaction; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Oomycetes",2-s2.0-85028768065

Little is known about the inheritance of the blue grain traits including their genome location. In this experiment, we observed the grain color development and the segregation of blue wheat. The blue color development of wheat grains started at the mid grain development stage of 20 days post anthesis (dpa) and completed within 26 dpa. Segregation pattern of blue wheat was studied using an F2 population derived from blue and white wheat and it was found that the blue color is dominant to white color. The segregation did not follow the simple Mendalian inheritance. The different color intensities of blue wheat grains may be due to genetic dosage effect and the effect of minor genes. The main reason for the huge variation in the segregation of blue and white seeds in the same spike of the blue population is the effect of xenia. Several other genetic and environmental factors also affect for the blue trait in wheat. These findings will be helpful to identify the genetic basis of blue aleurone traits which will be utilized for further improvement of the blue wheat crop.","Aleurone layer; Anthocyanin; Blue wheat; Inheritance; Segregation",,2-s2.0-85032495740

The critique has great value in that it asks interesting questions that often go unnoticed and fail to be discussed in mathematics education research—e.g., the question of alienation or the role of agency in Vygotsky’s notion of the zone of proximal development. Despite the great value of the questions raised, the critique fails because its idealist theoretical epistemological underpinning is at odds with Vygotsky’s thought and cultural-historical activity research in general. The critique falls short especially on the point of realizing the materialist dialectical method Vygotsky employed. The goal of this article is to address Williams’ critique by (a) revisiting the main argument of the critique, (b) articulating the departures of the critique from the materialist dialectical method, (c) conceptualizing development along the theoretical lines of the late (Spinozist-Marxian) Vygotsky, and (d) formulating a materialist dialectical approach to alienation.

We studied the geographic variation in the density of the lace bug, Corythucha marmorata, and the resistance of tall goldenrod Solidago altissima to the lace bug herbivory in their native range in the United States and invaded range in Japan. We conducted field surveys and reciprocal transplant experiments to examine what abiotic and biotic factors influence variation in lace bug density, and what ecological and evolutionary factors predict the resistance of the host plant between and within the native and invaded ranges. Lace bug density was higher throughout the invaded range than in the native range, higher in populations with warmer climates, and negatively affected by foliage damage by other insects in both ranges. The higher lace bug density in warmer climates was explained by the shorter developmental time of the lace bugs at higher temperatures. The resistance of S. altissima to lace bugs was higher in populations with lace bugs compared to populations without lace bugs in both native and invaded ranges, indicating that the evolutionary history of the interaction with the lace bugs was responsible for the variation in S. altissima resistance in both ranges. The present study revealed that abiotic and biotic factors, including temperature and other herbivorous insects, can drive the geographic variation in lace bug density, which in turn selects for variation in plant resistance in both in the native and invaded ranges. We conclude that the novel combination of factors such as higher temperature and lower number of other herbivorous insects is responsible for the higher lace bug density in the invaded range than in the native range. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","biological invasion; Corythucha marmorata; exotic insects; plant defense; plant–insect interaction; Solidago altissima","biological development; biological invasion; defense mechanism; environmental factor; evolutionary biology; geographical variation; herb; high temperature; host plant; introduced species; plant-insect interaction; population density; Japan; United States; Corythucha marmorata; Hexapoda; Solidago canadensis var. scabra; Tingidae",2-s2.0-85030462218

We examined the biogeographic origins of herbaceous invaders in EAS and ENA forests, summarized their life histories and ecology, and compiled the relevant literature on the 10 leading mechanistic hypotheses proposed for these invasions. We asked whether invasions of EAS and ENA forests by herbs are shared between regions, and whether a common suite of ecological traits unite these invaders into a functionally distinct group. In a focused summary of the empirical literature, we investigated if leading hypothesized mechanisms for biological invasions at large are also invoked and supported for this ecologically important, but relatively understudied, group of species. In contrast to ENA, forest invaders in EAS are overwhelmingly herbaceous (78% of forest invasions vs. 34% for ENA) and originate from different regions. Plant families represented and species traits between regions differed. Within a single species, multiple invasion mechanisms were often supported, highlighting the need for future research that simultaneously investigates multiple mechanistic hypotheses. Further, because results for a single invader often differed across space and time, a shift in focus to incorporate the complex dynamics across temporal and spatial scales with the consideration of spatial heterogeneity and the interplays among natural and anthropogenic factors to study exotic invasions is needed. © 2017, The Author(s).","Automated content analysis; East Asia; Eastern North America; Functional traits; Herbaceous temperate forest invaders; Invasion mechanisms; Systematic review","biological invasion; complexity; deciduous forest; functional role; future prospect; herb; heterogeneity; invasive species; literature review; spatiotemporal analysis; temperate forest; understory; Far East; North America",2-s2.0-85020246245

As such, little is known about the persistence of invasions and their long-term impacts on native species. To experimentally evaluate longer-term effects of invasions, we established field plots with native tree and herbaceous species and then invaded half of the plots with the most widespread invasive grass in the eastern United States (Microstegium vimineum). Over 8 years, we quantified invader and native plant biomass, native plant diversity, and tree density and size. Microstegium was dominant during the first 4 years of the experiment, constituting more than 60% of herbaceous plant biomass in the plots, and native herbaceous biomass was 57% lower and diversity was 44% lower in invaded vs. control plots. However, both Microstegium and herbaceous native species declined in later years. By the end of the experiment, Microstegium was only 2% of community biomass, and there was no difference in native herbaceous biomass in invaded and control plots. We applied a fire treatment in years 6 and 7 to test if repeated disturbance is required to maintain invader dominance and to evaluate how this common management practice in eastern US forests affected invasive and native plants. Tree density was 65% lower and tree diameters were 28–51% smaller on average in fire-treated compared with control quadrants, resulting in significantly greater light availability in fire-treated areas. Consequently, Microstegium and native herbaceous species biomass increased significantly where fire was applied. However, only native species were persistent, and after 8 years, Microstegium was nearly absent, regardless of the fire treatment. Synthesis. The invasive grass was initially abundant and suppressed native species, but invader decline over time corresponded with succession to native herbaceous species dominance when fire was applied, and to native tree dominance without fire such that after 8 years, the initial effects of invasion were no longer apparent. Thus, our data provide some of the first experimental evidence that while the initial effects of plant invasions can be dramatic, invaders and their impacts may decline over time. © 2017 The Authors.

Population-wide management of EAB is focused on biological control through the introduction of four parasitic wasps, including the recently approved larval parasitoid Spathius galinae. This species was approved for release in the north-central and northeastern US in 2015 and its long ovipositor (4–5.3 mm) is expected to allow it to reach EAB larvae in larger ash trees with thicker bark, than the only other successfully established larval parasitoid, Tetrastichus planipennisi. Using experimentally infested logs of varying diameters in the laboratory, we measured the effect of bark thickness on oviposition of S. galinae to understand its potential value for controlling EAB in trees of differing diameter and bark thickness. Parasitism by S. galinae was highest when bark was thin (<4 mm) and dropped significantly as valley bark thickness increased beyond 6.5 mm. We also found that EAB larval feeding on inner bark, reduced the bark thickness directly over the larval galleries by 0.4 mm on average. Our results suggest that S. galinae will be able to reach EAB larvae in >95% of all ash in the northeastern United States.

Archaeological evidence suggests an African origin with later world-wide invasion facilitated by the last centuries’ legume trading and exchange. To date, no studies could identify the routes or timing of dispersal of the species. Here, we investigate the global phylogeography of this pest to shed light on the main inter-continental dispersal routes that led to it becoming a cosmopolitan pest. Location: World-wide. Methods: We sampled seed beetles over a large fraction of the species’ range and sequenced one nuclear and three mitochondrial loci. Using this data, we estimated spatio-temporal phylogeographical reconstructions, and the demographic history of the species. We also used our dataset to evaluate the effect of panmixia on Bayesian demographic estimations. Results: Callosobruchus maculatus exhibited regional and continental genetic structure, with the highest genetic diversity found in Africa. Our discrete Bayesian phylogeographical approach indicated that the species first dispersed to Asia and then colonized the pantropical belt. The three methods used for inferring the demographic history of C. maculatus indicated a recent demographic expansion in the world-wide dataset, as well as in the subset restricted to African samples. Such a signal was, however, not observed in the subset composed of Asian specimens. This demographic expansion occurred in the Holocene and is likely explained by the spread of cowpea and other host legumes across and out of Africa. Main conclusions: The inferred dispersal routes support the idea that the evolutionary history of C. maculatus relates to the trade of its main host plant, Vigna unguiculata. Human-mediated processes appear to have shaped the global genetic structure of this pest. As a methodological implication, we demonstrate that coalescent-based demographic reconstructions can be erroneous if the dataset violates the assumption of panmixia. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Bruchinae; Callosobruchus; demographic history; dispersal routes; human-mediated dispersal; insect pest; world-wide distribution","beetle; data set; demographic history; dispersal; genetic structure; geographical distribution; historical ecology; Holocene; host plant; human activity; insect; legume; pest species; phylogeography; range expansion; Africa; Asia; Bruchinae; Callosobruchus; Callosobruchus maculatus; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Vigna unguiculata",2-s2.0-85026512308

In the present study, we examined how variation in life-history traits can influence colony foundation success in two European termite species: Reticulitermes grassei, an indigenous, and R. flavipes, an invasive. We conducted an experiment in which we observed the development of colonies founded by 165 royal pairs on a weekly basis over a 6-month period. Several key results emerged: (1) survival rates of royal pairs were lower in R. grassei; (2) R. grassei pairs laid fewer eggs; and (3) all castes contained fewer individuals in R. grassei colonies, but (4) their timing of appearance are similar for both species. Overall, R. grassei pairs seemed less robust and produced fewer offspring. To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe the foundation of R. grassei incipient colonies in detail over a 6-month period. We also discovered new information about R. flavipes’ colony foundation. The data suggest that the two species have different levels of colony foundation success, resulting in differences in colony development. This finding could help explain the invasiveness of R. flavipes. Our study contribute to our understanding of the spread of two termite pest species and shed light on critical steps in the colony foundation process. © 2017, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).","Colony foundation; Incipient colonies; Reticulitermes flavipes; Reticulitermes grassei; Royal pair; Termite","caste; colony; invasiveness; life history trait; pest species; social insect; subterranean environment; survival; termite; Hexapoda; Isoptera; Reticulitermes flavipes; Reticulitermes grassei; Rhinotermitidae",2-s2.0-85021223968

We reviewed 112 studies from 61 publications that report invader impacts on mycorrhizal fungi. We describe emerging patterns on the frequency of negative, neutral and positive invader effects on mycorrhizal fungal abundance, richness and community composition, and we evaluate how these outcomes vary with invasion age. We also describe the evidence for three mechanisms of disruption: (1) plant-plant competition that alters host quantity or quality (2) changes in soil properties such as nutrient availability and (3) allelopathy. Invaders can disrupt native mutualisms if they are non-mycorrhizal, associate with a different type of mycorrhiza, or associate with different taxa of the same type of mycorrhiza as the native plants. Invaders that enrich soil nutrients can cause declines in mycorrhizal abundance, shifts in fungal community composition, and cause native plants to reduce their dependence on mycorrhizas. Invaders that produce allelopathic compounds cause mycorrhizal abundance to decrease and alter community composition because of variation in the sensitivity of different fungi to toxins. While the evidence for disruption of the mycorrhizal mutualism with invasion is strong, temporal patterns have not yet emerged from the literature. Invasion age was not clearly associated with extent of disruption, and the timing of recovery following invader removal was highly variable. Differences in the biology of native and invasive plants, their interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and the surrounding landscape contributed to this variation. Synthesis. Our systematic review suggests that invaders frequently decrease mycorrhizal abundance and alter fungal community composition while only occasionally affecting fungal species richness. The development of invader impacts, as well as the restoration of native communities after invader removal, are influenced by a suite of plant, fungal and environmental traits that change over time. However, few studies have examined the temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal disruption, and results are variable. Future research should focus on the temporal scale of mutualism disruption while considering plant phylogenetics and demography, fungal functional traits such as spore longevity and dispersal, and soil chemistry. © 2017 The Authors.

A weakness of TLS collections, especially in vegetation, is the occurrence of unsampled regions in point clouds where the sensor’s line-of-sight is blocked by intervening material. This problem, referred to as occlusion, may be mitigated by scanning target areas from several positions, increasing the chance that any given area will fall within the scanner’s line-of-sight from at least one position. Because TLS collections are often employed in remote regions where the scope of sampling is limited by logistical factors such as time and battery power, it is important to design field protocols which maximize efficiency and support increased quantity and quality of the data collected. This study informs researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize TLS sampling methods for vegetation monitoring in dryland ecosystems through three analyses. First, we quantify the 2D extent of occluded regions based on the range from single scan positions. Second, we measure the efficacy of additional scan positions on the reduction of 2D occluded regions (area) using progressive configurations of scan positions in 1 ha plots. Third, we test the reproducibility of 3D sampling yielded by a 5-scan/ha sampling methodology using redundant sets of scans. Analyses were performed using measurements at analysis scales of 5 to 50 cm across the 1-ha plots, and we considered plots in grass and shrub-dominated communities separately. In grass-dominated plots, a center-scan configuration and 5 cm pixel size sampled at least 90% of the area up to 18 m away from the scanner. In shrub-dominated plots, sampling at least 90% of the area was only achieved within a distance of 12 m. We found that 3 and 5 scans/ha are needed to sample at least ~ 70% of the total area (1 ha) in the grass and shrub-dominated plots, respectively, using 5 cm pixels to measure sampling presence-absence. The reproducibility of 3D sampling provided by a 5 position scan layout across 1-ha plots was 50% (shrub) and 70% (grass) using a 5-cm voxel size, whereas at the 50-cm voxel scale, reproducibility of sampling was nearly 100% for all plot types.

Wardship represents an in-between status, neither citizens nor non-citizens, but rather an anticipatory citizenship formation constructed by the Australian state. The ward is a not-yet citizen, and the deeds, acts, and discourses that define the ward's capacities to act as a political subject can maintain their anticipatory nature even as people ‘achieve’ formal citizenship. Wardship can be layered on top of citizen and non-citizen status alike. Rather than accounting for the grey areas between ‘citizen’ and ‘non-citizen,’ therefore, wards exist beyond this theoretical continuum, demanding a more nuanced accounting of political subjectivities and people's relationships to the state. I trace the emergence of the category ‘ward’ in the 1950s and 1960s in Australia and its re-emergence for Aboriginal Australians impacted by the 2007 Northern Territory Emergency Response legislation. The promise of citizenship offered by the status of ‘ward’ is built upon expectations about family life, economic activity, and appropriate behaviour. These assumptions underscore an implicit bargain between individuals and the state, that neoliberalised self-discipline will lead to both formal citizenship rights and a sense of belonging. Built-in impediments, however, ensure that this bargain is difficult, if not impossible, to fulfil. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aboriginal; Anticipatory; Australia; Citizenship; Northern Territory emergency response; Wardship",,2-s2.0-85030563697

Because competitive and facilitative mechanisms operate simultaneously, but through different food web pathways, the balance of their combined effects can produce complex and variable responses. We used a response-surface experimental design to assess the roles of negative (e.g. intra-, interspecific competition) and positive (e.g. facilitation) interactions between native and invasive juvenile fishes. We tested whether these interactions alter the densities of planktonic and benthic invertebrates to evaluate the magnitude and mechanism(s) influencing the acceptance or resistance of biological invaders. Interactions between bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) or common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were evaluated in mesocosms. Intraspecific interactions were 1.5–2.4 times stronger than interspecific interactions between carp species. The only instance of interspecific competition resulted in bighead carp reducing the daily growth of bluegill, whereas the reciprocal interaction resulted in facilitation. Facilitation occurred when bluegill increased the daily growth of low density bighead carp treatments, despite increased numbers of fishes. Bighead carp also increased densities of benthic Chironomidae larvae, which were subsequently consumed by bluegill, but did not result in enhanced bluegill growth. These suites of interactions were not observed between common and bighead carp. Our response-surface design proved useful for comparing the relative magnitude of intra- vs. interspecific competition, identifying facilitation among species, and tracing attendant effects on invertebrate communities. By accounting for the directionality of interactions within our experimental framework and tracking responses of prey at lower trophic levels, we provide a clearer understanding of how competitive effects and stressed consumers alter prey communities and influence facilitation.

These treatments were repeated in the same animals when lambs were 3 (G3), 10 (G10), and 20 (G20) days old. The behavior of lambs was recorded during each 15-minute separation period, and data were examined using covariance analysis to determine differences for repeated measures over time. In general, after the physical separation from the ewes (A+V+W and A+V+S groups), lambs emitted more vocalizations (3, 10, and 20 days old) and displayed more frequent urination (3 days old), exploration of objects (20 days old) and conspecifics (3 and 20 days old), escape attempts (A+V+W at 10 and 20 days of age; A+V+S at 20 days old), or walking (A+V+W at 10 and 20 days of age; A+V+S at 3, 10 and 20 days old) and lying down (10 and 20 days old for A+V+W and 3 days old for A+V+S) in comparison to the other treatments. G10 and G20 lambs of the A+V, A+V+W, and A+V+S groups also displayed greater values for walking activity (P &lt; 0.05) in comparison with G3 lambs.

However, most existing research suggests that age is not the sole predictor of second/foreign language development, but multiple factors such as quality and quantity of input, intensity of exposure, and socioaffective orientations serve more critical role than only age or maturation.

In some species, individuals appear to postpone song learning until after dispersal, possibly to facilitate conformity to local dialects. Despite decades of study, we still lack a consensus regarding the selective pressures driving this delayed song learning. Two common hypothetical benefits to conformity, and thus delayed song learning, are rooted in territorial interactions; individuals preferentially produce local song either to avoid detection as new arrivals (deceptive mimicry) or to be more effectively recognized as conspecific territory holders. The dickcissel (Spiza americana) is an ideal species in which to study these hypotheses. Males of this species appear to delay song learning until they arrive at their first adult territory, each individual sings a single song type, and conformity to the local song culture is high. Using playback, we contradicted both of the territorial hypotheses described above; male dickcissels did not respond differentially to local vs foreign song playback treatment. We are confident in this lack of difference because dickcissels clearly responded less strongly to a third treatment, neighbor song, than to the other two treatments, demonstrating sufficient power in our experimental design (and providing the first evidence of the dear-enemy effect in dickcissels). Our results raise the question of why dickcissels respond equally aggressively to both local and foreign songs when other bird species often show reduced aggression toward foreign song. If reduced aggression to foreign song is not ubiquitous in species that achieve conformity through delayed learning, then selection from aggressive territorial interaction seems unlikely to be a general explanation for such delayed learning.

Primary detector that always corresponds to the current appearance of target is set to conduct object detection, while auxiliary detectors that correspond to the previous appearances of target are used to re-detect the target when it shows a previous appearance. To achieve better classification with less features and ferns, the detectors are constructed based on the feature selection by the mutual information. As the previous appearances of target are recorded by the detectors correspondingly and only primary detector needs to update, our tracker can achieve long-term real-time object tracking in unconstrained environments.

Trapping reproductive adults is often effective for control, and modification of traps may greatly increase their attractiveness to such individuals. Cane toads (Rhinella marina) are invasive, and males use advertisement vocalisations to attract reproductive females. In amphibians, including toads, specific structural parameters of calls (e.g. dominant frequency and pulse rate) may be attractive to females. Some cane toad traps use an artificial advertisement vocalisation to attract toads. We determined whether variation of the call's parameters (volume, dominant frequency and pulse rate) could increase the capture rate of gravid females. RESULTS: Overall, traps equipped with loud calls (80 dB at 1 m) caught significantly more toads, and proportionally more gravid females, than traps with quiet calls (60 dB at 1 m), and traps with low dominant frequency calls caught more gravid females than traps with median frequency calls. Traps with high pulse rate calls attracted more females than traps with low pulse rate calls. Approximately 91% of the females trapped using a low frequency and high pulse rate combination call were gravid, whereas in traps using a call with population median parameters only approximately 75% of captured females were gravid. CONCLUSION: Calls that indicated large-bodied males (low frequency) with high energy reserves (high pulse rate) are often attractive to female anurans and were effective lures for female toads in our study. The design of future trapping regimes should account for behavioural preferences of the target sex. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry","acoustic attractant; acoustic communication; invasive anuran; Rhinella marina; trapping","acoustic method; biological control; biomanipulation; capture method; invasive species; mate attraction; parameterization; toad; trapping; vocalization; Amphibia; Anura; Bufo marinus; Vertebrata",2-s2.0-85030637346

Overgrowing plants can alter resources, especially soil inorganic nitrogen availability and get benefits from positive feedback. However, comprehensive knowledge on particular mechanisms underlying their successful colonization remains unclear. Here, field examinations and laboratory manipulations were combined to investigate significant impact of overgrowing Ageratina adenophora on soil NO3 −-N availability and nitrification. Interestingly, we found significant enhancement in soil total N, NO3 −-N, pH, potential nitrification rates, and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), while reduced abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) under the influence of A. adenophora. Notably, AOB abundance was positively correlated with both pH and soil potential nitrification rates. AOA abundance was negatively correlated with pH and had no significant correlation with soil nitrification potential. Both AOA and AOB communities significantly differed between populated and non-populated soils. pH was the strongest factor contributing to this community difference.

However, a comprehensive biodiversity impact assessment has so far not been performed. The aim of this study is to analyse how biodiversity is currently viewed in LCA, to highlight limitations and gaps and to provide recommendations for further research. Method Firstly, biodiversity indicators are examined according to the level of biodiversity they assess (genetic, species, ecosystem) and to their usefulness for LCA. Secondly, relevant pressures on biodiversity that should be included in LCA are identified and available models (in and outside of an LCA context) for their assessment are discussed. Thirdly, existing impact assessment models are analysed in order to determine whether and how well pressures are already integrated into LCA. Finally, suggestions on how to include relevant pressures and impacts on biodiversity in LCA are provided and the necessary changes in each LCA phase that must follow are discussed. Results The analysis of 119 indicators shows that 4% of indicators represent genetic diversity, 40% species diversity and 35% ecosystem diversity. 21% of the indicators consider further biodiversity-related topics. Out of the indicator sample, 42 indicators are deemed useful as impact indicators in LCA. Even though some identified pressures are already included in LCA with regard to their impacts on biodiversity (e.g. land use, carbon dioxide emissions etc.), other proven pressures on biodiversity have not yet been considered (e.g. noise, artificial light). Conclusion Further research is required to devise new options (e.g. impact assessment models) for integrating biodiversity into LCA. The final goal is to cover all levels of biodiversity and include all missing pressures in LCA. Tentative approaches to achieve this goal are outlined. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Biodiversity; Environment; Indicators; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); Pressures","Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Ecosystems; Global warming; Indicators (instruments); Land use; Pressure; Biodiversity indicators; Carbon dioxide emissions; Ecosystem diversity; Environment; Impact assessments; Impact indicators; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life cycle; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; diversity index; environmental assessment; environmental impact; environmental indicator; environmental research; life cycle analysis; model test",2-s2.0-85028927523

That is, when invaders dominate a community, can they shift selection regimes and impact the evolutionary trajectory of native populations? The invasion of the annual grass Bromus tectorum in the Intermountain West provides an opportunity to quantify the effects of invasion on natural selection in wild populations. The shift from a perennial-dominated native community to one dominated by a highly competitive annual species alters the timing and intensity of competitive pressure, which has the potential to strongly shift selection regimes for native plants. To quantify traits under selection in contrasting environments, we planted seeds of two native perennial grasses, Elymus multisetus and Poa secunda, into three invaded, invaded but weeded and relatively uninvaded sagebrush systems. We quantified phenotypic traits of seedlings from separate maternal plants, describing differences in phenotypes among individuals. We then asked which traits were associated with survival and plant size in adjacent invaded and uninvaded sagebrush systems, following individual seed performance for 3 years. We found evidence for divergent selection between invaded and uninvaded sagebrush systems, with contrasting phenotypic traits associated with greater survival or plant size in these different growing conditions at all three field sites. For example, at one field site, P. secunda families with higher root tip production were more likely to survive in invaded and weeded environments, but this was not the case in uninvaded environments. Similarly, for E. multisetus, root mass fraction, seed mass and allocation to coarse or fine roots affected survival and plant size, again with contrasting relationships across invaded, weeded or uninvaded environments. Synthesis. Impacts of invasive species extend beyond ecosystem and community composition changes and can affect the evolutionary trajectory of native populations. By quantifying natural selection in invaded landscapes, we identified phenotypic traits that are potentially adaptive in these invaded systems. Importantly, these traits differed from traits associated with success in uninvaded communities. This insight into adaptive, contemporary evolution in native species can guide restoration and conservation efforts. © 2017 The Authors.

Transposons stably integrate into the target cell genome, enabling persistent expression of therapeutic genes. Transposons have evolved from being used as basic tools in biomedical research to bona fide therapeutics. Currently, the most promising transposons for gene therapy applications are derived from Sleeping Beauty (SB) or piggyBac (PB). Stable transposition requires co-delivery of the transposon DNA with the corresponding transposase gene, mRNA, or protein. Stable transposition efficiency can be substantially increased by using ""next-generation"" transposon systems that combine codon-usage optimization with hyper-activating mutations in the SB or PB transposases. By virtue of their relatively large capacity, gene therapy applications with relatively large therapeutic transgenes, such as full-length dystrophin, can now be envisaged. The authors and others have shown that efficient and stable gene transfer can be achieved with these next-generation transposons in several clinically relevant primary cells, such as CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, T cells, and mesenchymal and myogenic stem/progenitor cells that are amenable for ex vivo transfection. Alternatively, in vivo transposon gene delivery has been explored using non-viral vectors or nanoparticles or in combination with viral vectors. The therapeutic potential of these SB- and PB-based transposons has been demonstrated in preclinical models that mimic the cognate human diseases. However, there are still challenges impeding clinical translation of transposons pertaining mainly to the typical limiting efficiencies of most non-viral transfection methods and the intrinsic DNA toxicity. Nevertheless, it is particularly encouraging that transposons have now been used in gene therapy clinical trials. In particular, transposon-engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors are starting to yield promising results in patients with hematological malignancies.

We registered an inverse SRC effect in the presence of a parallel backward-counting task in Experiment 1, and a cancellation of the SRC effect in Experiment 2 when a parallel Stroop-like task was used. We interpret our data as supporting a self-inhibition account of the affordance activation control. Accordingly, the role of executive processes is to prevent self-inhibition in supraliminal conditions: when cognitive resources are depleted by a parallel task, the self-inhibition mechanism becomes active and irrelevantly potentiated affordances are inhibited, leading to the emergence of an inverse SRC effect. In addition, the difference between data patterns observed in the two experiments suggests that the exact roles of the executive processes involved during the activation of affordances may differ. The results suggest a mechanism for action-related activation monitoring based on a flexible control over automatically potentiated actions.

Although antipredator responses can influence the outcome of predator-prey interactions, we have limited information about what cues spider mites use to adjust their behavioural antipredator responses. We experimentally exposed two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) to different predator-borne cues (using a specialist predator, Phytoseiulus persimilis, or a generalist predator, Amblyseius swirskii), conspecific prey-borne cues, or both, and measured locomotion and egg-laying activity. The reactions to predator species compared to each other manifested in reversed tendencies: spider mites increased their locomotion activity in the presence of P. persimilis, whereas they decreased it when exposed to A. swirskii. The strongest response was triggered by the presence of a killed conspecific: focal spider mites decreased their locomotion activity compared to the control group. Oviposition activity was not affected by either treatment. Our results point out that spider mites may change their behaviour in response to predators, and also to the presence of killed conspecifics, but these effects were not enhanced when both types of cues were present.

Ten taxa of predatory or omnivorous insects were evaluated for their capacity to consume eggs and nymphs of Halyomorpha halys in laboratory mesocosm experiments. Predators were collected from agricultural ecosystems in New Jersey, starved for 24–48 h, and then exposed to H. halys eggs, first instar, or second instar nymphs. Survivorship of control prey in predator-excluding containers within the arenas was compared to that of predator treatment groups to determine the effect of predator presence. Stage-specific differences in H. halys survivorship among life stages were observed for several predator taxa indicating stage-specific predation. Acrididae, Coccinella septempunctata (L.), Podisus maculiventris (Say) (nymphs and adults), and Tettigoniidae reduced the hatch rate of H. halys eggs. Hemipteran predators, including Nabis spp. and Reduviidae, reduced the survivorship of first instar nymphs.

Acrididae, Nabis spp., P. maculiventris nymphs, Reduviidae, and Tettigoniidae showed stage-specific tendencies in their consumption of H. halys. Morphological similarities between the immature stages of H. halys may facilitate predator suppression of these mobile stages.

We show that in areas characterised by a high urbanisation rate (>56% impervious land cover), a large decrease of both genetic diversity (loss of 60-80% of initial observed heterozygosity) and population size (loss of 70-90% of individuals) is observed over time.

Clonal integration (resource translocation) between connected ramets of clonal plants can increase their tolerance to stress. We hypothesised that clonal integration facilitates spread of amphibious clonal plants from terrestrial to Cd-contaminated aquatic habitats. The spread of an amphibious grass Paspalum paspaloides was simulated by growing basal older ramets in uncontaminated soil connected (allowing integration) or not connected (preventing integration) to apical younger ramets of the same fragments in Cd-contaminated water. Cd contamination of apical ramets of P. paspaloides markedly decreased growth and photosynthetic capacity of the apical ramets without connection to the basal ramets, but did not decrease these properties with connection. Cd contamination did not affect growth of the basal ramets without connection to the apical ramets, but Cd contamination of 4 and 12 mg·l−1 significantly increased growth with connection. Consequently, clonal integration increased growth of the apical ramets, basal ramets and whole clones when the apical ramets were grown in Cd-contaminated water of 4 and 12 mg·l−1. Cd was detected in the basal ramets with connection to the apical ramets, suggesting Cd could be translocated due to clonal integration.

The present study hypothesized that alterations to certain immunogenic substances occur in injured lungs and are able to specifically bind with corresponding proteins in the blood, and that these proteins may be readily detected. To investigate this hypothesis, a rat model of ARDS was established by cecal ligation and puncture surgery, and an immunoproteomics approach, using serum as the primary antibody in a western blot analysis, was used with the aim of identifying immuno-genic proteins in the injured lungs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for bioinformatics analysis, and mass spectro-metric analysis was used to identify a total of 38 differentially expressed immunogenic proteins. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the top canonical pathways in which the identified proteins may be involved were gluconeogenesis I, glycolysis I, choline degradation I, NADH repair and heme degradation. IPA Biomarker Filter analysis with the terms 'acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury' was used to screen 13 proteins as candidate biomarkers. These proteins were described as antigens, and suggested that paired antibodies may be detected in the plasma of patients at high risk of ARDS. Analysis of these identified proteins may provide novel insights into the potential pathological mechanisms of ARDS.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Biomarkers; Immunoproteomics; Ingenuity Pathway Analysis",,2-s2.0-85030108902

Silvopastoral systems combine livestock raising with tree use, favor conservation of biological diversity, and provide a variety of services to the environment and to farmers. In this study, we evaluated tree regeneration in cattle pastures in the Tulijá River Valley of Chiapas, Mexico. We argue that density of seedlings/saplings in the pastures studied is associated with the density of adult trees, with the type of dominant grass (induced or introduced), and with the practice of weeding around seedlings and saplings. We sampled trees in pastures according to categories of size, as well as herbaceous vegetation in 35 cattle pastures, and interviewed farmers with respect to their practices of weeding around seedlings and saplings. We evaluated specieś capacity for regeneration, and classified species as having adequate or limited natural regeneration capacity (ANR and LNR, respectively). Furthermore, we constructed a generalized least squares model to identify whether density of adult trees, type of grass cover (induced vs. introduced), and farmerś practice of weeding affect the density of seedlings and saplings of tree species. Finally, we identified dispersal agents of each tree species recorded and then compared the relative abundance of seedlings/saplings with adult trees for each dispersal agent, using chi-square goodness-of-fit test. In the 35 cattle pastures, we found 17 species (28%) with ANR capacity, 90% of which belonged to secondary vegetation, and 44 species (72%) with LNR capacity; most of these belonged to late successional tree species. Density of seedlings/saplings was positively associated with density of adult trees and the practice of manual weeding. The greatest abundance of seedlings/saplings corresponded to species dispersed by cattle, followed by those dispersed by wind. For adult trees, the most common type of dispersal was by wind, followed by cattle. These results suggest that native tree species are principally dispersed by cattle and wind, and cattle have a positive effect on the regeneration capacity of the most abundant tree species in the pastures studied. We conclude that Chol Mayan silvopastoral management practices in the study communities in Chiapas, Mexico allow for and promote regeneration of native tree species, most of which belong to secondary vegetation, although some belong to late successional species. These simple management practices allow for harvesting some trees in the pasture while also maintaining the regeneration process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","scattered trees; silvopastoral systems; traditional practices; tree regeneration","agroforestry; biodiversity; cattle; density; grass; herb; management practice; pastoralism; pasture; regeneration; relative abundance; sapling; seedling; silviculture; traditional agriculture; tree; vegetation cover; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]; Bos",2-s2.0-85028553878

In typically developing (TD) children, WM is underpinned by a fronto-parietal network of interacting left and right brain regions. Developmental absence (agenesis) of the corpus callosum (AgCC) is a congenital brain malformation resulting from disruption of corpus callosum formation. This study aims to investigate functional organisation of WM in children and adolescents with AgCC using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nine children with AgCC and a comparison group of sixteen TD children aged 8–17 years completed an fMRI WM paradigm designed to enable investigation of different WM processes, i.e., encoding, maintenance and retrieval. We found that AgCC children recruited globally similar brain regions as the TD comparison group during the WM task, despite significant disparity in brain development, i.e., bilateral occipito-frontal activations during verbal encoding, and bilateral fronto-parietal executive control network during retrieval. However, compared to their TD peers, children with AgCC seemed less able to engage lateralised brain systems specialised for particular memory material (i.e. less supramarginal activations for verbal material and less fusiform activations for face processing) and particular memory process (i.e. absence of right-predominant activations during retrieval). Group differences in the pattern of activation might also reflect different cognitive strategies to cope with competition in processing resources with different susceptibility to concurrent tasks (verbal vs visual), such as differential recruitment of associative visual areas and executive prefrontal regions in the AgCC compared with the TD group depending on the concurrent task completed during maintenance.

The activity patterns of potential predators in the local vicinity should be one especially important source of information, although this may vary in urban ecosystems with altered predator-prey relationships. We examined the extent to which predator activity was associated with the nest distribution and survival of Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Acadian Flycatchers (Empidonax virescens) in 13 riparian forests situated across a gradient of urbanization in central Ohio, USA, in 2008- 2010. We focused on a suite of diurnal predators that was responsible for > 70% of songbird nest depredations in our study system. By overlaying nest locations of cardinals (n = 334) and flycatchers (n = 60) on predator utilization distributions created from mapped predator locations at each site, we determined the corresponding probability of predator use for each site, year, and nest location. The amount of urbanization surrounding sites did not predict nest survival nor relationships between nest placement and nest predator activity. Instead, predator activity better explained patterns of nest distribution and survival. Cardinals nested in areas of high use by avian predators (especially Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater)), but nest survival only declined when these areas also received high use by mammalian predators. The distribution of flycatcher nests was unrelated to predator activity, but nest survival declined where avian predator activity was high and mammalian predator activity was low. Although predator movements at local scales predicted nest survival, our findings provided no evidence that cardinals and flycatchers used that information to select nest sites. Further examination of spatiotemporal variation in the use of predator cues by breeding songbirds is needed to elucidate patterns of information use in songbird nest-site selection, particularly in urban ecosystems. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.","Nest location; Nest survival; Predator; Songbird; Urbanization; Utilization distribution",,2-s2.0-85030168420

We tested whether the occurrence of pecky rice damage caused by the sorghum plant bug Stenotus rubrovittatus (Hemiptera: Miridae), a major rice pest in Japan, could be predicted using a spatial model based on land use data. Using a data from a 3-year field study, we examined the relationships among the land use of the area within a 300-m radius around each focal paddy field, the abundance of S. rubrovittatus, and level of pecky rice damage in the Maesawa region of northern Honshu Island, Japan. We also used mapping to visualize potential priority areas using a model and GIS software. From a linear mixed model analysis and model selection by Akaike's information criterion values, areas of source habitats, soybean fields and rice paddies were selected for the best model, but the abundance of S. rubrovittatus was not. Based on the model's evaluation, the predicted value of pecky rice damage, when compared with the observed value, was not sensitive enough for a quantitative prediction. However, the model was accurate enough to predict whether the brown rice was first grade, which is of greatest importance to local farmers. Therefore, it is possible that potential pecky rice damage by S. rubrovittatus could be predicted when the spatial arrangement of arable fields in a certain year is determined.

This paper presents the findings of a large-scale survey (N = 2193) among Dutch volunteer biodiversity recorders of diverse taxa, and focuses on three questions: what are the characteristics of these citizen scientists regarding their activities and socio-demographic background, what are their motivations for recording biodiversity, and what are their views on data sharing and ownership? Our findings show that a connection to, interest in and concern for nature are the most important motivations for biodiversity recorders. Volunteer recorders have high expectations regarding the impact of their data, both for their own learning as well as for science and management. Almost half the volunteers consider their data to be public goods, but this does not mean they support unconditional data sharing. Instead, the acceptability of data sharing with third parties seems strongly linked to the goals of the user. We discuss the implications of our findings for practitioners, such as the role of biology curricula and the importance of learning opportunities to redress the lack of younger volunteers. We argue that conceptualising volunteer recorders as data custodians rather than owners helps to understand their perspective on data sharing, and emphasize the importance of clear and transparent data policy that respects volunteers’ views on their data. © 2017, The Author(s).","Biodiversity monitoring; Citizen science; Data sharing; Open data; Public participation in scientific research; Volunteer motivations","biodiversity; data assimilation; diversity index; environmental monitoring; local participation; perception; public attitude; public goods; research work",2-s2.0-85020495106

Then, using linear and generalized linear models, we examined the influence of land use on these four metrics in urban atmospheric environments, and evaluated the usefulness and limitation of them. The % N and δ15N models were well explained by the influence of nitrogen sources and/or sinks. The RHL models were significantly affected by urban and forest areas, reflecting urban heat islands. Surprisingly, IAP was higher in urban areas, but comparisons of IAP are not informative in areas with narrow pollution gradients. Land use strongly affected % N and δ15N models in smaller areas because of a point-source influence of nitrogen pollution, whereas RHL was strongly influenced by land use at larger scales owing to drought stress in urban settings.

However, the patterns of spatial and temporal changes in host compatibility are often unknown despite host shifts having direct impact on the persistence of local populations. Bivalves of the order Unionida (freshwater mussels) are a functionally important but declining group of affiliate species, which are dependent on freshwater fish to host their parasitic larvae. The role of local adaptations and host fish resistance in shaping freshwater mussel host relationships remains poorly understood. We used an invasive East Asian unionid bivalve, Sinanodonta woodiana, and its potential host fishes to study the mechanisms shaping fish-mussel coevolution using a combination of laboratory cross-exposure methods and field-collected data. We tested whether generalist host use of S. woodiana is pertinent to native host species, with special attention to bitterling fishes (Cyprinidae: Acheilognathinae) that are characterised by a mutual association with freshwater mussels. We also tested whether the pattern of the parasite–host association varies temporally (between areas of ancient and recent sympatry) and spatially (at a sub-basin level in its native range). Results revealed the ability of S. woodiana to widely exploit non-bitterling host fishes at a global scale. In contrast, the ability of S. woodiana to exploit closely associated bitterling fishes was low in its native range (with ancient sympatry). In areas of recent sympatry (non-native S. woodiana range in Europe), S. woodiana glochidia were demonstrated to readily parasitise local, evolutionarily naive bitterling species at high density. The results of a population-level experiment with three native populations of S. woodiana and rose bitterling, Rhodeus ocellatus, from various sub-basins of the River Yangtze confirmed that mussel populations vary in their compatibility with particular host populations. However, there was no evidence of population-specific adaptive coevolution. This study provides the first evidence for a role of fish counter-adaptations against freshwater mussel glochidia, and documents the importance of population-level variation in shaping compatibility between glochidia and their host fishes. This outcome can inform predictions on the impact of biotic homogenisation on endangered affiliate species in general and freshwater mussels in particular. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","affiliate species; freshwater bivalves; glochidia; host relationships; Sinanodonta woodiana",,2-s2.0-85029365430

The impacts of attack by individual or multiple above-ground herbivores on root functional traits critical to tree health have received little attention. This is especially true for exotic herbivores, organisms often found in disturbed forests. We excavated whole-root systems from eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) individuals experimentally infested with hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA: Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (EHS: Fiorina externa) individually, or in combination, for periods of 2 and 4 years. Below-ground root biomass, functional traits and storage nutrients were measured to assess impacts of herbivory. We also quantified ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) colonisation of fine roots and used culture-independent methods to examine EMF diversity. Trees infested with HWA had a greater root mass fraction (root to total biomass ratio), although feeding had no observable effects on root functional traits (e.g. specific root length) or on resource allocation to roots. HWA feeding did significantly reduce EMF colonisation of hemlock fine roots, though surprisingly, EMF diversity and that of other fungal associates were unaffected. In contrast to HWA, EHS (alone or in conjunction with HWA) feeding had no observable effect on below-ground traits or EMF colonisation alone; however, its presence mediated HWA effects when trees were co-infested. Simultaneous infestation within the same year yielded significant reductions in EMF colonisation, whereas prior EHS attack weakened HWA effects. Our results collectively suggest that prior EHS attack dampens the impact of HWA on below-ground functional traits.

Digenean metacercariae occurred in two forms in the abdominal cavity, excysted and encysted, the latter attached to the gonads, liver and alimentary tract. Parasites were, using morphological and molecular techniques, identified as two representatives of Crassiphialinae, specifically part of the Posthodiplostomum-Ornithodiplostomum clade. The spatial, seasonal, and age class variation in parasite prevalence was examined. Autumn parasite prevalence varied between the six populations sampled (18.2 to 100%). Seasonal prevalence at the two sites sampled quadannually peaked in autumn and reached its lowest value in spring; prevalence increased with size to 100% in young adult fish. We did not find a correlation between prevalence and host sex. Overall parasites’ weight averaged 0.64% of the host’s, while parasite weight increased with host weight. A comparison of relative condition and hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices of infected and metacercariae-free specimens showed that infection did not have a significant effect on host body condition and reproduction. Regarding the parasite’s life cycle, planorbid gastropods are proposed as potential first intermediate hosts in view of the host’s diet and occurrence data of molluscs in the ecosystem. This is the first record of a diplostomid digenean in valenciid fishes and of representatives of the Posthodiplostomum-Ornithodiplostomum clade in a native Greek freshwater fish. Our findings are discussed in conjunction to fish conservation interventions, since parasites may contribute to the decline of endangered species. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Digenea; Host body condition; Parasite prevalence; Planorbidae; Platyhelminthes; Valenciidae","abdominal cavity; Article; autumn; controlled study; Crassiphialinae; diet; Digenea; Diplostomidae; ecosystem; endangered species; gastropod; Greece; host; killifish; metacercaria; nonhuman; parasite prevalence; Planorbidae; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; Valencia letourneuxi; Valencia robertae; weight",2-s2.0-85029433263

Accordingly, estimating riparian ecosystem health across landscapes is critical for sustainable river management. However, methods that identify local riparian vegetation condition, an effective proxy for riparian health, have not been applied across broad, regional extents. Here we present an index to assess reach-scale (500 m segment) riparian vegetation condition across entire drainage networks within large, physiographically-diverse regions. We estimated riparian vegetation condition for 53,250 km of perennial streams and rivers, 25,685 km in Utah, and 27,565 km in twelve watersheds of the interior Columbia River Basin (CRB), USA. We used nationally available, existing land cover classification derived from 30 m Landsat imagery (LANDFIRE EVT) and a modeled estimate of pre-European settlement land cover (LANDFIRE BpS). The index characterizes riparian vegetation condition as the ratio of existing native riparian vegetation cover to pre-European settlement riparian vegetation cover at a given reach. Roughly 62% of Utah and 48% of CRB watersheds showed significant (>33%) to large (>66%) departure from historic condition. Riparian vegetation change was predominantly caused by human land-use impacts (development and agriculture), or vegetation change (native riparian to invasive or upland vegetation types) that likely resulted from flow and disturbance regime alteration. Through comparisons to ground-based classification results, we estimate the existing vegetation component of the index to be 85% accurate. Our assessments yielded riparian condition maps that will help resource managers better prioritize sites and treatments for reach-scale conservation and restoration activities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Columbia River Basin; Condition assessment; Floodplain assessment; Landscape planning; Riparian restoration; Utah","anthropogenic effect; assessment method; biodiversity; conservation status; ecosystem health; floodplain; land cover; Landsat; landscape ecology; landscape planning; restoration ecology; riparian vegetation; river basin; river management; satellite imagery; stream; terrestrial environment; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics; watershed; agriculture; classification; Colombia; floodplain; human; land use; landscape; manager; river basin; satellite imagery; stream (river); Utah; vegetation; watershed; Columbia Basin; North America; United States; Utah",2-s2.0-85006320232

Synaptotagmin 1, 2, and 9 were found to act as the Ca2+ sensors for synchronous release and synaptotagmin 7 and Doc-2 were proposed as the Ca2+ sensors for asynchronous release. Comparatively, the Ca2+ sensor for spontaneous release remains a mystery. At the Calyx of Held synapse, the Ca2+sensor for spontaneous release was found not identical to the sensor for synchronous release, synaptotagmin 2. As Ca2+ sensors have different sensitivity to Sr2+ and Ca2+ and induce significantly different rate of vesicle release, Sr2+ is traditionally used as a tool to examine the intrinsic properties of different Ca2+ sensors. Here, we employed cell-attached patch recording and presynaptic/postsynaptic whole-cell recording at the Calyx of Held synapses of synaptotagmin 2 knock-out mice to assay the Sr2+ and Ca2+ influx into the nerve terminal at resting potential and observed the effects of Ca2+ and Sr2+ on spontaneous neurotransmitter release. We found that the dwell time of single voltage gated Ca2+ channel opening increased around threefold for Sr2+ than Ca2+ with the channel conductance unchanged; the divalent cation sensing machinery in regulating spontaneous release has much lower sensitivity to Sr2+ than Ca2+. Thus, our study reveals some of the intrinsic properties of Ca2+ sensor(s) of spontaneous transmitter release and provided an insight into the underlying mechanisms. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","calcium sensor; single calcium channel currents; spontaneous release; strontium","calcium ion; strontium; synaptotagmin II; voltage gated calcium channel; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioassay; calcium conductance; calcium signaling; calcium transport; Calyx of Held synapse; controlled study; mouse; nerve ending; neuromodulation; neurophysiology; neurotransmitter release; nonhuman; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; synapse; whole cell patch clamp",2-s2.0-85029925633

A growth curve model indicated greater tissue growth in the surface than in the bottom layers, and advanced summer growth by more than 4 months in the stagnant inner bay compared with winter growth in the more rapidly flowing outer bay. Our results suggest that rapid tissue growth of oysters in the surface layer in summer is supported by high primary productivity in the inner bay. In contrast, oyster growth performance at the outer bay in late fall and winter may be related to seasonal food availability that is regulated by short residence time and thereby rapid renewal of water compared to the inner bay. Furthermore, a combination of the water flow regime of the bay and the flow rate-dependent feeding physiology of oysters proved to be an important determinant of seasonal growth dynamics. Finally, oyster growth was better explained by water flow rates than by hydrographic conditions. © 2017, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Clearance; Crassostrea gigas; Food limitation; Growth; Longline culture; Oyster; Water flow","biochemical composition; clearance rate; food availability; food limitation; growth curve; hydrodynamics; hydrographic survey; oyster culture; physiological response; residence time; surface layer; water flow; Hansan Bay; Pacific Ocean; South Korea; South Kyongsang; Crassostrea gigas; Ostreidae",2-s2.0-85018362536

Besides higher plants and animals, microbes, in particular the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, has attracted increasing attention, due to its spread towards temperate zones of the northern and southern hemisphere. A number of advantageous functional traits and a high intraspecific plasticity have been suggested to explain its invasion success. The aim of this study was to examine intraspecific functional trait variability in 12 different isolates of C. raciborskii originating from different lakes in an invaded region in Northeast Germany. We measured growth rate, C:N:P ratios, chlorophyll-a content and the abundance of heterocysts under nutrient-replete and phosphorus-limited conditions. Moreover, the isolate-specific morphology and grazing losses by an herbivorous rotifer, as a top-down force, were studied. DNA fingerprinting revealed that all isolates were genetically different. C. raciborskii exhibited a large variability in all measured traits among isolates. The C:P, N:P and Chl-a:C ratios differed by a factor of two or more. The trait variability among isolates was higher under nutrient-replete conditions, except for the C:P ratio, which varied most during phosphorus limitation. The susceptibility to grazing, calculated as maximum ingestion rates of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus on C. raciborskii, varied most among isolates, but was not related to any of the measured physiological or morphological traits, i.e. no trade-off was found. Ecological and genetic clustering did not match, indicating that the genetic relationship based on DNA fingerprinting did not cover ecological differences. Our results show a high trait variability within locally occurring and partly co-occurring C. raciborskii isolates. No overall trade-offs between the measured functional traits were found. This demonstrates the ecological relevance of linking multiple traits, e.g. competitive and consumptive. Furthermore, this study emphasises the importance of analysing more than one strain of a species, as different strains show different trait values potentially relevant for their invasibility and the field of general trait-based ecology. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii; functional traits; genotypes; invasion; stoichiometry",,2-s2.0-85031494719

The model divided the 200-km-long lagoon into 157,330 cells. Data from a hydrodynamic model were used to generate current vectors for each cell at 10-min intervals. Each cell was assigned a habitat type, and releases or recruitment of mangrove propagules or epifauna larvae were based on the suitability of these habitats. Multiple species were included in the model, each with its own life-history parameters. All individuals were followed over 8 years or until mortality occurred. Adults could reproduce and release new larvae or propagules. The mean rates of spread predicted by the model were &lt;1 km year−1 for all species, which were less than the 2 km year−1 predicted for mangroves along this coast. Spread rates were also found to differ among the five inlet source sites used in the model. Epifaunal invertebrate populations spread at similar rates, but spread more rapidly from mangrove habitats than from dock habitats.

Most such studies investigate plant size, competitive vigour or habitat requirements, but studies that explore more complex characteristics of species directly related to different stages of the plant life cycle are much less common. Germination is the most critical stage in the life cycle of many plants and is the primary source of variation in the regeneration niche. However, only a few authors have studied differences in germination requirements between common and rare congeners, and none have studied these requirements for large sets of species. The aim of this study was to compare seed mass, germination requirements and proportions of germinated seeds of rare and common congeners across a large set of species. We analysed seed mass, proportions of germinated seeds in specific conditions and total proportions of germinated seeds of 18 congeneric pairs of rare and common plant species. We tested different lengths of cold stratification, constant or alternating temperatures, and different light conditions. Seed mass of rare and common congeners was not significantly different. The results indicated that after cold stratification, the proportions of germinated seeds were higher in rare than in common species. In common species, the proportions of germinated seeds were significantly higher during cold stratification than those of rare species. Rare species had higher proportions of germinated seeds than those of their common congeners, and total proportions of germinated seeds were influenced by seed mass and species rarity. Rare species were apparently well adapted to local conditions in the mountains and the inability to germinate was clearly not a cause for their rarity. The study provides unique data on proportions of germinated seeds over a wide spectrum of species and conditions. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Commonness; Krkonoše Mts; Rarity; Reproduction characteristics; Seed size; Temperature requirements",,2-s2.0-85030469332

Unconventional oil and gas development produces surface disturbance by way of well pad, road, and pipeline construction, and increased traffic. Little is known about the resulting impacts on plant community assembly, including the spread of invasive plants. Our work was conducted in Pennsylvania forests that overlay the Marcellus and Utica shale formations to determine if invasive plants have spread to edge habitat created by unconventional gas development and to investigate factors associated with their presence. A piecewise structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect factors associated with invasive plant establishment on well pads. The model included the following measured or calculated variables: current propagule pressure on local access roads, the spatial extent of the pre-development road network (potential source of invasive propagules), the number of wells per pad (indicator of traffic density), and pad age. Sixty-one percent of the 127 well pads surveyed had at least one invasive plant species present. Invasive plant presence on well pads was positively correlated with local propagule pressure on access roads and indirectly with road density pre-development, the number of wells, and age of the well pad. The vast reserves of unconventional oil and gas are in the early stages of development in the US. Continued development of this underground resource must be paired with careful monitoring and management of surface ecological impacts, including the spread of invasive plants.

In the sub-Antarctic, isolation by geographic, geological and glaciological processes has long been thought to underpin patterns in the region's terrestrial and marine diversity. Molecular studies using increasingly high-resolution data are, however, challenging this perspective, demonstrating that many taxa disperse among distant sub-Antarctic landmasses. Here, we reconsider connectivity in the sub-Antarctic region, identifying which taxa are relatively isolated, which are well connected, and the scales across which this connectivity occurs in both terrestrial and marine systems. Although many organisms show evidence of occasional long-distance, trans-oceanic dispersal, these events are often insufficient to maintain gene flow across the region. Species that do show evidence of connectivity across large distances include both active dispersers and more sedentary species. Overall, connectivity patterns in the sub-Antarctic at intra- and inter-island scales are highly complex, influenced by life-history traits and local dynamics such as relative dispersal capacity and propagule pressure, natal philopatry, feeding associations, the extent of human exploitation, past climate cycles, contemporary climate, and physical barriers to movement. An increasing use of molecular data – particularly genomic data sets that can reveal fine-scale patterns – and more effective international collaboration and communication that facilitates integration of data from across the sub-Antarctic, are providing fresh insights into the processes driving patterns of diversity in the region. These insights offer a platform for assessing the ways in which changing dispersal mechanisms, such as through increasing human activity and changes to wind and ocean circulation, may alter sub-Antarctic biodiversity patterns in the future. © 2017 Cambridge Philosophical Society","climate change; gene flow; invasive species; island model; metapopulation; next-generation sequencing; phylogeography; single nucleotide polymorphism",,2-s2.0-85016787797

In agroecosystems the performance of (invasive) herbivores and their impacts on crops is of particular concern. Scientists are presently challenged with making reliable inferences on invader success, natural enemy performance and efficacy of biological control, particularly in tropical agroecosystems. In this study, we assess how trophic regulatory forces (bottom-up vs. top down) influence the success of three globally important pests of cassava. We examine the mealybug species (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) of differing host breadth and invasion history: Phenacoccus manihoti, Paracoccus marginatus, and Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi. Potted plant fertilizer trials were combined with a regional survey in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia of 65 cassava fields of similar size and age, but with varying soil fertility. Relative abundance of each mealybug invader was mapped along a soil fertility gradient, and contrasted with site-specific measures of parasitism. Potted plant trials revealed strong bottom-up effects for P. manihoti, such that impacts of nitrogen and potassium additions were propagated through to higher trophic levels and substantially boost development and fitness of its specialist parasitoid, Anagyrus lopezi (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). Field surveys indicate that mealybug performance is highly species-specific and context-dependent. For example, field-level abundance of P. jackbeardsleyi and P. marginatus, was related to measures of soil fertility parameters, soil texture and plant disease incidence. Furthermore, for P. manihoti, in-field abundance is equally associated with soil texture (i.e., silt content). Principal component analysis (PCA) and regression suggested that P. manihoti and P. marginatus are disproportionately favored in low-fertility conditions, while P. jackbeardsleyi prospers in settings with high organic carbon and phosphorus. Parasitism of P. manihoti by A. lopezi varied greatly with field and soil fertility conditions, and was highest in soils with intermediate fertility levels and where management practices include the addition of fertilizer supplements. Our characterization of the relative performance of invasive mealybugs and strength of parasitism across variable soil fertility conditions will help guide parasitoid release programs and soil management practices that enhance mealybug biological control. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biotic resistance; Classical biological control; Invasive species; Soil fertility; Trophic dynamics","Anagyrus; Encyrtidae; Hemiptera; Hymenoptera; Manihot esculenta; Paracoccus marginatus; Phenacoccus manihoti; Pseudococcidae; Pseudococcus",2-s2.0-85027717621

However, the screening and evaluation of the main predators of insect pests has seldom been reported in the field. Here, we employed comprehensive indices for evaluating the predation of a common pest (Ectropis obliqua) by nine common spider species in Chinese tea plantations. RESULTS: We established the relative dominance of the spider species and their phenological overlap with the pest species, and analyzed DNA from the nine spider species using targeted real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to identify the residual DNA of E. obliqua. The predation rates and predation numbers per predator were estimated by the positive rates of target fragments and the residual minimum number of E. obliqua in predators' guts, respectively. The results showed that only four spider species preyed on E. obliqua, and the order of potential of the spiders to control E. obliqua from greatest to smallest was Neoscona mellotteei, Xysticus ephippiatus, Evarcha albaria and Coleosoma octomaculatum by the Z-score method. CONCLUSION: The orb-weaving spider N. mellotteei has the maximum potential as a biological control agent of E. obliqua in an integrated pest management strategy.

Our results support the numerical and functional dominance of AOA over AOB in acidic soils as bacterial amoA gene and transcript were both under detection limits and archaeal amoA, in contrast, were abundant and responded to the fluctuations of environmental factors.

A conventional integrated pest management (IPM) based on insecticide, mass trapping and cultural measures is compared with an upgraded IPM strategy based on exclusion netting. Costs and benefits associated with the change between the two are estimated to evaluate the most profitable strategy from a societal point of view. The robustness of the results to uncertainty in parameter values is assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In a period of low pest pressure, the conventional IPM strategy would likely be more profitable than no management. However, with higher pest pressure levels, the upgraded IPM strategy would increasingly be more profitable than conventional IPM as pest damage levels increase. CONCLUSION: For the problem considered in this study, insecticide-based management is expected to prove less and less profitable as rising pest pressure levels lead to an intensification of the insecticide applications. Conversely, exclusion netting, despite being more expensive, is expected to be much more profitable, in terms of both its effectiveness in reducing pest pressure and its lower societal impact. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry","Drosophila suzukii insecticide; economics; exclusion netting; integrated pest management; soft fruits","chemical control; cost-benefit analysis; economic impact; fly; fruit; integrated pest management; invasive species; parasite infestation; pest damage; probability; profitability; sensitivity analysis; trapping; Italy; Trentino-Alto Adige; Trento; Drosophila suzukii; Vaccinium",2-s2.0-85026453870

Large tracks of primary forest can be (1) degraded by human-induced disturbance to the point of total conversion into alternative non-forest land-use types, or (2) reduced into small forest fragments isolated within an anthropogenic matrix. Such disturbed habitats are further prone to be colonized by disturbance-adapted species, which can offset species extinctions therein. Here we investigate amphibian and lizard responses to different degrees of habitat degradation and fragmentation, in terms of both species richness and composition, across the neotropics. We then partitioned the β-diversity into its species replacement and richness-difference components to further examine changes in amphibian and lizard species composition. Based on a comprehensive compilation of 67 studies, we observed increasing rates of amphibian and lizard species loss, particularly along the habitat degradation gradient. There were considerable shifts in species composition for both taxa at human-disturbed sites, which were compounded by species replacements. Novel environmental features of disturbed sites clearly benefited synanthropic generalists at the expense of strict forest habitat specialists. As such, we recommend avoiding the use of species richness as a single metric in evaluating the effects of habitat disturbance on biodiversity. Our findings further highlight the critical importance of retaining large expanses of relatively undisturbed forest within anthropogenic landscapes to prevent pervasive species losses and changes in community structure. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Amphibians; Anthropogenic landscapes; Biodiversity loss; Forest disturbance; Lizards; Species replacement; Tropical forests","amphibian; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; environmental degradation; environmental disturbance; environmental factor; extinction; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; herpetofauna; lizard; Neotropical Region; replacement; species diversity; species richness; tropical forest; Amphibia; Squamata",2-s2.0-85021810557

Here we investigate the relative impact of plant data from small natural history collections (collections with < 100,000 specimens) on species distributional models in an effort to document the potential of data from small NHCs to contribute to and inform biodiversity research. We modelled suitable habitat of five test case species from Fuireneae (Cyperaceae) in the United States using specimen records available via the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and that of data ready to mobilize from two regional small herbaria. Data were partitioned into three datasets based on their source: 1) collections-based records from large NHCs accessed GBIF, 2) collections-based records from small NHCs accessed from GBIF, and 3) collections-based records from two small regional herbaria not yet mobilized to GBIF. We extracted and evaluated the ecological niche represented for each of the three datasets by applying dataset occurrences to 14 environmental factors, and we modelled habitat suitability using Maxent to compare the represented distribution of the environmental values among the datasets. Our analyses indicate that the data from small NHCs contributed unique information in both geographic and environmental space. When data from small collections were combined with data from large collections, species models of the ecological niche resulted in more refined predictions of habitat suitability, indicating that small collections can contribute unique occurrence data which enhance species distribution models by bridging geographic collection gaps and shifting modelled predictions of suitable habitat.

The clearings could potentially promote flowering species associated with open-canopy habitats, and provide alternative habitat for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands, but the empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak. We carried out a large-scale field study of understorey plant communities at 51 sites in powerline clearings and adjacent boreal forest. At each site, we placed four 4 m × 5 m plots with five 1-m2 subplots in the clearing centre and a parallel set of plots 100 m into the adjacent forest. Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. The clearings had a higher richness of species associated with semi-natural grasslands, and a higher richness of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant forb species. Total plant richness and diversity were higher in the clearings than in the forests. The magnitude of difference in species composition between clearings and forest, and plant community properties in the clearings, depended on the environmental context (age of the clearing, productivity, shading by tree regrowth, landscape fragmentation, climate). Our results indicate that over time, powerline clearings develop into novel habitats. Low-productive sites were dominated by Ericaceaous dwarfs shrubs. Richness of forbs and semi-natural grassland species in the clearings increased with productivity. Richness of shade-intolerant forbs and semi-natural grassland species increased with fragmentation of the surrounding landscape. We conclude that frequent clearing of productive sites can enhance plant biodiversity – including richness of insect-pollinated species – and mitigate the loss of species associated with semi-natural grasslands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Forest fragmentation; Human-modified landscapes; Novel ecosystems; Plant diversity; Semi-natural grassland; Used land","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forestry; Productivity; Forest fragmentations; Human-modified landscapes; Novel ecosystems; Plant diversity; Semi-natural grasslands; Plants (botany); biodiversity; grassland; habitat fragmentation; herb; land use; landscape ecology; plant community; regrowth; shade tolerance; shrub; species diversity; species richness; understory; Hexapoda",2-s2.0-85026741508

Recent studies suggest that migrating birds can improve their immune and antioxidant status during stopover, implying that variation in stopover habitat can affect migrants’ health. We studied 2 species that are strongly frugivorous during fall migration, Swainson’s Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) and Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis). We asked whether birds that used shrubland dominated by exotic plants experienced differences in mass change, immune function, and antioxidant status relative to conspecifics in native-dominated shrubland during fall stopover in Michigan, USA, in 2012–2013. We found no habitat-related differences in any of the measured health parameters for Swainson’s Thrushes. However, Gray Catbirds using native-dominated shrubland retained mass while those in exotic-dominated shrubland lost mass in 2013. Gray Catbirds in exotic-dominated habitat that year also had poorer immune status (elevated granulocyte:lymphocyte ratio and reduced hemagglutination and haptoglobin) and had lower plasma total carotenoids (immunostimulatory antioxidants) relative to conspecifics in native-dominated shrubland. While these findings were not replicated in 2012, circulating antioxidant capacity was lower in both years in Gray Catbirds captured in exotic habitat. Habitat-specific estimates of dietary energy, carotenoid, and antioxidant content per unit mass of fruit were similar between habitat types for Swainson’s Thrushes. For Gray Catbirds, however, the fruit diet was lower in carotenoids and antioxidant capacity, but not in energy, in exotic habitat. Our results provide evidence that differential use of stopover habitats may affect the immune and antioxidant status of migrating landbirds. Furthermore, our results suggest that habitat may affect health status based on the complex relationships among quality and abundance of food, food preferences, and refueling performance, which vary among species. We suggest that future studies measure immune and antioxidant metrics in addition to refueling performance to better understand the effects of stopover habitat use on landbird migrant health. This information may improve assessment of habitat quality for migrants.

Interpreting successional trajectories is particularly difficult because many seeded sites were actively managed with subsequent treatments to kill sagebrush and sustain high forage productivity of crested wheatgrass plants. In addition, inherent differences in climate, topography, soils, and disturbance regimes may lead to variable vegetation structure and species composition among seeded sites. To clarify variation in successional trajectories, we measured vegetation composition, plant species diversity, ground cover, and soil properties in 38 historical crested wheatgrass seedings distributed across 146 sampling sites that lacked subsequent sagebrush treatments. The multivariate dataset was analyzed using principal components analysis to identify ""defining factors"" that best explained variation among sites. Variation was primarily attributed to an inverse relationship between crested wheatgrass and sagebrush abundance (R2 = 0.69; P &lt; 0.0001) and their affinity for either silty or sandy soil textures, respectively, as well as a negative association between crested wheatgrass abundance and species diversity (R 2 = 0.67; P &lt; 0.0001). These results do not support the assumption that crested wheatgrass seedings uniformly remain in vegetation states with low diversity and poor sagebrush reestablishment over the long term (i.e., 43-63 yr). We suggest that a broader interpretation of plant community dynamics is needed while avoiding generalizations of how historically seeded Wyoming big sagebrush sites will respond over time. © Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.","Agropyron cristatum & desertorum; brush management; ecological site; native shrub; succession; vegetation structure","abundance; grass; ground cover; herb; introduced species; native species; principal component analysis; shrub; soil property; species diversity; succession; trajectory; vegetation structure; Great Basin; United States; Agropyron cristatum; Artemisia tridentata; Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis",2-s2.0-85029182741

Impacts could increase as the population increases, individuals grow in size and ecological changes accumulate. We used a chronosequence approach to characterize the development of soil impacts over time following the invasion of Cytisus scoparius, a widespread nitrogen-fixing shrub thought to limit reforestation success. In a greenhouse experiment, we evaluated how abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi, Douglas-fir performance and leaf nitrogen changed across a 3- to 31-year chronosequence of invasion. Each of the chronosequence sites were clearcuts where reforestation efforts were unsuccessful and where C. scoparius invaded. To estimate the contributions of the invasion separately from contributions of the accompanying disturbance, i.e. deforestation, we included soils from both invaded and uninvaded patches in each site of the chronosequence. In a complementary soil conditioning experiment, we examined the separate effects of host absence and invader presence on the mycorrhizal mutualism, leaf nitrogen and seedling growth. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was lower in invaded soil, but this effect did not intensify with time. Despite the suppression of the mutualism, Douglas-fir grew larger in invaded soils. This positive response is likely due to nitrogen fertilization, a conclusion supported by higher concentrations of leaf nitrogen of Douglas-fir grown in invaded soils. While leaf N concentration increased with invasion duration, Douglas-fir survival and growth did not. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that soil impacts of an invader can develop rapidly and can be surprisingly stable over time. In such systems, recently invaded areas may be as difficult to restore as long-invaded areas, especially where ectomycorrhizal fungi are important drivers of reforestation success. More chronosequence studies or long time series are needed to evaluate whether this is a general pattern. © 2017 The Authors.

The invasive spotted stemborer (Chilo partellus Swinhoe), which is native to Asia, is one of the most damaging cereal stemborers in Africa. The impact of C. partellus on indigenous stemborer species remains unclear, although recent work demonstrates its increasing ecological influence and numerical advantage over Sesamia calamistis and Busseola fusca in African landscapes. In the present study, we discuss C. partellus dominance under Africa's changing climates and highlight the ecological and thermal physiological factors that may contribute to its dominance over indigenous stemborer species. Chilo partellus is an efficient colonizer and competitor and may have an advantage under limited resources typical under climate change. Its invasion potential may also probably stem from its short generation time, overwintering physiology, temperature and relative humidity resilience, wide host preferences, and asynchrony with its biocontrol agents. Using laboratory experiments, we show that C. partellus has a high basal temperature tolerance and related plasticity compared with S. calamistis and B. fusca. These results indicate that ecophysiology may determine invasion success and thus may explain the relative invasion advantage of C. partellus in African landscapes. We recommend that future climate change work be directed towards more comprehensive stemborer total ecology research, stemborer thermal biology and implications on the efficacy of biocontrol.

We tested whether and how anthropogenically changed soils affected the distribution of extraordinary species richness. Using magnetometry we detected former furnaces, workspace, waste deposit and unaffected surrounding grasslands and compared their vegetation and environmental conditions. Archaeological features, especially furnaces and waste deposits, showed a higher pH, higher soil concentrations of exchangeable phosphorus, manganese, lead and calcium, and higher productivity. Surrounding grassland showed higher iron and sodium concentrations in the soil, higher N:P ratio in the biomass and higher species richness. Moisture was uniformly lower in soils on archaeological features, where non-trivially a more ‘mesic’ vegetation in terms of European habitat classification occurred. Plant compositional variation was best explained by water-extractable phosphorus. Because nutrient-richer patches were not moister as common elsewhere, and because species richness was only poorly accounted for by productivity, the occurrence of a species-poor ‘mesic’ vegetation on archaeological features was evidently caused by a long-lasting phosphorus oversupply which favours a comparatively small species pool of rather recently arriving species.

We measured vegetation cover and density on untreated and treated plots 3 and 6 yr after treatment across a gradient of pretreatment tree dominance as quantified by the tree dominance index (TDI); (tree cover)/(tree + shrub + tall grass cover). We analyzed plant responses by functional group using mixed-model analysis of covariance, with TDI treated as a covariate. As tree cover increased and TDI exceeded 0.5, shrub cover declined to < 25% of the maximum on untreated plots. Although total shrub cover recovered on burned plots to untreated percentages 6 yr after treatment, sagebrush cover was still 1.1-0.6% on burned plots compared with 13.9-0.5% on untreated plots across the range of 0-1 TDI. Tall grass cover increased to 25.4-9.4% for burn plots and 24.3-22.4% on cut plots from 0-1 TDI 6 yr after treatment. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) increased on prescribed fire and on cut treatments, especially at higher pretreatment TDI. However, ratios of cheatgrass to tall grass cover were much lower on cut than burn plots. To retain the shrub, especially sagebrush, components on a site and increase ecosystem resilience and resistance through increases in tall grasses, we recommend treating at low to mid TDI using mechanical methods, such as cutting or mastication. Effects of fire and mechanical treatments implemented at different phases of tree dominance create different successional trajectories that could be incorporated into state-and-transition-models to guide management decisions. © 2017 The Society for Range Management.

However, alternative primary sources may make a significant contribution toward the diets of primary consumers in subtropical mangroves due to seasonal processes that impact the availability and nutritional quality of the leaf litter. The variability of the dietary niche for the giant mangrove whelk Terebralia palustris was investigated using a stable isotope approach (δ15N and δ13C) in conjunction with gut contents analysis. The size of the isotopic niche for T. palustris was different between November (summer) and July (winter). Isotopic niches were larger in July, indicating higher dietary diversity. There was no overlap between isotopic niches of different-sized T. palustris, which indicates robust resource partitioning and an ontogenetic dietary shift. The C:N ratio of mangrove leaf litter ranged from 59.34 ± 0.9 in November to 201.66 ± 4.5 in July. The high C:N ratio observed in July could be driving the dietary diversification, if T. palustris preferably consumes more nutritious sources such as microphytobenthos. The variability in the diet of T. palustris is important when considering the ecological role of this species, as a link between mangrove primary productivity and higher trophic levels. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Deposit feeder; Isotopic niche; SIBER; Subtropical mangrove; Trophic niche width","deposit feeder; diet; estuary; gastropod; isotopic analysis; leaf litter; mangrove; niche; niche partitioning; phytobenthos; stable isotope; subtropical region; trophic level; Gastropoda; Rhizophoraceae; Terebralia palustris",2-s2.0-85018728480

However, climate change will substantially alter forest dynamics in the future, affecting the climate regulation function of forests. Increasing natural disturbances can reduce carbon uptake and evaporative cooling, but at the same time increase the albedo of a landscape. Simultaneous changes in vegetation composition can mitigate disturbance impacts, but also influence climate regulation directly (e.g., via albedo changes). As a result of a number of interactive drivers (changes in climate, vegetation, and disturbance) and their simultaneous effects on climate-relevant processes (carbon exchange, albedo, latent heat flux) the future climate regulation function of forests remains highly uncertain. Here we address these complex interactions to assess the effect of future forest dynamics on the climate system. Our specific objectives were (1) to investigate the long-term interactions between changing vegetation composition and disturbance regimes under climate change, (2) to quantify the response of climate regulation to changes in forest dynamics, and (3) to identify the main drivers of the future influence of forests on the climate system. We investigated these issues using the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model (iLand). Simulations were run over 200 yr for Kalkalpen National Park (Austria), assuming different future climate projections, and incorporating dynamically responding wind and bark beetle disturbances. To consistently assess the net effect on climate the simulated responses of carbon exchange, albedo, and latent heat flux were expressed as contributions to radiative forcing. We found that climate change increased disturbances (+27.7% over 200 yr) and specifically bark beetle activity during the 21st century. However, negative feedbacks from a simultaneously changing tree species composition (+28.0% broadleaved species) decreased disturbance activity in the long run (−10.1%), mainly by reducing the host trees available for bark beetles. Climate change and the resulting future forest dynamics significantly reduced the climate regulation function of the landscape, increasing radiative forcing by up to +10.2% on average over 200 yr. Overall, radiative forcing was most strongly driven by carbon exchange. We conclude that future changes in forest dynamics can cause amplifying climate feedbacks from temperate forest ecosystems. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","albedo; bark beetles; carbon sequestration; climate change; evapotranspiration; forest dynamics; iLand; Kalkalpen National Park; latent heat flux; radiative forcing; simulation modelling; wind disturbance","Scolytinae",2-s2.0-85030464606

A wide array of naturally occurring genetic changes are sources of new characteristics available to plant breeders. During conventional plant breeding, genetic material is exchanged that has the potential to beneficially or adversely affect plant characteristics. For this reason, commercial-scale breeders have implemented extensive plant selection practices to identify the top-performing candidates with the desired characteristics while minimizing the advancement of unintended changes. Selection practices in maize (Zea mays L.) breeding involve phenotypic assessments of thousands of candidate lines throughout hundreds of different environmental conditions over many years. Desirable characteristics can also be introduced through genetic modification. For genetically modified (GM) crops, molecular analysis is used to select transformed plants with a single copy of an intact DNA insert and without disruption of endogenous genes. All the while, GM crops go through the same extensive phenotypic characterization as conventionally bred crops.

Understanding differences in germination requirements and emergence patterns across a species’ range is critical for demographic modelling and potential invasive species control efforts. We assessed germination responses of Alliaria petiolata using seeds collected from 10 populations spanning much of the North American distribution of the species. We compared germination responses under different stratification regimes in a growth chamber over 2·5 years, and evaluated seedling emergence in a common garden in Ithaca, New York over 13 years. We further evaluated how climate overlap between Ithaca and original collection sites influenced emergence patterns. In the laboratory, germination of all populations was similar and highest at 4 °C stratification. Seeds exposed to sub-zero temperatures delayed germination and population responses were variable. In the common garden, seedlings from most populations emerged over 13 years, and emergence patterns were strongly influenced by population. Annual emergence was positively correlated with spring temperature and inversely correlated with number of spring days with minimum temperature below freezing. Climate overlap between the common garden and original collection location enhanced germination, but common garden climate conditions over the course of the 13-year experiment and population identity had greater explanatory power. Synthesis. Laboratory germination tests did not reflect seedling emergence under field conditions. After 150 years of residence time in North America, Alliaria petiolata populations have developed striking differences in their responses to local climates and stratification requirements suggesting that a complex interplay of pre-adaptation, rapid evolutionary changes, and phenotypic plasticity result in locally adapted populations. © 2017 The Authors.

Yet most trait-based theory stems from terrestrial systems and extension to other habitats can provide new insights. Wetlands differ from terrestrial systems in conditions (e.g. soil water saturation, anoxia, pH extremes), plant adaptations (e.g. aerenchyma, clonality, ubiquity of bryophytes) and important processes (e.g. denitrification, peat accumulation, methane emission). Wetland plant adaptations and trait (co-)variation can be situated along major plant trait trade-off axes (e.g. the resource economics spectrum), but soil saturation represents a complex stress gradient beyond a simple extension of commonly studied water availability gradients. Traits that affect ecosystem functioning overlap with patterns in terrestrial systems. But wetland-specific traits that mediate plant effects on soil redox conditions, microbial communities and on water flow, as well as trait spectra of mosses, vary among wetland types. Synthesis. With increasing availability of quantitative plant traits a trait-based ecology of wetlands is emerging, with the potential to advance process-based understanding and prediction.

In recent years the interest in oats has increased, particularly because of its dietary benefits and therapeutic potential for human health.

Despite the well-documented benefits, the status of the oat crop is still fragile, due to many reasons. The area cultivated for the oat crop is much less compared with other cereals, and therefore commercial efforts in oat breeding are less. Oat groat yield is lower than other cereals such as wheat and the nutritious uniqueness has not been reflected in agreeable market prices. The same price still exists for both naked and conventional/covered oats in the world grain market. The absence of visible market competitiveness, and some of the oat biological drawbacks, including low grain yield, keeps the oat crop as a lower profitability minor crop.

The best studied examples are those caused by plants and animals, including insects. In contrast, forest invasions caused by microbes, including fungi, have received much lower levels of attention, particularly in the invasion biology literature. This can at least to some extent be due to the large number of these organisms involved and the fact that the majority of these have yet to be discovered and described. This is equally true for tree-infecting fungi, many of which are devastating pathogens responsible for dramatic invasions in natural and planted forests. This situation is changing through the application of molecular genetic tools that make it possible to accurately identify fungal tree pathogens, to determine their origins, pathways of movement, their modes of reproduction and change; all of which can influence invasions. The role and relevance of symbioses between tree pathogens and insects in forest invasions is also gaining increased attention. So too is our understanding that trees live in close association with large numbers of microbes that make up their holobiome. This has substantial relevance to invasion biology (Zenni et al. 2017). This commentary highlights four emerging issues that need to be considered regarding the invasions by fungal pathogens of trees and it emphasizes opportunities to better understand their relevance and impacts on natural and planted forests.

The main application of the direct seeding of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) today occurs in the context of the conversion of Norway spruce stands in central Europe. Although direct seeding is often considered to closely resemble natural regeneration in many respects, tree planting is currently more commonly employed in forestry. Presented in this paper is an extensive historical review showing the variety of facets associated with and experiences of direct seeding gleaned through scientific experiments or based on forestry practice. This review also illustrates the fluctuating practical relevance of the direct seeding of silver fir depending on the prevailing objectives of forest owners, harvesting methods, forest structures and the possibilities for technical implementation. An overview of the available ecological knowledge of the development stages and processes within the natural regeneration cycle of silver fir is provided, highlighting the most relevant environmental factors and the resources determining the success of natural regeneration. Having identified these factors, the individual technical steps involved in direct seeding can be analysed. The means by which the individual steps in the direct seeding approach can be used to manipulate environmental factors and microsite conditions such as the density of overstorey shelter, soil and seedbed preparation, and to reduce competition pressure to optimise the direct seeding of silver fir are outlined. Finally, on the basis of the analyses presented, these complex relationships are integrated in a step by step decision pathway to provide an individual forest stand decision-making process. This ecologically based approach can improve the success of direct seeding and may allow for the adaptation of the direct seeding process to suit individual forest stand conditions. Consequently, the growing efforts to convert and enrich homogenous Norway spruce stands by means of the direct seeding of silver fir can be promoted in a close-to-nature way, while employing controlled silvicultural measures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Direct seeding techniques; Forest conversion; Regeneration cycle; Silver fir; Silvicultural management","Decision making; Forestry; Plants (botany); Seed; Silver; Timber; Direct-seeding; Forest conversion; Regeneration cycles; Silver fir; Silvicultural management; Reforestation; Abies; Abies alba; Picea abies",2-s2.0-85027499868

Yet there is great variability in the influence of CND across species and ecosystems, and the causes of this variation are not well understood. Here, we review and synthesize the mechanisms behind CND in fresh waters. We reviewed 131 articles on CND published between 1973 and 1 June 2015. The rate of new publications in CND has increased from 1.4 papers per year during 1973–2002 to 7.3 per year during 2003–2015. The majority of investigations are in North America with many concentrating on fish. More recent studies have focused on animal-mediated nutrient excretion rates relative to nutrient demand and indirect impacts (e.g. decomposition). We identified several mechanisms that influence CND across levels of biological organization. Factors affecting the stoichiometric plasticity of consumers, including body size, feeding history and ontogeny, play an important role in determining the impact of individual consumers on nutrient dynamics and underlie the stoichiometry of CND across time and space. The abiotic characteristics of an ecosystem affect the net impact of consumers on ecosystem processes by influencing consumer metabolic processes (e.g. consumption and excretion/egestion rates), non-CND supply of nutrients and ecosystem nutrient demand. Furthermore, the transformation and transport of elements by populations and communities of consumers also influences the flow of energy and nutrients across ecosystem boundaries. This review highlights that shifts in community composition or biomass of consumers and eco-evolutionary underpinnings can have strong effects on the functional role of consumers in ecosystem processes, yet these are relatively unexplored aspects of CND. Future research should evaluate the value of using species traits and abiotic conditions to predict and understand the effects of consumers on ecosystem-level nutrient dynamics across temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, new work in CND should strive to integrate knowledge from disparate fields of ecology and environmental science, such as physiology and ecosystem ecology, to develop a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the functional role of consumers. Comparative and experimental studies that develop testable hypotheses to challenge the current assumptions of CND, including consumer stoichiometric homeostasis, are needed to assess the significance of CND among species and across freshwater ecosystems. © 2016 Cambridge Philosophical Society","ecological stoichiometry; egestion; excretion; homeostasis; metabolic theory; nutrient recycling; nutrient storage; subsidy; trophic trait",,2-s2.0-85007289733

Each study showed there had been periods of increase in coral cover in the bay and showed that the rate of change in cover has been inversely dependent on the initial cover at a site. When coral cover is high on upper reef slopes, the fragile structure of reefs in this sheltered bay often collapses, resulting in a decrease in coral cover. The rate of change in coral cover was also inversely dependent on cover in one of the two studies that included analysis of reef-flat corals; the cause of decrease in cover in this habitat is thought to be attributable to particularly low sea levels in Hawai‘i in the late 1990s and 2009–2010. The inverse relationship between initial coral cover and change in cover, and the intersections of the regression lines of these variables with the x-axis at intermediate values of coral cover, is indicative of resilience in this ecosystem over the last 44 yr. In the 1970s, the invasive macroscopic green alga Dictyosphaeria cavernosa covered a high percentage of coral habitat and commonly displaced corals from the reef slope and outer reef flats; the change was cited as an example of a phase shift on a reef. This alga has virtually disappeared from the bay, thus increasing the space available to corals; its disappearance is coincident with the increase in coral cover.

With the aim of restoring their sensory and motor functions, theoretical and technological investigations have been carried out in the field of neuroprosthetic systems. For transmission of sensory feedback, several interfacing modalities including indirect (non-invasive), direct-to-peripheral-nerve (invasive), and cortical stimulation have been applied. Peripheral nerve interfaces demonstrate an edge over the cortical interfaces due to the sensitivity in attaining cortical brain signals. The peripheral nerve interfaces are highly dependent on interface designs and are required to be biocompatible with the nerves to achieve prolonged stability and longevity. Another criterion is the selection of nerves that allows minimal invasiveness and damages as well as high selectivity for a large number of nerve fascicles. In this paper, we review the nerve-machine interface modalities noted above with more focus on peripheral nerve interfaces, which are responsible for provision of sensory feedback. The invasive interfaces for recording and stimulation of electro-neurographic signals include intrafascicular, regenerative-type interfaces that provide multiple contact channels to a group of axons inside the nerve and the extra-neural-cuff-type interfaces that enable interaction with many axons around the periphery of the nerve. Section Current Prosthetic Technology summarizes the advancements made to date in the field of neuroprosthetics toward the achievement of a bidirectional nerve-machine interface with more focus on sensory feedback. In the Discussion section, the authors propose a hybrid interface technique for achieving better selectivity and long-term stability using the available nerve interfacing techniques.

The macrofouling community consisted of 93 sessile invertebrate species, of which 16 were NIS and five were cryptogenic. In both years non-indigenous species (NIS) recruitment occurred mainly in the quarter July/October in concert with the settlement of pioneer autochthonous species. This recruitment is independent of immersion time, occurring on both bare substrates and on previously colonized panels. This increase in NIS coverage is influenced by the development stage of the community, suggesting that NIS grow better without potential competitors. Two sets of NIS were distinguished. The first included abundant ascidians, serpulids, and bryozoans that are structuring components of early communities when favorable conditions exist (i.e. a lack of competitive autochthonous species). After settlement, these species are unable to develop in later-stage communities. The second set of NIS was composed of sabellid worms that settle in early and late communities but, unlike the other NIS, are able to persist and become dominant in late macrofouling communities independent of seasonal changes. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Alien species; Biological invasions; Macrofouling; Mediterranean sea",,2-s2.0-85032685420

As cities are hubs of anthropogenic activities, with both highly transformed and disturbed environments, these areas are often the first point of entry for alien species. We compiled a global database of cities with more than one million inhabitants that data had on alien species occurrence. We then identified the most prominent pathways of introduction and vectors of spread of alien species in these cities. Most species were intentionally introduced to cities and were released or escaped from confinement. The majority of alien species then spread within cities through natural means (primarily unaided dispersal). Pathway prominence varied across the taxonomic groups of alien species: the most prominent pathway for plants and vertebrates was the escape pathway; for invertebrates the stowaway and contaminant pathways were most likely to facilitate introductions. For some organisms, pathway prominence varied with the geographical and climatic characteristics of the city. The characteristics of the cities also influenced the prominence of vectors of spread for alien species. Preventing the natural spread of alien species within cities, and into adjacent natural environments will be, at best, difficult. To prevent invasions, both the intentional and unintentional introduction of potentially harmful alien species to cities must be prevented. The pathways of introduction and vectors of spread identified here should be prioritised for management. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Biological invasions; Pathways of introduction; Prioritisation; Urban invasions; Vectors of spread",,2-s2.0-85032658254

The massive rejection of refugees/asylum seekers taking place has made their conditions before, during and after flight, increasingly difficult and dangerous. This paper relates current xenophobia to historical attitudinal trends in Europe regarding Islam, and claims that a much more basic conflict is at work: the one between anti-modernism/traditionalism and modernism/globalization. Narratives on refugees often relate them to both the foreign (Islam) and to “trauma”. In an environment of insecurity and collective anxiety, refugees may represent something alien and frightening but also fascinating. I will argue that current concepts and theories about “trauma” or “the person with trauma” are insufficient to understand the complexity of the refugee predicament. Due to individual and collective countertransference reactions, the word “trauma” tends to lose its theoretical anchoring and becomes an object of projection for un-nameable anxieties. This disturbs relations to refugees at both societal and clinical levels and lays the groundwork for the poor conditions that they are currently experiencing. Historically, attitudes towards refugees fall somewhere along a continuum between compassion and rejection/dehumanization. At the moment, they seem much closer to the latter. I would argue that today’s xenophobia and/or xeno-racism reflect the fact that, both for individuals and for society, refugees have come to represent the Freudian Uncanny/das Unheimliche. © 2017 Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis","anti-modernism; Islamism; refugees; traumatization",,2-s2.0-85032704264

The success of H. axyridis as an invader is often attributed to weak control by natural enemies. In this paper, we provide an overview of current knowledge on predators and parasitoids of H. axyridis. The common feature of predators and parasitoids is that they directly kill exploited organisms. Currently available data show that H. axyridis, displaying a variety of chemical, mechanical, and microbiological anti-predator defenses, is usually avoided by predators. However, some birds and invertebrates can eat this ladybird without harmful consequences. The primary defenses of H. axyridis against parasitoids include immune response and physiological and nutritional unsuitability for parasitoid development. These defenses are probably relatively efficient against most ladybird parasitoids, but not against flies of the genus Phalacrotophora. The latter are idiobiont parasitoids and hence can evade the host’s immune response. Indeed, rates of parasitism of H. axyridis by Phalacrotophora in the Palaearctic region (both in the native range in Asia and in Europe) are relatively high. While strong evidence for enemy release on the invasive populations of H. axyridis is lacking, several cases of parasitoid acquisition have been recorded in Europe, North America, and South America. We conclude that enemy release cannot be excluded as a possible mechanism contributing to the spread and increase of H. axyridis in the early stages of invasion, but adaptation of parasitoids may lead to novel associations which might offset previous effects of enemy release. However, further work is required to elucidate the population-level effects of such interactions. © 2017 The Author(s)","biocontrol; Coccinellidae; Enemy acquisition; Enemy release; Natural enemies",,2-s2.0-85032671390

This study investigated trophic interrelationships between an alien predator, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and native omnivores, sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) and largescale yellowfish (Labeobarbus marequensis), in an invaded aquatic system to elucidate factors that might have aided their successful establishment. It tested the hypothesis that M. salmoides is able to co-exist with the two native omnivores by either utilising a previously vacant food niche or through niche complementarity. Gut content and stable isotope analyses were used to determine trophic interactions. There was no evidence that M. salmoides was utilising a previously vacant food niche but instead it occupied a restricted and specialised niche within a broad niche space utilised by the native omnivores. Differences in niche space and size have resulted in minimal niche overlaps that imply niche complementarity. The introduction of M. salmoides raises concerns about increases in predation pressure in the system. This, however, is difficult to ascertain because of complexities in measuring long-term trends in predator demands, abundance and community compensation mechanisms. There is a need for long-term monitoring of community structure, especially small-sized prey species that are vulnerable to increased predation pressure. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Food resource partitioning; Invasive species; Predation pressure; Stable isotopes",,2-s2.0-85032479038

We investigated the urbanization effect on bird communities in a growing South American city (Santa Fe, Argentina) and hypothesized that if habitat structure and human disturbance change along an urban gradient, the richness and abundance of trophic guilds should also vary accordingly. We placed 50 transects 100 m long × 50 m wide in five districts with different levels of urbanization, determined by habitat structure variables. We recorded the number and abundance of species and the amount of pedestrians and vehicles passing through each transect. We recorded 23% of all bird species known for the Santa Fe province and categorized them within 19 trophic guilds. The percentage of area covered by herbaceous vegetation, water bodies and trees and shrubs had a positive relationship with the richness and abundance of most of trophic guilds (hawking aerial, terrestrial, bark and foliage insectivores; terrestrial and generalized granivores; generalized, aquatic diving and foliage omnivores; hawking aerial, aquatic diving and striding carnivores; nectarivores; and aquatic filters). Pavement surface and human disturbance variables had a negative relationship with the richness, and high buildings and pavement surface had a positive relationship with the abundance of terrestrial omnivores and coursing aerial insectivores. Variation partitioning revealed that habitat structure and human disturbance were better predictors of the richness than the abundance of each trophic guild. Results showed that trophic guilds associated to vegetation strata were seen to increase their richness and abundance towards green areas, even if they presented generalist or specialist habits.

However, while large cities are usually the first sites of introduction, small towns are more numerous and have a greater chance of launching invasions into natural areas as they have proportionally larger interfaces with their surroundings. In this paper we develop a set of scenarios as hypotheses to explore the role of small towns in facilitating within-country dispersal of alien plants. In particular, we developed ten scenarios for how introductions to small towns, agricultural and natural areas can lead to landscape-scale invasions. We tested a part of these scenarios using a case study of a highly invaded region in South Africa (the Berg River catchment in the Western Cape). We specifically investigated the main plant invasion routes between 12 small towns and their surrounding agricultural and natural areas. This was accomplished by conducting urban-specific alien plant surveys in towns, then comparing these results to regional databases of naturalized and/or invasive plants. Many of the alien plants found in urban areas were listed as invasive or naturalized in the catchment (over 30% of the total alien species pool). Despite marked environmental gradients across the study area, we found no relationships between the alien plant species richness in towns and climatic variables or with levels of anthropogenic disturbances. All towns hosted large numbers of invasive plant species and nearly half of the alien species found in towns were naturalized or invasive in surrounding areas. The likelihood of alien plants being naturalized or invasive outside urban areas increased in proportion to their local abundance in towns and if they were tall and woody. Ornamental horticulture was the main reason for introduction of these alien species (69%). Small towns can and do harbour significant populations of plant taxa that are able to spread to surrounding natural areas to launch invasions. Comparing lists of species from urban alien plant surveys with those from naturalisation records for the region is a useful protocol for identifying species which may be moving along the introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Alien plants; Gardens; Horticulture; Invasion pathway; Invasive species; Mode of introduction; Small towns; Urban ecosystems; Urban invasions",,2-s2.0-85032186085

The fouling communities, consisting of 21 families, were distinct between habitats, but not between polymer types. Positive primary production was measured in the pelagic, but not in the benthic habitat, suggesting that large accumulations of floating plastic could pose a source of oxygen for local ecosystems, as well as a carbon sink.

Several studies have identified a number of biological and ecological drivers that contribute to the establishment of plant species in the invaded range. One long-term factor that is generally accepted as a relevant determinant of invasion success is residence time, or time since first introduction into the new region. Residence time is often an important correlate of range extent in the invaded region, such that alien species with longer residence times in the novel environment tend to be more widely distributed. Plant species that were introduced in different regions at different times provide a unique opportunity to examine the effect of residence time on invasion success. In this paper, we examined how residence time affects the beta diversity of alien plants in selected urban floras of New Zealand and of English and Irish cities. We used an intercontinental plant exchange as a model system, comparing groups of species introduced to New Zealand and to the British Isles at different times (i.e., species native to the British Isles, British archaeophytes and British neophytes) and asked if differences in their beta diversity can be related to differences in their residence times. Our results suggest that observed patterns of beta diversity among the urban floras of New Zealand and of English and Irish cities can be attributed to a combination of residence time and of pre-adaptation to urban habitats that evolved, or were filtered in association with human activities, before the species were introduced into the invaded range. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Archaeophytes; Cities; Date of naturalization; Invasion; Neophytes; Pre-adaptation to urban habitats; Urban invasions",,2-s2.0-85032026426

The presence of HDPE wax is essential for lowering melt viscosity at high UHMWPE content. Since HDPE wax crystallizes onto extended-chain UHMWPE shish to form kebab structures, high HDPE wax content is tolerated without encountering emission problems and impairing mechanical properties as observed in the absence of UHMWPE. This in situ reinforcement substantially improves HDPE toughness/stiffness/strength balance as reflected by simultaneously increased Young's modulus (+365%), tensile strength (+392%), and impact resistance (+197%). The performance of self-reinforced polyethylene (PE-SRC) is far superior to that of melt-blended UHMWPE/HDPE and the majority of PE nanocomposites. Neither hazardous UHMWPE nanoparticles nor alien inorganic nanofillers are required. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Additives; Elastic moduli; Ethylene; Injection molding; Nanostructures; Polyethylenes; Reinforcement; Silica; Tensile strength; Ethylene polymerization; High density polyethylene(HDPE); Molar mass distribution; Oriented crystallization; Polyethylene composites; Polyethylene reactors; Polyethylene waxes; Self-reinforcement; High density polyethylenes",2-s2.0-85032001915

Compressed cortical neurons remodel their dendrites instantly. The effects on axons however remain unclear. Using a rat epidural bead implantation model, we studied the effects of unilateral somatosensory cortical compression on its transcallosal projection and the reversibility of the changes following decompression. Compression reduced the density, branching profuseness and boutons of the projection axons in the contralateral homotopic cortex 1 week and 1 month post-compression. Projection fiber density was higher 1-month than 1-week post-compression, suggesting adaptive temporal changes. Compression reduced contralateral cortical synaptophysin, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) expressions in a week and the first two marker proteins further by 1 month. βIII-tubulin and kinesin light chain (KLC) expressions in the corpus callosum (CC) where transcallosal axons traveled were also decreased. Kinesin heavy chain (KHC) level in CC was temporarily increased 1 week after compression. Decompression increased transcallosal axon density and branching profuseness to higher than sham while bouton density returned to sham levels. This was accompanied by restoration of synaptophysin, VGLUT1 and PSD95 expressions in the contralateral cortex of the 1-week, but not the 1-month, compression rats. Decompression restored βIII-tubulin, but not KLC and KHC expressions in CC. However, KLC and KHC expressions in the cell bodies of the layer II/III pyramidal neurons partially recovered.

We identified a critical role for the scaffolding protein Cnk (connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras) in this signaling pathway. Embryos that ectopically expressed the minimal Alk interaction region in the carboxyl terminus of Cnk or lacked maternal and zygotic cnk did not generate visceral founder cells or a functional gut musculature, phenotypes that resemble those of jeb and Alk mutants. Deletion of the entire Alk-interacting region in the cnk locus affected the Alk signaling pathway in the visceral mesoderm and not other RTK signaling pathways in other tissues. In addition, the Cnk-interacting protein Aveugle (Ave) was critical for Alk signaling in the developing visceral mesoderm. Alk signaling stimulates the MAPK/ERK pathway, but the scaffolding protein Ksr, which facilitates activation of this pathway, was not required to promote visceral founder cell specification. Thus, Cnk andAve represent critical molecules downstream of Alk, and their loss genocopies the lack of visceral founder cell specification of Alk and jeb mutants, indicating their essential roles in Alk signaling. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-85032206277

People living in these environments have specific needs and demands in terms of ecosystem services (ES). Urban ecosystems are transformed in many ways by human activities and their floras comprise a high proportion of alien plant species, many of which were intentionally introduced to provide, augment or restore ES. Urban environments also have novel disturbance regimes and provide colonization sites for the establishment, dispersal and proliferation of alien plant species; such conditions often generate biological invasions which may cause marked changes to ES. We review the roles that alien plants play in providing urban ES and ecosystem disservices (EDS) globally. We identify the main ES and EDS associated with alien plants, and highlight the key species involved. A literature search revealed 335 papers, representing studies in 58 cities or urban areas in 27 countries. These studies recorded 337 alien plant species, contributing to 39 different ES and 27 EDS–310 species were recorded as contributing to ES and 53 species to EDS. A small number of alien plant taxa were frequently recorded as providing multiple ES in many urban ecosystems; the 10 most recorded species accounted for 21% of the ES recorded. Some of these species also result in significant EDS; three species accounted for 30% of the EDS recorded. Cultural services (notably aesthetics) are the most reported ES provided by alien plants in urban areas of developed countries, while provisioning services (notably food production) are most reported in developing countries. The most commonly studied EDS provided by alien plants is the impact on human health (notably allergic reactions). Eighty percent of studies on alien plants and ES and EDS have been done in developed countries. To elucidate the full range of effects of alien plants, more work is needed in developing countries. Urban planners and managers need to be mindful of both the positive and negative impacts of alien plant species to maximise the provision of ES. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Ailanthus altissima; Biological invasions; Developed and developing countries; Human health; Planning and management; Plant invasions; Tree invasions; Urban ecosystems; Urbanisation",,2-s2.0-85031904578

In spite of this phenomenon having a psychodynamic nosography and descriptive models that effectively reveal it in detail, mental alienation is still mysterious and unsettling, especially when it manifests all of a sudden in clinical work. Alienating withdrawal into sensory fantasizing, which causes increasing loss of contact with human reality, is often preceded by a long period of time spent in a dissociated world that has gradually replaced psychic reality. However, prior to the human world being completely replaced by the alien world, both worlds coexisted for a considerable length of time in the patient’s mind. My hypothesis is that the dissociation from psychic reality that underlies the future state of psychotic alienation occurs in psychic withdrawal that begins in infancy.

Negative impacts can be particularly severe when caused by floating aquatic plants, which can reduce access to freshwater for extraction and navigation, reduce the harvest of fish and other resources, and change water cycling and chemistry. This paper reviews and discusses some of these impacts globally and then concentrates on the case study of Wular Lake, India. Wular is the largest freshwater lake in Jammu and Kashmir state and is highly important for local livelihoods through the provision of a range of services, including fish and edible aquatic plants, and water to local communities. The supply of these services has decreased due to a long history of environmental degradation, and recent invasions by the floating plants Azolla cristata and Alternanthera philoxerodies (alligator weed) have further impacted human well-being. Here, we review the published literature about these invasions, present information from interviews with locals living near Wular Lake, and review the global literature about invasive floating plant species to assess the present and predict the future impacts of these species. We find that the implications of these invasions for livelihoods reliant on lake resources and services provide good justification for management efforts.

The island is covered mainly by Atlantic Forest (Dense Ombrophilous Forest), as well as with rock outcrop and anthropogenic vegetation with herbaceous-shrub phytophysiognomies. QGI showed relatively low species richness (S = 125) when compared to other Brazilian coastal islands. Herbaceous (52) and climbing species (31) predominated on QGI. The richest families were Fabaceae (11 species), Poaceae (9), and Apocynaceae, Asteraceae and Orchidaceae (8 species each). Most species (S = 112) are autochthonous from different phytophysiognomies of the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest complex. Many species associated with anthropically disturbed areas (S = 26) can be found on QGI, including the invasive grass Melinis minutiflora. There was a slight predominance of zoochory (S = 50). We did not identify any species endemic to QGI. One of its species (Cattleya intermedia, Orchidaceae) is vulnerable at both national and regional levels, and another (Barrosoa apiculata, Asteraceae) is presumably extinct on the mainland in São Paulo State. The vascular flora of QGI originated from the mainland Atlantic Forest complex, following the pattern of other coastal islands in southeastern Brazil. The flora and vegetation of QGI reflect the combination of insular conditions, the small size of the island, habitat restriction, steep topography, incipient soils, and the past use of the area with the introduction of several foreign species. We recommend permanent monitoring of the vegetation cover of QGI and its management, in order to ensure the conservation of the local native biota. © 2017 Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

Using both archival and secondary evidence mainly from Southern Rhodesia and South Africa, it argues that the history of Southern Africa’s labor consciousness from the early to mid-twentieth century can be enriched by exploring the place of Nyasa migrants in shaping anti-colonial processes across the region. Nyasa migrants, a product of the colonial labor migration system (chibaro/mthandizi), laid the foundations for, and influenced trade unionism in the region, especially between 1910 and 1960. The colonial wage economy created ambiguities of dependence for Africans forcing many into a migrant and capitalist world laden with dilemmas, tightropes, and frustrations that fueled social movements. Malawian migrants who were at the core of such movements within a regional colonial economic system, gained a reputation for being ‘ringleaders and troublemakers’ to the colonial governments. Existing literature has not fully historicized the centrality of Nyasas in molding this critical episode of Southern African history. The historiography has dealt with these dynamics in an ad hoc manner, approaching this Nyasa ‘annoyance’ on a national basis, without drawing on the underlying regional connections. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Labor migration; Nyasaland; proto-nationalism; Rhodesia; South Africa; Southern Africa; transnational labor movements",,2-s2.0-85024374160

Recently, a possible range expansion of this invasive species to the more eastern parts of the Baltic Sea has been discussed. T. navalis larval settlement was therefore monitored at the distribution boundary of the species in the Baltic Sea over a period of 4 years. At 7 stations along the prevailing salinity gradient on the Mecklenburg-western Pomeranian coast, larval traps were installed at regular time intervals, while at the same time water temperature and salinity were measured continuously every hour. Correlations between measured abiotic parameters and borehole abundance of T. navalis were tested. For the German Baltic Sea coast, no range expansion of T. navalis was confirmed.

In Greece, evidence of resistance to the pyrethroid tau-fluvalinate goes back to the early 1990s. In the present study we examined the presence of resistance mutations at the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene, encoding the target of pyrethroids. The frequency of resistance mutations was examined by genotyping 113 V. destructor individuals from seven localities in Greece The nucleotide sequencing of the IIS4-IIS5 region of the VGSC gene revealed two amino acid replacements at position 925: a leucine to valine substitution (L925 V) and a leucine to isoleucine substitution (L925I). This is the first report of L925I mutation in European populations of V. destructor that has so far been identified only in USA. No mutations at two other “hot spot” resistance positions, 918 and 929 of the VGSC gene encompassing position 925 were identified. Resistant alleles were predominant (53%) and most of them (83%) corresponded to the L925I substitution. Genotyping results showed the presence of homozygous wild type 925L (44.2%) individuals as well as homozygous resistant 925I (39.8%) and 925 V (7.1%), while heterozygous individuals (925I/L, 925I/V, 925 V/L) were present at low frequency (5.3, 2.7 and 0.9 respectively).

Since such conflicts can hamper proposed management actions, managers, decision makers and researchers increasingly recognize the need to consider the social dimensions of invasive species management. In this exploratory study, we aimed (1) to explore whether species’ taxonomic position (i.e. animals vs. plants) and type of invaded landscape (i.e. urban vs. non-urban) might influence public perception about the management of invasive species, and (2) to assess the potential of public awareness to increase public support for invasive species management. We reviewed the scientific literature on the conflicts of interest around the management of alien species and administered two-phased questionnaires (before and after providing information on the target species and its management) to members of the public in South Africa and the UK (n = 240). Our review suggests that lack of public support for the management of invasive animals in both urban and non-urban areas derives mainly from moralistic value disagreements, while the management of invasive plants in non-urban areas mostly causes conflicts based on utilitarian value disagreements. Despite these general trends, conflicts are context dependent and can originate from a wide variety of different views. Notably, informing the public about the invasive status and negative impacts of the species targeted for management appeared to increase public support for the management actions. Therefore, our results align with the view that increased public awareness might increase the public support for the management of invasive species, independent of taxonomic position and type of landscape. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Alien species; Attitudes; Non-native species; Public opposition; Public perception",,2-s2.0-85031790792

This is related to specific attributes of urban areas including the availability of natural resources and habitats (namely geological substrates and land cover), the dispersal pathways and associated propagule pressure due to trade and traffic, and the proximity many urban hubs have to rivers. Here we explored how richness and proportions of alien species introduced after the discovery of the Americas (so-called neophytes), can be explained by environmental covariates along the urbanization gradient from very rural to very urbanized grid cells. We tested whether there is a specific urban effect, either as an interaction effect of urbanized areas that changes these general relationships, or if there is an effect due to specific urban conditions. We found that the environmental covariates explaining richness as well as proportions of neophytes remain largely the same across the rural–urban gradient. There is, however, an effect of urbanized area on neophyte species richness and proportions, which also incorporates strictly urban conditions. Rivers, roads and railroads contribute disproportionately less to the increase of neophyte species diversity in more urbanized areas, which might be due to the already higher number of neophytes in cities. We argue that the conditions determining neophyte richness in cities are not fundamentally different from those in rural environments, but extend on the same environmental axis, i.e. having different positions along the gradient towards the upper end. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Cities; Environmental covariates; Generalized estimating equations; Neophytes; Species richness",,2-s2.0-85031502380

In this study, we assessed how human disturbance and invasion by Carpobrotus edulis impact the soils and the establishment of native flora in the north-western coastal regions of Spain. We compared soil characteristics (pH, conductivity, water content, nutrients and enzymatic activities) and native plant as well as C. edulis fitness correlates (germination and early growth) between uninvaded and invaded soils from urban and natural coastal dune areas. We found that human disturbance impacts coastal soils by increasing organic matter and water content, modifying soil nutrients and cycles, and reducing the pH in urban soils. The presence of invasive C. edulis further increases these impacts. These changes in soil characteristics allow for the establishment of the native, but ruderal, Scolymus hispanicus and non-native C. edulis, both of which are not adapted to the typically limiting conditions of coastal dunes. In some instances, the coastal dune endemic, Malcolmia littorea, showed no fitness effects in response to urbanization or the presence of C. edulis.

Many species are well established whereas others are still in the early stages of invasion. The management of invasive species is most cost effective at the early stages of invasion; it is thus essential to target and contain naturalizing invaders before they spread across the landscape. Multi-scale species distribution models (SDMs) provide useful insights to managers; they combine species-occurrence observations with climatic variables to predict potential distributions of alien species. Applying SDMs in human-dominated ecosystems is complicated because many factors associated with human actions interact in complex ways with climatic and edaphic factors to determine the potential suitability of sites for species. The aim of this study was to determine the degree to which a worldwide invader, A. altissima (Simaroubaceae) has occupied its potential range in South Africa, to identify areas at risk of future invasion. To do this we built a set of SDMs at both global and country scales using climatic, land use and human-footprint data. Climatic data best explained the distribution of A. altissima at the global scale whereas variables reflecting human-mediated disturbances were most influential at the national scale. Our analyses show the importance of human-mediated disturbances at a global scale and human occupancy at a country scale in determining the range limits of A. altissima. Populations of this tree species are already present in most parts of South Africa that are environmentally suitable for the species, and management actions need to focus on preventing increases in density in these areas. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Biological invasions; Early stages of invasion; Ensemble models; Invasive species; Range filling; Species distribution models; Spread potential; Tree invasions; Urban invasions",,2-s2.0-85031917768

Although most introduced ornamental garden-plant species are locally not naturalized yet, many of them have shown invasion potential elsewhere in the world, and might naturalize when climate changes. We inventoried the planted flora of 50 public and 61 private gardens in Radolfzell, a small city in southern Germany, to investigate whether local naturalization success of garden plants is associated with their current planting frequency, climatic suitability (as assessed with climatic niche modelling) and known naturalization status somewhere in the world. We identified 954 introduced garden-plant species, of which 48 are already naturalized in Radolfzell and 120 in other parts of Germany. All currently naturalized garden plants in Radolfzell have a climatic suitability probability of ≥ 0.75 and are naturalized in ≥ 13 out of 843 regions globally. These values are significantly higher than those of garden plants that have not become locally naturalized yet. Current planting frequencies, however, were not related to current naturalization success. Using the identified local naturalization thresholds of climatic suitability and global naturalization frequency, and climate projections for the years 2050 and 2070, we identified 45 garden-plant species that are currently not naturalized in Radolfzell but are likely to become so in the future.

Such conditions provide non-native species with opportunities to establish and spread through “urban green areas” (UGAs). UGAs can serve as stepping stones for many alien species to recruit and may become sources of propagules to launch invasions in adjoining natural ecosystems. There is great diversity in the spatial structures of UGAs worldwide; these are determined by the city’s level of development, human density, urban planning policy, and history. We explore the invasion risks of, and the potential of invasive spread in, UGAs in the world’s 100 most populous cities (in 40 countries). Based on maps of enhanced vegetation index at 250 m resolution over the extent of 25 by 25 km for each city centre, we simulate the invasion and spread of a reference species (a virtual ruderal invasive species) from the city centre into surrounding urban or rural areas. Doing so allowed us to provide an objective baseline for comparing urban susceptibility to such invasions across diverse cultures, histories and societies. We derive the global ranking of invasive spread potential for each city based on the rate of spread of the reference species, and the ranking of 40 countries, based on the average rate of spread in their cities. We explore correlates of spread rates after 100 time steps (years) by examining the roles of climate (mean annual temperature and rainfall), human demography (city population size and growth rate), and socio-economic indicators [human footprint, human development index and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita]. Small city population size and high GDP per capita are the only significant predictors of high potential for invasive spread.

Sequences of COI and 16S revealed the presence of two cryptic species. One of them exhibits a wide distribution range (∼14,000 km), very low level of genetic diversity and a high frequency of shared haplotypes along sampled sites. The genetic pattern indicates that this species has probably been introduced in all sampled sites, and its wide distribution is associated to human-mediated transport. In addition, the great capability of T. punctata to reproduce by fragmentation makes the colonization process easier. Thus, the number of alien polychaete species is probably underestimated and future studies are necessary to reach a more realistic perspective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alien species; Asexual reproduction; Mitochondrial DNA; Phylogeography","asexual reproduction; benthos; biological invasion; colonization; crypsis; detection method; fragmentation; genetic differentiation; introduced species; phylogeography; polychaete; Atlantic Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Annelida; Cirratulidae; Polychaeta; Timarete",2-s2.0-85032644311

Each spring and summer, 2011–2014, percent cover of each plant species in 50 × 20 cm subplots was recorded.

Removal of forest floors and, to a lesser degree, compaction significantly altered plant and fungal communities. There was no effect of retaining logging slash but a consistent influence of tree species on biotic communities likely due to initial differences in conifer growth rates. Average community dissimilarity of the 3 guilds from a least disturbed baseline (tree bole removal, no compaction) increased linearly by a small amount (4–6%) with each level of disturbance severity. Some degree of soil disturbance across landscapes can be acceptable in creating regeneration niches for rare and functionally important pioneer species, but we also see losses in ecological integrity, such as the spread of invasive plants, that merit concern in managing these ecosystems. © 2017","Boreal indicators; Compaction; Disturbance; Hieracium; Whole-tree harvest","Buildings; Compaction; Ecology; Ecosystems; Floors; Fungi; Housing; Natural resources; Plants (botany); Reforestation; Soil mechanics; Soils; Community dissimilarities; Disturbance; Ecological integrity; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Full factorial experiment; Hieracium; Organic matter removal; Whole-tree harvest; Forestry; beetle; bioindicator; boreal forest; compaction; coniferous tree; ecosystem function; ectomycorrhiza; environmental disturbance; environmental factor; experimental study; forest ecosystem; forest floor; forest soil; fungus; herb; microbial community; organic matter; regeneration; understory; vulnerability; British Columbia; Canada; Coleoptera; Coniferophyta; Fungi; Hieracium; Picea; Picea glauca; Pinus contorta",2-s2.0-85026830467

Larvae of the Neotropical specialist moth Utetheisa ornatrix (Erebidae: Arctiinae) can feed on unripe seeds and leaves of both native and nonnative Crotalaria species (Fabaceae). Despite some species being able to eat nonnative plants, such behavior can impair the herbivore, as they are not adapted to the alien plant, and still contribute to the success of the nonnative species via enemy release. We tested the performance of the moth from hatching to adulthood fed on two native (C. micans and C. paulina) and two nonnative (C. pallida, C. juncea) host plants. Utetheisa ornatrix performed better (lower development time, heavier pupae and more eggs) on the native host plants than in the nonnative. However, larva performance in nonnative C. pallida was similar to that in the native host plants. Using the larval weight 7 days after hatching from the eggs as a proxy for performance in twelve Crotalaria species (five Neotropical natives, four nonnatives from Afrotropical region, and three nonnatives from India), we found similar results. Crotalaria nutritional compounds, the defensive pyrrolizidine alkaloids and Crotalaria phylogeny did not explain moth performance. Our results give some support to the ERH. The good moth performance in nonnative C. pallida may be related to its high availability as host plant for U. ornatrix, and its longer time since their introduction in Neotropics which would provide opportunity for the moth to adapt. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Crotalaria; Crotalaria pallida; Enemy release hypothesis; Pyrrolizidine alkaloids; Specialist; Utetheisa ornatrix",,2-s2.0-85031422205

Respondents were asked to document the number and frequency of sightings of unconfined animals, evidence for environmental harm, and the resulting “degree of concern” in their respective jurisdictions.

Invaders generally are at the resource acquisitive end of functional global plant trait variation and in low-resource savanna environments we might expect that successful invaders will only outperform native species under resource rich or highly disturbed conditions. However, invaders may also directly exploit resource stressed environments using resource conservative traits in some situations. It’s also possible that successful invaders and native species largely overlap in their trait profiles indicating site specific environmental factors are responsible for invader success in particular contexts rather than a general trait and functional divergence between invaders and native species. To address these various hypotheses, we compared a suite of morphological and physiological traits in graminoid and herbaceous native and co-occurring invasive plant species across a range of habitats in savannas of the Kimberley region of northern Australia. Invader grass species had traits associated with resource acquisition and fast growth rates, such as high SLA and leaf nutrient contents. In contrast, dominant native perennial grasses had traits characteristic of resource conservation and slow growth in resource stressed conditions. Trait profiles among invasive forbs and legumes exhibited stress tolerant traits relative to their native counterparts. Invaders also displayed strong divergence in reproductive traits, suggesting diverse responses to disturbance not indicated by leaf economic traits alone. These results suggest that savannas may be resistant to invaders with resource acquisitive traits due to their strong resource limitation. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Disturbance; Plant functional traits; Plant invaders; Plant resources; Plant strategies; Universal leaf trait economic spectrum",,2-s2.0-85031410434

The effect of flooding events on terrestrial and aquatic microbial communities is, however, less well understood. They may respond to the changed abiotic properties of their native habitat, and the native community may change due to the introduction of alien species. We designed an experiment to investigate the effect of five different flooding durations on the terrestrial and aquatic communities of eukaryotic microorganism, using the AquaFlow mesocosms. With amplicon sequencing of the small subunit (SSU) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA gene regions, we analyzed community compositions directly before and after flooding. Subsequently, they were monitored for another 28 days, to determine the sustainability of community changes. Our results revealed a temporary increase in similarity between terrestrial and aquatic communities according to OTU composition (operational taxonomic unit, serves as a proxy for species). Increased similarity was mainly caused by the transmission of OTUs from water to soil. A minority of these were able to persist in soil until the end of the experiment. By contrast, the vast majority of soil OTUs was not transmitted to water. Flooding duration affected the community structure (abundance) more than composition (occurrence). Terrestrial communities responded immediately to flooding and the flooding duration influenced the community changes. Independent from flooding duration, all terrestrial communities recovered largely after flooding, indicating a remarkable resilience to the applied disturbances. Aquatic communities responded immediately to the applied inundations too. At the end of the experiment, they grouped according to the applied flooding duration and the amount of ammonium and chloride that leached from the soil. This indicates a sustained long-term response of the aquatic communities to flooding events. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC","Aquatic eukaryotes; Flooding duration; High-throughput sequencing; Mesocosm experiment; Metabarcoding; Terrestrial eukaryotes",,2-s2.0-85031397558

Archeological and historical evidence indicated the presence of this species in Southeast Asia dating back at least 1500 years. B. flabellifer is believed to be originated in Africa, spread to South Asia and introduced into Southeast Asia through commercial routes and dissemination of cultures, however, the nature of its invasion and settlement in Thailand is unclear. Results: Here, we analyzed genetic data of 230 B. flabellifer accessions across Thailand using 17 EST-SSR and 12 gSSR polymorphic markers. Clustering analysis revealed that the population consisted of two genetic clusters (STRUCTURE K = 2). Cluster I is found mainly in southern Thailand, while Cluster II is found mainly in the northeastern. Those found in the central are of an extensive mix between the two. These two clusters are in moderate differentiation (F ST = 0.066 and N M = 3.532) and have low genetic diversity (HO = 0.371 and 0.416; AR = 2.99 and 3.19, for the cluster I and II respectively). The minimum numbers of founders for each genetic group varies from 3 to 4 individuals, based on simulation using different allele frequency assumptions. These numbers coincide with that B. flabellifer is dioecious, and a number of seeds had to be simultaneously introduced for obtaining both male and female founders. Conclusions: From these data and geographical and historical evidence, we hypothesize that there were at least two different invasive events of B. flabellifer in Thailand. B. flabellifer was likely brought through the Straits of Malacca to be propagated in the southern Thailand as one of the invasive events before spreading to the central Thailand. The second event likely occurred in Khmer Empire, currently Cambodia, before spreading to the northeastern Thailand. © 2017 The Author(s).","Arecaceae; Expressed sequence tag- simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR); Genetic diversity; Genomic-simple sequence repeat (genomic SSR); Microsatellite marker; Minimum founder","adult; Borassus flabellifer; Cambodia; case report; dioecy; DNA polymorphism; expressed sequence tag; female; gene frequency; genetic variability; human; male; microsatellite marker; nonhuman; plant seed; simple sequence repeat; simulation; Thailand",2-s2.0-85030830755

Decapoda represents the most species-rich order among crustaceans and, despite its ecological and economic importance, little is known about decapod karyology. We aim at cytogenetically characterizing two sympatric prawn species. Results: Analysis of mitotic metaphases and meiotic diakinesis of the common prawn Palaemon serratus and the rockpool prawn P. elegans, revealed considerable differences between their karyotypes including chromosome numbers and sex determination systems. The cytogenetic data for P. serratus showed a diploid number of 56 and the putative absence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. However, the diploid chromosome number in P. elegans was 90 for females and 89 for males. The karyotype of the females consisted of the three largest acrocentric pairs and 42 submetacentric and metacentric pairs, while the karyotype of the males comprised a clearly identifiable large metacentric chromosome and two acrocentric pairs as well as the smaller 42 pairs. These results highlight the presence of the X1X1X2X2/X1X2Y multiple sex chromosome system in P. elegans, which constitute the only sexual system for Decapoda reported cytogenetically using modern techniques. The origin of this sex chromosome system is discussed. We hypothesize that the chromosome evolution within the genus could involve several fusion events giving rise to a reduction on the chromosome number in P. serratus. In both species, the major ribosomal genes were located in two chromosome pairs and hybridization signals of the telomeric sequences (TTAGGG)n were visualized at the telomeres of all chromosomes. C-banding revealed that, when present, constitutive heterochromatin had a predominantly telomeric distribution and no centromeric constitutive heterochromatin was observed. Conclusions: Although more comparative cytogenetic analyses are needed to clarify our hypotheses, the findings of this work indicate that the prawns of the genus Palaemon represent a promising model among Decapoda representatives to investigate the karyotype evolution and the patterns of sex chromosome differentiation. © 2017 The Author(s).","Comparative cytogenetics; Decapoda; FISH; Karyotype; Palaemon elegans; Palaemon serratus; Sex chromosomes",,2-s2.0-85030849080

Several methods have been discussed to control populations of invasive fish including the release of YY-males. YY-males are fish that have 2 male chromosomes compared to a XY-male. When YY-males mate, they only produce male (XY) offspring. This decreases the female proportion of the population and can, in theory, eradicate local populations by biasing the sex-ratio. YY-males have been used as a population control tool for brook trout in montane streams and lakes in Idaho, USA. The YY-male control method has been discussed for grass carp in Lake Erie, North America. We developed and presented an integral projection model for grass carp to model the use of YY-males as a control method for populations in this lake. Using only the YY-male control method, we found that high levels of YY-males would need to be release annually to control the species. Specifically, these levels were the same order of magnitude as the baseline adult population (e.g., 1000 YY-males needed to be released annual for 20 years to control a baseline adult population of 2500 grass carp).

A general model of energy pyramids based on a fruitful but simple analytical connection between ecology and conventional physics has been proposed by Rodríguez et al. (2015a). However, this model has several drawbacks. Among them: it has only been tested for isolated taxocenes and under stationary ecological conditions (SEC). Besides, it has not been tested if the internal distribution of typical species groups within the obtained pyramids follows the expected pattern according to the well-known trophic habits of these typical groups of species. This article starts with a brief summary of the most relevant drawbacks of our conventional point of view about trophic pyramids in order to highlight the differences, as well as the advantageous coincidences, of the above-mentioned new model in comparison with our orthodox point of view about trophic pyramids. This summary connects with a description of the obstacles that should be surpassed in order to develop a more general model (i) valid at the inter-taxocene scale and (ii) fully useful to model systems under non-stationary ecological conditions (NSEC). The article proposes two simple mathematical modifications of the original model in order to achieve items (i) and (ii). In subsequent sections, the effectiveness of these modifications is tested by using field data from 25 samplings belonging to 6 different taxocenes, by including a majority of zooplankton data from a human-made highly eutrophic reservoir (Acton Lake; Hueston Woods State Park, Ohio, U.S.A.) with frequent and contingent episodes of NSEC. According to our results, it is not possible to reject either the hypothesis about the validity of modifying the original equation to model ecosystems as a whole under NSEC or the hypothesis that typical species groups follow a distribution within their respective pyramid in agreement with the expected pattern according to their trophic habits. In summary, this article is an additional step in favor of the usefulness of rescuing and expanding the original epistemological roots of ecosystem ecology in connection with conventional physics. © 2017","Ecological pyramids; Ecological state equation; Ecosystem ecology; Organic biophysics of ecosystems; Partition function; Physics","Ecology; Equations of state; Physics; Population distribution; Reservoirs (water); Ecological conditions; Ecological pyramids; Ecological state; Ecosystem ecologies; Environmental influences; Eutrophic reservoirs; Non-stationary condition; Partition functions; Ecosystems; biophysics; ecological approach; ecosystem modeling; food chain; manmade structure; physics; reservoir; trophic status; zooplankton; Acton Lake; Hueston Woods State Park; Ohio; United States",2-s2.0-85028505440

On the other hand, weaker superflares may play a positive role in enabling the origin of life through the formation of key organic compounds. Superflares could also prove to be quite detrimental to the evolution of complex life on present-day Mars and exoplanets in the habitable zone of M- and K-dwarfs. We conclude that the risk posed by superflares has not been sufficiently appreciated, and that humanity might potentially witness a superflare event in the next ∼103 years, leading to devastating economic and technological losses.

We found that unmated adults survived cold better than mated ones. Among mated individuals, those that had not reproduced survived better than those that had reproduced. After cold stress, formerly unmated females were mated, and we evaluated their ability to reproduce. Females that reproduced prior to cold stress were less likely to reproduce after cold stress than females from the other treatments.

For this purpose, a dithiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-based immunoassay previously performed on maleimide plates (mELISA) has been adapted to gold electrode arrays for the development of an electrochemical immunosensor for TTX. The electrochemical SAM-based immunosensor designed herein, provided an oriented, stable and spaced sensing platform for the determination of TTX, attaining a limit of detection of 2.6 ng mL−1. The applicability of the biosensor array was demonstrated by the accurate quantifications obtained in the analysis of different tissues of several puffer fish species (Lagocephalus lagocephalus, L. sceleratus and Sphoeroides pachygaster) caught along the Mediterranean coast of Spain. The good agreements found between the TTX concentrations determined by the immunosensor array platforms and those determined by mELISA, surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensor and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis, proved the feasibility of the approach. The electrochemical immunosensor enables the determination of TTXs at levels as low as 0.07 mg TTX equiv. kg−1 tissue, thus, well below the Japanese value of 2 mg TTX equiv. kg−1 tissue used as a criterion to consider puffer fish safe for consumption. Compared to the colorimetric SAM-based approach, the immunosensor array described herein shows promise towards the development of disposable, portable and compact analysis tools applicable in monitoring programs for the surveillance of fishery products. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dithiol; Electrochemical immunosensor array; Food safety; Puffer fish; Self-assembled monolayer; Tetrodotoxin","Colorimetric analysis; Fish; Food safety; Health risks; Immunosensors; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Molecular interactions; Monolayers; Risk assessment; Self assembled monolayers; Surface plasmon resonance; Tissue; Accurate quantifications; Dithiols; ELectrochemical detection; Electrochemical immunosensors; Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometries; Puffer fishes; Surface plasmon resonance immunosensors; Tetrodotoxin; Chemical detection; dithiol derivative; self assembled monolayer; tetrodotoxin; animal tissue; Article; colorimetry; controlled study; desorption; electrochemical detection; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; food safety; Lagocephalus lagocephalus; Lagocephalus sceleratus; limit of detection; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nonhuman; priority journal; puffer fish; Spain; Sphoeroides pachygaster; surface plasmon resonance",2-s2.0-85026737470

Several artificial trap designs to attract and capture EAB beetles have been developed to detect, delineate, and monitor infestations. Double-decker (DD) traps consist of two corrugated plastic prisms, one green and one purple, attached to a 3 m tall polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe supported by a t-post. The green prism at the top of the PVC pipe is baited with cis-3- hexenol, a compound produced by ash foliage. Surfaces of both prisms are coated with sticky insect glue to capture adult EAB beetles. Doubledecker traps should be placed near ash trees but in open areas, exposed to sun. Double-decker trap construction and placement are presented here, along with a summary of field experiments demonstrating the efficacy of DD traps in capturing EAB beetles. In a recent study in sites with relatively low EAB densities, double-decker traps captured significantly more EAB than green or purple prism traps or green funnel traps, all of which are designed to be suspended from a branch in the canopy of ash trees.

In some cases, these experiences include pain that can be alleviated by “mirror therapy.” Mirror therapy consists of superimposing a mirrored image of the moving intact limb onto the phantom limb. This therapy provides a closed loop between the motor command to the amputated limb and its predicted visual feedback. This loop is also involved in the sense of agency, a feeling of controlling one’s own body. However, it is unclear how mirror therapy is related to the sense of agency over a phantom limb. Using mirror therapy, we investigated phantom limb pain and the senses of agency and ownership (i.e., a feeling of having one’s own body) of the phantom limb. Nine upper-limb amputees, five of whom reported recent phantom limb pain, underwent a single 15-min trial of mirror therapy. Before and after the trial, the participants completed a questionnaire regarding agency, ownership, and pain related to their phantom limb. They reported that the sense of agency over the phantom limb increased following the mirror therapy trial, while the ownership slightly increased but not as much as did the agency. The reported pain did not change; that is, it was comparably mild before and after the trial. These results suggest that short-term mirror therapy can, at least transiently, selectively enhance the sense of agency over a phantom limb, but may not alleviate phantom limb pain. © 2017 Imaizumi, Asai and Koyama.","Agency; Amputation; Mirrored visual feedback; Ownership; Pain; Phantom limb; Sensorimotor and multisensory integration",,2-s2.0-85032034625

However, few studies have considered the local scale of urban forests to effectively evaluate their potential long-term carbon offset. The lack of precise, consistent and up-to-date forest details is challenging for long-term prognoses. Therefore, this review aims to identify uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset assessment and discuss the extent to which such uncertainties can be reduced by recent progress in high resolution remote sensing. We do this by performing an extensive literature review and a case study combining remote sensing and life cycle assessment of urban forest carbon offset in Berlin, Germany. Main text: Recent progress in high resolution remote sensing and methods is adequate for delivering more precise details on the urban tree canopy, individual tree metrics, species, and age structures compared to conventional land use/cover class approaches. These area-wide consistent details can update life cycle inventories for more precise future prognoses. Additional improvements in classification accuracy can be achieved by a higher number of features derived from remote sensing data of increasing resolution, but first studies on this subject indicated that a smart selection of features already provides sufficient data that avoids redundancies and enables more efficient data processing. Our case study from Berlin could use remotely sensed individual tree species as consistent inventory of a life cycle assessment. However, a lack of growth, mortality and planting data forced us to make assumptions, therefore creating uncertainty in the long-term prognoses. Regarding temporal changes and reliable long-term estimates, more attention is required to detect changes of gradual growth, pruning and abrupt changes in tree planting and mortality. As such, precise long-term urban ecological monitoring using high resolution remote sensing should be intensified, especially due to increasing climate change effects. This is important for calibrating and validating recent prognoses of urban forest carbon offset, which have so far scarcely addressed longer timeframes. Additionally, higher resolution remote sensing of urban forest carbon estimates can improve upscaling approaches, which should be extended to reach a more precise global estimate for the first time. Conclusions: Urban forest carbon offset can be made more relevant by making more standardized assessments available for science and professional practitioners, and the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing data and the progress in data processing allows for precisely that. © 2017 The Author(s).","Carbon offset; Change detection; Climate change mitigation; High resolution; Individual tree detection; Life cycle assessment; Tree species; Uncertainty; Urban forests; Urban remote sensing","adaptive management; carbon emission; climate change; data processing; detection method; emission control; forest canopy; growth; life cycle analysis; literature review; mortality; remote sensing; resolution; tree; uncertainty analysis; urban area; Berlin; Germany",2-s2.0-85030310127

Drawing on Judith Butler's political philosophy of performativity, I assess “The Dead Are Coming” as a “doing” rather than a “describing” of dignity. I argue that the integration of God into the practices of mourning enables both the activists and the audience to resist the differential distribution of dignity in Europe's migration policy.

To interrogate how the visa system operates, this paper reviews politics between and within the government, the market and the migrants. Although the government rhetorically uses visa policies as a quality-control mechanism to selectively accept a desirable population, it can only do so by relying on the market to ‘evaluate’ migrants. However, Korean-Chinese migrants are welcomed in the low-skilled employment market to fill labour shortages, and they also contribute to the expanding migration industry as consumers, which stand at odds with the government’s effort to limit ‘unskilled’ migration. The relegation of the state’s responsibility to the market provides an opportunity for migrants to contest the border and negotiate with the state. However, their negotiation comes at the expense of precarisation of their legal status. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","borders; co-ethnic migration; Korean-Chinese migrants; skilled/unskilled migration; visa policies","ethnic group; immigration policy; international migration; labor migration; quality control; skilled labor; South Korea",2-s2.0-85007504868

More precisely, it presents the various spatial concepts Arendt uses (place, space, territory, world, location, etc.), and suggests that a tri-partite spatial ontology is at work behind her lexicon. Since such an ontological trilogy is never explicit in Arendt’s work, it is compared to the architecture of Arendt’s explicit theorization which is structured around different sets of concepts (identity/plurality; labour/work/action). Then, the paper explains that an ontological analysis of Arendt’s proposals allows us to understand the major issues or tragedies that she focused on as being related to tensions between different forms of spatiality. I conclude that Arendt’s extensive contributions in diverse conceptual and empirical fields are intrinsically spatially grounded. © 2016 Regional Studies Association.","Arendt; place; space; spatiality; territory; world",,2-s2.0-84988733131

This article uses the riverside garden of Chinese-born Willie Sang, near Mackay, Queensland, as a finegrained example of a ‘subversive space’, drawing on a previously unanalysed archive of Queensland government-issued ‘Informal Leases’. It demonstrates the complexity of Sang’s space and others like it through the detail of his experience and by embedding it in a wider history than that of Chinese market gardeners in Queensland. It argues that understanding Sang’s garden in this way shifts any narrative which characterises white settlement as comprehensive, and provides detail on how, in contrast to the way such spaces have been understood, they encapsulated persistence, adaptation and longevity. © 2017, Routledge.

Recently, the topic of fūfubessei has once again come under a spotlight, since the Japanese Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Civil Code Article 750, which stipulates that a married couple must choose either the husband's or wife's surname upon marriage registration. Owing to the large number of women forfeiting their surnames, the fūfubessei issue has often been researched from feminist perspectives, which may have hindered the voices of others. This article analyzes, using text mining (quantitative analysis) and discourse analysis (qualitative analysis), a large number of opinions from people of various cultural backgrounds. The results of this study reveal a diversity of beliefs and attitudes towards Article 750, reflecting the complexity of the issue. In general, proponents of reform claim the law violates equality, rights and liberty. From opponents there was a strong push to conform rather than to recognize a need for individual choice. Moreover, the many personal narratives provided insight into issues on the ground and revealed how many in Japanese society have dealt with the law, social pressure and social expectations and why they have followed the path they have chosen.

This view was based mainly on the artist’s activity in Rome when he worked after Raphael’s designs. Until recently, his pre- Roman years were less frequently treated. It has been widely known that he borrowed motifs from Northern sources as Albrecht Dürer (i47i-i528) and Lucas van Leyden (c. i494-i533). This essay suggests that Marcantonio drew inspiration, especially in his Bolognese years, from the works of two early engravers from the Upper Rhine, the Master E.S. (active c. i450-i467), and the Master of the Playing Cards (active c. i430- i450). He did not copy line-to-line motifs from these masters, however, but reinvented some of their work and imaginatively incorporated them into his own print, Orpheus Enchanting the Animals, c. i505. This new engraving shows the artist’s creative strength and ability as an independent thinker. The fact that some other North Italian artists also explored the engravings of the two masters from the Upper Rhine reinforces the plausibility of Marcantonio’ s engagement with the same sources. © 2016 Konsthistoriska Sallskapet.",,,2-s2.0-85030705548

How could a colonial-era narrative emerge as both fact and fiction, law, and legend, so rapidly fit the language of contemporary moral anxieties, such as sex-reassignment surgery and LGBT rights activism? Using M.M. Bakhtin’s concept of ‘genre,’ I demonstrate that narratives of kidnapping, from the early colonial period onward, have circulated in genres ranging from ethnography and medical jurisprudence to fiction and even pornography. As activists in contemporary Chennai weave together past fragments to make their claims, these historical traces are re-animated in indeterminate, unexpected ways.

The aim of this paper was, therefore, to identify and characterize those areas colonized by a high number of alien species as a means to provide directional indications that can be used to minimize the potential negative effects that the alien species may have on host ecosystems. This is done by applying spatially explicit predictive modeling in order to explain the diversity of vertebrate alien species in Spain. The relative importance of the different factors was assessed using variation partitioning. Our results showed that the main factor as regards predicting the distribution of alien species was the anthropogenic variable, and that this was followed by abiotic variables. The other significant predictor of alien species was the number of native species, which had a positive relationship with the number of alien species. This accord with the ‘the rich get richer’ acceptance hypothesis, which predicts a higher number of alien species in areas with high native species diversity. In this study, we detected actual conflict areas (ACAs), which have high-medium values for the number of both native and alien species. Many of the ACAs identified some overlap with protected areas, which further aggravate the problem as these areas are often the home to endangered species which may be adversely affected by the emergence of alien species. This signifies that eradication, control or mitigation programs should be carried out to reduce the undesirable impact of alien species in these areas. However, other areas of conflict also appeared in unprotected areas near to big cities, where monitoring and preventive measures are necessary to avoid the release of new species and their subsequent spread. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London","alien species; areas of priority concern; biodiversity; biological invasions; distribution pattern; invasive species; macro-ecology; Mediterranean","biodiversity; biological invasion; hot spot; introduced species; macroecology; native species; species richness; terrestrial environment; vertebrate; Spain; Vertebrata",2-s2.0-85008182728

They may even host relatively new plant communities due to the peculiar ecosystem where they vegetate. The port of Trieste (NE Italy) is characterized by a mixed mosaic of intensely human impacted areas (where commercial activities are still ongoing) flanked by abandoned areas where vegetation persists or has spontaneously recovered. In this study, we sampled the whole port area through a stratified random sampling by placing multiscalar nested plots in four different habitats (strata) previously identified by photo-interpretation. Plant species richness and abundance were assessed in each plot. Each species was then classified as native or alien and patterns of species richness and complementarity were compared among habitats. Results show that there is a significant difference in species richness patterns among habitats, while observed patterns are likely to vary at different spatial scales. As expected, urban plots account for most of the alien species in the sampling, while wooded plots cope better with invasion, accounting for a lower alien/native ratio. These results highlight how habitat diversity enhances biodiversity in urban areas and how it could provide an effective filtering effect able to reduce the spread of alien species.

Habitat preferences, physiological responses such as photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll contents, growth rates, and nutrient contents were quantified for each species. A competition experiment was conducted to evaluate the temperature preferences of the two species. All results indicated that the alien species H. japonicus can take advantage of elevated temperatures (35 °C) to enhance its competitive advantage against the native species P. lobata. While H. japonicus took advantage of elevated temperatures and preferred high-temperature areas, P. lobata showed reduced performance and dominance in high-temperature areas. Therefore, in future, due to global warming and urbanization, there are possibilities that H. japonicus takes advantage of elevated temperature against P. lobata that could lead to increased H. japonicus coverage over time. Therefore, consistent monitoring of both species especially where P. lobata is dominated are required because both species are found in every continents in the world. Controlling P. lobata requires thorough inspection of H. japonicus presence of the habitat in advance to prevent post P. lobata management invasion of H. japonicus. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Alien species; Climate change; Ecophysiological responses; Invasive plant; Japanese hop; Kudzu",,2-s2.0-85026915881

Much of the land is invaded by invasive alien plant species (IAPs) such as Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara. Most of these species do not have any economic value and compromises communal livelihoods and biodiversity. This paper aims to investigate the benefits and costs of clearing IAPs in northern Zululand. A system dynamics model was developed specifically for this analysis. A number of scenarios characterised by various IAP spread rates and clearing investment interventions were formulated and evaluated. The study finds that the highest net returns from clearing the IAPs were generated by value-added products (VAPs), followed by the value of water not consumed by the IAPs. The clearing of IAPs was found to be more cost-effective than augmenting water supply. Supplementing clearing investment operations through private sector co-finance reduces the stock of invasion, increases the area cleared, increases biomass for VAPs, saves more water and clears a greater area for livestock and maize production. The co-finance scenario proved to be the better management option. This scenario generated the most benefits and had a positive net present value (R2.5 million). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Clearing; Costs and benefits; Invasive alien plants; Northern Zululand; System dynamics",,2-s2.0-85019446305

Using the Agulhas Plain as a case study, we assess the feasibility of using IAP biomass in modular 250 kWe wood gasifiers to produce electricity with biochar as a co-product. There is sufficient IAP biomass available over a 15 year time-frame for the installation of 2.6 MWe electricity generation capacity, and the financial feasibility is attractive (net present value US$1.35 million for wood gasifiers, compared to -US$2.1 million for diesel-fuelled generators). However, the feasibility of the value added industry depends on sharing the cost for IAP biomass supply between the bioenergy entrepreneur (US$11.01/green tonne) and government (US$17.56/green tonne). A cost-sharing business model and public-private partnerships will be needed to develop value adding industries, control IAPs and reduce the costs of landscape restoration.

Therefore, the appropriate control and management of bush encroachment and alien plant invasions can restore ecosystems services and enhance the provision of timber and non-timber products to society. To understand the economics of land impacted by bush encroachment and alien plant invasions, we valued a selected number of ecosystem services from landscape restoration in South Africa and Namibia. In Namibia, the estimated value of ecosystem services from the restoration of bush encroachment was US$5.8 billion. In South Africa, the estimated value of ecosystem services from the restoration of bush encroachment was US$2.1 billion, and US$6.6 billion from the restoration of alien plant invasions. The most valued ecosystem service benefit assessed was water, followed by timber products and wood-fuels such as biomass to electricity, and then grazing. The value of these ecosystem services are considerable compared to the direct costs involved to clear invasive alien plants and control bush encroachment.

We investigated pollinator switching and magnitude plus distance of IPT between the alien aquatic Ludwigia grandiflora and the native Lythrum salicaria in both directions in uninvaded and invaded sites with a different relative abundance of L. grandiflora (% cover of the alien plant: no cover; low cover: <5%; high cover: 50–75%). A field experiment was conducted to include both pollinator interspecific movements and tracking of IPT, using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Despite a substantial overlap in pollinators between L. grandiflora and the native L. salicaria, less than 10% of the observed flights were interspecific. Similar results were found in dye transfer patterns. The proportions of stigmas with conspecific dye were always higher than the proportions of stigmas with heterospecific dye for L grandiflora and L. salicaria. There were no differences in conspecific dye loads for L. salicaria between uninvaded and invaded sites. Conspecific pollen loss (native CPL) and heterospecific pollen deposition (alien HPD) were in general low and species-specific. The distance of HPD ranged respectively from 1.7 to 39 m and from 0.3 to 54.8 m in the low cover and high cover sites while CPL ranged respectively from 6.40 to 68.02 m and from 0.60 to 40.18 m in the low cover and high cover sites. We can conclude that, in this system, CPL and HPD will play a minor role in pollinator-mediated interaction. Furthermore, interspecific competition for pollinators will cover a larger distance than just neighboring individuals. Our results suggest the necessity to consider the combined effect of insect visitation, pollen deposition, relative alien abundance, distance and seed set when investigating pollinator-mediated interactions of invasive plants. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Conspecific pollen loss (CPL); Dye transfer distance; Fluorescent dye; Freshwater ecosystem; Heterospecific pollen deposition (HPD); Invasive alien species; Relative alien abundance","angiosperm; aquatic environment; conspecific; dye; freshwater ecosystem; herb; interspecific competition; interspecific interaction; invasive species; plant community; plant-pollinator interaction; pollen; relative abundance; seed set; Hexapoda; Ludwigia uruguayensis; Lythrum salicaria; Magnoliophyta",2-s2.0-85021726491

Seed herbivores are commonly used as biocontrol agents but may also act as flower visitors, potentially resulting in pollination. However, such contrasting or potentially counterproductive interaction effects are rarely considered or evaluated for biological control programs. We investigated the breeding system and pollinators of Bitou Bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata), an invasive species in Australia that has been the subject of biocontrol programs since 1987. We found the species to be obligate outcrossing in all six populations tested. From 150 video hours, we found 21 species of potential pollinators, including Mesoclanis polana, the Bitou Seedfly, native to South Africa and released in Australia as a biocontrol agent in 1996. Mesoclanis polana transferred pollen to stigmas and was the most common pollinator (52% of pollinator visits), followed by the syrphid fly Simosyrphus grandicornis (9%) and introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera (6.5%). Fruit-to-flower ratios ranged from 0.12 to 0.45 and were highest in the population with the greatest proportion of Mesoclanis polana visits. In an experimental trial, outside the naturalized range, the native bee Homalictus sphecodoides and the native syrphid Melangyna viridiceps were the primary pollinators, and fruit-to-flower ratios were 0.35, indicating that Bitou Bush would have ready pollinators if its range expanded inland. Synthesis. Invasive Bitou Bush requires pollinators, and this is effected by a range of generalist pollinators in eastern Australia including the Bitou Seedfly, introduced as a biocontrol agent, and the major pollinator detected in this study. Fruit-to-flower ratios were highest when the Bitou Seedfly was in high abundance.

Individual-based interspecific competition significantly affected aboveground mass, belowground mass and biomass of native A. indica and I. batatas, but did not affect growth of invasive E. annuus. Interspecific relative competition intensity (RCI) of aboveground mass and biomass mass were significantly lower in E. annuus than those in other two co-existing species. Group-based interspecific competition significantly decreased all growth measures of E. annuus. Under the segregation distribution, aboveground mass and biomass of E. annuus were significantly greater in the no competition than in the competition treatments, but was statistically the same between two competition treatments under the aggregation distribution. Moreover, RCI of biomass in E. annuus was significantly lower under the aggregation than under the segregation distribution. Therefore, E. annuus has high individual-based competitive ability, and aggregation distribution of E. annuus can increased the group-based interspecific competitive ability with two co-existing herbs. © 2017, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

While it is prevalent in prokaryotes, HGT is less frequent in eukaryotes and particularly in Metazoa. Here, we propose Alienness, a taxonomy-aware web application available at http://alienness.sophia.inra.fr. Alienness parses BLAST results against public libraries to rapidly identify candidate HGT in any genome of interest. Alienness takes as input the result of a BLAST of a whole proteome of interest against any National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein library. The user defines recipient (e.g., Metazoa) and donor (e.g., bacteria, fungi) branches of interest in the NCBI taxonomy. Based on the best BLAST E-values of candidate donor and recipient taxa, Alienness calculates an Alien Index (AI) for each query protein. An AI > 0 indicates a better hit to candidate donor than recipient taxa and a possible HGT. Higher AI represent higher gap of E-values between candidate donor and recipient and a more likely HGT. We confirmed the accuracy of Alienness on phylogenetically confirmed HGT of non-metazoan origin in plant-parasitic nematodes. Alienness scans whole proteomes to rapidly identify possible HGT in any species of interest and thus fosters exploration of HGT more easily and largely across the tree of life. © 2017 by the authors.

First, we analyze how the Rabari pastoralists perceive the presence of P. juliflora among a range of environmental changes and problems they are faced with today. Second, we focus on the dynamics of their Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) system by studying the knowledge and uses that are implemented in daily interactions with the tree. Our results show that P. juliflora invasion is not perceived as a major problem by the pastoralists, despite being mostly associated with negative impacts. We relate these results to several intertwined factors, such as the importance of other changes, the shifting baseline syndrome, the adaptive capacity of LEK systems, and the slow rate of environmental change directly attributable to P. juliflora invasion. We then suggest that the ability of LEK systems to adapt to environmental change may in turn influence the perception of environmental changes, such as P. juliflora invasion.","environmental changes; Invasive Alien Species; Local Ecological Knowledge; nomadic pastoralists; Prosopis juliflora",,2-s2.0-85029576606

However, unlike many conservation actions, fence networks are expanding in an unsystematic manner, generally as a reaction to local funding opportunities or threats. We conducted a gap analysis of Australia's large predator-exclusion fence network by examining translocation of Australian mammals relative to their extinction risk. To address gaps identified in species representation, we devised a systematic prioritization method for expanding the conservation fence network that explicitly incorporated population viability analysis and minimized expected species’ extinctions. The approach was applied to New South Wales, Australia, where the state government intends to expand the existing conservation fence network. Existing protection of species in fenced areas was highly uneven; 67% of predator-sensitive species were unrepresented in the fence network. Our systematic prioritization yielded substantial efficiencies in that it reduced expected number of species extinctions up to 17 times more effectively than ad hoc approaches.

Numerous enhancements were approved and implemented during both the SDSS development and operation because of organisational learning fostered by the system. Two basic forms of learning methods were used: visual pattern recognition within graphical SDSS outputs, and hypothesis testing through re-evaluation of founding precepts and parameters.

Following the cessation of manual removals, the relative abundance of O. mykiss had increased to 0.56 ± 0.18 fish per net per night by March 2016, suggesting that without sustained removal effort, the population will rapidly return to its pre-removal abundance level.

This approach holds potential for meeting the dual goals of reducing the ecological impacts of non-native fishes and generating employment opportunities in line with the policy objectives of developing nations.

Climate change can affect the survival, colonization and establishment of non-native species. Many non-native species common in Europe are spreading northwards as seawater temperatures increase. The similarity of climatic conditions between source and recipient areas is assumed to influence the establishment of such species, however, in a changing climate those conditions are difficult to predict. 2. A risk assessment methodology has been applied to identify non-native species with proven invasive qualities that have not yet arrived in north-west Europe, but which could become problematic in the future. Those species with the highest potential to become established or be problematic have been taken forward, as well as some that may be economically beneficial, for species distribution modelling to determine future potential habitat distributions under projected climate change. 3. In the past, species distribution models have usually made use of low resolution global environmental datasets. Here, to increase the local resolution of the distribution models, downscaled shelf seas climate change model outputs for north-west Europe were nested within global outputs. In this way the distribution model could be trained using the global species presence data including the species' native locations, and then projected using more comprehensive shelf seas data to understand habitat suitability in a potential recipient area. 4. Distribution modelling found that habitat suitability will generally increase further north for those species with the highest potential to become established or problematic. Most of these are known to be species with potentially serious consequences for conservation. With caution, a small number of species may present an opportunity for the fishing industry or aquaculture. The ability to provide potential future distributions could be valuable in prioritizing species for monitoring or eradication programmes, increasing the chances of identifying problem species early. This is particularly important for vulnerable infrastructure or protected or threatened ecosystems. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","alien species; dispersal; invasive; invertebrate; ocean; subtidal","aquaculture system; climate change; climate conditions; climate prediction; colonization; conservation status; dispersal; ecological modeling; fishing industry; invasive species; invertebrate; marine environment; risk assessment; seawater; shelf sea; subtidal environment; survival; Europe; Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85017440171

Information on its dispersal abilities, ecological preferences and impacts may contribute towards the improvement of management strategies, including those relating to regulatory demands such as the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Both the above perspectives were addressed through inspection of environmental constraints to C. fluminea dispersal and impacts in a semi-natural drainage catchment (interconnected system of ditches). Forty sites were surveyed in 2014 to describe the species distribution and to characterize benthic macroinvertebrate communities, water column and sediment physico-chemistry, as well as the hydromorphological conditions. Clams were unevenly distributed in the study area and artificial barriers (dikes) did not prevent downstream dispersal of juveniles. Large variation in clam density (0–3077 clams m−2) could not be explained by physico-chemical or hydromorphological gradients. Although typical clam preference ranges reported in the literature were often exceeded, dense populations were nevertheless observed. Macroinvertebrate community structure suggested associations between the Asian clam and some functional feeding groups. However, the impacts of clams on macroinvertebrate assemblages and ecological quality were negligible, suggesting that contemporary methods designed to comply with the WFD bioassessment scheme may fail to detect important drivers of ecological change in freshwater ecosystems. This study demonstrated the reduced ecological impacts and broad ecological competence of the Asian clam, but also that its spread depends on human vectors. These findings highlight the need to rethink prediction tools supporting preventive measures against the introduction and spread of this invasive bivalve.

These invasive stands have major impacts on biodiversity, local livelihoods and ecosystem services. We applied several methods to develop an objective basis for a national strategy to prioritise and guide the management of Prosopis. Decision trees were used for assigning different control objectives (prevention of spread to unoccupied areas, local eradication, containment and asset protection) to each of the 234 local municipalities in the country. Priority assets that require protection in densely invaded areas were identified, ranked and mapped (in order of importance: water source areas, biodiversity hotspots, and areas with high agricultural and rangeland potential). Available control methods were compared in terms of costs, effectiveness, and potential to create employment. Biological control and more mechanised approaches were identified as important and the role of control-through-utilisation requires urgent research. Scenario development suggests that integrated control would be most effective. Strategic guidelines for improving the management of Prosopis were produced. These guidelines discuss key needs and objectives for management, targets, time frames, indicators and monitoring programs, research needs and spatially prioritized management areas. Although the strategy proposed in this paper is specific to Prosopis in South Africa, the principles will be useful in other regions where Prosopis species are invasive, and more generally for other widespread invasive tree taxa. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alien tree; Biological invasions; Ecosystem services; Multi-criteria decision making; Natural resource management; Strategic planning and management; Tree invasions",,2-s2.0-85013395110

Boom-bust dynamics can arise from many causes, some closely associated with invasions, but others occurring across a wide range of ecological settings, especially when environmental conditions are changing rapidly. As a result, it is difficult to infer cause or predict future trajectories merely by observing the dynamic. We use tests with simulated data to show that a common metric for detecting and describing boom-bust dynamics, decline from an observed peak to a subsequent trough, tends to severely overestimate the frequency and severity of busts, and should be used cautiously if at all. We review and test other metrics that are better suited to describe boom-bust dynamics.

However, it is still unclear how invasions may interact with local abiotic stressors, which are expected to increase as global change intensifies. Furthermore, we know little about the response to biological invasions of insects, despite their disproportionate contribution to global animal biodiversity. The aim of the present work is to investigate the impact of an invasive aquatic insect on the co-occurrence patterns of native species of insects along a salinity gradient, and determine which assembly rules are driving these patterns. First, we characterised the habitat specialisation and functional niches of each species from physiological and biological traits, respectively, and their degree of overlap. Second, we used field data to compare the co-occurrence patterns of native and invasive species in invaded and non-invaded areas of southern Iberia and northern Morocco. Finally, we tested if habitat filtering or niche differentiation assembly rules mediate their co-occurrence. In non-invaded areas, habitat filtering drives habitat segregation of species along the salinity gradient, with a lower contribution of niche differentiation. The presence of the invasive insect modifies the distribution and co-occurrence patterns of native species. In invaded areas, niche differentiation seems to be the main mechanism to avoid competition among the invasive and native species, enabling coexistence and resource partitioning. The combined study of functional niche similarity and abiotic stressor tolerance of invasive and native species can improve our understanding of the effects of invasive species along abiotic stress gradients. This approach may increase our capacity to predict the outcomes of biological invasion in a global change context. A lay summary is available for this article. © 2017 The Authors.

In this context, the family Cactaceae is particularly challenging because it is considered the fifth most threatened large taxonomic group in the world; several species are among the most widespread and damaging invasive species; and Cactaceae is one of the most popular horticultural plant groups. Based on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna and the 11 largest online auction sites selling cacti, we documented the international cactus trade. To provide an in-depth look at the dynamics of the industry, we surveyed the businesses involved in the cactus trade in South Africa (a hotspot of cactus trade and invasions). We purchased seeds of every available species and used DNA barcoding to identify species to the genus level. Although <20% of this trade involved threatened species and <3% involved known invasive species, many species were identified by a common name. However, only 0.02% of the globally traded cacti were collected from wild populations. Despite a large commercial network, all South African imports (of which 15% and 1.5% were of species listed as threatened and invasive, respectively) came from the same source. With DNA barcoding, we identified 24% of the species to genus level. Based on our results, we believe that if trade restrictions are placed on the small proportion of cacti that are invasive and there is no major increase in harvesting of native populations, then the commercial trade in cactus poses a negligible environmental threat. However, there are currently no effective methods for easily identifying which cacti are traded, and both the illicit harvesting of cacti from the wild and the informal trade in invasive taxa pose on-going conservation challenges. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology","alien species; biological invasions; cactus; cactus; código de barras de ADN; DNA barcoding; e-trade; especies foráneas; introduction pathways; invasiones biológicas; invasive plants; mercado en línea; nursery; ornamental plants; plantas invasoras; plantas ornamentales; vivero; vías de introducción","biodiversity; biological invasion; cactus; conservation genetics; endangered species; genetic analysis; global trade; horticulture; invasive species; native species; nurse plant; ornamental species; Cactaceae",2-s2.0-85018387187

Calls have been made for alternative metaphors that open up new management possibilities and reconnect with a deeper conservation ethic. Here, we turn to Indigenous perspectives because they are increasingly recognised as offering important and novel voices in invasive species discourse. We examine how Australian Aboriginal elders and land managers (rangers) speak about ‘environmental weeds’ (the term used to describe invasive plants in Australia) and weed management. Based on qualitative research with five Aboriginal groups in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, our findings indicate that Aboriginal elders speak about weeds through passive, neutral language and prefer metaphors for weed management that focus on health, care and creation.

The phenology of G. vermiculophylla was studied through seasonal monitoring of biomass, density and size of fragments, complemented by metabolomic monitoring using 1H HR-MAS NMR chemical footprinting analyses. Moreover, lipids and pigments were quantified, using high-performance thin layer chromatography for the former and high-performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry for the latter. This rhodophyte is present throughout the year, never fixed to a substrate on the mud, with a maximum biomass in the summertime. Phenological observations on algal populations demonstrated a high capacity for fragmentation, with a majority of fragments shorter than 3 cm. Metabolomic analyses highlighted a temporal variability of lipids, pigments and osmolytes between seasons.

We surveyed 45 sites across six river-systems in northeastern South Africa, to compare Odonate FD and standardised effect size of Odonate FD (sesFD) in riparian systems that had been invaded by alien plants, cleared of alien invasives, and sites that had never been invaded (15 sites each). Although species richness did not differ between treatments, Odonate sesFD was lower in invaded sites than those that had been cleared of alien riparian vegetation and those that had never been invaded. Clearance of 40% of alien riparian vegetation was associated with sesFD greater than that of invaded sites by almost two standard deviations. Representation of traits varied between treatments but was similar between cleared and natural sites, suggesting that invasion by alien plants directly impacts food webs, and that clearance can restore ecosystem processes and ecological services.

The successful competitive strategies may, however, be interfered with by parasitic plants, which withdraw resources from other plants' vasculature. Parasitism may strongly reduce the growth of the dominants, which may facilitate regeneration of other species and consequently trigger restoration of natural communities of high diversity. Here, we aim to provide robust empirical evidence demonstrating this restoration potential of parasitic plants. We present a case study testing suppressive effects of hemiparasitic Rhinanthus alectorolophus on competitive grass Calamagrostis epigejos. In recent decades, C. epigejos has invaded many high-nature-value semi-natural grasslands of Central Europe, which is one of the prominent factors causing their biodiversity decline. We conducted three manipulative field experiments testing the effect of sowing of R. alectorolophus in different vegetation types infested by C. epigejos. Rhinanthus sowing was compared to different mowing treatments recommended as the ‘best practice’ management at respective sites. Rhinanthus alectorolophus established itself in most C. epigejos-dominated plots where sown. Calamagrostis epigejos was virtually exterminated in 2 years in two of the experiments (dry meadow and industrial area). In the wet-meadow experiment, the suppressive effect was variable as a result of uneven establishment success of Rhinanthus. In this experiment increased mowing intensity had an additional suppressive effect on C. epigejos. Rhinanthus also increased regeneration potential of other species by a temporary reduction of vegetation density. Restoration of target vegetation composition was, however, dependent on community context. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrated that hemiparasitic Rhinanthus alectorolophus is an accessible and efficient tool for targeted biological control of Calamagrostis epigejos, with a great potential to restore infested grassland vegetation. The strong effect of Rhinanthus is caused by interference with the underground storage and clonal growth strategy of Calamagrostis epigejos, which are both traits that underlie its competitive ability.

Climate is the one of the most dominant factors regulating the geographic distribution and population density of most insect species. Recent bioclimatic simulation models of the two flea beetle species fostered a better understanding of how the two species responded to selected climate variables. They demonstrated that selected climate variables increased population densities and geographic range of the two species. General circulation model inputs were applied in this study to assess the impact of a changing climate on the response of P. cruciferae and P. striolata populations. Model output, using the climate change scenarios, predicted that both P. cruciferae and P. striolata populations will shift north in future climates and the degree of geographic overlap between these two species will be greater than for current climate. This suggests that the two species could potentially cause economic losses over an expanded area in the future. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2017.",,"Alticini; Brassicaceae; Chrysomelidae; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Phyllotreta cruciferae; Phyllotreta striolata",2-s2.0-85029957442

Some other functions are also attributed to these systems. Clostridium botulinum bacteria produce botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT), one of the deadliest known toxins for humans and some animals. Food poisoning due to these bacteria is still a challenge in food industries. On the other hand, BoNT has been widely investigated for therapeutic applications including different muscle disorders. Bont genes may be located on bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, or even prophages. Generally, the genomes of Cl. botulinum show a high level of plasticity. In order to investigate the presence and characteristics of CRISPRs in these anaerobe bacteria, an in silico study on 113 CRISPR arrays identified in 38 Cl. botulinum strains was performed. A high occurrence of CRISPR arrays (80%) were found, with a remarkable frequency on plasmids. Several (CRISPR-associated) Cas proteins from different types were recognized in the studied strains, which were mostly Cas6. The CRISPR-Cas systems were identified as type I or III, but no type II. The spacers showed more homology with bacterial plasmids than phages. Active CRISPR-Cas systems can prevent the transfer of foreign genes, which may also include bont genes. This study provides the first insight into the probable roles of CRISPR-Cas systems in Cl. botulinum strains such as toxigenicity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bioinformatics; Botulinum toxin; Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins; Clostridium botulinum; CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats); Direct repeat",,2-s2.0-85027259732

Abstract: The intensity of silvicultural interventions and the composition of tree species are important forest management decisions. Both determine tree shape and thus influence the value of a tree, be it in terms of economy (trunk form, branchiness), or in terms of ecology (microhabitats). However, our knowledge on the distinct changes in tree architecture due to silvicultural management intensity or different neighborhood diversities is still limited, especially if the focus is on single tree attributes, e.g., branching patterns or crown shapes. We used terrestrial laser scanner data to calculate 25 structural measures for 55 European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees that grew either in pure stands along a gradient of management intensity or in intra or interspecific neighborhoods in unmanaged stands. We found a lower height of maximal horizontal crown extension, a higher crown surface area, and straighter trunks with increasing management intensity. Moreover, our study revealed that beech trees surrounded by valuable hardwoods showed a lower height of maximal horizontal crown extension, a lower height–diameter ratio, and longer branches with flatter branch angles than beech trees surrounded by conspecific neighbors. Our findings provide evidence of phenotypic plasticity of European beech to diverse environmental conditions. The differences in tree structure indicate an increasing crown competition with decreasing management intensity and stronger competitive pressure for beech surrounded by conspecific neighbors in comparison to alien neighbors. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Competition; Crown plasticity; Quantitative structural models; Terrestrial laser scanning; Thinning; Tree architecture","Competition; Laser applications; Tires; Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.); European beech (fagus sylvatica l.); Silvicultural management; Structural models; Terrestrial laser scanners; Terrestrial laser scanning; Thinning; Tree architectures; Forestry; Crowns; Fagus Sylvatica; Silviculture; Thinning",2-s2.0-85023781959

While aggressive and reproductive forms of interspecific interference have generally been studied separately, their many parallels and connections warrant a unified conceptual approach. Substantial evidence exists that aggressive and reproductive interference have pervasive effects on species coexistence, range limits, and evolutionary processes, including divergent and convergent forms of character displacement. Alien species invasions and climate change-induced range shifts result in novel interspecific interactions, heightening the importance of predicting the consequences of species interactions, and behavioral interference is a fundamental but neglected part of the equation. Here, we outline priorities for further theoretical and empirical research on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of behavioral interference. Aggressive and reproductive forms of behavioral interference between species are widespread in animals and share many parallels in their underlying causes and their ecological and evolutionary effects. Behavioral interference can determine whether species coexist and, thus, affects species ranges, the persistence of native species, and the spread of invasive species. As species ranges shift under environmental change and new interspecific interactions arise, it will be important to incorporate knowledge of behavioral interference into ecological forecasts and conservation planning. Behavioral interference can drive both divergent and convergent character displacement processes and thereby contribute to phenotypic diversity and speciation. Evidence is accumulating that behavioral interference has shaped large-scale ecological and evolutionary patterns. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","character displacement; competitive exclusion; interference competition; interspecific aggression; reproductive interference; sexual exclusion","aggression; animal; behavioral response; character displacement; climate change; coexistence; convergent evolution; divergence; environmental change; evolutionary biology; exclusion experiment; interference competition; interspecific interaction; sexual selection; Animalia",2-s2.0-85026799579

To do this, we combine large genomic and sampling data sets analysed with approximate Bayesian computation and random forest scenario evaluation to compare single and multiple invasion scenarios with pre- and postintroduction admixture simultaneously. We show the historical admixture zone within native North America originated before global invasion of this weed and could act as a potential source of introduced populations. We provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the invasive populations established through multiple introductions from the native range into Europe and subsequent bridgehead invasion into Australia.

Effects on crop yield and quality parameters (nitrogen, protein, and oil content) were also evaluated. Our results showed that the ready mixture of aminopyralid + florasulam at the recommended dose of 33 g/ha resulted in a very good control of Xanthium strumarium, Amaranthus retroflexus, Cirsium arvense, and Solanum nigrum even at 28 DAT, providing a long-term effect. Efficacy of the specific mixture was also very efficient against the invasive weed species Physalis angulata L. Moreover, there were not any significant differences between the two doses of Lancelot 450 WG (33 and 66 g/ha) and Callisto 10 SC at double the recommended dose (1500 mL/ha) regarding yield of maize, with untreated plots and treated with Callisto 10 SC at the recommended dose (750 mL/ha) showing significantly lower yields. It has to be noted that even double the recommended dose of Lancelot 450 WG (66 g/ha) was highly selective to the crop, without any adverse effects on yield and quality parameters.

In recent years, floating populations of S. horneri have drifted to Northern Taiwan via the southward flowing cold current along the Chinese coast. Nevertheless, no populations of this alien alga have been established in Northern Taiwan. In this study, we designed a series of culture conditions in order to understand the life cycle of this introduced alga. Several thalli bearing developed receptacles were collected from the field in the spring of 2015 and 2016, and fertilized eggs were obtained by conducting artificial fertilization in the lab. Two experiments were performed to determine whether or not the rafts of floating Sargassum that arrive in Northern Taiwan are capable of producing viable offspring under temperature conditions analogous to those of their native home, as well as in an environment where the seawater surface temperature (SST) is above 22 °C (the average SST in spring of Northern Taiwan). This study on the life cycle of the floating S. horneri in Northern Taiwan showed that these embryos could grow well and develop into viable new generations with reproductive capacity. However, incubation experiments under different temperatures suggest that the embryos derived from these floating S. horneri can only survive well at a SST of 20 °C or below in the natural seawater obtained from Northern Taiwan. We suggest that the sea surface temperature in the spring is a limiting factor for determining the distribution range of the floating S. horneri in Taiwan. However, further outdoor cultivation experiments are needed, specifically in combination with various natural nutrient and irradiance regimes under natural conditions, for testing the sensitivity of germlings to water temperature. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Embryo development; Introduced species; Phaeophyceae; Sargassum horneri; Sexual reproduction; Taiwan",,2-s2.0-85014901219

We investigated its impact on plant–soil feedback and ecosystem functioning. We recorded >40 variables focusing on: soil characteristics, including micro- and macro-nutrients; characteristics of litter layer and enzyme activity in litter; and richness and species composition of the forest understory. Three treatments were followed for 3 years: plots invaded by I. glandulifera; adjacent invader removal plots within the invaded area; and spatially separated uninvaded plots outside the invaded area. The effect of year-to-year variation was generally greater than that of the treatments, especially in soil and litter characteristics. Copper and boron were higher in invaded than invader removal and uninvaded plots, though in quantities that are unlikely to harm other plants. We found no effect of I. glandulifera on litter characteristics or enzyme activity. Despite almost 80% cover of I. glandulifera, we did not detect any difference in species richness and total vegetation cover between invaded and uninvaded plots. The floristic composition differed among the uninvaded, invader removal and invaded plots across 3 years. Our results indicate that the effect of I. glandulifera on the forest community studied was minor, and largely resulted from its increased shading to other plant species.

This holistic approach means caring for the person, not just their symptoms. Conditions, personalities, past experiences, pain thresholds and levels of understanding vary in each individual, so there is no predicting how each patient will react; but there are numerous ways that the play team can support a child and ensure that care for the child's emotional needs is offered, to complement the medical care.

I will argue to focus on “cognitive minorities”, that is, on groups of people whose understanding of the world differs significantly from that of their social environment. As concrete cases I suggest a comparative study of a religious group (Evangelical Protestants) in a strongly secularized city (Leipzig, Germany) and a group of skeptics and seekers (Unitarians) in a city characterized by evangelical religiosity (Dallas, Texas).

The relative value of these native and non-native plants for invertebrates is largely unknown. To address this a replicated field experiment with plots planted with one of three assemblages of non-invasive perennial and shrubby garden plants (treatments), based on plant origin [UK native, near-native (Northern Hemisphere) and Exotic (Southern Hemisphere)] was established. Over 4 years the invertebrates were recorded by Vortis suction sampler and amount of plant material measured. The abundance of above ground plant-inhabiting invertebrates increased with canopy cover and was higher on the native treatment. For several functional groups including herbivores and some predatory groups the near-native plants supported only marginally fewer individuals compared to native plots, with exotic plants being less favoured. The experiment demonstrated that gardens and other cultivated ornamental plantings support a wide range of plant-inhabiting invertebrates from primary functional groups regardless of the plants’ origin and the more plant matter (canopy cover) available the greater the abundance. Greater abundance of invertebrates will be supported by gardens and cultivated planting schemes with plantings biased towards native and near-native plants and that provide dense vegetation cover. However, exotic plants should not be dismissed as these are inhabited by some invertebrates. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Canopy cover; Functional group; Invertebrate abundance; Invertebrate herbivore; Invertebrate predator; Ornamental plants","abundance; biodiversity; functional group; garden; herbivore; invertebrate; Northern Hemisphere; ornamental species; perennial plant; predator; shrub; Southern Hemisphere; vegetation cover; United Kingdom; Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85019752830

Research suggests that immigrant regularisation policies improve labour market opportunities for undocumented migrant workers in host societies – particularly those engaged in the informal economy. However, research on regularisation remains focused on national-level policy efforts, despite increased political activity by sub-national levels of government on immigration issues across migrant-receiving societies. This article identifies and examines local migrant labour market regularisations – a new political geography of labour market regulation – and explores the potential of these policies to influence labour market mobility and opportunity for irregular migrants in the US. Using data on 5,528 policy ordinances across 3,067 city, counties, and states, implementation trends across four local migrant labour market regularisation policy domains were analysed for the time period 2001–2014. Case studies of local-level government activism within each policy domain are also presented. Findings indicate that the implementation of local migrant labour market regularisations in the US has become increasingly unfavourable towards migrant workers and that within these new political geographies, local governments are emerging as central actors in shaping migrant labour market opportunities. The article concludes by reflecting on the implications these new political geographies present for the economic incorporation of irregular migrants and their role in constructing a new scalar reality of migrant labour market regulation.

There are key challenges to understand the factors behind invasion propensity of non-native populations in invasion biology. Interestingly, interpretations cannot be expanded to higher taxonomic levels due to the fact that in the same genus, there are species that are notorious invaders and those that never spread outside their native range. Such variation in invasion propensity offers the possibility to explore, at fine-scale taxonomic level, the existence of specific characteristics that might predict the variability in invasion success. In this work, we explored this possibility from a molecular perspective. The objective was to provide a better understanding of the genetic diversity distribution in the native range of species that exhibit contrasting invasive propensities. For this purpose, we used a total of 784 sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA-COI) collected from seven Gammaroidea, a superfamily of Amphipoda that includes species that are both successful invaders (Gammarus tigrinus, Pontogammarus maeoticus, and Obesogammarus crassus) and strictly restricted to their native regions (Gammarus locusta, Gammarus salinus, Gammarus zaddachi, and Gammarus oceanicus). Despite that genetic diversity did not differ between invasive and non-invasive species, we observed that populations of non-invasive species showed a higher degree of genetic differentiation. Furthermore, we found that both geographic and evolutionary distances might explain genetic differentiation in both non-native and native ranges. This suggests that the lack of population genetic structure may facilitate the distribution of mutations that despite arising in the native range may be beneficial in invasive ranges. The fact that evolutionary distances explained genetic differentiation more often than geographic distances points toward that deep lineage divergence holds an important role in the distribution of neutral genetic diversity. © 2017 The Authors.

In this study, arthropods using flowers of the ice plant, Carpobrotus edulis, were recorded on the sand dunes at New Brighton in the south island of New Zealand. Of 3600 flowers, only 10% contained invertebrates and only 478 specimens were recorded in total. Of 32 arthropod species observed on this exotic plant, we consider at least 20 to be native to New Zealand and five species are probably New Zealand endemics. Based on an occupation rate of individual flowers of 10%, a binomial model indicated that a sample of 100 flowers would have <0.003% chance of containing no specimens, and 96% chance that 5–16 flowers would contain some animals. Species accumulation models (e.g. bootstrap, Chao and rarefaction) and models examining the likelihood of recording rare species indicated that after examining 2000 flowers, 80% of arthropod species would be recorded, and that only the rarest species in our study would fall below an 80% statistical power of detection. The results suggest that for this flower–invertebrate system, a scheme that involved 20 independent samples, each consisting of 100 flowers, would provide a good chance of (1) avoiding totally empty samples (2) collecting a high proportion of the total species present and (3) recording all but the very rarest species that occur in this system. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carpobrotus; Endemic species; Ice plant; New Zealand; Pollinators","angiosperm; arthropod; community dynamics; dune; endemic species; plant-insect interaction; pollinator; rare species; New Zealand; Animalia; Arthropoda; Carpobrotus; Carpobrotus edulis; Invertebrata; Mesembryanthemum crystallinum",2-s2.0-85017430616

The study area was located in north-central portion of the Eastern Cordillera of the Ecuadorian Andes, on a road from 1,150 m a.s.l. (Osayacu) to 4,000 (Papallacta). Along a mountain road spanning a wide altitudinal gradient, at 20 elevations we sampled three plots: one at the roadside and two perpendicular to the roadside. The relationship between elevation and species richness was assessed using linear and quadratic regressions, the effect of disturbance on species richness was determined by ANCOVA and a t test with parameters obtained from quadratic equations. Similarity of species composition among the roadside and sites distant was evaluated with the Chao-Jaccard and classic Jaccard similarity indices, the distribution of non-native species according to their origin were analyzed with linear and quadratic regression. The native species showed a linearly monotonic decrease with elevation, whereas non-natives showed a quadratic distribution. Disturbed areas had the greatest number of non-native species and lower native species richness, showing also a high floristic similarity; less disturbed areas showed the opposite. The non-native species of temperate origin were more numerous and showed unimodal elevational distribution, while species of tropical origin were few and decreased linearly with elevation. We conclude that in a tropical highland mountain range, native and non-native plant species respond differently to elevation: native species exhibit a monotonically linear decrease, and non-native species show a unimodal trend. Disturbance positively affects non-native species showing higher richness and fewer species turnover. In addition, the non-native species are located along of the elevational gradient in relation to their biogeographic origin. © 2017 The Authors.

Spatially explicit individual based models (SEIBMs) are a powerful tool to explore different management scenarios to control invaders, but we rarely have enough data to parameterize these models, particularly for relatively long-lived species. Here we take advantage of our previous work estimating demographic rates of invasive beavers in Patagonia, and develop an SEIBM to model the spread of beavers in Patagonia. We used our SEIBM both to estimate dispersal distances by fitting their observed rate of spread and to test how placing a buffer zone (a longitudinal strip of land perpendicular to the direction of spread within which a fraction of beavers are culled) beyond the invasion front would work as a control strategy. Specifically, we explored six different scenarios with two different culling rates and two buffer zone widths. We found that beavers in Patagonia must disperse long distances on average to account for the observed rate of spread, and thus our model predicts that a 100 km buffer zone will be needed to slow (but likely not halt) the spread of beavers. Interestingly, culling a higher proportion of beavers within a 100 km buffer zone (90 vs. 60%) did not improve buffer zone performance. Our study shows that wide buffer zones can slow (but likely not halt) continental spread of beavers in Patagonia and potentially pave the way for beaver eradication. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Castor canadensis; Cordon sanitaire; Long distance dispersal; Patagonia; SEIBM","biological invasion; buffer zone; dispersal; invasive species; management practice; simulation; Patagonia; Castor canadensis; Castoridae",2-s2.0-85019922521

Such broadscale eradications incur high repeated costs (e.g. control and surveillance effort) because the entire area cannot be treated at one time, and a progressive ‘treat-evaluate-move on’ approach must be employed. We describe a two-stage model to analyse surveillance data for assessing progress and declaring success of broadscale eradications, and to identify optimal cost-efficient surveillance strategies. Stage I modelling coincides or follows population control within a subset area or management zone (MZ). Surveillance data are analysed to quantify the probability of freedom for a treated MZ (i.e. local eradication), which is used to inform an operational decision to reallocate resources to other MZs, and progress across the region. Importantly, freedom declared individually in all MZs is not necessarily equivalent to a high probability of eradication over the broadscale area, because each MZ will have a probability of being erroneously declared free. After a MZ has been operationally declared free, Stage II surveillance commences to detect MZ-level failures, and to estimate the broadscale surveillance sensitivity and a corresponding probability of eradication. We developed a computer algorithm to identify cost-optimal Stage I and II surveillance strategies for a hypothetical large area. We assessed the following: (1) the balance between local surveillance intensity and spatial coverage; (2) the number of years to declare success in Stages I and II; (3) the stopping probability of freedom (Stage I); and (4) the optimal strategy given variation in the starting-over cost, should a MZ be erroneously declared free. This two-stage approach provides an objective basis for decision-making in wildlife pest/disease eradication, and guidance for implementing optimal bio-economic surveillance strategies. © 2017, The Author(s).","Biological invasion; Disease; Environmental decision-making; Eradication; Large-scale suppression; Optimisation; Pest re-introduction; Re-invasion; Surveillance","algorithm; biological invasion; decision making; disease; invasive species; model test; optimization; pest species; population regulation; reintroduction; resource allocation",2-s2.0-85021058626

Although some drivers of risk perception for INNP have been identified, research has not determined those for INNP in domestic gardens. This is concerning as domestic gardens are where people most commonly encounter INNP, and where impacts can be particularly acute. Using a survey approach, this study determined the drivers of perceptions of risk of INNP in domestic gardens and which risks most concern people. Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica, in Cornwall, UK, where it is a problematic INNP in domestic gardens, was used as a case study. Possible drivers of risk were chosen a priori based on variables previously found to be important for environmental risks. Participants perceived Japanese knotweed to be less frequent on domestic property in Cornwall if their occupation involved the housing market, if they had not had Japanese knotweed in their own garden, if they did not know of Japanese knotweed within 5 km of their home, or if they were educated to degree level. Participants who thought that the consequences of Japanese knotweed being present on domestic property could be more severe had occupations that involved the housing market, knew of Japanese knotweed within 5 km of their home, or were older. Although concern about the damage Japanese knotweed could do to the structure of a property was reported as the second highest motivation to control it by the majority of participants, the perception of threat from this risk was rated as relatively low. The results of this study have implications for policy, risk communication, and garden management decisions. For example, there is a need for policy that provides support and resources for people to manage INNP in their local area.

Similarly, it has been suggested, and sometimes shown, that decreasing soil N via carbon (C) additions can facilitate native species recovery. Yet all species are unlikely to respond to resource supply in the same way. We asked how soil nutrients and competition affect native and exotic woody species in a restoration experiment where we added N or C, and crossed soil manipulation with the manipulation of dominant exotic grass abundance in a Hawaiian subtropical woodland. We related changes in survival and growth of outplanted individuals to native/exotic status and plant traits. As a group, N-fixers showed reduced survival compared to non-fixers in response to added N, with Morella faya (exotic) and Acacia koa (native) having dramatic negative responses. Among non-fixers, species with greater foliar %N had more positive survival responses to increasing soil N. Specific leaf area was not predictive of responses to nutrients or competition. In general, responses to carbon addition were weak, although reducing competition from existing exotic grasses was beneficial for all outplanted species, with N-fixers showing the most positive response. We conclude that commonly used restoration strategies to clear exotic species or lower soil resources with C addition will most greatly benefit N-fixing species, which themselves may be unwanted invaders. Thus statements about the influence of increased soil N on invasions should be carefully dissected by considering the traits (such as N-fixation status) of the regional species pool. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

However, this body of work does not adequately connect the ways in which these processes influence immigrants' economic and labour market integration.

Invader-facilitated invasion success—”secondary invasion”—is a key conceptual aspect of the well-known invasional meltdown hypothesis, but remains poorly defined and empirically underexplored. Drawing from heuristic models and published empirical studies, we explore this form of “secondary invasion” and discuss the phenomenon within the recognized conceptual framework of the determinants of invasion success. The term “secondary invasion” has been used haphazardly in the literature to refer to multiple invasion phenomena, most of which have other more accepted titles. Our usage of the term secondary invasion is akin to “invader-facilitated invasion,” which we define as the phenomenon in which the invasion success of one exotic species is contingent on the presence, influence, and impacts of one or more other exotic species. We present case studies of secondary invasion whereby primary invaders facilitate the entry or establishment of exotic species into communities where they were previously excluded from becoming invasive. Our synthesis, discussion, and conceptual framework of this type of secondary invasion provides a useful reference to better explain how invasive species can alter key properties of recipient ecosystems that can ultimately determine the invasion success of other species. This study increases our appreciation for complex interactions following invasion and highlights the impacts of invasive species themselves as possible determinants of invasion success. We anticipate that highlighting “secondary invasion” in this way will enable studies reporting similar phenomena to be identified and linked through consistent terminology. © 2017 The Authors.

Here, an integrated management strategy is proposed for the blue crab in SEW, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea and the eastern Atlantic coasts of the Iberian Peninsula.

The review is concluded by an appraisal of the current trends in global and European crustacean fisheries.

Such imperfect observation bears the risk of underestimating the already realised distribution of the invading species, misguiding management efforts and misjudging potential future impacts. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical modelling framework which disentangles the determinants of the invasion and observation processes, models spatio-temporal heterogeneity in detection patterns, and infers the actual, yet partly undocumented distribution of the species at any particular time. We illustrate the model with a case study application to the invasion of common ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Austria. The invasion part of the model reconstructs the historical spread of this species across a grid of ∼ 6 × 6 km2 cells as driven by spatio-temporal variation in physical site conditions, propagule production, dispersal, and ‘background’ introductions from unknown sources. The observation part models the detection of the species’ occurrences based on heterogeneous sampling efforts, human population density, and estimated local invasion level. We fitted the hierarchical model using a Bayesian inference approach with parameters estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The actual spread of A. artemisiifolia concentrated on the climatically well-suited lowlands and was mainly driven by spatio-temporal propagule pressure from source cells with long-distance dispersal occurring rather frequently. Annual detection probabilities were estimated to vary between about 1 and up to 28%, depending mainly on sampling intensity. The model suggested that by 2005 about half of the actual distribution of the species was not yet documented. Our hierarchical model offers a flexible means to account for imperfect observation and spatio-temporal variability in detection efficiency. Inferences can be used to disentangle aspects of the invasion dynamics itself from patterns of data collection, develop improved future surveying schemes, and design more efficient invasion management strategies. © 2016 The Authors",,"Bayesian analysis; biological invasion; dispersal; ecological impact; ecological modeling; estimation method; herb; hierarchical system; invasive species; management practice; Markov chain; Monte Carlo analysis; sampling; spatial distribution; species occurrence; surveying; Austria; Ambrosia artemisiifolia",2-s2.0-85010450404

The successful biological control programme against invasive Tamarix in the USA, using several species of “Tamarisk beetle”, is being used as a guide for the South African research. The South African programme is complicated by firstly, the presence of the indigenous T. usneoides which raises the precision of host-specificity required, and secondly, the introduced and indigenous Tamarix have a high intrinsic value for phytoremediation of mine tailings dams in South Africa. The phylogenetic proximity of these Tamarix species to each other has contributed to this challenge, which has nevertheless been successfully addressed by molecular techniques used to separate the species. In addition, classical morphological techniques have been used to separate the Tamarisk beetles, so that now they can generally be matched to Tamarix tree species.

In order to make an informed decision land managers need to be able to predict the spread of these invasive species at local scales and without the need for excessive sampling. Our approach uses a hybrid model, combining habitat suitability and the presence of the invasive in neighbouring cells to predict the probability of a cell being invaded over time. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to create a habitat suitability model and a spread model. The habitat suitability model predicts the presence of buckthorn based on environmental characteristics and the results are used in the spread model. The spread model indicates that the invasion of buckthorn is influenced by the suitability of habitat and the presence of buckthorn in neighbouring cells.

However, there are few studies investigating non-target effects or rates of reinvasion, particularly over multi-year time frames. The aims were to evaluate the effectiveness of aerial application of glyphosate for control of dense stands of the invasive grey willow Salix cinerea, and determine the vegetation trajectory over the subsequent 2 yr. Location: Whangamarino Wetland, Waikato, New Zealand. Methods: A before–after control–impact (BACI) experiment was conducted in a Ramsar-listed wetland in New Zealand. Effects on S. cinerea cover, canopy light interception and non-target damage were monitored over a 7.1 ha experimental area prior to, and for 2 yr following, aerial application of glyphosate. Vegetation classification, ordination and species richness analyses were undertaken to describe community-level effects. Results: Aerial application of glyphosate to an established willow canopy was effective in reducing cover to &lt;5% on average for up to 2 yr post-spray when assessed using 100 m2 vegetation survey plots. Smaller 1 m2 plots were more sensitive for detecting willow reinvasion, which was noted from 1 yr post-spray. Collateral damage to non-target sub-canopy species was generally minimal, except for the native tree fern Dicksonia squarrosa, which showed marked reductions in cover and no recovery over the study period. Species richness was higher in sprayed plots post-spray and a shift towards a native Carex-dominated sedgeland community was detected. Conclusions: Aerial application of glyphosate to a dense canopy of mature willow was effective in reducing the cover and dominance of this invasive wetland tree species. Minimal collateral damage occurred, facilitating recovery and expansion of a native sedgeland community. The risk of secondary invasion did not eventuate, although exotic species richness spiked in the year following spraying. Sedgelands are susceptible to willow reinvasion via seed, so longer-term trajectories will diverge depending on management intensity. Using currently available tools, the management options are either repeated cycles of herbicide application to redirect the trajectory from reinvasion to short-statured sedgelands, or intensive initial management to establish an alternative, more resilient trajectory to native wetland forest. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","Grey willow; Herbicide; Invasive species; Ramsar; Restoration ecology; Salix cinerea; Succession",,2-s2.0-85030179880

Ecological monitoring of restoration is typically short term and rarely reassessed to determine if initial findings are indicative of multiyear outcomes, and economic costs of restoration are seldom quantified. To address these knowledge gaps, we resampled a restoration experiment in an invasive Megathyrsus maximus-dominated ecosystem in Hawai'i to compare success of restoration treatments at 8 and 36 months. We calculated cost to establish and maintain (for 3 yr) experimental field trials (0.13 ha) and management-scale (1 ha and 10 ha) units, estimated 30-yr costs for management-scale units, and determined key drivers of costs. Survival of native outplant species did not differ between 8-(56%) and 36-month (51%) monitoring periods, and M. maximus cover was lower in restoration treatments than in control plots at both time periods. Cost to establish and maintain the experimental trial was14,299 (Present Value at 2% annual discount rate, 2015 US;109,993 ha-1). Scaling up restoration to 1 and 10 ha units produced economies of scale, with 3 yr costs declining with increasing area (149,918 ha-1 for 1 ha;124,139 ha-1 for 10 ha). Total Present Value to restore and maintain a 1 ha site for 30 yr ranged from153,195 to302,917 ha-1, varying primarily based on labor and seedling costs. This study demonstrates that early restoration results can be indicative of longer-Term results, establishment expenses drive long-Term costs, and restoration efforts are most cost-effective when maintained over large spatial scales and long time periods. Importantly, this study allows other projects in the region to estimate restoration costs based on site-specific criteria.",,"cost analysis; experimental study; grass; invasive species; monitoring; quantitative analysis; restoration ecology; ungulate; Hawaii [United States]; United States; Poaceae; Ungulata",2-s2.0-85030330724

Abstract: Perennial Triticeae species of the Thinopyrum genus are among the richest sources of valuable genes/QTL for wheat improvement. One notable and yet unexploited attribute is the exceptionally effective resistance to a major wheat disease worldwide, Fusarium head blight, associated with the long arm of Thinopyrum elongatum chromosome 7E (7EL). We targeted the transfer of the temporarily designated Fhb-7EL locus into bread wheat, pyramiding it with a Th. ponticum 7el1L segment stably inserted into the 7DL arm of wheat line T4. Desirable genes/QTL mapped along the T4 7el1L segment determine resistance to wheat rusts (Lr19, Sr25) and enhancement of yield-related traits. Mapping of the Fhb-7EL QTL, prerequisite for successful pyramiding, was established here on the basis of a bioassay with Fusarium graminearum of different 7EL-7el1L bread wheat recombinant lines. These were obtained without resorting to any genetic pairing promotion, but relying on the close 7EL-7el1L homoeology, resulting in 20% pairing frequency between the two arms. Fhb-7EL resided in the telomeric portion and resistant recombinants could be isolated with useful combinations of more proximally located 7el1L genes/QTL. The transferred Fhb-7EL locus was shown to reduce disease severity and fungal biomass in grains of infected recombinants by over 95%. The same Fhb-7EL was, for the first time, proved to be effective also against F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum, predominant agents of crown rot. Prebreeding lines possessing a suitable 7EL-7el1L gene/QTL assembly showed very promising yield performance in preliminary field tests. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,"Bioassay; Food products; Genes; Mapping; Bread wheat; Disease severity; Effective resistances; Fungal biomass; Fusarium graminearum; Fusarium head blights; Key message; Thinopyrum elongatum; Fungi",2-s2.0-85021256881

The present paper aims at investigating the role of watercourses in the dispersal of the knotweed due to its frequent occurrence on riverbanks and production of fertile achenes (type of fruit of the Japanese knotweed). This dispersal occurs along two steps after the fruits deposit on the water surface: floatation first and then sinking towards the bottom of the watercourse. Regarding the first step, the effects of agitation of the water, temperature, surface tension and luminosity on the achenes floatability are experimentally studied. While no influence of luminosity is observed, an increase of temperature greatly decreases the floating time. Floating time also decreases as the contact between water and the fruit is enhanced (through submersion of achenes, agitation of the water or lower surface tension). Regarding the second step, the fall velocity of the fruits in water at rest is measured and appears to be independent of the seed history (floating time). 3D helical motions are systematically observed with constant tangential velocity with respect to the falling velocity. The trajectory of the fruits in a shear flow is then measured and the evolution of their velocity components along the sinking process is discussed. Finally, the contribution of both steps to the long-distance migration of the seeds is estimated. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Achene; Buoyancy; Fruit hydrodynamics; Helical motion; Hydrochory; Settling velocity; Shear flow","achene; angiosperm; buoyancy; hydrochory; hydrodynamics; laboratory method; seed dispersal; settling velocity; shear flow; submergence; three-dimensional modeling; water flow; Polygonaceae; Polygonum cuspidatum",2-s2.0-85019773767

However, they have never been found to dominate the phytoplankton in the northern part of the invaded area. The aim of our study was to expand the understanding of the invasion process in Nostocales, by answering the question which environmental conditions enabled the first ever noted bloom incident of C. raciborskii and S. aphanizomenoides in the northern part of their current occurrence ranges. We examined the population dynamics of the two invasive cyanobacteria and the abiotic conditions in which their blooms developed in a reservoir at 52°N. We also examined the phytoplankton community diversity and composition before and during the invasive species blooms. As shown by redundancy analysis, the competitive advantage of S. aphanizomenoides depended strongly on high water temperature and high concentration of phosphates, and was positively related to other summer conditions (low water transparency, high ammonium nitrogen concentration). C. raciborskii biomass was not related to temperature and phosphates, but we argue that high water temperature in the first half of July enabled abundant akinete germination, and pulsed phosphorus availability synergized to bring about a later bloom. Both the invasive species co-occurred with the native cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon gracile, but C. raciborskii bloomed after the native species domination period. The results of the study corroborate the high competitiveness of S. aphanizomenoides in hot, nutrient-rich conditions, and the adaptation of the invaders to the environment in the invaded regions, inter alia by the overwintering mechanism of numerous akinete differentiation.

Among birds, the widely introduced ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri locally affects cavity-nesting communities through competition for suitable tree cavities, although it remains unclear to what extent such competition translates into population declines of native species. Here, we studied the potential for nest site competition between ring-necked parakeets and the native scops owl Otus scops, a small nocturnal migratory raptor, by comparing the spatial distribution of the nest site locations of the raptor before (2002) and after (2015) the parakeet invasion. Pre-invasion nesting sites of scops owls (2002) strongly coincided with those selected by ring-necked parakeets, but although both parakeet and scops owl populations increased during the study period, this was no longer true for 2015. Ring-necked parakeets took over several cavities formerly occupied by scops owls, and land-use data suggest that because of the higher overall breeding densities in 2015, scops owls were forced to occupy suboptimal breeding habitats to minimize nest site competition with invasive parakeets. Ring-necked parakeets start breeding early in the season, a behaviour enabling them to secure the best nest sites first, before the owls return from their wintering grounds. Our study highlights that locally observed competition not necessarily impacts on population dynamics of competing species and thus warns against uncritical extrapolation of smaller scale studies for assessing invasive species risks at larger spatial scales. Nonetheless, given the increasing number of studies demonstrating its competitive capacities, monitoring of ring-necked parakeet populations is prudent and mitigation measures (such as mounting of man-made nest-boxes, which are used by scops owls, but not by parakeets) may be justified when the parakeets are likely to invade areas harbouring cavity-nesters of conservation concern. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London","attraction–inhibition analysis; biological invasions; cavity-nesters; nest displacement; Otus scops; Psittacula krameri","biological invasion; bird; competition (ecology); ecological impact; invasive species; native species; nature conservation; nesting behavior; raptor; spatial distribution; Aves; Otus; Otus scops; Psittacidae; Psittacula krameri; Raptores; Strigiformes",2-s2.0-85010282474

As a result, immigrant workers experience precarious and deteriorating wage and work arrangements. I discuss whether these are inevitable processes by analysing one particular case, that of the Norwegian agricultural industry since the turn of the century. In the first years after 2000, a growing number of low-skilled Eastern European immigrants in Norway's agricultural industry faced precarious work arrangements as the industry drifted toward informalisation. Yet labour relations in Norwegian agriculture have since seen signs of reformalisation, resulting in higher wages and improved working conditions. I examine the characteristics of Norwegian society and its agricultural industry that have facilitated the reformalisation process. Important is the presence of strong and long-lasting institutionalised structures of cooperation and negotiation between state agents and representatives of labour and capital, which promote more than economic rationalities among the industry's employers. The analysis builds on a mixed methods approach that addresses both macro and micro levels, as well as both institutionalised ‘objective facts’ and actors' subjective interpretations, by use of various quantitative and qualitative materials.

During its first years of existence the program proved quite inefficient, but in 2012-13 it was revised to become more attractive and extended to include more Federal Subjects (now 58). Whereas in September 2012 RIA Novosti reported that there had been 80,000 repatriates since the start of the program, the FMS (the Federal Migration Service) stated in 2014 that more than 200,000 compatriots had been resettled. The paper focuses on this period of revival and investigates what the discussions and representations of the State Program in Russian public discourse reveal about ideals of citizenship, membership, and statehood in Russia. Discourse analysis is combined with references to theoretical debates on states' policies of inclusion and exclusion. Researchers have already pointed to the concept of “compatriots” as ambiguous, because it only vaguely defines who the program is open for. Even though the initial aim of the program was to secure economic development in the regions and improve the demographic situation in the country, it clearly intervenes in other discourses that relate to the image of the Russian nation and the boundaries of the imagined “we.” One is the idea of Russia as the historical homeland of “compatriots,” and connected to this the idea that “compatriots” are discriminated against in other countries and therefore implicitly want to return to Russia. The debates also bear witness to an explicit dichotomy between “compatriots” and “migrants,” where “migrants” are construed as unqualified, unwanted and not rightfully belonging in the country, whereas “compatriots” are skilled and desired labor, easy to include into the Russian “community of value.” From spring 2014 onwards, the State Program became an issue also in relation to refugees from Ukraine who fled to Russia during the escalating conflict and war. This study shows how at that point the State Program suddenly turned into a means of effective integration of Ukrainian refugees-“compatriots.” I argue that although in the media representations the program acquires several other functions, the pragmatic aspect-Russia wanting to attract skilled labor-is present throughout and stands out as the most important. © 2017 The Russian Review.",,,2-s2.0-85029224852

Despite their promise, the contributions of fenced and intensively-managed reserves towards achieving wider biodiversity goals are contentious. There has been little empirical evidence that fenced reserves can restore communities or ecological function over larger landscapes in ways that justify their large economic and sometimes social costs. Here we tested whether the exclusion of introduced predators restored mammal-sensitive habitat after 8 years within a mainland fenced reserve in southern New Zealand. We also asked whether the abundance of bird-dispersed fruiting trees and frugivorous birds was elevated immediately outside the reserve as compared with the broader landscape. We found that only saplings of fleshy-fruited tree species sensitive to browsing and seed predation by introduced mammals increased over time within the reserve. These mammal-sensitive trees were also more abundant in the surrounding unfenced landscape when close to the reserve, i.e. within 500 m. Our results suggested that mammal-sensitive trees were benefitting from increased fruit dispersal that was spilling over the fenced boundary as mammal-sensitive frugivores responded to predator control. Using point count surveys at 278 unique sites throughout the broader region, we found that the native frugivore community that evolved in the absence of mammalian predators was a third more abundant within the reserve and immediately outside the fenced boundary than at sites 20 km away in the surrounding landscape. Non-endemic frugivores did not show the same spatial pattern. Our work provides among the first evidence that an intensively-managed wildlife reserve can measurably restore populations of threatened flora and fauna and disperse conservation benefits into wider landscapes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation planning; Forests; Herbivory; Invasive species; Meta-populations; Protected areas; Restoration; Vegetation recovery","abundance; biodiversity; bird; browsing; conservation management; conservation planning; fauna; frugivory; herbivory; invasive species; mammal; metapopulation; vegetation dynamics; New Zealand; Aves; Mammalia",2-s2.0-85027278438

In order to reach such an understanding, it is important to know abiotic variables that impact and drive distributions of native and non-native species. We used an existing long-term macrobenthos database for species presence-absence information and biomass estimates at different environmental gradients in the northern Baltic Sea. Region specific abiotic variables (e.g. salinity, depth) were derived from previously constructed bathymetric and hydrodynamic models. Multidimensional ordination techniques were then applied to investigate potential niche space separation between all native and non-native invertebrates in the northern Baltic Sea. Such an approach allowed to obtain data rich and robust estimates of the current native and non-native species distributions and outline important abiotic parameters influencing the observed pattern. The results showed clear niche space separation between native and non-native species. Non-native species were situated in an environmental space characterized by reduced salinity, high temperatures, high proportion of soft seabed and decreased depth and wave exposure whereas native species displayed an opposite pattern. Different placement of native and non-native species along the studied environmental niche space is likely to be explained by the differences in their evolutionary history, human mediated activities and geological youth of the Baltic Sea. The results of this study can provide early warnings and effectively outline coastal areas in the northern Baltic Sea that are prone to further range expansion of non-native species as climate change is expected to significantly reduce salinity and increase temperature in wide coastal areas, both supporting the disappearance of native and appearance of non-native species. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Benthic ecology; Benthos; Biological invasions; Environmental gradients; Introduced species; Invasive species; Marine ecology; Niche; Spatial dynamics; Species distribution","Climate change; Coastal zones; Conservation; Digital storage; Ecology; Geographical distribution; Separation; Benthic ecologies; Benthos; Biological invasion; Environmental gradient; Introduced species; Invasive species; Marine ecology; Niche; Spatial dynamics; Species distributions; Population distribution; biological invasion; environmental gradient; geographical distribution; introduced species; macrobenthos; marine ecosystem; native species; niche; spatial variation; Baltic Sea; biomass; climate change; high temperature; human; hydrodynamics; introduced species; invasive species; invertebrate; juvenile; macrobenthos; marine biology; nonhuman; salinity; seashore; species distribution; species invasion; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85030762686

However, expansion by expansive species may also offer benefits to ecosystems and humans, through the supply of ecosystem goods and services (such as firewood, fodder and fruits), as well as potentially offering refugia in heavily used landscapes. Here, we examine the effects of four expansive dwarf shrub species (Aspalathus subtingens, Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis, Pteronia incana and Oedera genistifolia) on plant species richness (at the point scale), vegetation cover, soil properties and whether the expansive species offer refugia to other species. Plant species richness, cover and soil properties were recorded in 1-m2 quadrats located within a mosaic of expanded and non-expanded patches for the four expansive shrub species. Plant species richness was significantly higher in the non-expanded areas compared to the expanded ones for all four expansive species. Some of the expansive shrubs provided refugia to certain plant species and limited the frequency of other species. With regard to species composition, there was little separation of expanded and non-expanded samples within sites, indicating that the site factors were stronger determinants of plant species richness and composition than expansion. Therefore, it is more likely that the reduction in species richness in expanded sites is caused by multiple drivers, including vegetation attributes cover, litter cover and soil nutrients (organic C, Zn and P) and soil compaction.

Climate change, land degradation and an inherently semi-arid, variable climate are making it increasingly difficult for water service providers to deliver sufficient quantity and quality of water to meet escalating demand. Investments in ecological infrastructure are seldom considered as a way of augmenting water supplies and improving water quality over the long-term. However, hydrological modelling shows that protecting and rehabilitating ecological infrastructure could generate meaningful gains in water quantity in two important South African water supply systems, the Baviaanskloof-Tsitsikamma and uMngeni catchments. The costs of such interventions, as estimated using resource economic techniques, are within the same order of magnitude as built infrastructure solutions. Investments in ecological infrastructure can also have a considerable range of other benefits. These findings make a compelling case for large-scale investment in the rehabilitation and protection of ecological infrastructure, which can be a cost-effective option for achieving water resource planning objectives. The types of rehabilitation activities planned would depend on the needs of local water users. Associated long-term monitoring and research would further improve knowledge of these systems, and provide support for the modelled results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Catchments; Ecological infrastructure; Hydrological modelling; Investment; Rehabilitation; Water security.",,2-s2.0-85015784793

Yet landscape scale distribution patterns of invasive species are rarely leveraged to understand invasion in a comprehensive manner. Objectives: Characterize three key stages of invasion from the landscape scale distribution patterns for an invasive insect—Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), and investigate the potential spatial variability in establishment and impact risk. Methods: The study focuses on the recent invasion of D. citri in Southern California’s urban landscape. We used a combination of spatiotemporal pattern analyses and species distribution models (SDMs) to characterize the introduction, establishment and impact of D. citri invasion. Results: Diaphorina citri detections in relation to major roadways revealed that initial detections are significantly closer to major roads than later detections, suggesting that transportation corridors serve as introduction pathways. SDMs of D. citri establishment and impact potential using presence-(pseudo)absence and abundance revealed percent impervious surface as the best landscape predictor. Inclusion of prior D. citri detections as a lagged spatiotemporal effect improved both model fit and performance suggesting that small-scale dispersal events do matter. Interestingly, interpolated risk maps based on the predicted occurrence and abundance highlighted substantial spatial variability in D. citri establishment and impact risk. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates how examining spatiotemporal patterns of an invasive species is useful in inferring key stages of the invasion, and how occurrence and abundance information can be leveraged to quantify variability in establishment and impact risk. The study thus provides a useful baseline in formulating effective landscape-level management actions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Empirical Bayesian Kriging; Generalized additive model; GIS; Pathways; Response curves; Risk maps; Stages of invasion","abundance; Bayesian analysis; biological invasion; dispersal; empirical analysis; insect; invasive species; kriging; population distribution; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; California; United States; Citrus; Diaphorina citri; Hexapoda; Psyllidae",2-s2.0-85028765414

We determined the relative abundance of the subspecies and the distributions of plastid DNA haplotypes throughout British Columbia, Canada, at the northwestern distribution limit of common reed in North America. Of 203 specimens assigned to subspecies using molecular markers, we identified only 9 plants as the introduced ssp. australis; all remaining samples were the native ssp. americanus. The two subspecies co-occurred at only one locality. We identified four native haplotypes (one widespread in British Columbia and three others more localized) and two introduced haplotypes. Using plants of known haplotype, we assessed the utility of different morphological traits and trait combinations for distinguishing native and introduced subspecies in this geographic region. No single morphological trait was diagnostic, but principal components analysis and identification indices based on combinations of traits consistently separated the native and introduced subspecies in our sample. Two- or three-trait combinations of ligule length, lemma length and stem anthocyanic coloration gave the best separation. These indices could reduce the need for confirmation of the introduced subspecies using molecular tools, facilitating efforts to monitor and control this invasive plant. © 2017, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Cryptic invasive species; Morphological variation; Phragmites australis; Plastid DNA haplotype","DNA; geographical distribution; grass; introduced species; invasive species; morphology; plastid; relative abundance; subspecies; weed; wetland; British Columbia; Canada; Phragmites australis; Poaceae",2-s2.0-85018744268

Less is known about its pollinators, and especially in urban habitats where it is planted often despite being under increasing pressure from invasive plant species, such as the related milkweed, the dog-strangling vine (DSV), Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barbar. (Asclepiadaceae). During the A. syriaca flowering period in July 2016, we surveyed bees in open habitats along a DSV invasion gradient and inspected 433 individuals of 25 bee species in 12 genera for pollinia: these were affixed to bees that visited A. syriaca for nectar and contain pollen packets that are vectored (e.g., transferred) between flowers. Of all bees sampled, pollinia were found only on the nonindigenous honeybee, Apis mellifera (43% of all bees identified), as well as one individual bumblebee, Bombus impatiens Cresson. Pollinia were recorded from 45.2% of all honeybees collected. We found no relationship between biomass of DSV and biomass of A. syriaca per site. There was a significant positive correlation between A. syriaca biomass and the number of pollinia, and the proportion vectored. No relationship with DSV biomass was detected for the number of pollinia collected by bees but the proportion of vectored pollinia declined with increasing DSV biomass. Although we find no evidence of DSV flowers attracting potential pollinators away from A. syriaca and other flowering plants, the impacts on native plant–pollinator mutualisms relate to its ability to outcompete native plants. As wild bees do not appear to visit DSV flowers, it could be altering the landscape to one which honeybees are more tolerant than native wild bees. © 2017 The Authors.

As described in articles from 1868, 1872, and 1875 there were three distinct introductions of the plant in the 1860s, two from Europe and one from Japan. The European introductions consisted of the now widespread, seedless female clone introduced into commerce by Philipp von Siebold in the 1840s and a dwarf, seed-producing variety with reddish stems, probably also introduced by von Siebold. The introduction from Japan was sent by Thomas Hogg to his brother James's nursery in New York City and produced ""an abundance of rose-colored fruits."" Serendipitously, an herbarium specimen collected from Hogg's plant in 1873 was discovered in in 2006 and its examination strongly suggests that the introduction consisted of at least one male and one female plant.

The Confusion-Assessment-Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) has demonstrated very good psychometric properties, and has been translated into many different languages though not into French. We undertook this opportunity to describe the translation process. Material and methods The translation was performed following recommended guidelines. The updated method published in 2014 including introduction letters, worksheet and flowsheet for bed-side use, the method itself, case-scenarios for training and Frequently-Asked-Questions (32 pages) was translated into French language by a neuropsychological researcher who was not familiar with the original method. Then, the whole method was back-translated by a native English-French bilingual speaker. The new English version was compared to the original one by the Vanderbilt University ICU-delirium-team. Discrepancies were discussed between the two teams before final approval of the French version. Results The entire process took one year. Among the 3692 words of the back-translated version of the method itself, 18 discrepancies occurred. Eight (44%) lead to changes in the final version. Details of the translation process are provided. Conclusions and relevance The French version of CAM-ICU is now available for French-speaking ICUs. The CAM-ICU is provided with its complete training-manual that was challenging to translate following recommended process. While many such translations have been done for other clinical tools, few have published the details of the process itself.

According to this thesis, the German Empire embarked on a military ""Sonderweg"" [special path] in contrast to other states. This was supposedly particularly evident in a more radical form of warfare exhibited during colonial wars and the First World War. This view postulates a continuity of German military culture between the First and the Second World War. The present article tests this thesis by means of an examination of the Eastern Front during the First World War and concludes that the supposition of a specifically German military culture during the German Empire and a continuity between the form of warfare practised on the Eastern Front of the First World War and ""Operation Barbarossa"" often bears the markings of a backward-looking projection. In comparison to the Austro-Hungarian as well as the Russian Army, the German military was the most restrained until late 1917. Ultimately the success of Bolshevism since late 1917 led to a radical mental change; the state of command now exasperated, as the counterinsurgency in Ukraine in 1918 demonstrated. Simultaneously the German Army also largely tried to go easy on the civilian population. A further surge of radicalisation was revealed in the conflicts in the Baltic States in 1919. These may have possessed a formative character for the later Nazi movement, but not for the military, who saw the ""Baltic fighters"" as ""undisciplined rabble"". © 2017 Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag GmbH.","Baltic States; Bolshevism; First World War; German Military Culture; Russian Civil War; Ukraine",,2-s2.0-85031897829

The kelp Undaria pinnatifida, or “Wakame,” has a global non-native range and is considered one of the world's “worst” invasive species. Since its first recorded introduction in 1971, numerous studies have been conducted on its ecology, invasive characteristics, and impacts, yet a general consensus on the best approach to its management has not yet been reached. Here, we synthesize current understanding of this highly invasive species and adopt Undaria as a case study to highlight challenges in wider marine invasion ecology and management. Invasive species such as Undaria are likely to continue to spread and become conspicuous, prominent components of coastal marine communities. While in many cases, marine invasive species have detectable deleterious impacts on recipient communities, in many others their influence is often limited and location specific. Although not yet conclusive, Undaria may cause some ecological impact, but it does not appear to drive ecosystem change in most invaded regions. Targeted management actions have also had minimal success. Further research is needed before well-considered, evidence-based management decisions can be made. However, if Undaria was to become officially unmanaged in parts of its non-native range, the presence of a highly productive, habitat former with commercial value and a broad ecological niche, could have significant economic and even environmental benefit. How science and policy reacts to the continued invasion of Undaria may influence how similar marine invasive species are handled in the future. © 2017 The Authors.

We evaluated burn effects on P. secunda, the rare native annual forb Amsinckia grandiflora and local native and exotic species. Annual burning maintained P. secunda number, resulted in significant expansion, the lowest thatch and exotic grass cover, the highest percentage of bare ground, but also the lowest native forb and highest exotic forb cover. Burning approximately every 3 years maintained a lower number of P. secunda plants, allowed for expansion, and resulted in the highest native forb cover with a low exotic grass cover. Burning approximately every 5 years and the control (burned once from a wildfire) resulted in a decline in P. secunda number, the highest exotic grass and thatch cover and the lowest percentage of bare ground. P. secunda numbers were maintained up to 4 years after the final burn. While local native forbs benefited from burning approximately every 3 years, planted A. grandiflora performed best in the control treatment. A. grandiflora did not occur naturally at the site; therefore, no seed bank was present to provide across-year protection from the effects of the burns.

Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) (EAB) may cause extensive changes to forest composition due to rapid ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality. Invasive shrubs like Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) may benefit from EAB and have negative effects on woody seedlings. We predict that ash mortality has positive effects on seedling abundance, recruitment, and survival, but that these effects are influenced by L. maackii basal area and/or cover. We sampled 16 sites, representing a chronosequence of ash mortality throughout western Ohio. We tested whether L. maackii growth and fecundity varied in relation to ash decline. We also investigated effects of ash decline, stand basal area (BA), L. maackii BA and percent cover on woody seedling abundance, recruitment, and survival using linear mixed models evaluated with Akaike’s Information Criterion. These same responses were also investigated for four seedling groups: L. maackii, invasive plants (excluding L. maackii), shade tolerant natives, and shade intolerant natives. We found a significant positive relationship between ash decline and L. maackii BA growth. Lower seedling species richness corresponded with greater L. maackii BA and better ash condition. Greater L. maackii BA was also associated with lower seedling abundance and recruitment, as well as abundance and recruitment of shade-tolerant species, and recruitment of shade-intolerant species. Sites with poorer ash condition and greater L. maackii BA had more L. maackii seedlings. These findings indicate that the negative effects of L. maackii are more important to future forest composition than ash decline; however ash decline increases L. maackii growth, hence exacerbating the effects of this invasive shrub. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Agrilus planipennis; Chronosequence; Facilitation; Fraxinus; Lonicera maackii; Seedling recruitment; Shade tolerance; Tree fall gap","abundance; basal area; beetle; chronosequence; dicotyledon; facilitation; fecundity; growth; invasive species; mortality; recruitment (population dynamics); seedling; shade tolerance; shrub; species richness; survival; tree; vegetation cover; Ohio; United States; Agrilus planipennis; Fraxinus; Hexapoda; Lonicera maackii",2-s2.0-85021703755

The amount of target eDNA in water samples from each aquarium was measured using the quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. We show that the presence of eggs significantly increases the concentration of crayfish eDNA per unit of mass, and that there is a significant relationship between eDNA concentration and biomass when females are egg-bearing. However, the relationship between crayfish biomass and eDNA concentration is lost in aquaria without ovigerous females. Female-specific tanks had significantly higher eDNA concentrations than male-specific tanks, and the prevention of fighting did not impact the amount of eDNA in the water. These results indicate that detection and estimate of crayfish abundance using eDNA may be more effective while females are ovigerous. This information should guide further research for an accurate estimation of crayfish biomass in the field depending on the season. Our results indicate that detection and quantification of egg-laying aquatic invertebrate species using eDNA could be most successful during periods when eggs are developing in the water. We recommend that practitioners consider the reproductive cycle of target species when attempting to study or detect aquatic species using eDNA in the field. © 2017 The Authors.

There are several primary hypotheses to explain invasion success. Two main hypothesis based on niche spaces stand out as alternative, although not exclusive. The empty niche hypothesis states that invaders occupy a vacant niche space in the recipient community, and the niche competition hypothesis states that invaders overlap with native species in niche space. Studies on trait similarity/dissimilarity between the invader and native species can provide information on their niche overlap. Here, we use the highly invasive and well-studied cane toad (Rhinella marina) to test these two hypotheses in Australia, and assess its degree of overlap with native species in several niche dimensions. We compare extensive morphological and environmental data of this successful invader to 235 species (97%) of native Australian frogs. Our study is the first to document the significant morphological differences between the invasive cane toad and a continent-wide frog radiation: despite significant environmental overlap, cane toads were distinct in body size and shape from most Australian frog species, suggesting that in addition to their previously documented phenotypic plasticity and wide environmental and trophic niche breadth, their unique shape also may have contributed to their success as an invasive species in Australia. Thus, the invasive success of cane toads in Australia may be explained through them successfully colonizing an empty niche among Australian anurans. Our results support that the cane toad's distinct morphology may have played a unique role in the invasiveness of this species in Australia, which coupled with a broad environmental niche breadth, would have boosted their ability to expand their distribution across Australia. We also propose RLLR (Relative limb length ratio) as a potentially useful measure of identifying morphological niche uniqueness and a potential measure of invasiveness potential in anuran amphibians. © 2017 The Authors.

Success stories, such as that of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge and papers in this special feature, demonstrate the value in large-scale efforts. However, the number of decision makers involved and siloed agencies responsible for land and nearshore coastal management, incomplete or contradictory knowledge regarding community and ecosystem dynamics, the large costs associated with complete restoration, and the interconnectedness of restoration decisions with social, cultural, policy, and economic dimensions, clearly classify the process of attempting large-scale restoration of degraded systems as a wicked problem. We wish to outline three focal areas that specifically address each of the challenges associated with wicked problems and that may improve the likelihood of achieving restoration goals. First, managers and decision makers must identify clear objectives that will guide decisions regarding restoration actions. Second, research funded through conservation initiatives should be aimed at reducing uncertainty in ways that increase the probability of choosing a set of management actions likely to have a desirable outcome. Finally, we need innovative solutions that borrow from industries that have already discovered economy of scale, as well as partnerships among those in the fields of social science, economics, policy, and the natural sciences. The collection of articles in this special feature illustrate how objective-driven studies, high-value research in areas of uncertainty, and collaborations among economists, cultural practitioners, and scientists can move us toward the identification of optimal solutions.

Although correlative models can predict environmental suitability at a coarse scale, they often neglect short-term climatic variability, instead relying on long-term averages. Accurately projecting the fate of any particular introduction requires demographic data on how a population responds to a novel environment. The recent introduction of watersnakes (genus Nerodia) poses a risk to California’s already imperiled aquatic vertebrate fauna. Despite inhabiting a seemingly suitable climate, a non-native Nerodia sipedon population in central California is likely to have been affected by a prolonged extreme drought from 2012 to 2015. We studied the only known population of N. sipedon in California for 3 years from 2013 to 2015, and estimated its abundance and annual survival. Its abundance declined from a peak of 218 (95% Credible Interval 149–313) in August 2013 to 97 (80–119) in July 2015. Annual survival of N. sipedon from 2013 to 2014 (0.23, 0.13–0.39) and from 2014 to 2015 (0.29, 0.18–0.41) was lower than survival estimates reported from native populations. Snake body condition, the abundance of large adult females, and prey availability all declined throughout the study. We conclude that the population of N. sipedon declined from 2013 to 2015, likely due to decreasing habitat and prey availability from the prolonged regional drought.

Recently, land reclamation has been extended to the construction of whole new islands; a phenomenon that is particularly common in Asia and the Middle East and is recognised as a global conservation issue. Using Penang Island, Malaysia as a case study, we illustrate the relationship between rapid population growth and the simultaneous increase in urbanisation, land reclamation and extent of artificial shorelines; and decrease in the quality and extent of natural coastal habitats. Our goal was to provide an up-to-date assessment of the state of coastal habitats around Penang, identify knowledge gaps and identify locations that may be potentially suitable for eco-engineering. Comparisons of historical and current topographic maps revealed that land formerly consisting of coastal swamp and forest, mangrove forests, sandy beaches, and rubber and oil plantations have been lost to large-scale land reclamation and urbanisation. Between 1960 and 2015, there were increases in urbanised area, reclaimed land, and artificial shoreline extent. The total extent of mangrove forests has remained relatively stable but this balance is characterised by significant losses on the east coast coupled with increases on the west coast. Coastal development on the island is still on-going with plans for the construction of five artificial islands and another two coastal reclamation projects are either underway or scheduled for the near future. If the plans for future land reclamations are fully realized, 32.3 km2 of the 321.8 km2 island (10%) will be reclaimed land and the associated negative effects on the island's natural coastal habitats will be inevitable. This study highlights sections of the coast of Penang Island in need of effective monitoring, conservation and management and explores the possibility of incorporating ecological engineering into development projects, either prospectively or retrospectively, to create more environmentally-friendly urban environments and to promote educational, amenity and economic activities. With coastal development taking place on a global scale, opportunities to balance development needs with conservation strategies abound and should be integrated into present and subsequent projects to protect these coastal ecosystems for future generations. © 2017 The Authors","Coastal management; Ecological engineering; Erosion; Mangrove; Ocean sprawl; Sustainable coastal development; Urbanisation",,2-s2.0-85029031273

From these data, we identified time since last timber harvest, not prescribed fire history, as the major driver of both Ailanthus seedling and tree presence and density. Two site factors, aspect index (a transformation of aspect) and photosynthetically active radiation, were also significant predictors of seedling presence or density. These findings to demonstrate that dormant-season prescribed fire has a limited impact on the distribution of Ailanthus within forested landscapes and that recent timber harvesting (within 20 years) is the primary predictor.

Do different vegetation types have different trajectories of change?. Location: A long-term ecological research site comprising temperate eucalypt grassy woodland and forest in south-eastern Australia, converted from pastoral use to conservation management. This has involved the implementation of habitat restoration treatments in addition to the cessation of livestock grazing and fertilizer inputs. Methods: We surveyed ground-layer floristic composition over a 4-yr interval, in 96 1-ha sites that had been subjected to combinations of restoration treatments aimed at improving the condition of the woodland habitat for fauna: (1) Reduced kangaroo grazing intensity; (2) Addition of coarse woody debris; and (3) Burning. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to plot the sites, and to analyse the average trajectories of floristic change for each of six initially identified vegetation types, and the restoration treatments. We partitioned Bray–Curtis dissimilarity measures to rank individual species’ contributions to floristic change in each vegetation type between 2007 and 2011. Results: The identities of the six vegetation types identified at time zero was strongly retained over the 4-yr observation period. There was generally a uniform change across the vegetation types, which was the result of increases in biomass of the characteristic dominant perennial grasses, and increases in some native forbs. The two vegetation types with evidence of past fertilization showed some convergence with native vegetation types due to the decrease in some exotic species. The restoration treatments had no significant influence on species composition. Conclusions: The native herbaceous vegetation in the woodland was largely resistant to compositional change, although seasonal conditions increased the biomass of the perennial grasses defining the different vegetation types. However, sites with an evident history of past fertilization and notable amounts of exotic pasture species changed slightly but significantly, with some pasture species declining and floristic convergence with native vegetation over 4 yr.

Shipping is the principal vector for international dispersal of nonindigenous species, and shipping rates are increasing globally. The Australian government performs a range of regulatory actions to mitigate biosecurity risks associated with marine vessels, and in so doing has amassed a large volume of operational inspection data. This data can be used to quantitatively examine risk factors of vessels failing biosecurity procedures after arriving from international ports, the nature of biosecurity failures, and the types and seizure rates of biosecurity risk material (BRM). Classification trees with gradient boosting were used to assess characteristics that predict high risk vessels (n = 93,006) for carrying BRM, across 7 years of inspection data. Undeclared vessels and suspected irregular entry vessels posed the highest risk, but both were rare. Vessels that visit infrequently (<20 visits in 7 years) were common and had almost three times greater odds of failing inspection than vessels visiting frequently. On statistical analysis, yachts appeared to pose less risk than commercial vessels. In operational terms, a tentative profiled 20% fraction would contain 57% of genuine failures, and the concomitant non-screened group would contain 82% of passes. The most common reason for inspection failures was ballast water non-compliance (2.53%) and plant or insect detections (1.77%); biofouling was less common (0.13%) but testing for biofouling is not exhaustive. Invertebrate species comprised almost 90% of invasive organisms detected and seized from vessels failing biosecurity inspections. This study targets an entire transportation vector, which includes many pathways. Understanding the characteristics of transport vectors is pivotal to characterising the risk of biological invasions and applying adequate controls and prevention strategies. Our results show that biosecurity risk is not uniform on maritime pathways, so there is considerable scope for biosecurity regulators to impose risk-based intervention. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Australia; Biosecurity; Classification trees; Invasive species; Marine; Risk; Shipping; Vessels","action plan; ballast water; biodiversity; biofouling; biological invasion; decision support system; invasive species; quantitative analysis; regulatory framework; risk factor; shipping; statistical analysis; vessel; Australia; Hexapoda; Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85021125193

In this paper, we report the morphological features to distinguish O. auronitens from S. titanus, and discuss the possible implications of its expected spread across the Old World. © Entomological Society of Canada 2017.",,"biogeography; deciduous forest; geographical distribution; identification key; insect; introduced species; invasive species; leafminer; morphology; new species; Palearctic Ecozone; phytoplasma; population outbreak; range expansion; type specimen; Canada; Switzerland; Alnus glutinosa; Auchenorrhyncha; Betulaceae; Castanea sativa; Cicadellidae; Cornaceae; Cornus sanguinea; Corylus avellana; Deltocephalinae; Fagaceae; Hemiptera; Rosaceae; Rubus; Salicaceae; Salix; Vitis",2-s2.0-85015691235

Predicting the effects of climate change on biological control, and identifying natural enemies that will thrive in future climate scenarios, is thus essential to ensure agricultural sustainability. To promote biological control under climate change, land managers should prioritise the conservation of natural enemy diversity to ensure some effective natural enemies are always present despite often-unpredictable climate scenarios. In addition, ecophysiological and habitat domain models should be combined to predict climate change-induced shifts in predation by diverse predator communities. Finally, insights from land managers during extreme weather events, such as droughts and heat waves, may be invaluable in the effort to identify key biological control agents for future scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,,2-s2.0-85027706330

We quantified coastal dune erosion from Hurricane Sandy (October 2012) as a function of pre-storm system characteristics – dune height, beach width and dominant vegetation stabilizing dunes (native Ammophila breviligulata or invasive Carex kobomugi) at Island Beach State Park, New Jersey, USA. We assessed dune erosion using a combination of pre- and post-Sandy aerial image spatial analyses in ArcGIS and GPS field mapping. Our two erosion metrics are novel, macroscale 2D surface area changes and Dune Crest Transgression, the later of which is measured at the microscale (1 m−1) and analysed using a mixed model incorporating spatial autocorrelation. We document a species-specific effect on collision erosion. Although C. kobomugi reduces native diversity and abundance, it may be beneficial for coastal protection, as dunes fronted and stabilized by C. kobomugi suffered less erosion than those dominated by A. breviligulata under the same abiotic conditions. Dune height and beach width were equal for species prior to the storm and therefore do not account for or confound differences in erosion. Similarly, traditional calculations of erosion with volumetric loss confer these results. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to show a species effect on coastal dune erosion. Native Ammophila breviligulata stabilized dune stretches suffered more erosion from Hurricane Sandy than complimentary invasive Carex kobomugi stretches, contradicting anecdotal reports that foredunes stabilized by a shorter statured species are more prone to erosion. This study highlights the importance of vegetation for dune stability and management using two novel metrics for erosion. Our erosion metrics are related to volumetric loss, can be monitored and calculated by managers with or without remote sensing, and can be applied to other systems. Discussions on coastal management of dunes as habitats and protective buffers must include vegetation and the results of this study suggest that not all species are equal with regard to their ability to combat storm erosion. Multidisciplinary studies with applied implications will grow increasingly important as storms continue to grow more frequent, severe and unpredictable with climate change. © 2017 The Authors.

Some 108 insect species, from five orders and 23 families, were deployed against 38 weed taxa, mostly in the mainland USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

However, the two vegetation properties may not respond in a similar way to environmental and disturbance gradients, leading to uninformed management planning and difficulties when attempting to restore degraded ecosystems. In this context, we addressed two main questions: (1) how close are relations between floristic and physiognomic types as defined by numerical vegetation classification in mountain ecosystems; and (2) how are floristic and physiognomic types distributed along the elevation gradient?. Location: Central mountains of Argentina, between 500 and 1700 m a.s.l. Methods: We selected 437 sites where we performed complete floristic and physiognomic relevés. We classified eight physiognomic and eight floristic types. We tested the relationship between the two classifications through a chi square analysis. We tested the association between elevation and each physiognomic and floristic type with random permutations. Results: In general, floristic types were significantly and positively associated with more than one physiognomic type and vice versa. Physiognomic and floristic types responded differently to the elevation gradient. Floristic types were restricted to different sections of the gradient, although having large overlap among them. In contrast, seven out of the eight physiognomic types did not show elevation restriction, being distributed along the complete elevation gradient. The open low woodland with shrubs was the only restricted physiognomy, significantly absent from the upper part of the gradient. Conclusions: We highlight the importance of considering the two vegetation properties independently when characterizing vegetation patterns in heterogeneous systems, since they show decoupled responses to environmental gradients. We note that the assumption of a direct link between floristic composition and physiognomy may induce bias into the understanding of vegetation patterns and processes. Hence, we encourage managers and restoration practitioners to consider the complete range of possible physiognomic types under each floristic type. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","Chaco vegetation; Conservation; Floristic association; Mountain Chaco; Mountains; Physiognomic types; Restoration; Tree line",,2-s2.0-85025469352

Darwin suggested that piscivorous birds carry out secondary dispersal of seeds and invertebrates via predation on fish. We tested this hypothesis in the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo L.). Cormorants regurgitate pellets daily, which we collected at seven European locations and examined for intact propagules. One-third of pellets contained at least one intact plant seed, with seeds from 16 families covering a broad range of freshwater, marine and terrestrial habitats. Of 21 plant species, only two have an endozoochory dispersal syndrome, compared with five for water and eight for unassisted dispersal syndromes. One-fifth of the pellets contained at least one intact propagule of aquatic invertebrates from seven taxa. Secondary dispersal by piscivorous birds may be vital to maintain connectivity in meta-populations and between river catchments, and in the movement of plants and invertebrates in response to climate change.

We tested fidelity of AFIS using χ2 tests and effects of land-use structure using random forest models. We also checked spatial autocorrelation and its impact on AFIS distribution patterns within old and recent forests, using spatially explicit generalized linear models. We found a strong relationship between AFIS number per grid square and fraction of forests and waters in land-use structure. Relationships between AFIS distribution and land-use shows that AFIS are a good proxy describing human impact or an urbanity gradient. AFIS number per grid square shows small, but significant positive spatial autocorrelation, which suggests possibilities of migration into new forests.

Previous molecular phylogenetic reconstructions based on the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 showed that C. pilifer is split into an Old World and a New World lineage, but remained partly inconclusive concerning the relationships between these two clades and C. introflexus. Analyses of an extended ITS dataset displayed statistically supported incongruence between ITS1 and ITS2. ITS1 separates the New World clade of C. pilifer from a clade comprising C. introflexus and the Old World C. pilifer. Ancestral state reconstruction showed that this topology is morphologically supported by differences in the height of the dorsal costal lamellae in leaf cross-section (despite some overlap). ITS2, in contrast, supports the current morphological species concept, i.e., separating C. introflexus from C. pilifer, which is morphologically supported by the orientation of the hyaline hair point at leaf apex as well as costal lamellae height. Re-analysis of published and newly generated plastid atpB-rbcL spacer sequences supported the three ITS lineages. Ecological niche modeling proved a useful approach and showed that all three molecular lineages occupy distinct environmental spaces that are similar, but undoubtedly not equivalent. In line with the ITS1 topology, the C. pilifer lineage from the New World occupies the most distinct environmental niche, whereas the niches of Old World C. pilifer and C. introflexus are very similar. Taking the inferences from ecological niche comparisons, phylogenetics, and morphology together, we conclude that all three molecular lineages represent different taxa that should be recognized as independent species, viz.

We therefore tested the seedling survival, growth and nutrient acquisition capabilities of two co-occurring invasive vines [Persicaria perfoliata (L.) H. Gross and Sicyos angulatus L.] in three different manipulative greenhouse experiments to infer their range expansion potential to marginal habitats in Turkey. First experiment included five different moisture availability regimes (100, 75, 50, 25 and 12.5% available water), second experiment consisted of four different salinity levels (0, 3, 6 and 12 dSm−1 soil salinity) and third experiment had four different soil textures (clay-1, clay-2, sandy loam and silt-clay-loam). Seedling mortality was only observed under extreme moisture deficiency in both plant species, while most of the transplanted seedlings of both species did not survive under 6 and 12 dSm−1 salinity levels. Soil textures had no effect on seedling survival. POLPE better tolerated low moisture availability and high salinity compared to SIYAN. Biomass production in both plant species was linearly reduced with increasing salinity and moisture deficiency. SIYAN invested more resources towards shoot, accumulated higher K and P, whereas POLPE maintained higher root-to-shoot ratio under all experimental conditions. Both plant species employed different strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions, but failed to persist under high soil salinity and moisture deficiency. Our study suggest that both plant species have limited potential of range expansion to marginal habitats and will be limited to moist and humid areas only. Therefore, further research activities should be concentrated in these regions to develop effective management strategies against both species. © 2017","Invasion potential; Invasive vines; Nutrient acquisition; Stress conditions; Survival and growth","biomass; environmental conditions; growth; herb; invasive species; range expansion; sandy loam; soil texture; survival; vine; Turkey; Persicaria perfoliata; Sicyos angulatus",2-s2.0-85028522723

Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess how the infestation of this invasive species damages the host Brassica oleracea var botrytis, and to evaluate the interaction between plant emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and B. hilaris adults. Plant responses to insect feeding were evaluated through changes in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, VOC emission, and visual damage on leaves. The impact of B. hilaris was compared with that of Nezara viridula, a polyphagous species distributed worldwide. Plant VOC role in host plant detection was tested with electroantennography bioassays on B. hilaris antenna. Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were consistently reduced in plants infested with 40 B. hilaris adults for 24 h. The feeding activity of a single B. hilaris caused larger discolored spots on host leaves in comparison with N. viridula. VOC emitted by B. oleracea changed significantly in response to B. hilaris and N. viridula infestation.

Metacommunity ecology highlights the effects of species dispersal rates on local diversity, thereby suggesting that native species dispersal may influence local biotic resistance to invasion by non-native species. However, the effects of native species dispersal rates on local native diversity and invasibility could depend on any intraspecific differences of the invader that may alter establishment success. Here, I experimentally tested for the influence of native dispersal–diversity relationships on the invasibility of native communities by a non-native species represented by core, midrange and peripheral regions of the introduced geographic range. In mesocosms, native plankton communities were connected by low or moderate rates of dispersal to yield dispersal rate–driven differences in native species richness prior to invasion by a non-native zooplankter, Daphnia lumholtzi. After invasion, establishment success and effects of the non-native species on native community structure and ecosystem properties were evaluated as a function of dispersal rate and invader source region relative to a control without native species. Native species richness was greater at the moderate dispersal rate than the low dispersal rate and yielded a dispersal rate-dependent diversity–invasibility relationship that was robust to invader source region. There was almost no establishment success of the non-native species at moderate dispersal and reduced success at low dispersal relative to the control. Invader population growth rates were negative only at the moderate dispersal rate. Effects of species dispersal on native community and ecosystem response were more influential than effects of invasion and impacts associated with invader source region. The results demonstrate that dispersal–diversity relationships can influence diversity–invasibility relationships at the local spatial scale. These dispersal-driven responses of invasion were unaffected by any ecological differences associated with invasion history-related intraspecific variation of the non-native species. This study emphasizes that dispersal rates of native species in metacommunities can differentially alter local biotic resistance to invasion. Thus, native species dispersal rates have largely been an underappreciated local diversity maintenance mechanism that can confer insurance against biological invasions. © 2017 The Author.

Recently, Prussian carp, a nonnative freshwater fish species, were genetically confirmed in Alberta, Canada and have been rapidly expanding their range in North America since establishment. Given their rapid range expansion, there is an increasing need to determine how Prussian carp may impact native species. We assessed the severity of the Prussian carp invasion by (i) determining their impact on fish communities, (ii) assessing their impact on benthic invertebrate communities, (iii) evaluating if Prussian carp alter abiotic conditions, and (iv) identifying where we find higher abundances of Prussian carp. When Prussian carp were established, we found significant changes to the fish community. Correspondingly, the degree of impact to benthic invertebrate communities was related to the stage of invasion (none, early or recent), where changes in fish communitieswere significantly concordant with changes in benthic invertebrate communities. Finally, we found that higher abundances of Prussian carp were significantly associated with lower abundances of a majority of native fish species. Altogether using three lines of evidence, we determine that Prussian carp can have wide-ranging impacts on freshwater ecosystems in North America, pressing the need for management intervention. © 2017 The Authors.","Before-after comparison; Benthic invertebrates; Concordance; Freshwater fishes; Non-native species; Time since invasion",,2-s2.0-85030687214

Most studies assess these traits in the invaded region, while only few compare nonindigenous species to the pool of potential invaders in their native region. We focused on the niche breadth hypothesis, commonly evoked but seldom tested, which states that generalist species are more likely to become introduced as they are capable of thriving under a wide set of conditions. Based on the massive introduction of tropical species into the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal (Lessepsian migration), we defined ascidians in the Red Sea as the pool of potential invaders. We constructed unique settlement plates, each representing six different niches, to assess ascidian niche breadth, and deployed them in similar habitats in the native and invaded regions. For each species found on plates, we evaluated its abundance, relative abundance across successional stages, and niche breadth, and then compared (1) species in the Red Sea known to have been introduced into the Mediterranean (Lessepsian species) and those not known from the Mediterranean (non-Lessepsian); and (2) nonindigenous and indigenous species in the Mediterranean. Lessepsian species identified on plates in the Red Sea demonstrated wider niche breadth than non-Lessepsian species, supporting the niche breadth hypothesis within the native region. No differences were found between Lessepsian and non-Lessepsian species in species abundance and successional stages. In the Mediterranean, nonindigenous species numerically dominated the settlement plates. This precluded robust comparisons of niche breadth between nonindigenous and indigenous species in the invaded region. In conclusion, using Red Sea ascidians as the pool of potential invaders, we found clear evidence supporting the niche breadth hypothesis in the native region. We suggest that such patterns may often be obscured when conducting trait-based studies in the invaded regions alone. Our findings indicate that quantifying the niche breadth of species in their native regions will improve estimates of invasiveness potential. © 2017 The Authors.

For locally endemic rare plants on the brink of extinction, frugivory can drastically reduce local recruitment by dispersing seeds away from geographically isolated populations. Dispersal of seeds away from isolated populations can ultimately lead to population decline. For localized endemic plants, fine-scale changes in microhabitat can further limit population persistence. Evaluating the individual and combined impact of frugivores and microhabitat heterogeneity on the short-term (i.e. transient) and long-term (i.e. asymptotic) dynamics of plants will provide insight into the drivers of species rarity. In this study, we used 4 years of demographic data to develop matrix projection models for a long-lived shrub, Cyrtandra dentata (H. St. John & Storey) (Gesneriaceae), which is endemic to the island of O'ahu in Hawai'i. Furthermore, we evaluated the individual and combined influence of a non-native frugivorous bird, Leiothrix lutea, and microhabitat heterogeneity on the short-term and long-term C. dentata population dynamics. Frugivory by L. lutea decreased the short-term and long-term population growth rates. However, under the current level of frugivory at the field site the C. dentata population was projected to persist over time. Conversely, the removal of optimum microhabitat for seedling establishment (i.e. rocky gulch walls and boulders in the gulch bottom) reduced the short-term and long-term population growth rates from growing to declining. Survival of mature C. dentata plants had the greatest influence on long-term population dynamics, followed by the growth of seedlings and immature plants. The importance of mature plant survival was even greater when we simulated the combined effect of frugivory and the loss of optimal microhabitat, relative to population dynamics based on field conditions. In the short-term (10 years), however, earlier life stages had the greatest influence on population growth rate. Synthesis and applications. This study emphasizes how important it is to decouple rare plant management strategies in the short vs. long-term in order to prioritize restoration actions, particularly when faced with multiple stressors not all of which can be feasibly managed. From an applied conservation perspective, our findings also illustrate that the life stage that, if improved by management, would have the greatest influence on population dynamics is dependent on the timeframe of interest and initial conditions of the population. © 2017 The Authors.

Yponomeuta evonymellus is a monophagous moth that feeds on Prunus padus which is native to Europe. In recent years, larval feeding and egg clusters have also been observed on non-native Prunus serotina plants; however, survival of larvae on this new host is very low. 2. The objective of the present study was to determine how the feeding of larvae on each of the two host plants impacts oviposition, offspring survival and fecundity in Y. evonymellus. Our hypothesis was that, under controlled conditions, females will lay eggs on the host on which they fed as larvae. We also hypothesised that the lower survival of young larvae feeding on P. serotina was due to the smaller buds and leaves present in this species, relative to those of P. padus. 3. A dual-choice experiment conducted under laboratory conditions demonstrated that females preferentially chose to oviposit on the plant species on which they fed as larvae. In the experiment, potential fecundity and offspring survival were significantly higher on P. padus than on P. serotina. The reduced performance of Y. evonymellus on P. serotina was correlated with a smaller bud mass and volume, lower leaf mass and surface area, and difficulty in constructing a protective tent against unfavourable weather conditions. 4. In summary, the identity of the host plant species during larval feeding determines adult oviposition preference for that host species. The survival of larvae on P. serotina growing in the nature is low, but for phenology-related reasons. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society","Ermine moth; Hopkins' host-selection principle; host plant choice; Lepidoptera; P. serotina; Prunus padus","bud; experiment; fecundity; host plant; host selection; leaf; moth; oviposition; phenology; plant-insect interaction; survival; Europe; Lepidoptera; Prunus padus; Prunus serotina; Yponomeuta evonymellus; Yponomeutidae",2-s2.0-85020537809

The utility of FRs for predicting impacts on prey populations by invasive fishes of different trophic guilds was tested here by comparing the FRs of the invaders Cyprinus carpio and Carassius auratus, with three native, trophically analogous fishes, Barbus barbus, Squalius cephalus and Tinca tinca. Chironomid larvae and Gammarus pulex were used as prey items. Predictions, developed from studies on the foraging of C. carpio and C. auratus in the literature, were that the invaders would have significantly higher consumption rates for chironomids than the native fishes, but not for G. pulex. Mean consumption rates for chironomids were significantly lower for both invaders than B. barbus and S. cephalus, but were similar to T. tinca. Barbus barbus had a significantly lower consumption rate of G. pulex than both invaders, but there were no significant differences between S. cephalus, T. tinca and the invaders. All FRs were type II, with FR curves for the invaders preying upon chironomids never being significantly higher than the native fishes, contrary to predictions. For G. pulex, some significant differences were apparent between the invaders and native fishes, but again were contrary to predictions. These results indicated that when predation impacts of invasive fishes could also be a function of their population density and body sizes, these parameters should be incorporated into FR models to improve impact predictions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Carassius auratus; consumption rate; Cyprinus carpio; invasion; type II functional response",,2-s2.0-84978630849

Here, we compare round goby life histories from inshore Lake Michigan and adjacent tributary systems—an uncommon case study of life-history differences between connected systems. Tributary round gobies grew much faster (average length-at-age of 122.3 vs. 65.7 mm for Age 2 + round gobies), appeared to have shorter life spans (maximum observed age of 2 vs. 5) and had lower age-at-50% maturity (1.6 vs. 2.4 years; females only) compared to gobies from Lake Michigan.

We were not able to determine the cause of the observed life-history differences. Nonetheless, the observed differences in growth, maturation and longevity were consistent with known effects of water temperature, as well as predictions of life-history theory for animals at invasion fronts exposed to novel environmental conditions.

Eradication projects require critical resource allocation decisions, as they affect both the likelihood of success and the overall cost. However, these complex decisions must often be made within data-poor environments. Here we develop a mathematical framework to assist in resource allocation for invasive species control projects and we apply it to the proposed eradication of the tropical fire ant (Solenopsis geminata) from the islands of Ashmore Reef in the Timor Sea. Our framework contains two models: a population model and a detection model. Our stochastic population model is used to predict ant abundance through time and allows us to estimate the probability of eradication. Using abundance predictions from the population model, we use the detection model to predict the probability of ant detection through time. These models inform key decisions throughout the project, which include deciding how many baiting events should take place, deciding whether to invest in detector dogs and setting surveillance effort to confirm eradication following control. We find that using a combination of insect growth regulator and toxins are required to achieve a high probability of eradication over 2 years, and we find that using two detector dogs may be more cost-effective than the use of lure deployment, provided that they are used across the life of the project.

Yet, only recently has the influence of the surrounding landscape on invasive species spread started to be considered. The scientific community increasingly recognizes the need for broader modeling framework that focuses on cross-study comparisons at different spatiotemporal scales. Using two illustrative examples, we introduce a general modeling framework that allows for a systematic investigation of the effect of habitat change on invasive species establishment and spread. The essential parts of the framework are (i) a mechanistic spatially explicit model (a modular dispersal framework—MDIG) that allows population dynamics and dispersal to be modeled in a geographical information system (GIS), (ii) a landscape generator that allows replicated landscape patterns with partially controllable spatial properties to be generated, and (iii) landscape metrics that depict the essential aspects of landscape with which dispersal and demographic processes interact. The modeling framework provides functionality for a wide variety of applications ranging from predictions of the spatiotemporal spread of real species and comparison of potential management strategies, to theoretical investigation of the effect of habitat change on population dynamics. Such a framework allows to quantify how small-grain landscape characteristics, such as habitat size and habitat connectivity, interact with life-history traits to determine the dynamics of invasive species spread in fragmented landscape. As such, it will give deeper insights into species traits and landscape features that lead to establishment and spread success and may be key to preventing new incursions and the development of efficient monitoring, surveillance, control or eradication programs. © 2017 The Authors.

This barrier to invasion may be overcome if an invader either forms novel mutualistic associations or finds and associates with familiar mutualists in the exotic range. Here, we ask (1) does the community of rhizobial mutualists associated with invasive legumes in their exotic range overlap with that of local native legumes and (2) can any differences be explained by fundamental incompatibilities with particular rhizobial genotypes? To address these questions, we first characterized the rhizobial communities naturally associating with three invasive and six native legumes growing in the San Francisco Bay Area. We then conducted a greenhouse experiment to test whether the invasive legume could nodulate with any of a broad array of rhizobia found in their exotic range. There was little overlap between the Bradyrhizobium communities associated with wild-grown invasive and native legumes, yet the invasive legumes could nodulate with a broad range of rhizobial strains under greenhouse conditions. These observations suggest that under field conditions in their exotic range, these invasive legumes are not currently associating with the mutualists of local native legumes, despite their potential to form such associations. However, the promiscuity with which these invading legumes can form mutualistic associations could be an important factor early in the invasion process if mutualist scarcity limits range expansion. Overall, the observation that invasive legumes have a community of rhizobia distinct from that of native legumes, despite their ability to associate with many rhizobial strains, challenges existing assumptions about how invading species obtain their mutualists. These results can therefore inform current and future efforts to prevent and remove invasive species. © 2017 The Authors.

Lionfish are generalist predators that impact a wide range of commercial and non-commercial species. Functional response analysis was employed to quantify interaction strength between lionfish and a generic prey species, the shrimp (Paleomonetes varians) [Leach 1814], under the contexts of differing temperature, habitat complexity and light wavelength. Lionfish have prey population destabilising Type II functional responses under all contexts examined. Significantly more prey were consumed at 26 °C than at 22 °C. Habitat complexity did not significantly alter the functional response parameters. Significantly more prey were consumed under white light and blue light than under red light. Attack rate was significantly higher under white light than under blue or red light. Light wavelength did not significantly change handling times. The impacts on prey populations through feeding rates may increase with concomitant temperature increase. As attack rates are very high at low habitat complexity this may elucidate the cause of high impact upon degraded reef ecosystems with low-density prey populations, although there was little protection conferred through habitat complexity. Only red light (i.e. dark) afforded any reduction in predation pressure. Management initiatives should account for these environmental factors when planning mitigation and prevention strategies. © 2017, The Author(s).","Feeding ecology; Functional response; Invasive species; Lionfish","crustacean; ecological impact; feeding; feeding ecology; fish; functional response; generalist; habitat structure; invasive species; juvenile; light effect; response analysis; temperature effect; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Palaemonetes; Pterois; Pterois volitans",2-s2.0-85021738888

However, management of these weeds is constrained by the practical difficulty of detecting small-scale infestations across large landscapes and by limits in understanding of landscape-scale invasion dynamics, including mechanisms that enable patches to expand, contract, or remain stable. While high-end hyperspectral remote sensing systems can effectively map vegetation cover, these systems are currently too costly and limited in availability for most land managers. We demonstrate application of a more accessible and cost-effective remote sensing approach, based on simple aerial imagery, for quantifying weed cover dynamics over time. In California annual grasslands, the target communities of interest include invasive weedy grasses (Aegilops triuncialis and Elymus caput-medusae) and desirable forage grass species (primarily Avena spp. and Bromus spp.). Detecting invasion of annual grasses into an annual-dominated community is particularly challenging, but we were able to consistently characterize these two communities based on their phenological differences in peak growth and senescence using maximum likelihood supervised classification of imagery acquired twice per year (in mid- and end-of season). This approach permitted us to map weed-dominated cover at a 1-m scale (correctly detecting 93% of weed patches across the landscape) and to evaluate weed cover change over time. We found that weed cover was more pervasive and persistent in management units that had no significant grazing for several years than in those that were grazed, whereas forage cover was more abundant and stable in the grazed units. This application demonstrates the power of this method for assessing fine-scale vegetation transitions across heterogeneous landscapes. It thus provides means for small-scale early detection of invasive species and for testing fundamental questions about landscape dynamics. © 2017 Malmstrom et al.

Across Australia's natural landscapes, feral cats typically consume 272 million birds yr− 1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 169–508 million). However, there is substantial inter-annual variation, depending on changes in the cat population that are driven by rainfall conditions: ranging between 161 million birds yr− 1 (95% CI: 114–284 million) following dry periods and 757 million birds yr− 1 (95% CI: 334–1580 million) following wet periods.

With a much sparser evidence base, we also estimate that a further 44 million birds are killed annually by feral cats in highly modified landscapes, and 61 million birds are killed annually by pet cats, summing to 377 million birds killed yr− 1 (i.e., just over 1 million birds per day) by all cats. Feral cats include a significantly higher proportion of birds in their diet than do other main mammalian predators. The national tally of birds killed by cats in Australia is broadly comparable to recent assessments for Canada, but less than that reported for the United States (because the cat population is much higher there). However, it remains challenging to interpret this mortality tally in terms of population viability or conservation concern for Australian birds. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation; Diet; Introduced predator; Island; Mortality; Predation","annual variation; diet; felid; mortality; population size; predation; predator; species conservation; Australia; Canada; United States; Aves; Mammalia",2-s2.0-85026891118

Because crowdsourcing's success depends on a mass of motivated crowdsourcees, crowdsourcing platforms have increasingly been imbued with motivational design features borrowed from games; a practice often called gamification. While the body of literature and knowledge of the phenomenon have begun to accumulate, we still lack a comprehensive and systematic understanding of conceptual foundations, knowledge of how gamification is used in crowdsourcing, and whether it is effective. We first provide a conceptual framework for gamified crowdsourcing systems in order to understand and conceptualize the key aspects of the phenomenon. The paper's main contributions are derived through a systematic literature review that investigates how gamification has been examined in different types of crowdsourcing in a variety of domains. This meticulous mapping, which focuses on all aspects in our framework, enables us to infer what kinds of gamification efforts are effective in different crowdsourcing approaches as well as to point to a number of research gaps and lay out future research directions for gamified crowdsourcing systems. Overall, the results indicate that gamification has been an effective approach for increasing crowdsourcing participation and the quality of the crowdsourced work; however, differences exist between different types of crowdsourcing: the research conducted in the context of crowdsourcing of homogenous tasks has most commonly used simple gamification implementations, such as points and leaderboards, whereas crowdsourcing implementations that seek diverse and creative contributions employ gamification with a richer set of mechanics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crowdsourcing; Gamification; Human computation; Literature review; Persuasive technology; Research agenda","Human computer interaction; Gamification; Human computation; Literature reviews; Persuasive technology; Research agenda; Crowdsourcing",2-s2.0-85019568466

In northern Japan, we sampled R. rugosa along coasts around the Soya and Tsugaru straits with different histories of the Quaternary land formation as a result of different water depths. Both cpSSR and nSSR variations suggest rare hybridization between R. rugosa and the closely related species. Variations in one of two cpSSRs showed genetic differentiation between eastern and western Hokkaido. This genetic structure may result from introgression from R. davurica in eastern Hokkaido and/or isolation between the eastern and western coastlines of Hokkaido as a result of the Quaternary land formation in the Soya Strait. On the other hand, variations in 10 nSSRs were geographically homogeneous with weak isolation by distance along coastlines.

Field experiments indicate that the biomass allocation pattern can be strongly affected by mechanical harvesting.

To examine the differences in the growth dynamics of H. nipponica and Z. marina, their morphology, density, productivity and biomass, as well as local environmental conditions, were monitored monthly from January 2008 to July 2009.

However, understanding the population dynamics of organisms that must modify their habitats in order to survive, the so-called ecosystem engineers, requires the explicit incorporation of abiotic interactions in the models. Here we study a model of ecosystem engineers that is discrete both in space and time, and where the engineers and their habitats are arranged in patches fixed to the sites of regular lattices. The growth of the engineer population is modeled by Ricker equation with a density-dependent carrying capacity that is given by the number of modified habitats. A diffusive dispersal stage ensures that a fraction of the engineers move from their birth patches to neighboring patches. We find that dispersal influences the metapopulation dynamics only in the case that the local or single-patch dynamics exhibit chaotic behavior. In that case, it can suppress the chaotic behavior and avoid extinctions in the regime of large intrinsic growth rate of the population. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Coupled map lattice; Ecosystem engineer; Niche construction","Dynamics; Ecology; Engineers; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Chaotic behaviors; Competitive interactions; Coupled map lattices; Density dependent; Ecosystem engineer; Metapopulation dynamics; Population dynamics models; Spatial dynamics; Ecosystems; behavior; growth rate; habitat; metapopulation; patch dynamics; population model",2-s2.0-85027881225

In Telecinematic Discourse (TCD), the language of fictional film and television, the notion that characters onscreen speak on behalf of someone or something else is a particularly tangible representation of the duality of communicative levels by which TCD is usually characterised. Moreover, Goffman's (1986/1974) canonical understanding of ventriloquism, as well as the employment of the same term in neuroscience, film studies and narrative theory point to additional understandings of ventriloquism that are relevant for the understanding not just of TCD, but also for humour therein.

We designed in silico a large set of primers targeting microsatellite regions (ca. 9400) from two low coverage genomes presented here.

From this dataset, a set of primer pairs (15) was validated by polymerase chain reaction with 86% consistent amplification, confirming the accuracy of the in silico prediction. Nine of the primer pairs tested were selected for population genetics and presented polymorphism in the studied populations, thus showing promising potential for future studies of this global invasive species.

Vespula germanica (Fab.) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is an invasive social wasp that frequently forages on undepleted food sources, making several flights between the resource and the nest. Previous studies have shown that during this relocating behavior, wasps learn to associate food with a certain site, and can recall this association 1 h later. In this work, we evaluated whether this wasp species is capable of retrieving an established association after 24 h. For this purpose, we trained free flying individuals to collect proteinaceous food from an experimental plate (feeder) located in an experimental array. A total of 150 individuals were allowed 2, 4, or 8 visits. After the training phase, the array was removed and set up again 24 h later, but this time a second baited plate was placed opposite to the first. After 24 h we recorded the rate of wasps that returned to the experimental area and those which collected food from the previously learned feeding station or the nonlearned one. During the testing phase, we observed that a low rate of wasps trained with 2 collecting visits returned to the experimental area (22%), whereas the rate of returning wasps trained with 4 or 8 collecting visits was higher (51% and 41%, respectively). Moreover, wasps trained with 8 feeding visits collected food from the previously learned feeding station at a higher rate than those that did from the nonlearned one. In contrast, wasps trained 2 or 4 times chose both feeding stations at a similar rate. Thus, significantly more wasps returned to the previously learned feeding station after 8 repeated foraging flights but not after only 2 or 4 visits.

This network collected environmental and genetic samples, habitat data, and management information to identify environmental and plant community associations of Phragmites invasion and patterns of management responses. Fifty managers overseeing 209 Phragmites stands in 16 US states and ON, Canada participated. Participants represented federal agencies (26%), municipalities (20%), NGOs (20%), academia (14%), state agencies (12%), and private landowners (8%). Relative to the native lineage, non-native Phragmites occurred in areas with higher nitrate/nitrite and ammonium than non-native Phragmites. Stand interiors had higher soil electrical conductivity than nearby uninvaded areas, consistent with use of road salt promoting spread of Phragmites. Non-native Phragmites co-occurred with fewer plant species than native Phragmites and was actively targeted for management. Herbicide was applied to 51% of non-native stands; surprisingly, 11% of native stands were also treated with herbicide.

Disagreements can arise among different stakeholders over whether and how their populations should be managed. The purpose of this article was to examine Tennessee, United States landowners’ attitudes toward wild hogs, to compare acceptability of control methods, and to evaluate factors significantly influencing public support for regulations to control wild hogs. Logistic regression was employed to analyze data collected from a statewide survey of rural landowners in the fall of 2015. Landowners had overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards wild hogs, and were concerned about their impact on the natural environment and rural economy. Although landowners showed support for controlling wild hogs, levels of acceptability for management options varied. Respondents favored active management and supported education and incentive-based control programs to control wild hogs. Cognitive concepts such as social and personal norms and awareness of consequences, as well as demographic characteristics, significantly predicted landowners’ support for state regulations to control wild hogs in Tennessee.

One such view comes from Bonarus of Balice, south-east Poland. Bonarus attests that although the Eurasian Lynx (Lynx Lynx) is common throughout central and eastern Europe, the best skins come from Sweden and, surprisingly, Scotland. After exploring evidence about who Bonarus was and why he might have written to Gessner, this essay builds up two possible explanations for Bonarus's opinion that Lynx populations were present in sixteenth-century Scotland: Either, native populations of European Lynxes may have still been present in Scotland in the sixteenth century; British Lynx remains have been dated to the sixth century. The Lynx could possibly have survived longer without being noticed in records if it was customarily called a ""cat"", like other large felids. However, other than Bonarus's attestation, there is only tentative positive evidence consistent with this interpretation; most importantly the ambiguous testimony of Robert Sibbald in 1684. Or, Scotland may have ""tricked"" Bonarus by importing and then re-exporting fine, exotic furs. There is evidence that Scotland had a major fur industry. Eurasian Lynx fur had a high status. Furs were commonly re-exported in the fourteenth century. Scots merchants often imported high-status furs like Lynx into Poland in the sixteenth century, suggesting that Bonarus had the highest possible chance of seeing Scottish-fashioned Lynx furs. This essay argues that, on balance of the evidence, the second interpretation is the stronger of the two, although the first is also possible. © The Society for the History of Natural History.","Conrad gessner; Iohannis bonarus; Jan boner; Wildlife history",,2-s2.0-85030758369

Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate the impact of disease transmission on the population dynamics benefits provided by group hunting. We consider a predator–prey model with foraging facilitation that can induce strong Allee effects in the predators. We extend this model by an infectious disease spreading horizontally and vertically in the predator population. The model is a system of three nonlinear differential equations. We analyze the equilibrium points and their stability as well as one- and two-parameter bifurcations. Our results show that weakly cooperating predators go unconditionally extinct for highly transmissible diseases. By contrast, if cooperation is strong enough, the social behavior mediates conditional predator persistence. The system is bistable, such that small predator populations are driven extinct by the disease or a lack of prey, and large predator populations survive because of their cooperation even though they would be doomed to extinction in the absence of group hunting. We identify a critical cooperation level that is needed to avoid the possibility of unconditional predator extinction. We also investigate how transmissibility and cooperation affect the stability of predator–prey dynamics. The introduction of parasites may be fatal for small populations of social predators that decline for other reasons. For invasive predators that cooperate strongly, biocontrol by releasing parasites alone may not be sufficient. © 2017, Society for Mathematical Biology.","Behavioral ecology; Eco-epidemiology; Foraging facilitation; Group living; Hunting cooperation; Mathematical model",,2-s2.0-85027128118

Incorporating pre- and/or post-release information such as genetic diversity and structure on these agents using molecular-based approaches could advance our knowledge of how they perform in agroecosystems. We evaluated the population genetics of Macrolophus pygmaeus, the most widely used predatory mirid against many arthropod pests of greenhouse crops in the Mediterranean region, using the mitochondrial Cytb sequence and microsatellite data, and population genetics and phylogeny approaches. We investigated commercially mass-produced insects (i.e., commercial insects either mass-reared in the laboratory for many generations, or purchased by farmers and released in the greenhouses) and “wild” insects (i.e., that occur naturally outside or are collected in nature for release in the greenhouses). The mirids were mainly collected in agroecosystems in which solanaceous plants are grown in northern Spain, southern France and Greece. Both molecular markers and approaches distinguished 2 genetically differentiated populations. The less genetically diverse population, hereafter named the “commercial” strain included all individuals from laboratory mass-rearings and most releases of commercially bred individuals. The most genetically diverse population mainly comprised individuals originating from noncultivated environments, or from releases of “wild” individuals. Rare examples of hybridization between M. pygmaeus from the 2 populations were observed and asymmetric gene flow was revealed. These findings provide new insights into what happens to M. pygmaeus released in the agroecosystems we studied, and show that it is possible to monitor some commercial strains. © 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","biological control; commercial vs. wild strains; Macrolophus pygmaeus; microsatellites; mtCytb; population genetics","animal; biological pest control; evolution; female; genetic polymorphism; genetics; Hemiptera; male; phylogeography; Southern Europe; Animals; Biological Evolution; Female; Hemiptera; Male; Mediterranean Region; Pest Control, Biological; Phylogeography; Polymorphism, Genetic",2-s2.0-84983751649

The ecohydrological response of forested wetlands following a canopy disturbance has the potential to affect critical ecosystem services, and the degree of this effect may largely depend on the wetland's hydrogeological setting. The main objectives of this study were to characterize the hydrologic connectivity of uninfested black ash wetlands and evaluate the water table response to a simulated EAB disturbance. We hypothesized that black ash wetlands in northern Michigan were (a) seasonally connected to, and derived the majority of their water from groundwater, and (b) wetland water tables would be elevated following a simulated EAB infestation due to decreased transpiration with the loss of black ash. The results indicate that the black ash wetland sites received most of their water from groundwater discharge. Significantly smaller site transpiration fluxes and significantly slower rates of drawdown were detected during the growing season in the girdled and ash-cut treatment sites, and these responses collectively produced significantly elevated wetland water tables when compared to control sites in the latter portions of the growing season. However, the wetlands' strong connection with groundwater sources likely buffered the magnitude of hydrological responses associated with the loss of black ash from the landscape.

However, severe drought is only one component of global change, and ecological effects of drought may be compounded by other drivers, such as anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition and nonnative plant invasion. Elevated N deposition, for example, may reduce drought tolerance through increased plant productivity, thereby contributing to drought-induced mortality. High N availability also often favors invasive, nonnative plant species, and the loss of woody vegetation due to drought may create a window of opportunity for these invaders. We investigated the effects of multiple levels of simulated N deposition on a Mediterranean-type shrubland plant community in southern California from 2011 to 2016, a period coinciding with an extreme, multiyear drought in the region. We hypothesized that N addition would increase native shrub productivity, but that this would increase susceptibility to drought and result in increased shrub loss over time. We also predicted that N addition would favor nonnatives, especially annual grasses, leading to higher biomass and cover of these species. Consistent with these hypotheses, we found that high N availability increased native shrub canopy loss and mortality, likely due to the higher productivity and leaf area and reduced water-use efficiency we observed in shrubs subject to N addition. As native shrub cover declined, we also observed a concomitant increase in cover and biomass of nonnative annuals, particularly under high levels of experimental N deposition. Together, these results suggest that the impacts of extended drought on shrubland ecosystems may be more severe under elevated N deposition, potentially contributing to the widespread loss of native woody species and vegetation-type conversion. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","coastal sage scrub; drought; Mediterranean-type shrublands; nitrogen deposition; nonnative plant invasion; shrub loss; vegetation-type conversion","biological invasion; drought; extreme event; global change; introduced species; Mediterranean environment; nitrogen; plant community; scrub; shrubland; vegetation type; California; United States; Poaceae; nitrogen; California; drought; ecosystem; introduced species; plant; California; Droughts; Ecosystem; Introduced Species; Nitrogen; Plants",2-s2.0-85029323501

Here, we used nuclear microsatellites to analyze genetic diversity and structure and whole mitogenomic sequences to analyze the phylogeography of Silver Carp (SC; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and Bighead Carp (BHC; H. nobilis) across their North American ranges. Our objectives were to assess: (1) the number of mitochondrial haplotypes that were introduced and how they are distributed in North America, which may provide insight into the history of the invasion, (2) how genetic diversity compares between the native Asian and introduced North American populations, (3) how genetic variation is structured across the North American ranges of SC and BHC as well as between the two species, and (4) whether patterns of genetic diversity and structure are likely to affect success of environmental DNA programs for monitoring these species. In both species, we found relatively few mitochondrial haplotypes, and most were present throughout the range. For both SC and BHC, unique haplotypes were found only in a portion of the species’ range, possibly indicating the location of additional, more recent introductions. In both species, genetic diversity was moderately lower in North American populations (i.e., 75–90% of that found in Asian populations), but genetic diversity still remained high. We found very little population genetic structure, consistent with a rapidly spreading invasive species, and did not find evidence of cryptic interspecific hybrids. The markers developed for eDNA monitoring will be effective for detecting the majority of individuals of these species in North America. The relatively high level of genetic variation and lack of population structure of SC and BHC in North America indicate that genetic diversity likely will not limit their persistence and that high connectivity will likely complicate efforts to control these invasive species. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG (outside the USA).","Bighead Carp; Genetic diversity; Genetic structure; Invasive species; Microsatellites; Mitogenome; Silver Carp","biological invasion; cyprinid; gene flow; genetic marker; genetic structure; genetic variation; genome; invasive species; phylogeography; population decline; population genetics; North America; Hypophthalmichthys; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix; Hypophthalmichthys nobilis",2-s2.0-85021068275

We examined the richness, composition and structure of the trees and shrubs in 35 urban churchyards and cemeteries in the City of Saints (Grahamstown). The combined area of urban sacred sites (38.7 ha) represented 2.2% of the city area and 13.6% of the public green space area. Species richness of woody plants was high, albeit dominated by non-native species. Levels of similarity among sites were low, indicating the effects of individual management regimens. There was no relationship between age of the site and measured attributes of the vegetation, nor were there any significant differences in vegetation among different religious denominations. However, the basal area and number of woody plants was significantly related to site size.

In this study, we used data of species inventories and GIS-based landscape elements to examine the effects of habitat size and landscape composition on the species diversity of three taxonomic groups (vascular plants, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera) in meadows and ruderal sites in the urban region of Basel, Switzerland. We also related the responses of three species traits (body size, dispersal ability and food specialisation) to habitat size in Orthoptera and Lepidoptera. We found that species of the different taxonomic groups differed in their response to habitat size and landscape composition both in meadows and ruderal sites depending on the traits examined. The species richness of Orthoptera and Lepidoptera was positively related to meadow size but not to the size of ruderal sites, while the opposite was true for plants. For Lepidoptera in ruderal sites, the percentage cover of ruderal area in the closer surroundings was a better predictor of species richness than habitat size per se. To sustain high levels of urban biodiversity, we recommend that urban planners develop adequate management strategies to satisfy the different requirements of various taxonomic groups and to increase the quality of green sites surrounding the target habitat. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Butterflies; Grasshoppers; Plant functional richness; Species–area relationship; Urbanisation",,2-s2.0-85017415107

Here we evaluate the application of novel geostatistical tools to species distribution modelling in dendritic networks, using as case study two invasive crayfish (Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus) in a Mediterranean watershed. Specifically, we used logistic mixed models to relate the probability of occurrence of each crayfish to environmental variables, while specifying three spatial autocorrelation components in random errors. These components described spatial dependencies between sites as a function of (1) straight-line distances (Euclidean model) between sites, (2) hydrologic (along the waterlines) distances between flow-connected sites (tail-up model), and (3) hydrologic distances irrespective of flow connection (tail-down model). We found a positive effect of stream order on P. clarkii, indicating an association with the lower and mid reaches of larger streams, while P. leniusculus was affected by an interaction between stream order and elevation, indicating an association with larger streams at higher altitude. For both species, models including environmental and spatial components far outperformed the pure environmental models, with the tail-up and the Euclidean components being the most important for P. clarkii and P. leniusculus, respectively.

In this study, we analyzed patterns of early summer chlorophyll-a in a large-river reservoir in response to invasion of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). We used 25 years of ecological data from a 30-km reach of Kentucky Lake collected before and after silver carp establishment. We found significant decreases in chlorophyll-a within certain reservoir habitats since establishment of silver carp.

The kelp Undaria pinnatifida is one of the most successful marine invasive species worldwide, and is widely regarded as one of the worst. Here, we review research on Undaria in Australasia, where the kelp is established throughout much of New Zealand and south-eastern Australia. The presence of Undaria for at least three decades in these locations makes Australasia one of the longest-invaded bioregions globally, and a valuable case study for considering Undaria's invasion success and associated impacts. In Australasia, Undaria has primarily invaded open spaces, turf communities, and gaps in native canopies within a relatively narrow elevation band on rocky shores. Despite its high biomass, Undaria has relatively few direct impacts on native species, and can increase community-wide attributes such as primary productivity and the provision of biogenic habitat. Therefore, Australasian Undaria research provides an example of a decoupling between the success and impact of an invasive species. Undaria will most likely continue to spread along thousands of kilometres of rocky coastline in temperate Australasia, due to its tolerance to large variations in temperature, ability to exploit disturbances to local communities, and the continued transfer among regions via vessel movements and aquaculture activities. However, the spread of Undaria remains difficult to manage as eradication is challenging and seldom successful. Therefore, understanding potential invasion pathways, maintaining native canopy-forming species that limit Undaria success, and effectively managing anthropogenic vectors of Undaria spread, should be key management priorities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Canopy-forming species; Eradication; Invasion pathways; Invasive macroalgae; Kelp; NIS; Non-indigenous; Population control; Undaria pinnatifida","Biodiversity; Nickel; Canopy-forming species; Eradication; Invasion pathways; Kelp; Macro-algae; Non-indigenous; Population control; Undaria pinnatifida; Ecosystems; biodiversity; biological invasion; ecological impact; invasibility; invasive species; macroalga; population distribution; research work; aquaculture; Australia and New Zealand; biodiversity; biomass; canopy; habitat; human; invasive species; macroalga; native species; nonhuman; population dynamics; productivity; Undaria pinnatifida; Australia; New Zealand; Undaria; Undaria pinnatifida",2-s2.0-85029861029

We reviewed the literature for negative effects of invasive species to bats and summarised threats according to four categories: predation, disease, competition, and indirect interactions. We identified threats of 37 invasive species to 40 bat species. Ten bat species were threatened by more than one invasion pathway. About 38 percent of cases are speculative and 18 percent circumstantial, many attributed to overlapping ranges, and most accounts do not quantify effects needed to forecast bat population impacts. Evidence of cat predation is frequently cited, constituting the greatest incidence of observational data. Other direct and indirect impacts were documented from goats, dogs, brown tree snake, rainbow lorikeet, rose-ringed parakeet, yellow crazy ant, giant centipede, palm, burdock, avian cholera, and white-nose syndrome. Circumstantial evidence suggests impacts by rats, stoats, coqui frog, common wolf snake, little fire ant, kudzu, and Lantana camara. Other impacts by giant centipede, yellow crazy ant, cats, goats, rats, and avian cholera are speculative, as are those from pigs, deer, white eye, common starling, house sparrow, rock dove, barn and little owls, brush-tailed possum, honeybee, wasp, phytophagous insects, tamarisk, Cinnamomum verum, and Tabebuia pallida. Over 60 percent of bat species reviewed are island-dwelling, corresponding with evidence indicating that most extinctions occur on islands and invasive species’ impacts are worse for island than mainland populations. Although appreciable bat population reductions owing to invasive species are often unproven, invasions are likely to exacerbate effects of other vulnerabilities.

Two chromosomes maintained colinearity, whereas the remaining were highly rearranged as a result of inversions and inter- and intrachromosomal translocations. We used sets of barley and wheat orthologous gene sequences to compare discrete parts of the Ae. markgrafii genome involved in the rearrangements. Analysis of sequence identity profiles and phylogenic relationships grouped chromosome blocks into two distinct clusters. Chromosome painting revealed the distribution of transposable elements and differentiated chromosome blocks into two groups consistent with the sequence analyses. These data suggest that introgressive hybridization accompanied by gross chromosome rearrangements might have had an impact on karyotype evolution and homoploid speciation in Ae. markgrafii. © 2017 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Aegilops markgrafii; chromosome rearrangements; homoploid hybrid speciation; karyotype evolution; Triticeae","Cytology; Fluorescence microscopy; Genes; Plants (botany); Aegilops; Chromosome rearrangement; Hybrid speciation; Karyotype evolution; Triticeae; Chromosomes",2-s2.0-85030170492

The phase curve is composed of a combination of reflected and thermally emitted light from the planet, and for circular orbits the phase curve peaks during the secondary eclipse or at an orbital phase of 0.5. Physical mechanisms have been discovered that shift the phase curve maximum of tidally locked close-in planets to the right, or left, of the secondary eclipse. These mechanisms include cloud formations and atmospheric superrotation, both of which serve to shift the thermally bright hot-spot or highly reflective bright spot of the atmosphere away from the sub-stellar point. Here, we present a methodology for optimizing observing strategies for both secondary eclipses and phase curves with the goal of maximizing the information gained about the planetary atmosphere while minimizing the (assumed) continuous observation time. We show that we can increase the duty cycle of observations aimed at the measurements of phase curve characteristics (amplitude, phase offset) by up to 50% for future platforms such as CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) and JWST.

The sporophytes of these lines were cultured in a tank culture system under controlled environmental conditions, and their morphological characteristics, nutrient uptake kinetics (Vmax, Ks and Vmax/Ks), and carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents were determined. Sporophytes from MAT grew faster, whereas those from SIM were smaller than those from the other sites. Although the blade thickness of sporophytes cultivated in the sea significantly differs among cultivation sites in the previous study, there was no significant difference in blade thickness among the regional lines cultivated in the tank. Sporophytes from OGA had the greatest Vmax/Ks values and significantly greater nitrogen contents than the other lines. Therefore, the morphological characteristics of MAT and SIM sporophytes, and the nutrient uptake kinetics of OGA sporophytes may have a genetic origin.

The method constructs the detectors based on the feature selection by the mutual information. These detectors serve to learn the partial appearances of target and synchronously evaluate image locations via the voting based detection with the generalized Hough transform. According to the result of detections, the best detector is selected by the minimum entropy criterion and delivers the final hypotheses for target location. The feature selection allows our tracker to be able to obtain and use the most discriminative parts of target and thus more robust to its changes, e.g. occlusion and deformation. The detector selection can correct undesirable model updates and restore the tracker after tracking failure. Meanwhile, the Hough-based detection can reduce the amount of noise introduced during online self-training and thus effectively prevent the tracker from drifting.

Few studies have addressed the underlying processes by dissecting how biotic resistance to new invaders may be shaped by the same environmental influences that determine diversity and other community properties. In grasslands with heterogeneous soils, we added invaders and removed competitors to analyze the causes of invasion resistance. Abiotic resistance was measured using invader success in the absence of the resident community. Biotic resistance was measured as the reduction in invader success in the presence of the resident community. Invaders were most successful where biotic resistance was lowest and abiotic resistance was highest, confirming the dominant role of biotic resistance. Contrary to theory, though, biotic resistance was highest where both species richness and functional diversity were lowest. In the multivariate framework of a structural equation model, biotic resistance was independent of community diversity, and was highest where fertile soils led to high community biomass. Seed predation slightly augmented biotic resistance without qualitatively changing the results. Soil-related genotypic variation in the invader also did not affect the results. We conclude that in natural systems, diversity may be correlated with invasibility and yet have little effect on biotic resistance to invasion.

To determine traits that predict at-risk status for freshwater fishes in Canada a classification and regression tree analysis was performed using a suite of ecological and life-history traits, and the species’ distributions in Canada. Range-edge distribution in Canada was a significant predictor of a species assessed as at risk by COSEWIC and to be listed as at risk under SARA. Other predictive traits included Balon reproductive guild, reproductive age/maximum age ratio, and lifespan. Species with economic value were also not likely to be assessed as at risk by COSEWIC. Analyses showed greater inconsistency in listing status under SARA than COSEWIC assessment, and a bias toward not listing species, despite predicted at-risk status, was evident.

Assessing when and how a species was introduced are central to managing these transformed landscapes, particularly in island environments. In the Gulf of Alaska, there is considerable interest in the history of mammal introductions and rehabilitating Gulf of Alaska island environments by eradicating mammals classified as invasive species. The Arctic ground squirrel (Urocitellus parryii) is of concern because it affects vegetation and seabirds on Gulf of Alaska islands. This animal is assumed to have been introduced by historic settlers; however, ground squirrel remains in the prehistoric archaeological record of Chirikof Island, Alaska, challenge this timeline and suggest they colonized the islands long ago. We used 3 lines of evidence to address this problem: direct radiocarbon dating of archaeological squirrel remains; evidence of prehistoric human use of squirrels; and ancient DNA analysis of dated squirrel remains. Chirikof squirrels dated to at least 2000 years ago, and cut marks on squirrel bones suggested prehistoric use by people. Ancient squirrels also shared a mitochondrial haplotype with modern Chirikof squirrels. These results suggest that squirrels have been on Chirikof longer than previously assumed and that the current population of squirrels is closely related to the ancient population. Thus, it appears ground squirrels are not a recent, human-mediated introduction and may have colonized the island via a natural dispersal event or an ancient human translocation. © 2016 The Authors.

A scenario approach was developed to explore the plausible futures of the French bovine sector and their impact on climate change. These scenarios encompass a Business As Usual scenario (S1-BAU) and alternative contrasting scenarios: (S2) cattle production increase to meet a high global demand under a liberal policy, (S3) refocus on internal demand within France, with an upmarket move to ‘green’ products, (S4) committed public policy to reduce GHG emissions. This paper analyses how key drivers of these scenarios (e.g. subsidies on investment, reduction of market risks, carbon tax, limitation of concentrate feed in animal diets) affect the evolution of production, economics, and environmental impact on climate change of typical French suckler cow and dairy farms, by means of simulations performed with a bio-economic model. To adapt their farming systems to the scenarios, farms can opt for variably intensive/integrated practices per animal and per unit land area. Some technological progress in animal production, crop production, and farm equipment is also modeled. Results show that in S1-BAU, milk production, net income and impact on climate change of dairy farms rise. Beef production and impact on climate change decrease slightly in suckler cow farms. Impact on climate change per unit of product decreases owing to higher productivity per animal and to a more integrated management of crop production. Alternative scenarios underline that reorienting public support toward farm investment would further intensify dairy farms and increase their income, but would reduce production and income of suckler cow farms and favor crop production (S2). Climate change impact per unit of product is more strongly reduced in S3 (organic farming with low feed concentrate) than in S2, but with a reduced production, particularly for milk. A carbon tax decreases emissions, but to the detriment of cattle production, especially suckler cow farms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-economic model; Cattle farms; Greenhouse gas emissions; Intensification; Prospective","agricultural emission; agricultural intensification; cattle; climate change; crop production; economic analysis; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; farming system; greenhouse gas; investment; liberalization; pollution tax; France; Animalia; Bos; Bovinae",2-s2.0-85026651440

Egg recognition occurs in a variety of birds that retrieve eggs displaced from the nest. Egg recognition and rejection is also a particularly widespread defence against brood parasites. We studied egg retrieval and rejection in the American coot, Fulica americana, a species with high levels of conspecific brood parasitism. Previous work revealed that hosts recognize and reject many parasitic eggs. We conducted experiments to determine whether coots also show egg retrieval behaviour and, if they do, whether the same cues trigger retrieval and rejection. If these two responses share the same general cognitive mechanism, a given egg phenotype should elicit the same retrieval and rejection response (with the realization that failure to retrieve is analogous to rejecting eggs). Coots retrieved many eggs and objects placed on their nest rims. All coot eggs were retrieved, including eggs of other conspecific females, and most chicken eggs were also retrieved. The retrieval of a moderate proportion of non-egg-shaped objects like cubes and cylinders shows that an egg shape is not essential for retrieval. Two observations suggest that egg retrieval and rejection are triggered by different cues. The nonretrieval rates of parasitic eggs differed significantly from the corresponding egg rejection rates obtained in an earlier study. Moreover, a moderate fraction of retrieved eggs and objects were subsequently rejected soon after being retrieved. The rejection of the same eggs that were previously retrieved into the nest underscores the remarkable sensitivity of retrieval and rejection decisions to slight changes in an egg's location; a difference of a few centimetres triggers a very different response mechanism. Overall, our findings suggest that selection from brood parasitism has not shaped the evolution of egg retrieval in coots. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","American coot; brood parasitism; cognition; egg adoption; egg recognition; egg rejection; egg retrieval; recognition cues","adoption behavior; behavioral response; bird; brood parasitism; cognition; conspecific; egg; egg rejection; environmental cue; phenotype; recognition; Aves; Fulica americana; Rallidae",2-s2.0-85029718524

Seventy-four undergraduate students aged 18–29 years were tested. In line with study aims, results indicated that the virtual blood draw paradigm promoted strong perceptions of arm ownership and elicited significant changes in physiological indices (blood pressure, heart rate, electrodermal activity, respiratory rate) in response to key procedure elements (e.g., needle insertion).

Methods: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to isolate all patients aged 18 years who had a discharge International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis of ARDS, with and without procedure codes for ECMO, between 2006 and 2011. Results: We examined a total of 47 911 414 hospital discharges, representing 235 911 271 hospitalizations using national weights. Of the 1 479 022 patients meeting the definition of ARDS (representing 7 281 206 discharges), 775 underwent ECMO. There was a 409% relative increase in the use of ECMO for ARDS in the United States between 2006 and 2011, from 0.0178% to 0.090% (P =.0041). Patients treated with ECMO had higher in-hospital mortality (58.6% vs 25.1%, P <.0001) and longer hospital stays (15.8 days vs 6.9 days, P <.0001). They were also younger (47.9 vs 66.4 years, P <.0001) and more likely to be male (62.2% vs 49.6%, P <.0001). The median time to initiate ECMO from the time of admission was 0.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 4.9 days).

This study leveraged a naturally occurring change to massively multiplayer online game avatars to conduct a field quasiexperiment to investigate whether enhanced avatar anthropomorphism influences PAX dimensions: emotional investment, anthropomorphic autonomy, suspension of disbelief, and sense of control. Longitudinal analysis showed that enhanced anthropomorphism had no significant impact on any PAX dimension immediately or over time, when controlling for demographic and gameplay variables.

Among these algorithms, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has the advantages of fast computation speed and few parameters. However, PSO is prone to premature convergence. To solve this problem, we develop a new PSO algorithm (RPSOLF) by combining the characteristics of random learning mechanism and Levy flight. The RPSOLF algorithm increases the diversity of the population by learning from random particles and random walks in Levy flight. On the one hand, we carry out a large number of numerical experiments on benchmark test functions, and compare these results with the PSO algorithm with Levy flight (PSOLF) algorithm and other PSO variants in previous reports. The results show that the optimal solution can be found faster and more efficiently by the RPSOLF algorithm. On the other hand, the RPSOLF algorithm can also be applied to optimize the Lennard-Jones clusters, and the results indicate that the algorithm obtains the optimal structure (2–60 atoms) with an extraordinary high efficiency.

However, meeting these demands can be difficult because information on ecosystem-level factors controlling vegetation and continuous spatial data on species interactions are often lacking. Using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data from a Hawaiian dry forest, we delineated crowns and assessed the 3D structure of more than 700 000 shrubs and trees. We used Random Forest machine learning to assess the relative importance of resource availability, environmental conditions, and disturbance regimes on canopy density. We then modelled and scaled up plant–plant interactions (i.e. potential nursery effects) to landscape units using a LiDAR-derived Canopy Coalescence (CC) index. We used the relative importance of ecosystem factors, canopy cover, and CC index to prioritize landscapes for restoration. Here, we demonstrate a methodological framework that prioritizes landscapes in need of restoration (i.e. planting woody species) using two ecological perspectives: (i) ecosystem-level controls on remnant woody vegetation, and (ii) potential interactions between established canopies and seedlings (e.g. nursery effect, competition). Our results highlight the heterogeneous nature of ecosystem-level drivers affecting forest structure along elevation gradients. Consequently, the degree of potential nursery interactions between established canopies and seedlings at the landscape-scale was context-specific. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides a methodological approach that prioritizes landscapes for restoration by identifying the main controls on tree spatial distribution and by inferring the favourable conditions for seedlings.

We investigate pollination syndromes in Balsaminaceae, utilizing quantitative respectively categorical data sets of flower morphometry, signal and reward traits for 86 species to test for the effect of different types of data on the test patterns retrieved. Cluster Analyses of the floral traits are used in combination with independent pollinator observations. Based on quantitative data we retrieve seven clusters, six of them corresponding to plausible pollination syndromes and one additional, well-supported cluster comprising highly divergent floral architectures. This latter cluster represents a non-syndrome of flowers not segregated by the specific data set here used. Conversely, using categorical data we obtained only a rudimentary resolution of pollination syndromes, in line with several earlier studies. The results underscore that the use of functional, exactly quanitified trait data has the power to retrieve pollination syndromes circumscribed by the specific data used. Data quality can, however, not be replaced by sheer data volume. With this caveat, it is possible to identify pollination syndromes from large datasets and to reliably extrapolate them for taxa for which direct observations are unavailable. © 2017 Abrahamczyk et al.

In each of four lakes, we randomly chose two EWM beds for stocking and two beds as controls. A total of ca. 40,000 weevils were added to the eight stocked beds. During June and August 2013–2015, we measured plant diversity, biomass of EWM and native plants, and weevil abundance in the 16 study beds. Background weevil densities varied widely among beds and were often greater than the densities stocked. Weevil stocking had no significant effect on EWM or native plant biomass. Nevertheless, weevil damage to EWM was common and its extent appeared strongly related to observed densities of the weevil. ANCOVA results indicated that weevil density was a significant predictor of EWM biomass in both June and August, but not on growth during summer. Overall, our study found that weevil density is an important factor for predicting EWM biomass, while weevil density is likely affected by a large number of environmental factors.

Rational utilization of wheat leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes is still the best choice for control this disease. Wheat seedlings carrying Lr19 showed a high resistance phenotype to all Pt races in China. So far, all the cloned seedling Lr genes including Lr1, Lr10 and Lr21, encode protein with NBS-LRR domain. In this study, a wheat gene with NBS-LRR domain from previously established Lr19-resistance-related cDNA library was cloned and designated as TaRGA19. Full length of this gene was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). By blast against IWGSC wheat genome database, we have noticed that TaRGA19 was located on chromosome 2DS, which was different from Lr19 located on chromosome 7DL. Compared with susceptible Thatcher line, expression level of TaRGA19 was upregulated in wheat isogenic lines carrying Lr19 (TcLr19) after inoculation of Pt race THTS. By particle bombardment, TaRGA19-GFP fused protein was localized on plasma membrane of epidermal cells. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), TaRGA19-knockdown plants of TcLr19 showed reduced resistance and few sporulation phenotype upon Pt challenge. Further histological observation indicated that Pt hyphal growth at the infection sites was less suppressed in the TaRGA19-knockdown plants. In conclusion, we speculate this TaRGA19 gene was involved in the Lr19-mediated resistance to wheat leaf rust along with other components. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Gene TaRGA19; Puccinia triticina; Subcellular localization; Virus induced gene silencing; Wheat leaf rust resistance",,2-s2.0-85027545055

Solms Pontederiaceae) mainly occurs as a free-floating aquatic plant, but can survive decreasing water levels when rooted in soil. This adaptation to seasonal fluctuations in hydrology may contribute to its invasive potential in natural and man-made water bodies, where stranded plants can take root. To understand how water hyacinth plants rooted in saturated-soil compared to floating conspecifics, we conducted a month long mesocosm growth experiment in a well fertilised outdoor pool (experiment one) comparing plant traits between treatments. Following this, we investigated the effect of water stress on the plants rooted in soil, by conducting a progressive and prolonged drought (experiment two). We simultaneously investigated the effect of nutrient depletion in the mesocosm, on both the floating plants and those in saturated-soil. Plant physiological parameters were measured on these treatments. Plants were re-watered after the drought to assess mortality at two different drought intensities. Floating plants produced a larger total leaf area compared to plants rooted in saturated-soil, however, plants in both treatments developed a similar number of leaves and ramets. Progressive drought reduced photosynthesis, which was attributed to both stomatal and metabolic limitations. Nutrient stress reduced photosynthesis more in floating plants than rooted plants, and these reductions in photosynthesis were solely attributed to metabolic limitations caused by a decreased chlorophyll content. Plants recovered from prolonged drought but not prolonged severe drought. Water-stressed water hyacinth exhibited a drought avoidance strategy, a trait which may contribute to its ability to persist in variable aquatic environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Drought avoidance; Leaf water content; Management; Plant traits; Recovery; Stomatal and metabolic limitations","adaptation; aquatic plant; avoidance reaction; drought; drought stress; ecophysiology; leaf; leaf area; metabolism; morphology; mortality; nutrient availability; photosynthesis; seasonal variation; stomata; survival; water content; water stress; Eichhornia crassipes; Pontederiaceae",2-s2.0-85029800937

We studied foliar isoprenoid emissions, phenology, growth and survival rates on Quercus pubescens (QP) and Quercus ilex (QI) saplings growing in competition with herbaceous species under three temperature treatments (ambient, +1.5, +3 °C) combined with two precipitation treatments (normal, −30 % precipitation). Elevated temperature treatments significantly enhanced isoprenoid emissions of both species (~70 %). Most of this enhancement could be attributed to increases in the foliar emission capacities. Reduced precipitation tended to decrease isoprenoid emissions (~20 %), but this effect was variable depending on plant species, measurement period and interaction with temperature treatments. In QP, measured early summer, most of the emission variability was associated with that of photosynthesis while in QI, measured mid-summer, emissions and photosynthesis were rather uncoupled probably due to changes in resource allocation and persistent impairment of the primary metabolism caused by stress. Elevated temperature reduced sapling survival rates of both species (~20 %) but increased longevity of QP leaves (~18 %). Leaf biomasses at plant and community level were not affected by treatments but were strongly reduced by the presence of herbaceous competitors.

Using locally adapted ecosystem service tools and historical management costs, we quantified spatially explicit management costs and benefits (in terms of groundwater recharge and landscape flammability) to assist a state agency in evaluating cobenefits for a predefined restoration scenario (focused on biodiversity benefits) and to prioritize an expanded restoration scenario in the state-managed Pu'u Wa'awa'a watershed ( Hawai'i) now and under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 midcentury climate scenario. Restoring all available areas increases recharge by ∼1.74 million m3/yr (5% of recharge over the entire watershed) under the current climate and does not meaningfully change recharge under RCP 8.5 midcentury, whereas climate change decreases recharge by ∼50%. For landscape flammability, climate change increases the median and maximum probability of fire occurrence across all land use scenarios, and full restoration results in the greatest reduction in landscape flammability under both current and RCP 8.5 midcentury climate scenarios. We demonstrate that location and type of forest restoration influence overall cost-effectiveness of restoration, providing insights for landscape planning for ecosystem services under a limited budget. Across all scenarios, capturing potential benefits at low elevations requires greater expenditures (13,161/ ha) than at high elevations (5,501/ ha) due mainly to the substantial costs of removing Pennisetum setaceum (fountain grass), the dominant land cover below 1,000 m. If management focuses on groundwater recharge only, the most cost-effective areas occur at high elevations (&gt;1,000 m), with ample fog interception, although recharge benefits decline across the landscape under RCP 8.5 midcentury. Focusing instead on cost-effective landscape flammability reduction as the primary management objective shifts emphasis toward dry low-elevation areas under the current climate. However, under the RCP 8.5 midcentury scenario, the most cost-effective areas for flammability management shift toward higher elevations with greater potential overlap with recharge benefits.",,"adaptive management; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; dry forest; ecosystem service; environmental restoration; estimation method; grass; land cover; landscape change; landscape planning; spatial analysis; water yield; watershed; Hawaii [United States]; United States; Pennisetum setaceum",2-s2.0-85030315804

To assess the impact of regional extinction on the loss of genetic diversity in affected cage-birds, we obtained > 18,000 genome-wide markers across 60 Southeast Asian samples of the white-rumped shama (Copsychus malabaricus), a prized songbird that has gone extinct across wide swathes of its Southeast Asian range following heavy poaching. High levels of genomic uniformity across its mainland Southeast Asian range indicate that future reintroductions of birds from regions with less poaching could help bolster populations in regions with intense poaching pressure. Genomic assignment tests demonstrate that birds in the only Sundaic country with strict enforcement of poaching bans, Singapore, are a mosaic of both native populations and escaped cage-birds of mostly peninsular Malaysian origin, indicating that inadvertent reintroductions of caged shamas have led to the recovery of a local population that was nearly extinct and now constitutes a safe haven for the subspecies tricolor.

However, the plant species determining the ecosystem properties and plant community dynamics may not be the dominant, especially when it is exotic. Understanding plant community dynamics in ecosystems that are uncharacterized and/or affected by invasive plant species requires a data-driven approach and proper placement of monitoring plots. To generate robust datasets on vegetation change through time, monitoring plot placement must consider the scale of ecological variation for both vegetation and soils and plots would ideally be replicated within similar ecological site types to quantify the consistency of successional transitions. We characterized soil and vegetation across and within seven floodplains affected by Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia L.) along the Yellowstone River in southeastern Montana, USA. Using modern Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and multivariate net differentiation, we identified five distinct plant community types, or classes, characterized by their tertiary woody plant cover, not the primary species, Russian olive. Our findings indicate that Russian olive communities differ across space, and these riparian areas can be classified into distinct plant community types. Characterizing plant community types via this analytical approach should allow practitioners to modify management decisions and forecast succession within relevant plant communities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Such collapses can have disastrous consequences, for example, for loss of biodiversity. In this paper, we formulate a stage-structured consumer-resource biomass model in which adults only reproduce at the beginning of each growing season, and investigate the effect of an increasing stage-independent background mortality rate of the consumer. As the main difference with previously studied continuous-time models, seasonal reproduction can result in an Allee effect and consumer population collapses at high consumer mortality rate. However, unlike the mechanisms reported in the literature, in our model the Allee effect results from the time difference between the maturation of juveniles and the reproduction of adults. The timing of maturation plays a crucial role because it not only determines the body size of the individuals at maturation but also influences the duration of the period during which adults can invest in reproductive energy, which together determine the reproductive output at the end of the season. We suggest that there exists an optimal timing of maturation and that consumer persistence is promoted if individuals mature later in the season at a larger body size, rather than maturing early, despite high food availability supporting rapid growth. © 2017 Sun, de Roos.

From August 2014 to July 2015, samples of rainwater, river water, groundwater, bulk soil water at five soil depths (i.e. 0–30, 30–60, 60–90, 90–120, 120–150 cm), and xylem water of G. biloba, were collected and their δ18O and δ2H values were measured. Generally, the δ18O and δ2H values for xylem water, groundwater, and soil water clustered together and separated from those of river water, suggesting the possible occurrence of ecohydrological separation. However, the line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) values of most xylem water were positive, indicating a mixture of different water sources. Significant correlations were observed between the contributions of precipitation, soil water, and groundwater to water uptake by G. biloba, further supporting ecohydrological connectivity rather than ecohydrological separation. G. biloba switched its major water sources from soil water at 0–60 cm depth and precipitation in the wet summer, to soil water from &gt;90 cm depth and groundwater in the dry winter. The river water was a minor water source for G. biloba, but its contribution was comparatively greater at the site closest to the river bank. Our findings contribute to understanding of plant–soil–water relationships and the water balance, and may provide important information for investigations of nutrient sources and sinks in riparian zones.

Here, we used comparative functional response analyses to assess how predator-prey interactions between dogfish and invertebrate prey change under different warming scenarios. The Functional Response Type, attack rate, handling time and maximum feeding rate estimates were calculated for Scyliorhinus canicula preying upon Echinogammarus marinus under temperatures of 11.3 °C and 16.3 °C, which represent both the potential daily variation and predicted higher summer temperatures within Strangford Lough, N. Ireland. A two x two design of “Predator Acclimated”, “Prey Acclimated”, “Both Acclimated”, and “Both Unacclimated” was implemented to test functional responses to temperature rise. Attack rate was higher at 11.3 °C than at 16.3 °C, but handling time was lower and maximum feeding rates were higher at 16.3 °C. Non-acclimated predators had similar maximum feeding rate towards non-acclimated and acclimated prey, whereas acclimated predators had significantly higher maximum feeding rates towards acclimated prey as compared to non-acclimated prey. Results suggests that the predator attack rate is decreased by increasing temperature but when both predator and prey are acclimated the shorter handling times considerably increase predator impact. The functional response of the fish changed from Type II to Type III with an increase in temperature, except when only the prey were acclimated. This change from population destabilizing Type II to more stabilizing Type III could confer protection to prey at low densities but increase the maximum feeding rate by Scyliorhinus canicula in the future. However, predator movement between different thermal regimes may maintain a Type II response, albeit with a lower maximum feeding rate. This has implications for the way the increasing population Scyliorhinus canicula in the Irish Sea may exploit valuable fisheries stocks in the future. © 2017, The Author(s).","Climate change; Feeding ecology; Functional response; Thermal responses","acclimation; amphipod; climate change; community structure; diurnal variation; functional response; handling time; population dynamics; predation; predator; predator-prey interaction; shark; temperature gradient; thermal regime; Atlantic Ocean; Irish Sea; Northern Ireland; Strangford Lough; United Kingdom; Echinogammarus marinus; Invertebrata; Scyliorhinus canicula; Squalus acanthias",2-s2.0-85026457137

The genetic architectures of many species are always shaped by environmental constraints. Because little is known about the ecological and genetic traits of Tunisian whitefly populations, the main objective of this work is to highlight patterns of biodiversity, genetic structure and migration routes of this pest. We used nuclear microsatellite loci to analyze B. tabaci populations collected from various agricultural areas across the country and we determine their biotype status. Molecular data were subsequently interpreted in an ecological context supplied from a species distribution model to infer habitat suitability and hereafter the potential connection paths between sampling localities. An analysis of landscape resistance to B. tabaci genetic flow was thus applied to take into account habitat suitability, genetic relatedness and functional connectivity of habitats within a varied landscape matrix. We shed light on the occurrence of three geographically delineated genetic groups with high levels of genetic differentiation within each of them. Potential migration corridors of this pest were then established providing significant advances toward the understanding of genetic features and the dynamic dispersal of this pest. This study supports the hypothesis of a long-distance dispersal of B. tabaci followed by infrequent long-term isolations.

We investigated the complex relationships among weather, fine fuels, and fire in the Great Basin, USA. We first modeled the annual and time-lagged effects of precipitation and temperature on herbaceous vegetation cover and litter accumulation over a 26-year period in the northern Great Basin. We then modeled how these fine fuels and weather patterns influence subsequent wildfires. We found that cheatgrass cover increased in years with higher precipitation and especially when one of the previous 3 years also was particularly wet. Cover of non-native forbs and native herbs also increased in wet years, but only after several dry years. The area burned by wildfire in a given year was mostly associated with native herb and non-native forb cover, whereas cheatgrass mainly influenced area burned in the form of litter derived from previous years’ growth. Consequently, multiyear weather patterns, including precipitation in the previous 1–3 years, was a strong predictor of wildfire in a given year because of the time needed to develop these fine fuel loads. The strong relationship between precipitation and wildfire allowed us to expand our inference to 10,162 wildfires across the entire Great Basin over a 35-year period from 1980 to 2014. Our results suggest that the region's precipitation pattern of consecutive wet years followed by consecutive dry years results in a cycle of fuel accumulation followed by weather conditions that increase the probability of wildfire events in the year when the cycle transitions from wet to dry. These patterns varied regionally but were strong enough to allow us to model annual wildfire risk across the Great Basin based on precipitation alone. © 2017 The Authors.

Although context dependent, these native ecosystems subjected to prolonged invasion by exotic plants may be instrumental in distinguishing the role of plant–microbe–mineral interactions from the broader edaphic and climatic influences on the formation of soil organic matter (SOM). We hypothesized that the soils subjected to prolonged invasion by an exotic plant that input recalcitrant litter (Japanese knotweed, Polygonum cuspidatum) would have a greater proportion of plant-derived carbon (C) in the aggregate fractions, as compared with that in adjacent soil inhabited by native vegetation that input labile litter, whereas the soils under an invader that input labile litter (kudzu, Pueraria lobata) would have a greater proportion of microbial-derived C in the silt-clay fraction, as compared with that in adjacent soils that receive recalcitrant litter. At the knotweed site, the higher C content in soils under P. cuspidatum, compared with noninvaded soils inhabited by grasses and forbs, was limited to the macroaggregate fraction, which was abundant in plant biomarkers. The noninvaded soils at this site had a higher abundance of lignins in mineral and microaggregate fractions and suberin in the macroaggregate fraction, partly because of the greater root density of the native species, which might have had an overriding influence on the chemistry of the above-ground litter input. At the kudzu site, soils under P. lobata had lower C content across all size fractions at a 0–5 cm soil depth despite receiving similar amounts of Pinus litter. Contrary to our prediction, the noninvaded soils receiving recalcitrant Pinus litter had a similar abundance of plant biomarkers across both mineral and aggregate fractions, potentially because of the higher surface area of soil minerals at this site. The plant biomarkers were lower in the aggregate fractions of the P. lobata-invaded soils, compared with noninvaded pine stands, potentially suggesting a microbial co-metabolism of pine-derived compounds.

Most research has focused on understanding sources of variation in seed loss, without appreciating the implications of seed predation for plant coexistence, community assembly and broader community theory. Meanwhile, research aimed at understanding coexistence and community assembly processes in plant communities has focused on axes of dispersal and resource competition and the traits influencing these processes, without accounting for the role of generalist seed predators. We review the unique features of post-dispersal seed predation and assess the implications of seed loss on three critical components of plant community organization – coexistence, community structure and plant invasions – pointing to both important gaps in theory and empirical knowledge. We highlight how understanding fundamental controls on plant recruitment is central to determining how seed predation affects plant recruitment and coexistence. We discuss how accounting for seed predator foraging strategies may shift trait-based inferences of community assembly. Synthesis. We argue that seed predation by generalist consumers, which is pervasive in temperate communities, should be better incorporated into plant community theory. Experiments that specifically incorporate the presence and attributes of the seed predator community and that follow seed fate would fill important knowledge gaps. Particularly needed are studies focused on strengthening the connections between seed removal and plant establishment and linking selective and density-dependent foraging strategies to plant traits.

However, little information exists about the effects that these feeding points have on rarer species that feed there, some of which are of conservation concern. This study focuses on the influence of PAFS and their spatial location on the distribution of territories of the endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus. We analysed a population in the NE Iberian Peninsula that has in recent decades expanded its range. We used both null model and linear model analyses to ascertain the effect of PAFS and other covariates on the occupancy of territories by the study species. PAFS appeared to play an important role in territory selection by Egyptian Vultures, as occupied territories were nearer landfills than expected by chance. Furthermore, the distance from PAFS (landfills and vulture feeding stations, or ‘restaurants’) played an important role in the probability of territory occupancy by Egyptian Vultures, in addition to other environmental variables such as surface areas of rocky south-facing slopes, human settlement and the proximity of conspecifics. However, recent EU legislation aims to phase out open-air landfills to reduce the negative environmental effects of these facilities. This could have an undesired impact on the endangered species that use these feeding points. We recommend management measures that can control abundant pest species but, in the long term, other measures as supplementary feeding should be considered to counteract the probable negative effect of the disappearance of landfills on endangered species. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union","null model; predictable anthropogenic food subsidies; rubbish dumps; scavengers; threatened species; vulture restaurants","bird; breeding population; conservation status; conspecific; endangered species; European Union; human activity; human settlement; landfill; pest species; rare species; scavenger; Iberian Peninsula; Animalia; Neophron percnopterus",2-s2.0-85019931436

The invasion of benthic habitats by dreissenid mussels has led to systemic changes and native faunal declines. Size-dependent physiological rates, spatial differences and connectivity, competition, and differential population dynamics among invertebrate groups contributed to the change and system complexity. We developed a spatially explicit, individual-based mechanistic model of the benthic ecosystem in Lake Ontario, with coupling to the pelagic system, to examine ecosystem dynamics and effects of dreissenid mussel invasion and native fauna losses. Benthic organisms were represented by functional groups; filter-feeders (i.e., dreissenid mussels), surface deposit-feeders (e.g., native amphipod Diporeia spp.), and deposit-feeders (e.g., oligochaetes and other burrowers). The model was stable, represented ecological structure and function effectively, and reproduced observed effects of the mussel invasion. Two hypotheses for causes of Diporeia loss, competition or disease-like mortality, were tested. Simple competition for food did not explain observed declines in native surface deposit-feeders during the filter-feeder invasion. However, the elevated mortality scenario supports a disease-like cause for loss of the native amphipod, with population changes in various lake areas and altered benthic biomass transfers. Stabilization of mussel populations and possible recovery of the native, surface-deposit feeding amphipod were predicted. Although further research is required on forcing functions, model parameters, and natural conditions, the model provides a valuable tool to help managers understand the benthic system and plan for response to future disruptions. © 2017","Benthic ecosystem; Freshwater Great Lakes; Individual-based simulation model; Lower trophic level ecology; Size dependency","Aquatic ecosystems; Deposits; Ecosystems; Feeding; Lakes; Molluscs; Pathology; Benthic ecosystems; Great lakes; Individual-based simulations; Size dependency; Trophic level; Ecology; amphipod; benthic environment; biological invasion; bivalve; complexity; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem function; environmental stress; feeding ecology; filter feeder; individual-based model; lacustrine environment; mortality; size structure; trophic level; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Ontario; Creediidae; Dreissenidae; Invertebrata; Oligochaeta (Metazoa)",2-s2.0-85017380213

The effects of T. chinensis on plant diversity and growth of herbaceous community were negative in the degraded succession but facilitative in the positive succession. Solar irradiance was the only environmental factor investigated that was significant for species’ proximity to the shrub in the degraded succession, while both aboveground (solar irradiance) and belowground environmental factors (soil electrical conductivity, water content, nitrogen concentration) played an important role in the positive succession. The performances of dominant herbaceous species in interaction with T. chinensis were both species-specific and traits-specific. Of all investigated factors, both solar irradiance and soil electrical conductivity significantly affected by the shrub and were the key factors for plant growth and leaf nutrient concentration at the species level. Thus, T. chinensis played an important role in the succession processes of the coastal wetland, but mainly in the positive succession stage and less in the degraded succession. © 2017, Society of Wetland Scientists.","Chinese saltcedar; Degraded succession; Nursery effect; Positive succession; Species interaction","coastal water; competition (ecology); dominance; electrical conductivity; environmental factor; facilitation; herb; intraspecific interaction; irradiance; nursery ground; plant community; shrub; succession; China; Laizhou Bay; Shandong; Tamarix chinensis",2-s2.0-85020379370

Understanding pollination dynamics in agricultural systems is thus essential to help maintain this ecosystem service in the face of human disturbances. Surprisingly, our understanding of plant–pollinator interactions in widely distributed smallholder agricultural systems is still limited. Knowledge of pollination dynamics in these agricultural systems is necessary to fully assess how human disturbances may affect pollination services worldwide. In this study, we describe the structure of a plant–floral visitor network in a smallholder Cucurbitaceae agricultural system. We further identify the main floral visitors of these crops and tested their importance by simulating how their extinction affected network structure and robustness. The observed network was highly connected and generalized but it was neither nested nor compartmentalized. Our results suggest that the structure of agricultural plant–pollinator networks could be inherently different from those in natural communities. These differences in network structure may reflect differences in spatial distribution of floral resources between agricultural and natural systems. We identified Augochlora nigrocyanea and Peponapis limitaris as the two most frequent floral visitors. However, removal of these species did not affect network structure or its robustness, suggesting high levels of interaction rewiring. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to describe the structure of a plant–floral visitor network in diverse agricultural systems in the tropics. We emphasize the need for more studies that evaluate network structure in agricultural systems if we want to fully elucidate the impact of human disturbances on this key ecosystem service. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Crops; Cucurbitaceae; Interaction network; Pollination; Smallholder agriculture; Tropics","agricultural ecosystem; agroecology; crop plant; extinction; farming system; flora; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; spatial distribution; Animalia; Augochlora; Cucurbitaceae",2-s2.0-85018836644

Recent work demonstrates that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) can be important seed dispersers in North American forests, potentially moving seeds over long distances. However, little is known about the role of deer as seed dispersal agents in landscapes characterized by small, isolated forest patches. The objectives of this study were to (a) determine how habitat structure influenced the spatial distribution of deer activity, and (b) describe which plant species and traits were dispersed by deer in a highly fragmented, agricultural matrix. I collected deer fecal pellet groups from 10 forest patches in plots that ranged from 10 to 100 m from forest edge. Pellet groups were cold-stratified and planted in a greenhouse to quantify seeds dispersed by deer. The number of pellet groups collected was highest near forest edges but was not influenced by patch size or isolation; 258 seedlings from 15 species emerged from collected pellets, with three species contributing 80% of seedlings. Most seedlings emerging from deer pellets were herbaceous, nonnative plants with a foliage-as-fruit dispersal mode. Plants with these traits typically perform well in high-light habitats, such as forest edges, where deer are most active. These results suggest that while seed dispersal by deer is common in highly fragmented forest patches, it is most likely to benefit shade-intolerant herbaceous species, maintaining populations of those plants along forest edges. © 2017 by The Torrey Botanical Society.","Agricultural landscape; Edge effect; Endozoochory; Fragmentation; Odocoileus virginianus","agricultural land; bioactivity; deer; edge effect; fecal pellet; forest ecosystem; habitat fragmentation; habitat structure; heterogeneity; patch size; plant community; seed dispersal; shade tolerance; spatial distribution; spatial variation; zoochory; North America; Cervidae; Odocoileus virginianus",2-s2.0-85029519172

We have adapted our method of averaging short-cadence light curves of multiple Kepler planet candidates to long-cadence data, in order to detect an average albedo for the group of candidates. Long-cadence data exist for many more candidates than the short-cadence data, and so we separate the candidates into smaller radius bins than in our previous work: 1-2 R⊕, 2-4 R⊕, and 4-6 R⊕. We find that, on average, all three groups appear darker than suggested by the short-cadence results, but not as dark as many hot Jupiters. The average geometric albedos for the three groups are 0.11 ±0.06, 0.05 ±0.04, and 0.23 ±0.11, respectively, for the case where heat is uniformly distributed about the planet. If heat redistribution is inefficient, the albedos are even lower, since there will be a greater thermal contribution to the total light from the planet. We confirm that newly identified false-positive Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) 1662.01 is indeed an eclipsing binary at twice the period listed in the planet candidate catalog. We also newly identify planet candidate KOI 4351.01 as an eclipsing binary, and we report a secondary eclipse measurement for Kepler-4b (KOI 7.01) of ∼7.50 ppm at a phase of ∼0.7, indicating that the planet is on an eccentric orbit. © 2017.

A broad and multidisciplinary approach was used to achieve a quite complete pattern of the potential suitability of this innovative MPS-based disinfectant treatment to improve the microbiological quality of cultured Manila clams. The biocidal activity was evaluated against the Vibrio spp. population naturally associated with sea water and against viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV), genus Betanodavirus, the most threatening among the viral pathogens of marine finfish. The novel depuration process by sea water potassium MPS-based disinfection set up and tested in the present study (1000 ppm disinfectant for 3 h) greatly reduced the tested bacteria and viruses in the sea water column, being able to counteract the restarting of microorganisms during the depuration process. Furthermore, the microbiological quality of harvested clams with respect to their Vibrio spp. load improved after the 1000 ppm disinfectant 3 h treatment. The potential use of this treatment was strengthened by the absence of effects on clam health and welfare. This issue was assessed by direct observation as indicated by Regulation EC 853/2004, and by the unaltered biochemical parameters, cortisol level and histological pattern. The absence of undesired side-effects and surfactant residues in the edible flesh was also ascertained. The whole of data suggests that the proposed treatment may potentially represent an innovative strategy to face, in a quite easy and feasible way, still unresolved matter of concern in clam commercialization.

Pyramiding sources of resistance is essential for achieving broad-spectrum and durable resistance and for protecting crops from commonly occurring mixed virus infections. Stacking resistance-conferring gene sequences into single crop cultivars is achieved by first, conventional breeding and the use of dominant and recessive host genes; second, genetic engineering and the deployment of virus-derived gene sequences or modified small plant RNAs for antiviral RNA interference defense, or of programmable nucleases to target viral gene sequences or to alter host factors that are critical to complete the virus infection cycle; and third, a combination of conventional breeding and genetic engineering. These strategies are successfully used to mitigate the effect of viruses.

We argue that planning actions in an if (situation)-then (action) format induces sensorimotor simulations (i.e., activity patterns reenacting the event in the sensory and motor brain areas) of the anticipated situation and the intended action. Due to their temporal overlap, these activity patterns become linked. Whenever the previously simulated situation is encountered, the previously simulated action is partially reactivated through spreading activation and thus more likely to be executed. In 4 experiments (N = 363), we investigated the relation between specific if-then action plans worded to activate simulations of elbow flexion versus extension movements and actual elbow flexion versus extension movements in a subsequent, ostensibly unrelated categorization task. As expected, linking a critical stimulus to intended actions that implied elbow flexion movements (e.g., grabbing it for consumption) subsequently facilitated elbow flexion movements upon encountering the critical stimulus. However, linking a critical stimulus to actions that implied elbow extension movements (e.g., pointing at it) subsequently facilitated elbow extension movements upon encountering the critical stimulus. Thus, minor differences (i.e., exchanging the words ""point at"" with ""grab"") in verbally formulated action plans (i.e., conscious thought) had systematic consequences on subsequent actions. The question of how conscious thought can induce stimulus-triggered action is illuminated by the provided theoretical framework and the respective empirical evidence, facilitating the understanding of behavioral automaticity and human agency. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Automaticity; Control; Grounded cognition; Human agency; Planning",,2-s2.0-85023203803

Location: Alta Murgia, Puglia, southeast Italy. Methods: Sampling sites were selected taking into account three boundary attributes thought to be most important in the study area, i.e. adjacent land use, presence/absence of stone wall at the patch boundary and occurrence of slope. Plant communities were surveyed along 40-m transects perpendicular to the patch boundary. Each transect was divided in six plots at given distances from patch boundary. Data were collected related to a set of plant community descriptors referring to structure, composition, life history traits and ecological attributes. A novel methodology that relies on the definition of inner plots as relative interior habitat was introduced for assessment of the depth and magnitude of edge influence. DCA was then used to characterize edge communities. Results: Significant edge influence on grassland plant communities was limited to the adjacent boundary (<2.5 m). For the majority of descriptors, magnitude of edge influence was higher in grasslands adjacent to crops rather than to roads, in sloping rather than flat edges, and in wall-bounded rather than unbounded patches. Plant assemblages dominated by either ruderal species or xerothermic grassland species were, in all cases, associated with unbounded edges, while distinct assemblages were observed in wall-bounded plots according to their different morphology. Wall-bounded sloping edges were characterized by woodland species, whereas their non-sloping analogues were associated with calcareous grassland species. Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the influence of anthropogenic boundaries on semi-natural dry grassland by assessing the depth and magnitude of edge influence, as well as the changes in composition of edge plant communities as a function of the combination of boundary attributes. While the method implemented enabled us to address many of the issues experienced in quantification of edge influence in herbaceous communities, it also allowed us to demonstrate the major role of boundary attributes in modulation of edge community patterns. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","Alta Murgia; Boundary attribute; Depth of edge influence; Edge dynamic; Edge effect; Grassland conservation; Habitat fragmentation; Magnitude of edge influence",,2-s2.0-85027887427

In this study, the population characteristics (density, morphology and primary production) over a one-growing-season cycle were described. In the Nile Delta, the biomass of the shoot and root systems of E.crassipes was sampled monthly along three water courses from April 2014 to November 2014 using five quadrats (each of 0.5 m × 0.5 m) at each water course. The shoot system started to grow in April (121 g/DM/m2), reached a maximum biomass of 887 g/DM/m2 in July, and then decreased until reaching a minimum of 299 g/DM/m2 in November. The biomass of the root system increased from 75 g/DM/m2 in April to a maximum of 235 g/DM/m2 in August and decreased to a minimum of 100 g/DM/m2 in November. Water hyacinth allocated ca. 2% of its total biomass to stolons, 22% to laminae, 24% to roots and 52% to petioles. Peak density as high as 144 individual/m2 occurred in May, but it reduced to 33–50 individual/m2 during July to November. The average rate of change of biomass was maximum (17.3 g/DM/m2/day) during April and May and minimum (−8.9 g/DM/m2/day) during October and November. Relative growth rates were found to be lowest during the cooler months, October and November (−0.017 g/DM/g /day), whereas highest yields were recorded during the spring months, April and May (up to 0.044 g/DM/g/day).

The type, extent, and cumulative effects of multiple developments must be quantified to enable mitigation. Objectives: We quantified anthropogenic development footprints in a globally significant and relatively intact region. We identified the proportion accounted for by linear infrastructure (e.g. roads) including infrastructure that is currently unmapped; investigated the importance of key landscape drivers; and explored potential ramifications of offsite impacts (edge effects). Methods: We quantified direct development footprints of linear and ‘hub’ infrastructure in the Great Western Woodlands (GWW) in south-western Australia, using digitisation and extrapolation from a stratified random sample of aerial imagery. We used spatial datasets and literature resources to identify predictors of development footprint extent and calculate hypothetical ‘edge effect zones’. Results: Unmapped linear infrastructure, only detectable through manual digitisation, accounts for the greatest proportion of the direct development footprint. Across the 160,000 km2 GWW, the estimated development footprint is 690 km2, of which 67% consists of linear infrastructure and the remainder is ‘hub’ infrastructure. An estimated 150,000 km of linear infrastructure exists in the study area, equating to an average of ~1 km per km2. Beyond the direct footprint, a further 4000–55,000 km2 (3–35% of the region) lies within edge effect zones. Conclusions: This study highlights the pervasiveness of linear infrastructure and hence the importance of managing its cumulative impacts as a key component of landscape conservation.

We found that populations from localities with higher prawn biomass had relatively larger telencephalon size as well as larger brains. Optic tectum size was positively associated with one of the fish predator’s biomass and with overall predator diversity. However, both olfactory bulb and hypothalamus size were negatively associated with the biomass of another of the fish predators. Hence, while fish predator occurrence is associated with variation in brain anatomy, prawn occurrence is associated with variation in brain size.

This research further explores indaziflam's activity on monocotyledons and dicotyledons and evaluates indaziflam's potential for restoring non-crop sites infested with invasive winter annual grasses. RESULTS: Treated Arabidopsis, downy brome, feral rye and kochia were all susceptible to indaziflam in a dose-dependent manner. We confirmed that indaziflam has increased activity on monocots (average GR50 = 231 pm and 0.38 g AI ha−1) at reduced concentrations compared with dicots (average GR50 = 512 pm and 0.87 g AI ha−1). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed common CBI symptomologies following indaziflam treatments, as well as aberrant root and cell morphology. Across five application timings, indaziflam treatments resulted in superior invasive winter annual grass control 2 years after treatment (from 84 ± 5.1% to 99 ± 0.5%) compared with imazapic (36% ± 1.2%). Indaziflam treatments significantly increased biomass and species richness of co-occurring species 2 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Indaziflam's increased activity on monocots could provide a new alternative management strategy for long-term control of multiple invasive winter annual grasses that invade &gt;23 million ha of US rangeland. Indaziflam could potentially be used to eliminate the soil seed bank of these invasive grasses, reduce fine fuel accumulation and ultimately increase the competitiveness of perennial co-occuring species. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry","cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor; cellulose synthase; downy brome; feral rye; imazapic; indaziflam; pre-emergence","aboveground biomass; biomass; cellulose; concentration (composition); dicotyledon; enzyme; enzyme activity; fuel; grass; herbicide; inhibitor; invasive species; long-term change; monocotyledon; resistance management; seed bank; species richness; Arabidopsis; Bromus tectorum; Dicotyledoneae; Kochia; Liliopsida; Poaceae; Secale cereale",2-s2.0-85020464403

Beginning with European colonization of California, native grasslands were replaced almost entirely by annual exotic grasses, many of which are now so ubiquitous that they are considered part of the regional flora (“naturalized”). A new wave of invasive plants, such as Aegilops triuncialis (Barb goatgrass) and Elymus caput-medusae (Medusahead), continue to spread throughout the state today. To determine whether these new-wave invasive plants alter soil N dynamics, we measured inorganic N pools, nitrification and denitrification potentials, and possible mediating factors such as microbial biomass and soil pH in experimental grasslands comprised of A. triuncialis and E. caput-medusae. We compared these measurements with those from experimental grasslands containing: (1) native annuals and perennials and (2) naturalized exotic annuals. We found that A. triuncialis and E. caput-medusae significantly reduced ion-exchange resin estimates of nitrate (NO3 −) availability as well as nitrification and denitrification potentials compared to native communities. Active microbial biomass was also lower in invaded soils. In contrast, potential measurements of nitrification and denitrification were similar between invaded and naturalized communities. These results suggest that invasion by A. triuncialis and E. caput-medusae may significantly alter the capacity for soil microbial communities to nitrify or denitrify, and by extension alter soil N availability and rates of N transformations during invasion of remnant native-dominated sites. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Aegilops triuncialis; Elymus caput-medusae; Exotic plants; Plant invasion; Protozoa; Soil nitrogen availability","biological invasion; denitrification; grassland; invasive species; microbial activity; native species; nitrification; nutrient availability; protozoan; soil nitrogen; California; United States; Aegilops triuncialis; Poaceae; Protozoa; Taeniatherum; Taeniatherum caput-medusae",2-s2.0-85021716430

The structure of fish communities and their response to stressors have been commonly described by taxonomic richness, diversity and evenness. More recently, functional structure of communities has also been suggested to be a reliable indicator of disturbance. This article aimed at testing whether taxonomic and functional diversity metrics can provide comparable or complementary information on the response of fish communities to eutrophication and abundance of non-native species in reservoirs. Comparison of the responses of taxonomic and functional diversities to biogeography, habitat and stressors was made in 112 French reservoirs. Widely observed effects of biogeographic and habitat variables on taxonomic and functional diversities were identified. Taxonomic and functional richness metrics notably increased with lake area and temperature respectively. Taxonomic diversity metrics did not respond to any stressor, while all functional diversity metrics were found to be impacted by non-native species. Eutrophication was further found to decrease the impact of non-native species on two functional diversity metrics: evenness and divergence. Our study therefore reveals that functional metrics are more sensitive than taxonomic metrics to anthropogenic stressors in the studied reservoirs. Still, the multiple linear regressions tested had overall low explanatory power. Further refinements will thus be needed to use this type of metrics in an impact assessment scheme. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Pruning is a potential management practice that could help maintain tree vitality and aesthetics in parks, gardens, alleys and recreation areas, as well as maintaining veteran trees having high heritage or cultural value, or trees with high genetic importance (e.g. located in clonal seed orchards). In this study we investigated the maximum distance proximal to the lesion margin at which H. fraxineus can be detected on individual branches infected by the fungus in order to provide recommendations for pruning. Pruning of branches was carried out on 38 trees in southern Sweden. Tissue samples including bark and wood were collected from the margin of the lesion and at 5 cm intervals proximal to the lesion. Molecular analysis revealed presence of H. fraxineus in 91.3% of the investigated lesions. The proportion of lesions at which H. fraxineus could be detected declined with increasing distance from the lesion margin, with a significant reduction in the number of positive samples at 10 cm proximal to the margin. At 30 cm from the lesion edge the pathogen was never detected. Our results suggest that routine pruning may help maintain the vitality of younger trees. Pruning branches at least 35 cm from visible, active lesions in the bark should exclude the fungus and therefore reduce the probability of stem infection by H. fraxineus, however this cultural control tactic may only be economically feasible for high value amenity trees. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Ash dieback; Common ash; Fraxinus excelsior; Hymenoscyphus fraxineus; Pruning","amenity; bark; deciduous tree; detection method; dieback; disease control; disease prevalence; esthetics; fungal disease; fungus; greenspace; lesion; management practice; pruning; survival; urban ecosystem; Sweden; Fraxinus; Fraxinus excelsior; Fungi; Hymenoscyphus",2-s2.0-85022181710

However, in forest ecosystems, the diversity of woody plant taxa with different plant species makes it difficult to determine factors regulating nematode communities. In this respect, monoculture forests in sandy coastal areas can be model systems for characterizing nematode communities because harsh environments limit plant growth and, consequently, soil nematodes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the community structure and spatial pattern of soil nematodes molecularly in coastal Pinus thunbergii forests. Nematodes were collected from two soil layers at each of four sites and subjected to DNA sequence analysis focusing on partial SSU rRNA. In total, 398 sequences were determined from 400 nematode specimens (50 nematodes per soil layer per site). These sequences formed 36, 37, 50, and 84 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) at identity levels of 97%, 98%, 99%, and 100%, respectively. The MOTUs at a 98% identity level corresponded to genera in nematode assemblages. The bacterivorous Acrobeloides (relative abundance, 20–25%), omnivorous Aporcelaimellus (15–20%), and bacterivorous Prismatolaimus (12–22%) were the dominant taxa that collectively accounted for 60% of all genera detected in the top (0–10 cm soil depth) and bottom (10–20 cm) soil layers. The rank abundance pattern was best explained by the Mandelbrot model being a few taxa with other many minor taxa. Nematode communities formed two clusters regardless of the physical distances between study sites. Cluster 1 was characterized by higher soil water content and cluster 2 was characterized by higher pH. These results suggest that nematode community structure of the coastal pine forest is simple, and are regulated by proximate abiotic factors such as water content and soil pH. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Abiotic factor; Coastal sand; Rank abundance dominance; Sanger sequence; Small subunit rDNA",,2-s2.0-85021100459

In this study, a field experiment was conducted in a tidal marsh dominated by the native C4 plant Cyperus malaccensis in the Minjiang River estuary, China. Concentrations of SOC and liable SOC fractions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), were measured in the top 50-cm soils of the C. malaccensis community, as well as those of three S. alterniflora communities with an invasion duration of 0–4 years (SA-4), 4–8 years (SA-8), and 8–12 years (SA-12), respectively. Results showed that both SOC stocks in the 50-cm soils and mean SOC concentrations in the surface soils (0–10 cm) of the C. malaccensis community increased with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion, whereas SOC concentrations in the 10–50-cm soils decreased slightly during the initial period of S. alterniflora invasion, before increasing again. The pattern of changes in labile SOC fractions (DOC, MBC, and EOC) with invasion duration was generally similar to that of SOC, while the ratios of labile SOC fractions to total SOC (DOC:SOC, MBC:SOC, and EOC:SOC) decreased significantly with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion. The findings of this study suggest that invasion of the exotic C4 plant S. alterniflora into a marsh dominated by the native C4 plant C. malaccensis would enhance SOC sequestration owing to the greater amount of biomass and lower proportion of labile SOC fractions present in the S. alterniflora communities. © 2017 Soil Science Society of China","carbon sequestration; carbon stock; coastal wetland; labile organic carbon fractions; plant invasion; redundancy analyses; river estuary","biological invasion; C4 plant; carbon sequestration; coastal wetland; concentration (composition); estuarine ecosystem; grass; intertidal environment; invasive species; marsh; organic carbon; soil carbon; statistical analysis; topsoil; China; Min River [Sichuan]; Sichuan; Cyperus malaccensis; Spartina alterniflora",2-s2.0-85032683614

The movements of all fishes were continually monitored for five months using 22 stationary data-logging acoustic receivers, positioned along the length of the estuary. Diel and tidal cycles were identified in the movements of several individual R. holubi; however the lack of extensive movements for most individuals emphasised high residency of the species to particular sections of the estuary. River inflow and water temperature significantly affected the movement behaviour of most tagged R. holubi. Periods of increased freshwater inflow and rising riverine temperatures prompted certain individuals to shift their position downstream, while reduced sea temperatures in the lower reaches prompted certain individuals to shift their position further upstream from the mouth. Given the predicted effects of climate change in the study region, which include increased river inflow due to catchment rainfall and decreased sea temperatures due to ocean upwelling, these results suggest that R. holubi may be sensitive to the environmental effects of global warming and that the distribution and movement behaviour of this species in southern African estuaries is likely to be affected as climate change proceeds. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acoustic telemetry; Estuarine fish; Kowie estuary; Physico-chemical parameters","behavioral ecology; biotelemetry; climate change; diel migration; environmental factor; geophysics; juvenile; movement; perciform; tidal cycle; water temperature; Eastern Cape; Kowie Estuary; South Africa; Pisces; Rhabdosargus holubi",2-s2.0-85027701197

By applying a population modeling framework, we reveal conditions under which population responses from stressors applied to distinct life stages are either magnified (synergistic) or mitigated. We find that magnification or mitigation critically depends on the shape of density dependence, but not the life stage in which it occurs. Stressors are always magnified when density dependence is linear or concave, and magnified or mitigated when it is convex.

The results showed that high concentrations of urea (400 mg L−1) and Cd (500 µmol L−1) had negative effects on C. caroliniana. There were strong visible symptoms of toxicity after 4 days of exposure under Cd-alone, 400 mg L−1 urea, and Cd+400 mg L−1 urea treatments. In addition, 400 mg L−1 urea and Cd had adverse effects on C. caroliniana's pigment system. Significant losses in chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic rates, as well as Rubisco activity were also observed under Cd-alone, 400 mg L−1 urea, and Cd+400 mg L−1 urea treatments. 400 mg L−1 urea markedly enhanced Cd toxicity in C. caroliniana, reflected by a sharp decrease in photosynthetic activity and more visible toxicity symptoms. The results of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) pointed to extreme oxidative stress in C. caroliniana induced under Cd or 400 mg L−1 urea exposure. Exogenous ascorbate (AsA) protected C. caroliniana from adverse damage in 400 mg L−1 urea, which further corroborated the oxidative stress claim under 400 mg L−1 urea.

Laboratory-based waste centrifuge tubes made of polypropylene were chosen as a carbon source to show the process principle. In the process, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized from plastic waste in a two-stage stainless steel 316 (SS 316) metal tube that acted as both reactor vessel and catalyst. The steel reactor contains Fe (and Ni, and various alloys), which act as the catalyst for the carbon conversion process. The reaction and products were studied using electron probe microanalysis, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Optimization studies to determine the effect of different parameters on the process showed that the highest yield and most graphitized MWCNTs were formed at 900 °C under the reaction conditions used (yield 42%, Raman ID/IG ratio = 0.48). The high quality and high yield of the MWCNTs that were produced in a flow reactor from plastic waste using a two stage SS 316 chemical vapor deposition (CVD) furnace did not require the use of an added catalyst. © 2017 by the authors.

While the Kepler Space Telescope mission has enabled most of these exoplanets to be detected by identifying transiting events, exoplanets often exhibit additional photometric effects that can be used to improve the characterization of exoplanets. The EXONEST Exoplanetary Explorer is a Bayesian exoplanet inference engine based on nested sampling and originally designed to analyze archived Kepler Space Telescope and CoRoT (Convection Rotation et Transits planétaires) exoplanet mission data. We discuss the EXONEST software package and describe how it accommodates plug-and-play models of exoplanet-associated photometric effects for the purpose of exoplanet detection, characterization and scientific hypothesis testing. The current suite of models allows for both circular and eccentric orbits in conjunction with photometric effects, such as the primary transit and secondary eclipse, reflected light, thermal emissions, ellipsoidal variations, Doppler beaming and superrotation. We discuss our new efforts to expand the capabilities of the software to include more subtle photometric effects involving reflected and refracted light. We discuss the EXONEST inference engine design and introduce our plans to port the current MATLAB-based EXONEST software package over to the next generation Exoplanetary Explorer, which will be a Python-based open source project with the capability to employ third-party plug-and-play models of exoplanet-related photometric effects. © 2017 by the authors.","Astronomy; Astrophysics; Bayesian; Exoplanets; Kepler; Kepler-76b",,2-s2.0-85031942190

The study was conducted in 25 patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). PMX-DHP lowered the blood endotoxin level in all patients. Following PMX-DHP, there were decreases from day 0 → day 1 → day 2 in both the mean plasma sPLA2-II level (340 → 260 → 189 ng/mL) and plasma SP-D level (483 → 363 → 252 ng/mL).

Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the sPLA2-II and TNF-α levels. The results suggest that as the blood endotoxin levels were lowered by the PMX-DHP, the inflammatory reactions were suppressed, with suppressed formation of sPLA2-II and improved pulmonary oxygenation potential.

These detailed data have been proven useful for inferring disease transmission to a more refined level than previously. However, there remains a lack of statistically sound frameworks to model the underlying transmission dynamic in a mechanistic manner. Such a development is particularly crucial for enabling a general epidemic predictive framework at the individual level. In this paper we propose a new statistical framework for mechanistically modelling individual-to-individual disease transmission in a landscape with heterogeneous population density. Our methodology is first tested using simulated datasets, validating our inferential machinery. The methodology is subsequently applied to data that describes a regional Ebola outbreak in Western Africa (2014-2015). Our results show that the methods are able to obtain estimates of key epidemiological parameters that are broadly consistent with the literature, while revealing a significantly shorter distance of transmission. More importantly, in contrast to existing approaches, we are able to perform a more general model prediction that takes into account the susceptible population. Finally, our results show that, given reasonable scenarios, the framework can be an effective surrogate for susceptible-explicit individual models which are often computationally challenging. © 2017 Lau et al.",,,2-s2.0-85032747936

Although their kin could offer support and investiture in the prosperity of the dynasty, rulers were also threatened by them with internal rivalry and challenges for the throne. This article argues that focusing on how a ruler dealt with the fundamental problem of imperial relatives can illuminate the institutional arrangements of imperial power while still accounting for variation across space. The article takes up the case of the Manchus and the formation of their Qing dynasty in seventeenth-century China, and shows how political and cultural circumstances shaped institutional outcomes. The story begins with the Manchu ruler in a predicament of needing to rely on his relatives for political and military support, but at the same time being threatened and constrained by them. In order to solicit their cooperation he gave them administrative positions, but then imposed legal and ritualistic restraints to integrate them into the professional bureaucracy. The end result was that the Manchu relatives were neutralized as a threat and turned into a service elite, which facilitated the conquest and rule of a vast multiethnic empire. © The Author(s) 2017.","Dynasties; Early modern; Imperial relatives; Manchu; Qing; Succession",,2-s2.0-85032570977

By using the nearby binary stars Kepler-13BC as a reference, we were able to create a differential light curve for Kepler-13A that had little of the systematics typically present in HST/WFC3 spectrophotometry. We measure a broadband (1.1-1.65 μm) eclipse depth of 734 ±28 ppm and are able to measure the emission spectrum of the planet at R ≈ 50 with an average precision of 70 ppm. We find that Kepler-13Ab possesses a noninverted, monotonically decreasing vertical temperature profile. We exclude an isothermal profile and an inverted profile at more than 3σ. We also find that the dayside emission of Kepler-13Ab appears generally similar to an isolated M7 brown dwarf at a similar effective temperature. Due to the relatively high mass and surface gravity of Kepler-13Ab, we suggest that the apparent lack of an inversion is due to cold-trap processes in the planet's atmosphere. Using a toy model for where cold traps should inhibit inversions, as well as observations of other planets in this temperature range with measured emission spectra, we argue that with more detailed modeling and more observations we may be able to place useful constraints on the size of condensates on the daysides of hot Jupiters. © 2017.

The objective of this study was to identify the predominant begomoviruses infecting mungbean and the major cryptic species of B. tabaci associated with this crop in India. The indigenous B. tabaci cryptic species Asia II 1 was found dominant in Northern India, whereas Asia II 8 was found predominant in Southern India. Repeated samplings over consecutive years indicate a stable situation with, Mungbean yellow mosaic virus strains genetically most similar to a strain from urdbean (MYMV-Urdbean) predominant in North India, strains most similar to MYMV-Vigna predominant in South India, and Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) strains predominant in Eastern India. In field studies, mungbean line NM 94 showed a high level of tolerance to the disease in the Eastern state of Odisha where MYMIV was predominant and in the Southern state of Andhra Pradesh where MYMV-Vigna was predominant, but only a moderate level of tolerance in the Southern state of Tamil Nadu. However, in Northern parts of India where there was high inoculum pressure of MYMV-Urdbean during the Kharif season, NM 94 developed severe yellow mosaic symptoms.

Our objectives were to identify and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTL) in winter durum and to evaluate the potential of genomic approaches for the improvement of FHB resistance. Here, we employed an international panel of 170 winter and 14 spring durum lines, phenotyped for Fusarium culmorum resistance at five environments. Heading date, plant height and mean FHB severity showed significant genotypic variation with high heritabilities and FHB resistance was negatively correlated with both heading date and plant height. The dwarfing gene Rht-B1 significantly affected FHB resistance and the genome-wide association scan identified eight additional QTL affecting FHB resistance, explaining between 1% and 14% of the genotypic variation. A genome-wide prediction approach yielded only a slightly improved predictive ability compared to marker-assisted selection based on the four strongest QTL. In conclusion, FHB resistance in durum wheat is a highly quantitative trait and in breeding programmes may best be tackled by classical high-throughput recurrent phenotypic selection that can be assisted by genomic prediction if marker profiles are available. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","dwarfing gene; Fusarium culmorum; genome-wide association scan; genomic prediction; marker-assisted selection; quantitative trait loci",,2-s2.0-85030694055

The decision to pursue a reintroduction is often based upon the success of past efforts, yet in most cases the assumption that resulting populations are the products of recolonization, is not tested. By collecting data from source populations, reintroduced populations, and natural populations adjacent to reintroductions, it is possible to evaluate the success of past reintroduction events and these data may be used to guide future conservation initiatives. We used the fisher (Pekania pennanti), one of North America's most commonly reintroduced species, as a model to conduct an evaluation of reintroduction success. We genotyped 147 individuals at 15 microsatellite loci to determine the genetic contribution of reintroduced individuals to an ostensibly successfully reintroduced population in central Alberta, Canada. Principle component analysis and Bayesian statistical methods converged with confidence on one result: assayed individuals were descended from adjacent native Albertan populations, not putative founders from eastern Canada. A review of fisher reintroduction literature reveals similar patterns: a large proportion of contemporary individuals appear to be the result of recolonization events. Our study has broad implications for conservation as it may imply a 1) over-confidence in past reintroductions, which might lead to significant expenditure of financial and human capital on future initiatives of modest, if any, benefit, and 2) underestimation of some species' ability to disperse and (re-)colonize, highlighting limits to our understanding of functional connectivity.

However, traits and phylogeny are often related due to underlying trait evolution. Consequently, when combined, their shared information can be overemphasized, hindering their complementarity. It is therefore desirable to decouple their unique and overlapping contributions. We propose a conceptual and mathematical framework that produces a set of meaningful measures of ecological differences between species. We test the properties of these measures and the validity of the approach with extensive simulated data to show (i) the information provided by decoupling traits from phylogeny and vice versa, and (ii) that decoupling trait and phylogenetic information can uncover otherwise hidden signals underlying species coexistence and turnover. The application of the approach is further illustrated using a large dataset of Central European meadows as a case study. Decoupling traits and phylogeny particularly reveals the importance of differentiation between phylogenetically related species, which can be essential to understand species replacements along environmental gradients and the combined action of environmental filtering and limiting similarity within communities. Decoupling traits and phylogeny provides an avenue for connecting macro-evolutionary and local factors affecting coexistence and for understanding how complex species differences affect multiple ecosystem functions.

We tested the effects of climatic variables (temperature, precipitation), landscape attributes (number of patches, mean inter-patch isolation distance, matrix modification index) and patch size on the population density using linear models and the Akaike information criterion. Our findings showed that the density of S. nigritus is influenced by landscape attributes, particularly by fragmentation and matrix modification. Overall, moderately fragmented landscapes and those surrounded by matrices with intermediate indexes of temporal modification (i.e., crop plantations, forestry) are related to high densities of this species. These results support the assumptions that ecologically flexible species respond positively to forest fragmentation. However, the non-linear relationship between S. nigritus density and number of patches suggests that even the species that are most tolerant to forest cover changes seem to respond positively only at an intermediate level of habitat fragmentation, being dependent of both a moderate degree of forest cover and a high quality matrix.

There is convincing evidence that heat-shock proteins (HSPs) play important roles in helping organisms adapt to thermal stress. To better understand the physiological and ecological influence of thermal stress on the different development stages of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Mediterranean species (MED), nymphs and adults were shocked with temperatures of 35, 38, and 41 °C for 1 and 2 h, respectively, and the survival rate, fecundity, and developmental duration were investigated in the laboratory. The expression levels of the hsp40, hsp70, and hsp90 genes were assessed using real-time PCR. The results indicate that the survival rates of the nymphs and adults decreased with increased temperature. A 2-h heat shock at 41°C induced a significant reduction in fecundity in adults and an increase in developmental duration in young nymphs. Hsp90 showed higher temperature responses to thermal stress than hsp40 or hsp70. The expression levels of the hsps in the adults were significantly down-regulated by a 2-h heat shock at 41°C compared with that by a 1-h treatment. A significant decrease in the expression levels of the hsps also occurred in the adults when the temperature increased from 38 to 41°C for the 2-h treatment, whereas no significant decrease occurred in the nymphs. Compared with previous studies, we provide some evidence indicating that MED has the potential to adapt to a wider temperature range than the Middle East-Asia Minor 1 species. © The Author 2017.

We analysed nest-site characteristics, breeding success and competitive interactions between two apex predator populations. Whereas the Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus has nested in the Judean Foothills (Israel) for a long time, the Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus has only invaded the nesting habitat of the Short-toed Eagle during their breeding season in the last two decades. These two recently sympatric species have similar nesting ecology and frequently use the same nests. They are therefore expected to compete over nesting sites and territories. We analysed interspecific interactions between these two species by combining information from comprehensive observational, experimental, GIS analysis and remote sensing data, deriving 65 variables to characterize the nest-sites used and the breeding success in 381 breeding attempts over four consecutive breeding seasons. To assess interspecific and intraspecific territorial behaviour and aggressiveness, stuffed Long-legged Buzzards and Short-toed Eagles were presented close to nests. Nest-site characteristics overlapped substantially between species, and Long-legged Buzzards occupied 21% of all Short-toed Eagle nests. Intraspecific aggression rates among Long-legged Buzzards were higher than their interspecific aggression rates with Short-toed Eagles and also higher than intraspecific aggression among Short-toed Eagles. Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle breeding densities (1.59 ± 0.11 and 2.96 ± 0.11 pairs per 10 km2, respectively) are likely to be the highest across their respective breeding distributions, with a maximum productivity of 0.96 ± 0.01 and 0.56 ± 0.05 (young fledged/breeding pair) for Long-legged Buzzard and Short-toed Eagle, respectively. Intraspecific interactions among both species play an important role in determining their breeding success and the spatial distribution of nesting sites. Our results suggest that interspecific competition over nesting sites and territories between both species, and the potential dominance of Long-legged Buzzard, has both direct and indirect impacts on the spatial and demographic distribution of Short-toed Eagles due to the recent establishment of Long-legged Buzzard territories in the Judean breeding area. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union","aggressive interactions; interspecific competition; Long-legged Buzzard; nest occupation; remote sensing; Short-toed Eagle; territorial aggression","aggression; breeding season; breeding site; GIS; interspecific competition; intraspecific interaction; nest site; predator; raptor; remote sensing; reproductive success; spatial distribution; Israel; Accipitridae; Aves; Buteo rufinus; Buteo rufinus rufinus; Circaetus gallicus",2-s2.0-85021264131

Seabird populations are decreasing both in Hawai'i and globally, yet little is known about what is being lost from the ecosystems where they traditionally nested in large numbers. Given the marked decline in seabirds, we hypothesized that current sparsely populated seabird colonies in wet montane ecosystems of Hawai'i contribute minimally to nutrient availability, but that this small contribution should still be reflected in vegetative uptake of soil N and in plant community composition. Soil nutrient availability on Kaua'i was assessed using ion-exchange resin probes. Plant and soil uptake of marine-derived nitrogen was determined using δ 15N values in soil and foliage of the two dominant species using a two-end member N isotope mass balance mixing model. To determine if the added nutrients impacted the plant community, we also compared canopy cover (total and by dominant species) and species richness between treatments. Soil in seabird areas had more available ammonium, but nitrate and total inorganic N did not differ between sites. The dominant canopy tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, derived 28% of foliar N from marine sources; this value was 15% for the dominant understory plant, Dicranopteris linearis. Plant species composition was not influenced by presence or absence of seabirds. Because N plays a large role in net primary productivity, use of marine-derived N by native plants under even limited seabird populations is likely important to functioning of these ecosystems.",,"biological invasion; canopy architecture; endangered species; evergreen tree; foliage; forest ecosystem; isotope; montane forest; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient cycling; plant community; population decline; seabird; species richness; understory; Hawaii [United States]; United States; Dicranopteris linearis; Metrosideros polymorpha",2-s2.0-85030313222

Although it is well documented that the materials comprising artificial structures influence the composition of organisms that use them as habitat, little is known about how these materials may chemically react with changing seawater conditions, and what effects this will have on associated biota. We investigated the effects of ocean warming, acidification, and type of coastal infrastructure material on algal turfs. Seawater acidification resulted in greater covers of turf, though this effect was counteracted by elevated temperatures. Concrete supported a greater cover of turf than granite or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) under all temperature and pH treatments, with the greatest covers occurring under simulated ocean acidification. Furthermore, photosynthetic efficiency under acidification was greater on concrete substratum compared to all other materials and treatment combinations. These results demonstrate the capacity to maximise ecological benefits whilst still meeting local management objectives when engineering coastal defense structures by selecting materials that are appropriate in an ocean change context.

In this study, we conducted a survey on the natural distribution of Verticillium species on A. altissima in eastern Austria. Results of a survey, across the range of A. altissima in Austria, indicated a widespread distribution of V. dahliae (56 of 77 sampled sites) and a rare occurrence of V. nonalfalfae (two of 77 sites). All sites positive for Verticillium spp. were situated at 130 m to 240 m above sea level.

Results revealed that disease progression on A. altissima is negatively influenced by high temperatures in summer. Therefore, inoculation in spring turned out to be the most effective to combat A. altissima. However, due to the common occurrence of V. dahliae in Austria, this pathogen might be considered as alternative biocontrol agent of A. altissima on sites in warmer climates.

This non-randomness consequently results in phenotypic differences between dispersers and non-dispersers and, in the context of biological invasions, in an invasion front made of individuals with a biased phenotype. This bias of phenotypes at the front may subsequently modulate the strength of ecological effects of an invasive species on invaded communities. We recently demonstrated that more asocial mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), one of the 100 worst invasive species, disperse further, suggesting a sociability-biased invasion front. As behavioural types are related to the strength of interspecific interactions, an invasion by a biased subset of individuals should have important ecological implications for native communities. Here, we tested the impact of phenotypic biases in dispersing individuals (relative to non-dispersers) on prey communities in experimental mesocosms. We show that dispersers reduce prey abundance more than do non-dispersers during the first 4 weeks after introduction, and that the disperser's social types are likely drivers of these differences. These differences in prey communities disappeared after 8 weeks suggesting prey community resilience against predation in these mesocosm ecosystems. Consequently, we call for the integration of non-random dispersal, dispersal syndromes and more generally intraspecific variation into studies predicting the impacts of invasions. © 2017 The Authors.

Two KSC indices are suggested and have been calculated in the coastal benthic/pelagic ecosystem of Fildes Bay, King George Island (Antarctica). These indices of keystoneness emerge after considering: (1) functional indices based on steady-state and dynamic quantitative trophic models (using bottom-up, mixed and top-down control flow mechanisms); (2) structural indices including bottom-up and top-down control mechanisms, (3) semi-quantitative (qualitative) keystone indices using loop analysis (under mixed control); and (4) topological key player indices based on the centrality of node sets in the network. The models constructed and analyzed describe the interactions of the most abundant species and functional groups inhabiting the coastal ecological systems of Fildes Bay. Although our results only represent the transient dynamics of these ecological systems, the KSC indices identified the following trophically connected common core of components: the functional groups of Seastars (top-predators), the herbivorous sea urchin species Sterechinus neumayeri and the Phytoplankton (primary producers). The KSC indices for Fildes Bay could facilitate the design and assessment of conservation monitoring, especially when the Antarctic ecosystems are being severely stressed by the direct effects of global warming and UV radiation. A more holistic view of conservation remains difficult because the traditional view is based principally on single species. This imposes an even greater challenge, for global changes accompany the network of interacting species, co-varying with the variables of the natural system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Benthic/pelagic ecosystems; Fildes Bay; Keystone species; Monitoring; Multispecies modelling; Systems-based conservation","Arches; Complex networks; Ecology; Ecosystems; Global warming; Indexing (materials working); Mammals; Monitoring; Radiation effects; Antarctic Peninsula; Bottom-up and top-down; Community organizations; Conservation management; Fildes Bay; Interacting species; Keystone species; Multi-species; Conservation; benthic environment; coastal zone; conservation management; conservation status; echinoderm; environmental monitoring; functional group; global warming; keystone species; numerical model; pelagic ecosystem; phytoplankton; species complex; top-down control; ultraviolet radiation; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Fildes Peninsula; King George Island; South Shetland Islands; West Antarctica; Echinoidea; Sterechinus neumayeri",2-s2.0-85020924963

However, it is unclear which regional-scale abiotic conditions drive processes affecting rarity of endemic species on islands. To support conservation efforts, we (1) assess the main abiotic drivers of endemic rarity, (2) determine how well existing protected areas (PAs) coincide with hotspots of endemic rarity and (3) introduce and evaluate a new hypervolume-based rarity estimator. Location: La Palma (Canary Islands). Methods: We recorded all present endemic vascular plant species in 1,212 plots covering the entire island. We calculated endemic rarity (corrected range-rarity richness for endemics) using a rarity estimation approach based on kernel density estimations (hypervolume approach). We performed a sensitivity analysis based on multiple linear regressions and relative importance estimations of environmental drivers to estimate the performance of the hypervolume-based rarity estimation compared to standard methods (occurrence frequency, convex hulls, alpha hulls). Results: Climate variables (mean annual temperature, climatic rarity, precipitation variability) best explained archipelago endemic (AE) and single-island endemic (SIE) rarity. Existing PAs covered the majority of AE and SIE rarity, especially national and natural parks as well as the Natura 2000 sites. In our study system, hypervolumes performed better than standard measures of range size. Main conclusion: Both AE and SIE rarity on La Palma show a clear spatial pattern, with hotspots of endemic rarity found at high elevations and in rare climates, presumably owing to geographical and climatic constraints and possibly anthropogenic pressure (e.g., land use, introduced herbivores, fire). Areas of high rarity estimates coincide with the distribution and extent of PAs on La Palma, especially since the recent addition of the Natura 2000 sites. The hypervolume approach is a promising tool to estimate species range sizes, and can be applied on all scales where point/plot data are available. © 2017 The Authors.

In the present study, we investigated whether tool-induced recalibration of tactile perception on the hand transfers to the cheek. Participants verbally estimated the distance between two tactile points applied to either their hand or face, before and after using a hand-shaped tool. Tool use recalibrated tactile distance perception on the hand—in line with previous findings—but left perception on the cheek unchanged. This finding provides support for the idea that embodiment is body-part specific.

We tested whether taxonomic and trait turnover (1) are structured by regional bioclimatic conditions, (2) increase in relationship with topographic heterogeneity and environmental turnover and change according to current and historical environmental conditions, and (3) decrease with human impact. Major Taxa: Birds. Location: Global. Methods: We used computationally efficient algorithms to map the taxonomic and trait turnover of 8,040 terrestrial bird assemblages worldwide, based on a grid with 110 km × 110 km resolution overlaid on the extent-of-occurrence maps of 7,964 bird species, and nine ecological traits reflecting six key aspects of bird ecology (diet, habitat use, thermal preference, migration, dispersal and body size). We used quantile regression and model selection to quantify the influence of biomes, environment (temperature, precipitation, altitudinal range, net primary productivity, Quaternary temperature and precipitation change) and human impact (human influence index) on bird turnover. Results: Bird taxonomic and trait turnover were highest in the north African deserts and boreal biomes. In the tropics, taxonomic turnover tended to be higher, but trait turnover was lower than in other biomes. Taxonomic and trait turnover exhibited markedly different or even opposing relationships with climatic and topographic gradients, but at their upper quantiles both types of turnover decreased with increasing human influence. Main conclusions: The influence of regional, environmental and anthropogenic factors differ between bird taxonomic and trait turnover, consistent with an imprint of niche conservatism, environmental filtering and topographic barriers on bird regional assemblages.

In previous research, two atrazine-resistant waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) populations from Illinois, U.S.A. (designated ACR and MCR), displayed rapid formation of atrazine-glutathione (GSH) conjugates, implicating elevated rates of metabolism as the resistance mechanism. Our main objective was to utilize protein purification combined with qualitative proteomics to investigate the hypothesis that enhanced atrazine detoxification, catalysed by distinct GSTs, confers resistance in ACR and MCR. Additionally, candidate AtuGST expression was analysed in an F2 population segregating for atrazine resistance. ACR and MCR showed higher specific activities towards atrazine in partially purified ammonium sulphate and GSH affinity-purified fractions compared to an atrazine-sensitive population (WCS). One-dimensional electrophoresis of these fractions displayed an approximate 26-kDa band, typical of GST subunits. Several phi- and tau-class GSTs were identified by LC-MS/MS from each population, based on peptide similarity with GSTs from Arabidopsis. Elevated constitutive expression of one phi-class GST, named AtuGSTF2, correlated strongly with atrazine resistance in ACR and MCR and segregating F2 population. These results indicate that AtuGSTF2 may be linked to a metabolic mechanism that confers atrazine resistance in ACR and MCR. © 2017 The Authors.

These areas, characterized by various land types and uses, represent differences in management and governance, jurisdiction, planting practices and species selection, and professional and political agendas. Such complexities emphasize the importance of exploring the influence of various environmental and location attributes of suburban neighbourhoods. Using hierarchical cluster analysis to classify urban forest species assemblages, we found that location attributes such as land type, development decade, and geography are influential on species composition and diversity − but only to an extent. We found that street-tree assemblages were classified more distinctly than remnant woodlands, which were in turn more distinct than tree communities found on residential properties. Residential land types had a high degree of species heterogeneity, highlighting the importance of not only considering the location attributes chosen for this study, but also including socioeconomic and cultural variables in future ecological classification schemes. Identifying drivers of species composition and diversity is useful for developing and implementing forest management strategies for urban and peri-urban areas, as different species assemblages give rise to different challenges and management opportunities, as well as varying quantities of ecosystem services, values, and benefits. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Cluster analysis; Development; Species composition; Suburb; Urban tree diversity",,2-s2.0-85028020372

However, PCR-based information shows much broader diversity of genetic lineages in these parasites. This discrepancy indicates insufficient knowledge about taxonomic diversity and boundaries of a single species in avian Plasmodium species. In recent taxonomy, most of genetically closely related lineages that share the same morphology and development patterns are attributed to the same biological species, but there is no information if these lineages are able to cross. This information is crucial to understand if these lineages form single or multiple evolutionary units. Due to presence of sexual process and sporogonic development of Plasmodium parasites in mosquitoes, self and cross-fertilization can occur and be identified during the oocyst stage. We initiated in vivo hybridization experiments of two widespread Plasmodium relictum lineages (pSGS1 and pGRW11) in experimentally infected Culex pipiens pipiens form molestus mosquitoes. To study putative hybrid oocysts, we used a laser microdissection technique together with PCR-based analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. We demonstrate that both pSGS1 and pGRW11 lineages develop in infected mosquitoes in parallel, but also form hybrid oocysts of these two lineages. Our results are in accord to a recent global phylogeographic study of P. relictum that suggested that cross-fertilization between pSGS1 and pGRW11 might occur.

Stands of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) introduced decades ago represent a threat to the specialized plant communities of serpentine outcrops in Italy. This study investigates the effects of such invasions at the community and species level, based on vegetation sampling in three selected sites with comparable environmental conditions. Pine cover caused a decrease of α-diversity by lowering the species evenness of the community, though species richness was not negatively affected. Compositional changes between the two habitats were significant but not clearly associated with a decrease in taxonomic distinctness in the pine stands. As many as nine indicator species were found in the open vegetation, along with the obligate endemics Odontarrhena bertolonii and Armeria denticulata. Both of them declined in the pine stands. Here, an increase in the phytoavailable nickel fraction was associated with a decrease in total nickel concentration in the soil, via mobilization of the metal caused by lowering of pH induced by the conifer litter. The nickel-hyperaccumulator O. bertolonii was able to maintain high metal concentrations in the shoots despite a decrease in root concentration, resulting in a higher shoot/root ratio in the pine stands (~ 20). Conversely, shoot/root ratio in the non-accumulator Plantago holosteum was < 1 and not affected by the conifer, as well as its abundance in this anthropogenic habitat. Contrasting responses of the two species were likely due to their different sensitivity to modified light and soil conditions, whereas stability of shoot nickel-concentration in O. bertolonii did not support increased predation by natural enemies as one of the causes for its decline under the conifer. Progressive thinning of these stands is advocated to limit soil nickel mobilization and to restore a unique ecosystem with its endemic metallophytes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Endemic species; Heavy metals; Invading trees; Nickel-hyperaccumulation; Plant communities; Ultramafic outcrops","Biodiversity; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Heavy metals; Serpentine; Silicate minerals; Soils; Vegetation; Endemic species; Invading trees; Nickel hyperaccumulation; Plant communities; Ultramafic outcrops; Nickel; nickel; bioaccumulation; endemic species; invasive species; nickel; plant community; species diversity; tree; vegetation; Armeria denticulata; Article; bioaccumulation; canopy; concentration (parameters); conifer; controlled study; forest stand; light; natural enemy; nonhuman; Odontarrhena bertolonii; pine; Pinus pinaster; plant; plant litter; plant root; Plantago holosteum; predation; shoot; soil acidification; soil acidity; species composition; species diversity; species habitat; species invasion; species richness; vegetation; Armeria; Coniferophyta; Pinus pinaster; Plantago holosteum",2-s2.0-85016455481

Climatic sensitivity of radial increment (i.e., tree-ring width) of introduced European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) of different generations and social status, growing in its northeasternmost stands in Europe, was studied by dendroclimatological methods. At present, the studied stands occur outside of the natural distribution area of the species, providing opportunity to study adaptability and potential growth of beech in novel environments under changing climate. The sensitivity of radial growth to climatic factors was modulated by the generation and social status (size) of trees. The first generation trees, which were propagated from the material transferred from the northern Germany, were highly sensitive to climatic factors and showed wide spectrum of responses. The dominant trees were particularly sensitive to June precipitation, indicating sensitivity to water deficit in summer. The suppressed trees were mainly sensitive to temperature in the dormant period. Tree-ring width of the second generation trees, which were propagated from the first generation stands, was mainly affected by water deficit in summer, yet the local factors, modulated the mechanisms of response. In one stand, tree-ring width was affected by conditions during the formation of tree-ring, indicating direct influence of weather conditions on xylogenesis. In the other stand, tree-ring width was correlated to weather conditions in the preceding year, suggesting influence via carbohydrate reserves. The effect of social status on climatic sensitivity in the second generation stands was considerably weaker, likely due to the natural and anthropogenic selection of the material best adapted for local conditions. The effect of climatic factors on radial growth of beech has shifted during the 20th century. The effect of autumn temperature has weakened, likely due to warming; the effect of factors related to water deficit in summer has intensified that could be related to both, changes in climate and ageing. The observed climate-growth relationships suggested that conditions in winter have become suitable for beech, yet careful selection of sites/regions with appropriate hydrological conditions appear necessary to counteract the increasing effect of water deficit, hence to ensure productivity of future beech sites in Latvia. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Adaptation; Assisted migration; Dendroclimatology; Experimental plantation; Fagus sylvatica; Tree-ring width","adaptation; age; climate effect; deciduous tree; dendroclimatology; diameter; environmental factor; experimental study; genetics; growth; plantation forestry; tree ring; Germany; Latvia; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica",2-s2.0-85028700159

In the Faou estuary (48.295°N-4.179°W, Brittany, France), it forms a dense population at the mud's surface. The effects of G. vermiculophylla on metabolism, diversity, and the food web were studied. Community gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (CR) during emersion, chlorophyll-a content, macrofaunal and meiofaunal diversity and abundance, and stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) of representative macrofaunal species and main food sources were measured at low tide in winter, spring, summer 2014, and winter 2015. Results show significant seasonal variation in GPP and CR. Moreover, GPP was significantly higher in areas where G. vermiculophylla was present than in the control area (bare mud). However, this high GPP appeared to be linked to the increase in biomass in primary producers, with their efficiency (primary productivity, i.e. assimilation number) remaining relatively stable compared with the control area. Significant variation in abundance of meiofauna and macrofauna was also detected and new epifaunal species were collected, mainly in Gracilaria-colonized areas. Isotopic food-web Bayesian mixing models strongly suggested that G. vermiculophylla plays a major role in the diet of some dominant species. Mechanisms interacting with the functioning and diversity of the mudflat are discussed. Finally, the invasive seaweed G. vermiculophylla affected the mudflat ecosystem in three ways: as a new primary producer (increase in metabolism), as a habitat-forming species (changes in diversity and abundance of macrofauna and meiofauna), and as a new abundant food source, likely through the detrital pathway. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Engineer species; Food web; Invasive; Macrofauna diversity; Meiofauna diversity; Metabolism; Non-indigenous species; Red alga","Ecology; Isotopes; Metabolism; Physiology; Seaweed; Food webs; Invasive; Macrofauna; Meiofauna; Nonindigenous species; Red algae; Estuaries; carbon 13; chlorophyll a; nitrogen 15; algal bloom; biodiversity; ecosystem function; estuarine environment; food web; invasive species; meiofauna; metabolism; mudflat; Article; biomass; chlorophyll content; estuary; food web; Gracilaria; Gracilaria vermiculophylla; macrofauna; meiofauna; mudflat; nonhuman; population abundance; seasonal variation; species diversity; species identification; species invasion; spring; summer; wetland; winter; Norway; Portugal; Gracilaria; Gracilaria vermiculophylla; Rhodophyta",2-s2.0-85030871555

Through a series of four studies they thus are able to bring evidence for this type of unconscious defense. With event-related potentials, three clinical studies show how synchronization of a specific brain wave, the alpha wave, known for its inhibitory function, is also induced by subliminally presented conflictual subject-specific stimuli. Therefore, alpha synchronization could serve as the brain mechanism of unconscious defense. The results only make sense if we suppose the existence of a dynamic unconscious, which has inherited childhood conflicts, and with privileged connections to neurotic symptom characteristics. Moreover, by showing that the unconscious conflict phrases, inferred by clinicians from clinical interviews, have a similar brain behavior, Shevrin and his team provide evidence that these inferences are not simply clinician-dependent subjective interpretations but also imply some form of independent mental reality. Finally, interpretation of the results has led us to propose two distinct physiological mechanisms for defense: one, unconscious defense, by alpha synchronization in connection with the drive derivatives, and another, repression, based on the indications of reality in connection with the ego.

For example, temporal (plant thatch from the previous terrestrial phase) and spatial (nutrient runoff) factors may have strong effects on emergence and population densities during the aquatic phase. We examined the effects of hydroperiod stability, thatch, and nutrients on the emergence and density of 4 vernal pool endemic species: Branchinecta lynchi (Anostraca), Linderiella occidentalis (Anostraca), Lepidurus packardi (Notostraca), and Cyzicus californicus (Spinicaudata).

Hydroperiod and thatch differentially affected 3 of the 4 species based on emergence timing and life cycle. Treatments had effects on many water quality variables, and these variables were correlated with densities. These results highlight how hydroperiod stability along with other processes can affect large branchiopod species in temporary freshwater ecosystems.

It is based on a series of sensorimotor transformations through which the affordances of the objects to be grasped are transformed into appropriate hand movements. It is generally accepted that a circuit formed by inferior parietal areas AIP and PFG and ventral premotor area F5 represents the core circuit for sensorimotor transformations for grasping. However, selection and control of appropriate grip should also depend on higher-order information, such as the meaning of the object to be grasped, and the overarching goal of the action in which grasping is embedded. In this review, we describe recent findings showing that specific sectors of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex are instrumental in controlling higher-order aspects of grasping. We show that these prefrontal sectors control the premotor cortex through two main gateways: the anterior subdivision of ventral area F5-sub-area F5a-, and the pre-supplementary area (area F6). We then review functional studies showing that both F5a and F6, besides being relay stations of prefrontal information, also play specific roles in grasping. Namely, sub-area F5a is involved in stereoscopic analysis of 3D objects, and in planning cue-dependent grasping activity. As for area F6, this area appears to play a crucial role in determining when to execute the motor program encoded in the parieto-premotor circuit. The recent discovery that area F6 contains a set of neurons encoding specific grip types suggests that this area, besides controlling “when to go”, also may control the grip type, i.e., “how to go”. We conclude by discussing clinical syndromes affecting grasping actions and their possible mechanisms. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Contextual control; Goal coding; Prefrontal cortex; Premotor cortex; Sensorimotor transformation for object grasping; SII","association; brain function; hand movement; human; inferior parietal lobule; lateral prefrontal cortex; motor control; motor performance; neuroanatomy; object grasping network; parietal cortex; prefrontal cortex; premotor cortex; primary motor cortex; priority journal; Review; rostral premotor area; ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; visuomotor coordination",2-s2.0-85026914267

However, little is known about the impacts of these invasive predators on bats (Chiroptera), one of the most specious mammal groups, and one of the most widespread groups of mammals threatened on oceanic islands (> 200 spp.). Nearly 50% of the world's threatened bats are island endemics and because they are often the only native mammals on islands, they fulfil important ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal. Long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are critically endangered because of predation by exotic mammals, particularly ship rats (Rattus rattus), introduced by humans to the island archipelago of New Zealand. We monitored the survival of bats in three colonies in temperate rainforest in Fiordland over 22 years. Since 2009, we controlled predators during irruption phases and compared survival of bats in previously untreated areas with survival in forest blocks treated using rodenticides deployed in bait stations. Survival was estimated using multi-state mark-recapture models in Program Mark 7.0 with > 15,000 bats tagged. Survival was primarily dependent on year and age of bats, although seedfall intensity of the dominant canopy tree and predator management was also influential. Survival in long-tailed bats was as high as, or higher, than figures for bats generally in years with low predator numbers or predator control. Survival was markedly higher in treatment years when predators were managed (0.82 compared to 0.55). Population modelling indicated managed colonies will increase (λ > 1.05) whereas unmanaged colonies will decline (λ = 0.89 − 0.98) under scenarios that reflect increased frequency of beech mast and predator irruptions. Thus, effective predator control is essential for recovering long-tailed bat populations. Warming temperatures indicate that predator irruptions are becoming more frequent, which would require more predator control in the future than at present if declines in bat populations are to be reversed. These results are relevant to the conservation of threatened bats on oceanic islands, given the abundance of exotic mammalian predators, particularly ship rats, on them. © 2017","Climate change; Mammals; Mustelids; Population models; Predator control; Rats","Chalinolobus tuberculatus; Chiroptera; Fagus; Mammalia; Mustelidae; Rattus; Rattus rattus",2-s2.0-85027719679

The main objectives of this project were to identify non-Toll interleukin receptor, nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat (nTNL) genes and elucidate their evolutionary divergence across six plant genomes. Using reference sequences from Arabidopsis, we investigated nTNL orthologs in the genomes of common bean, Medicago, soybean, poplar, and rice. We used Hidden Markov Models for sequence identification, performed model-based phylogenetic analyses, visualized chromosomal positioning, inferred gene clustering, and assessed gene expression profiles. We analyzed 908 nTNL R genes in the genomes of the six plant species, and classified them into 12 subgroups based on the presence of coiled-coil (CC), nucleotide binding site (NBS), leucine rich repeat (LRR), resistance to Powdery mildew 8 (RPW8), and BED type zinc finger domains. Traditionally classified CC-NBS-LRR (CNL) genes were nested into four clades (CNL A-D) often with abundant, well-supported homogeneous subclades of Type-II R genes. CNL-D members were absent in rice, indicating a unique R gene retention pattern in the rice genome. Genomes from Arabidopsis, common bean, poplar and soybean had one chromosome without any CNL R genes. Medicago and Arabidopsis had the highest and lowest number of gene clusters, respectively. Gene expression analyses suggested unique patterns of expression for each of the CNL clades. Differential gene expression patterns of the nTNL genes were often found to correlate with number of introns and GC content, suggesting structural and functional divergence. © 2017 by the authors.

Global defaunation, and particularly the loss of frugivores, may negatively affect the seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited plant species, with predictable stronger impacts in simplified communities such as those on oceanic islands. However, logistical difficulties have hindered the experimental and theoretical need to disentangle the roles of species identity, richness (i.e. number of species) and abundance. Consequently, studies to date have focused exclusively on the loss of species richness leaving us largely ignorant regarding how species identity and abundance affect the loss of ecosystem functions. Here, we applied a network approach to disentangle the effects of disperser abundance, richness and identity on the seed dispersal service provided by frugivores to the Galapagos plant community. We found that both abundance and richness of the dispersers significantly affect the function of seed dispersal and that richness becomes increasingly important as disperser abundance declines. Extinction simulations revealed that the order of species loss has profound implications to the plant community. On the one hand, abundant generalist dispersers like the Galapagos lizards, can mitigate the loss of specialized dispersers. On the other hand, specific threats affecting key dispersers can lead to the rapid collapse of the community-level dispersal services. Our results suggest that the identity of the disperser species lost can have a large effect on the number of plant species dispersed, and generalist species are essential to the persistence of the community dispersal service. Both abundance and species richness of seed dispersers are key and synergistic drivers of the number of plant species dispersed. Consequently, the coupled negative effect of population declines and species extinctions in frugivore assemblages may lead to an accelerated loss of the seed dispersal function. plain language summary is available for this article. © 2017 The Authors.

The benthic environment has changed (e.g. food resources, sediment particle sizes and nutrients) over the decades, contributing to the substantial changes in zoobenthos abundance and community composition that may constitute a regime change in the lake. © 2017 International Association for Great Lakes Research","Eutrophication; Invertebrates; Lake Winnipeg; Long-term change; Regime change; Zoobenthos","Carbon; Eutrophication; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Invertebrates; Lake Winnipeg; Long term change; Regime change; Zoobenthos; Lakes; benthos; environmental stress; eutrophication; hydrological regime; invertebrate; long-term change; nutrient dynamics; organic carbon; population decline; population density; population dynamics; temporal variation; trend analysis; zoobenthos; Canada; Lake Winnipeg; Manitoba; Amphipoda; Chironomidae; Diptera; Ephemeridae; Ephemeroptera; Invertebrata; Leptoceridae; Mollusca; Sphaeriidae (bivalves); Trichoptera",2-s2.0-85021232071

To better understand some aspects related to the invasion of this species in the reservoir, we assessed its diet through the analysis of stomach contents, niche breadth and feeding selectivity. Simultaneously to fish catches, zooplankton samples were collected at three reservoir arms with different anthropic influences during the dry and rainy seasons of 2014. Zooplankton diversity and dominance varied between sites, while composition at the genus level was similar. Sprat fed predominantly on zooplankton (68.3%), consuming a broad diversity of prey (Bosmina, Lecane, Chydoridae, Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida copepods), which were selectively predated. Consumed species varied according to site, season and fish size, with Cladocera being dominant at the most eutrophic site (Bororé). Considering spatial differences in the consumed zooplankton, the analysis of percentage similarity (SIMPER) indicated the highest dissimilarity (95.3%) between the Bororé (hypereutrophic) and Grande River Reservoir (supereutrophic) sites, while trophic niche width increased from the most impacted (Bororé) to the most preserved site (Capivari). The high captures of the sprat in the Billings Complex reported by local fishermen, indicated the adaptability of this invasive fish to the new habitat, suggesting that it may possess a central role as the dominant zooplankton predator in the system. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Clupeiformes; Eutrophication; Feeding habits; Prey selectivity; Zooplankton","biological invasion; brackish water; clupeoid; diet; environmental conditions; eutrophic environment; eutrophication; feeding behavior; fishing community; freshwater environment; Neotropical Region; niche breadth; prey selection; reservoir; stomach content; trophic environment; urban area; zooplankton; Brazil; Rio Grande [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Tiete Basin; Bosmina; Chydoridae; Cladocera; Clupeidae; Clupeiformes; Copepoda; Cyclopoida; Harpacticoida; Lecane; Platanichthys platana; Sprattus sprattus",2-s2.0-85021924639

The bacterial diversity and community composition within hosts may play an important role in shaping insect population biology, ecology and evolution. We focussed on the bacterial microbiome of the Australian fig homotomid Mycopsylla fici (Hemiptera: Psylloidea), which can cause defoliation of its only host tree, Ficus macrophylla. This sap-feeding insect is native to mainland Australia and Lord Howe Island (LHI) but also occurs where its host has been planted, notably in New Zealand. By using a high-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing approach, we compared the bacterial diversity and community composition in individual adult males of four host populations, Sydney, Brisbane, LHI and Auckland. We also compared males, females and nymphs of the Sydney population. The microbiome of M. fici was simple and consisted mostly of the following three maternally inherited endosymbiont species: the primary endosymbiont Carsonella, a secondary (S-) endosymbiont and Wolbachia. However, the relative abundance of their sequence reads varied between host populations, except for similarities between Sydney and Auckland. In addition, insects from Sydney and Auckland had identical bacterial strains supporting the hypothesis that Sydney is the source population for Auckland. In contrast, mainland and LHI populations harboured the same S-endosymbiont, co-diverged Carsonella but different Wolbachia strains. Besides detecting endosymbiont-specific patterns of either co-evolution or horizontal acquisition, our study highlights that relative abundance of maternally inherited endosymbionts should also be taken into account when studying bacterial communities across host populations, as variations in bacterial density may impact host biology and ecology. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Carsonella; Endosymbiont; Geography; Psyllid; Wolbachia",,2-s2.0-85017166535

In total, we reviewed 317 publications and found biodiversity and UES metrics mentioned 944 times. Only 228 (24%) of the 944 mentions were empirically tested.

Our review showed that taxonomic metrics were used most often as proxies for biodiversity, with very little attention given to functional biodiversity metrics. Similarly, the role of particular species, including non-natives, and specific functional traits are understudied. Finally, we found a paucity of empirical evidence underpinning urban BES relationships.

Thus, FRE are the only known arbuscule-forming fungi not within the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomeromycotina) as currently understood. Phylogenetic differences between FRE and AMF could reflect ecological differences. To synthesize current ecological knowledge, we reviewed the literature on FRE and identified 108 papers that noted the presence of FRE and, in some, the colonization levels for FRE or AMF (or both). We categorized these records by geographic region, host-plant family and environment (agriculture, moderate-natural, low-temperature, high-altitude and other) and determined their influence on the percentage of root length colonized by FRE in a meta-analysis. We found that FRE are globally distributed, with many observations from Poaceae, perhaps due to grasses being widely distributed. In agricultural environments, colonization by FRE often equalled or exceeded that of AMF, particularly in Australasia. In moderate-natural and high-altitude environments, average colonization by FRE (~10%) was lower than that of AMF (~35%), whereas in low-temperature environments, colonization was similar (~20%). Several studies suggested that FRE can enhance host-plant phosphorus uptake and growth, and may be more resilient than AMF to environmental stress in some host plants. Further research is required on the functioning of FRE in relation to the environment, host plant and co-occurring AMF and, in particular, to examine whether FRE are important for plant growth in stressful environments.

We surveyed Weka and their feather lice in native and introduced populations using genetic data gathered from DNA sequences of mitochondrial genes and nuclear β-fibrinogen and five microsatellite loci. We found low genetic diversity among extant Weka population samples. Two genetic clusters were evident in the mtDNA from Weka and their lice, but partitioning at nuclear loci was less abrupt. Many formerly recognized subspecies/species were not supported; instead, we infer one subspecies for each of the two main New Zealand islands. Although currently range restricted, North Island Weka have higher mtDNA diversity than the more wide-ranging southern Weka. Mismatch and neutrality statistics indicate North Island Weka experienced rapid and recent population reduction, while South Island Weka display the signature of recent expansion.

Disease is commonly ignored or dismissed in investigations of wildlife declines, partly because there is often little or no obvious clinical evidence of illness. We argue that disease has the potential to cause many species declines and extinctions and that there is mounting evidence that this is a more important cause of declines than has been appreciated. We summarise case studies of diseases that have affected wildlife to the point of extinction and bring together the experiences of wildlife managers, veterinarians, epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, zoologists and ecologists to provide an investigation framework to help ecologists and wildlife managers address disease as a factor in wildlife declines. Catastrophic declines of wildlife may be the result of single or multiple synergistic causes, and disease should always be one factor under consideration, unless proven otherwise.

Along with severe negative effects on human and animal health and crop production, it also causes harm to ecosystem functioning by reducing the native plant species biodiversity. However, its impacts on native plant species, especially in pasture communities, are less known. Given parthenium weed causes substantial losses to Australian pastures’ productivity, it is crucial to estimate its impact on pasture communities. This study evaluates the impact of parthenium weed upon species diversity in a pasture community at Kilcoy, south east Queensland, Australia. Sub-sites containing three levels of parthenium weed density (i.e. high, low and zero) were chosen to quantify the above- and below-ground plant community structure. Species richness, diversity and evenness were all found to be significantly reduced as the density of parthenium weed increased; an effect was evident even when parthenium weed was present at relatively low densities (i.e. two plants m−2). This trend was observed in the summer season as well as in winter season when this annual weed was absent from the above-ground plant community. This demonstrates the strong impact that parthenium weed has upon the community composition and functioning throughout the year. It also shows the long-term impact of parthenium weed on the soil seed bank where it had displaced several native species. So, management options used for parthenium weed should also consider the reduction of parthenium weed seed bank along with controlling its above-ground populations. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany","Biodiversity; Biological invasion; Parthenium weed; Pasture; Soil seed bank; Weed management",,2-s2.0-85030158315

The ecosystems of the Israeli Mediterranean coast have undergone significant ecological changes in recent decades, caused primarily by the introduction of alien species, fishing and the warming of the waters. Here we used a food-web model representing the continental shelf of the Israeli Mediterranean coast to explore the historical dynamics of the area considering the combined effect of alien species, fishing activities and changes in sea surface temperature and primary productivity. The food-web model was fitted to available time series of data from the early 1990s to 2010 using the temporal dynamic module of the Ecopath with Ecosim modeling approach. An important challenge was to model the numerous alien species inhabiting the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, one of the most invaded marine ecosystems of the world. Historical model simulations satisfactorily matched observed data, especially regarding alien groups. However, lack of data from the pelagic environment limited our ability to compare model output with historical observations. Trophic interactions, climate change and fishing were important factors explaining the historical dynamics of the ecosystem, which showed a degradation pattern over time. Results also highlighted an increasing proportion of alien species in biomass and catch over time, with important effects on the food web.

For non-indigenous species, larval settlement behavior can determine invasive potential by influencing initial invasion success, secondary spread, and persistence of species outside their native environments. Membranipora membranacea is an ecologically significant invasive bryozoan in the northwest Atlantic, where settlers are most abundant on some but not all species of kelp. Whether the increased abundance of M. membranacea on select kelp species is the result of larval settlement preference remains unknown. In this study, we examine selective settlement by larvae of M. membranacea by (1) quantifying settlers in mixed kelp beds and determining whether larvae settle preferentially with respect to kelp species, (2) conducting laboratory settlement preference experiments using the most abundant kelp substrates in Nova Scotia, and (3) examining whether the presence of kelp beds provides a settlement cue for larvae by quantifying settlement of M. membranacea on plates deployed within and outside of kelp beds. Contrary to settlement behavior described for native populations, our results suggest that larvae of M. membranacea in invaded habitats do not exhibit preference for settling on particular kelp species or within kelp beds. Instead, larvae settle on substrates extending furthest above the primary substratum. Lack of substrate specificity suggests that M. membranacea will continue to persist in the northwest Atlantic despite significant declines in regional kelp abundance.

Experiment 1 found that perceiving fictitious aliens’ experience of the same primary emotions (e.g. sadness) presented in mixed vs. non-mixed valence pairs led to reduced prejudice via attenuated dehumanisation, i.e. attribution of uniquely human emotions. Experiment 2 confirmed these results, using an unfamiliar real-world group as an outgroup target. Experiment 3 used a familiar outgroup and found generally similar effects, reducing social distance through reduced dehumanisation.

Assessing the impacts of a biocontrol program includes evaluating the establishment of biocontrol agents, the control of target pest, the impact on the affected organism, and the indirect impacts that the biocontrol agent may have on the whole community. We assessed the recovery of forest vegetation following the mortality of ash trees caused by the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) pest in forest stands where biocontrol agents were released or not. We used a multilevel framework to evaluate potential indirect effects of the biocontrol agents on native forest seedlings. Our results showed a higher number of ash saplings where increasing numbers of the dominant EAB biocontrol agent were released, while the number of invasive and weedy saplings was negatively associated with the number of ash saplings, and the density of native seedlings was negatively associated with invasive and weedy saplings. The protection of ash saplings by the biocontrol agent may help native recruitment during forest transition by supporting the growth of native hardwood seedlings over invasive and weedy species. These results show that research on the efficacy of EAB biocontrol should include all ash size classes and the community dynamics of co-occurring species. © 2017 by the authors.","Agrilus planipennis; Fraxinus spp; Gap dynamics; Invasive species; Oobius agrili; Southeastern Michigan; Spathius agrili; Temperate forests; Tetrastichus planipennisi","Forestry; Vegetation; Agrilus planipennis; Fraxinus; Gap dynamics; Invasive species; Michigan; Oobius agrili; Spathius agrili; Temperate forests; Tetrastichus planipennisi; Biocontrol; assessment method; biological control; community dynamics; forest management; gap dynamics; invasive species; pest control; recruitment (population dynamics); species occurrence; stand dynamics; vegetation; wasp; Forestry; Mortality; Pest Control; Plants; Saplings; Seedlings; Michigan; United States; Agrilus planipennis; Fraxinus; Spathius agrili; Tetrastichus",2-s2.0-85030089492

These behaviours depend directly on genes expressed in focal individuals but also indirectly on genes expressed in other family members. However, how sibling and parental behavioural strategies are modified by genes expressed in family members, and to what degree, remains unclear. To answer this question, we have used a split litter design in an experimental population of genetically variable mouse families, and identified loci that indirectly affected sibling and maternal behaviour simultaneously. These loci map to genomic regions that also show a direct effect on offspring behaviour. Directly and indirectly affected traits were significantly correlated at the phenotypic level, illustrating how indirect effects are caused. Genetic variants in offspring that influence solicitation also impacted their siblings’ and maternal behaviour. However, in contrast to predictions from sibling competition, unrelated litter mates benefited from increased solicitation. Overall, such indirect genetic effects explained a large proportion of variation seen in behaviours, with candidate genes involved in metabolism to neuronal development. These results reveal that we need to view behavioural strategies as the result of conjoint selection on genetic variation in all interacting family members. © 2017 The Authors.","Family conflicts; Indirect genetic effects; Parent-offspring conflict; Systems genetics",,2-s2.0-85030720252

In order to define DE’s space of possibilities we need to explore DE’s consequences regarding both necessity and possibility. Unfortunately, the notion of possibility has not received much attention within the DE literature. In this paper, I attempt to fill this gap. I argue that the standard way of understanding possibility found in the literature—a proposition is possible iff it expresses the manifestation of some actual disposition—needlessly restricts the space of possibilities by not accepting global and absolute possibilities, including some alien properties, as genuinely possible. I propose instead to accept a more permissive understanding of possibility: a proposition is possible iff it does not contradict any of the necessities that follow from the core commitments of DE. This allows dispositionalists to expand their modal space and to account for modal intuitions that may otherwise undermine the tenability of DE. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Dispositional essentialism; Dispositions; Laws of nature; Necessity; Possibility; Powers",,2-s2.0-85029905561

The rate of tailings production continues to increase globally, and this increase has occurred asynchronously with our capacity to ameliorate ecological hostility and implement successful restoration programs on tailings landforms. Scope: There is currently a lack of sufficient technology to deliver timely and cost-effective restoration outcomes to tailings landscapes. The decadal to millennial time scale of soil formation driven by natural pedogenic processes is at odds with the short mine closure timeframes (≤5 years) and aspirations of newly formulated international standards for the practice of ecological restoration. This lack of restoration capability places biodiversity at risk, and not only jeopardises the economic viability of the mining industry but also impacts upon its social and environmental license to mine.

Understanding the colonization dynamics of aquatic invasive plant species is of high importance for preservation of native biodiversity. Many aquatic invasive plants rely on clonal reproduction to spread, but mixed reproductive modes are common. Under future climate changes, these species may favor a sexual reproductive mode. The aim of this study was to test the germination capacity and the seedling growth of two water primrose species, Ludwigia hexapetala and Ludwigia peploides, both invasive in Europe and in the United States. We performed a reciprocal transplant of seeds of L. hexapetala and L. peploides from two invasive ranges into experimental gardens characterized by Oceanic and Mediterranean-type climates. Our results showed that higher temperatures increased or maintained germination percentages and velocity, decreased survivorship of germinants, but increased their production of biomass. The origin of the seeds had low impact on L. hexapetala responses to temperature, but greatly influenced those of L. peploides. The invasiveness of water primroses in ranges with Oceanic climates might increase with temperature. The recruitment from seed banks by these species should be considered by managers to improve the conservation of native aquatic and wetland plant species. © 2017 Gillard, Grewell, Futrell, Deleu and Thiébaut.","Aquatic ecosystems; Biodiversity; Climate warming; Invasive plants; Ludwigia spp; Plant reproduction",,2-s2.0-85030835520

Whereas adjudication seeks generally to resolve disputes in accordance with justice, understood in classical Western thought as the rendering to each what is due, informal dispute resolution is oriented more towards the common good, understood classically as the maintenance of a peaceful social order that allows people to pursue their individual and collective goals in community. These conceptions of justice and the common good are not uncontroversial but their ideologies play a significant role in dispute resolution discourse in both the US and China.

The current research targets Japanese university students and adds several insights into the nature of these attitudes through the analysis of 95 open-ended questionnaires and 18 conversational interviews. First of all, the participants' negative language attitudes embraced notable contradictions. Also, their ambivalence was scarcely evident, and more to the point, a matter of degree. Moreover, it is the doxic experience (Bourdieu 1977, Outline of a theory of practice. Trans. Richard Nice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) within Japanese society that was likely to hinder grounding those attitudes on their own critical thinking and valuing their English communication ability with non-Japanese. And most importantly, it was easy for them to appreciate English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) perspectives, so long as they would like to use English for international communication. More precisely, while they were unlikely to have any previous attitudes towards the unfamiliar representation of their English (i.e. from ELF perspectives), they were highly likely to develop positive attitudes towards it.

Although geographic distances may be short, it is still unclear if such environments are inhabited evenly with panmictic conditions or if limited connectivity between marine populations, even on small geographic scales, leads to genetic differentiation between areas within the archipelago or even single reef structures. To study diversity patterns and connectivity between reefs of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, population genetic analyses of two reef organisms were performed by using the mitochondrial control region and microsatellite markers. A vertebrate (clown anemonefish) and an invertebrate species (sea squirt) were studied in parallel to investigate if there are general patterns of connectivity in Spermonde for sessile or site attached marine species, which can be extrapolated to a larger group. The genetic population structures revealed restrictions in gene flow in the clown anemone fish (Amphiprion ocellaris), especially between near-shore reefs in the South of the archipelago. This indicates very localized genetic exchange and may also reflect the high self-recruitment typical for these fish. The northern reefs show higher connectivity despite geographic distances being larger. The filter-feeding sessile sea squirt, Polycarpa aurata, features similar population patterns, especially in the southern area. However, connectivity is generally higher in the middle and shelf edge areas of Spermonde for this species. The results underline that there are restrictions to gene flow even on very small geographic scales in the studied organisms, with many barriers to gene flow in the southern shallower shelf area. Weaker currents in this area may lead to more influence of biological factors for dispersal, such as larval behavior, motility and competition for suitable habitat.

In fact, potential invaders are frequently released into areas with sub-optimal environmental conditions, and are not able to reproduce or establish viable populations. SDMs are mainly focused on determining species environmental suitability and in the case of invasive species modelling these do not integrate the invasion as a process, missing the crucial human contribution. Our model aims to introduce novelty by incorporating variables representing human activities such as pet shop densities or human areas. These are directly related with the studied species invasion pathway. Here we investigate the binomial influence of reproductive occurrences and human-related variables on invasive pet distribution modelling. As our model species, we used the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans (T.s.e.), an iconic invasive species with worldwide dissemination. Ten variables (predictors) were selected for T.s.e. modelling. These were four bioclimatic (BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature, BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter, BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter and BIO12 = Annual Precipitation), three topographic (altitude, slope and the compound topographical index (CTI)), and three human variables (pet shop density, distance to urban areas and human density). To model suitability for T.s.e. establishment we tested four combinations of three sets of descriptor variables (human, environmental and both), with two types of occurrence records (reproductive or all records), at a global (worldwide) or regional scale (Iberian Peninsula (IP)). For each combination, an ensemble of niche-based models (NBMs) was built using nine different types of models implemented in BIOMOD2. In worldwide modelling, the use of reproductive occurrence records enables the most accurate predictions. At a regional scale, the combination of environmental and human variables promotes higher accuracy than using human variables alone. For worldwide and regional modelling, the most important variables are associated with temperature (Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter; Annual Mean Temperature; Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter). For regional modelling the human variable with highest importance was human density. Our approach may be useful for the management of released pet invaders, namely identifying high invasion risk areas where management efforts should be prioritized. From our models we recommend that T.s.e. management efforts should be prioritized to coastal and lowland areas. This study highlights that when modelling invasive species distributions, it is very important to use records that accurately represent species establishment (e.g. species breeding). Moreover, it clarified that variables associated to propagule pressure can improve model performance, even though these are much less used than bioclimatic variables. This modelling framework may be applied to other invasive species with different invasion pathways, by using different variables, directly linked with the respective invasion vectors and taking into account anthropogenic pressure. These modelling procedures should provide a better view of areas at risk of invasion, should improve management efforts and should also provide important insights on the role of human vectors on the shaping of invasive species distribution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biological invasion; Freshwater; Habitat suitability; Pets; Propagule pressure; Red-eared slider turtle","Polyethylene terephthalates; Risk assessment; Biological invasion; Freshwater; Habitat suitability; Propagule pressures; Red-eared slider turtle; Population distribution; accuracy assessment; biological invasion; domestic species; ecological modeling; environmental conditions; freshwater ecosystem; habitat selection; human activity; invasive species; prioritization; propagule; turtle; Iberian Peninsula; Trachemys scripta; Trachemys scripta elegans",2-s2.0-85022345285

A. petiolata was originally lethal to most larvae of the native butterfly but during the past 20+ years it has been incorporated successfully into the larval diet, likely through evolutionary change. The region was also invaded by another exotic plant, Cardamine pratensis, on which the native butterfly larvae readily develops, allowing the possibility of population rescue. Further complicating the butterfly's reproductive dynamics, it is multigenerational within a summer, and host plant availability and location change during the summer. Our goal is to model the expected dynamics of the native butterfly population in this evolving, dynamic landscape by using a new bio-inspired paradigm known as membrane computing. In this context, a Probabilistic Guarded Scripted P system has been designed to model and explore the conditions under which an allele conferring ability of P. oleracea larvae to develop on A. petiolata might have proliferated. The design describes a population dynamics model whose parameter values are derived from experimental and observational data.

While many did not survive the initial onslaught and the years of turmoil that followed, and rulers that opposed the Mongols were largely swept away, the communities and dynasties that remained were forced to seek some sort of accommodation with the new overlords. While subjection to the Mongol yoke was far from desirable, rulers could seek to make the best of the situation, in the hope that the ambitions of the Mongols might come to match their own, or that the Mongols might be persuaded to support their cause. This paper will consider how certain Christian groups in the Near East sought to reconcile themselves to the Mongol presence, and how they sought to place these alien invaders within a more familiar framework. In particular it will examine the visual evidence for this process by looking at a couple of appearances of recognisably Mongol figures within Christian artwork, dating from the time of the second major Mongol invasion of the region, led by the Ilkhan Hülegü, which by 1260 had extended Mongol power into Syria and to the borders of Egypt. 1 Copyright © The Royal Asiatic Society 2017",,,2-s2.0-85030853040

However, unclear interspecific phylogeny and genome-wide variation has limited the utilization of A. cristatum in the production of superior wheat varieties. In this study, by sequencing the transcriptome of the representative tetraploid A. cristatum Z559 and the common wheat variety Fukuhokomugi (Fukuho), which are often used as parents in a wide cross, their phylogenetic relationship and interspecific variation were dissected. First, 214,854 transcript sequences were assembled, and 3,457 orthologous genes related to traits of interest were identified in A. cristatum. Second, a total of 72 putative orthologous gene clusters were used to construct phylogenetic relationships among A. cristatum, Triticeae and other genomes. A clear division between A. cristatum and the other Triticeae species was revealed. Third, the sequence similarity of most genes related to traits of interest is greater than 95% between A. cristatum and wheat. Therefore, using the 5% mismatch parameter for A. cristatum, we mapped the transcriptome sequencing data to wheat reference sequences to discover the variations between A. cristatum and wheat and 862,340 high-quality variants were identified. Additionally, compared with the wheat A and B genomes, the P and D genomes displayed an obviously larger variant density and a longer evolutionary distance, suggesting that A. cristatum is more distantly related to the wheat D genome. Finally, by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR array (KASPar) technology, 37 of 53 (69.8%) SNPs were shown to be genuine in Z559, Fukuho, and additional lines with seven different P chromosomes, and function of the genes in which these SNPs are located were also determined.

As a functional evidence of TaMYC1 and Pp3 being the same, higher transcriptional activity of the TaMYC1 gene in colored pericarp compared to uncolored one has been demonstrated. In the current study, we present additional strong evidences of TaMYC1 to be a synonym of Pp3. Furthermore, we have found differences between dominant and recessive Pp3(TaMyc1) alleles. Light enhancement of TaMYC1 transcription was paralleled with increased AP accumulation only in purple-grain wheat. Coexpression of TaMYC1 and the maize MYB TF gene ZmC1 induced AP accumulation in the coleoptile of white-grain wheat. Suppression of TaMYC1 significantly reduced AP content in purple grains. Two distinct TaMYC1 alleles (TaMYC1p and TaMYC1w) were isolated from purple- and white-grained wheat, respectively. A unique, compound cis-acting regulatory element had six copies in the promoter of TaMYC1p, but was present only once in TaMYC1w. Analysis of recombinant inbred lines showed that TaMYC1p was necessary but not sufficient for AP accumulation in the pericarp tissues. Examination of larger sets of germplasm lines indicated that the evolution of purple pericarp in tetraploid wheat was accompanied by the presence of TaMYC1p. Our findings may promote more systematic basic and applied studies of anthocyanins in common wheat and related Triticeae crops. © 2017 Zong, Xi, Li, Chen, Zhang, Liu, Liu, Wang and Zhang.","Anthocyanin biosynthesis; BHLH transcription factor; Common wheat; Pp3; Purple pericarp",,2-s2.0-85030833009

As such, job accommodations are an effective tool to secure the continued employment of aging workers who develop disabilities across their life span. However, while accommodations tackle health-related performance problems, they might create new challenges on the part of the affected employee. Building on the organizational change and accommodations literatures, we propose a theoretical framework of negative experiences during accommodation processes and apply it to qualitative data from group interviews with 73 manufacturing workers at a German industrial company who were part of the company's job accommodation program. Although problems associated with health-related impairments were mostly solved by accommodation, affected employees with disabilities reported about interpersonal problems and conflicts similar to those that typically occur during organizational change. Lack of social support as well as poor communication and information were raised as criticisms. Furthermore, our findings indicate that discrimination, bullying, and maltreatment appear to be common during accommodation processes. To make accommodation processes more successful, we derive recommendations from the organizational change literature and apply it to the accommodation context. We also emphasize unique characteristics of the accommodation setting and translate these into practical implications. © 2017 Kensbock, Boehm and Bourovoi.","Aging workforce; Disability; Impairment; Interpersonal conflicts, organizational change; Job accommodation; Workplace accommodation",,2-s2.0-85029630955

Building from a critique of these methods as profoundly anthropocentric, the authors examine three crucial problematics in which methodocentrism functions in educational research: the institutionalization of graduate training, a wide-spread privileging of the visual (part and parcel of empiricism), and the seeming necessity of ‘data’ in social scientific research methodologies. Ultimately, this article does not reject the necessity of particular studies having methods—rigorous, philosophically grounded approaches to problems in the world—but it argues that the belief that methods must be selected from existing options and assembled before approaching the ‘objects’ of study is not only a form of bad science, it is also deeply implicated in anthropocentric and colonialist politics.

We deem such research critical in the backdrop of public's heavy reliance and feverish pursuit of low-fee English-medium schools which have expanded exponentially off late. Deploying mixed methodology that utilized a questionnaire, interviews and observation, the research draws information from students, teachers and school principals. Results suggest that most respondents perceive early-English policy inevitable, and believe that the earlier the English-medium policy, the better. Respondents’ majority also views additive multilingual policy unfavorably presuming that more languages will amount to learners’ confusion. Teaching mother tongues is being perceived as waste of time. Actual English teaching practices appear illusory, as direct and contextualized use of English is a rare feature while Urdu stands as the de facto medium of classroom transactions. Grammar-translation methodologies and classrooms activities leave little potential for communicative competence, concept formulation and linguistic internalization.

These fuels are themselves a function of vegetation, and share the complexity and dynamics of natural systems. Worldwide, the requirement for solutions to the threat of fire to human values has resulted in the development of systems for predicting fire behaviour. To date, regional differences in vegetation and independent fire model development has resulted a variety of approaches being used to describe, measure and map fuels. As a result, widely different systems have been adopted, resulting in incompatibilities that pose challenges to applying research findings and fire models outside their development domains. As combustion is a fundamental process, the same relationships between fuel and fire behaviour occur universally. Consequently, there is potential for developing novel fuel assessment methods that are more broadly applicable and allow fire research to be leveraged worldwide. Such a movement would require broad cooperation between researchers and would most likely necessitate a focus on universal properties of fuel. However, to truly understand fuel dynamics, the complex biotic nature of fuel would also need to remain a consideration-particularly when looking to understand the effects of altered fire regimes or changing climate. © 2017 by the authors.

The combination of these threats have led to losses of native biota, altered hydrological and ecosystem processes, and reduced ecosystem services. These threats pose complex problems to often underfunded management entities. We developed a watershed decision support tool (WDST) for the windward coast of Hawai‘i Island aimed at prioritizing catchments for invasive species removal and native forest protection from non-native species invasions. Using the Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) system, we integrated spatial data from four sources: (i) native and invasive species coverage; (ii) modeled water yield; (iii) treatment cost and efficacy; and (iv) native species conservation value. We used a distributed hydrology model (DHSVM) to estimate catchment-level (∼90 ha) water yield under six climate and non-native species invasion scenarios to identify where (1) invasive species removal and (2) protection from invasion would have the greatest benefit to increasing or maintaining native biodiversity and hydrologic functioning. The hydrology model predicted a 30% decline (386 Gl yr−1) in total water yield under a drier future climate (20% reduction in rainfall), with an additional 2% reduction when catchments were fully invaded by non-native species. Increased temperatures had a small compensatory effect on water yield. The WDST identified 6.3% of the study area as high priority for invasive species removal, based on characteristics of large hydrological response to the removal treatment (concentrated in high rainfall areas), high quality road or trail access, and high conservation value. High protection priority from invasive species (5.9% by area) occurred in higher elevation catchments, near the upper range of strawberry guava (the main invasive species), where water yield was most sensitive to invasion. Climate change scenarios had little influence on the spatial distribution of priority scores despite large changes in overall water yield. In contrast, priority scores were sensitive to very high variation in treatment costs, which were influenced largely by travel times to catchments via road and trail networks. This last finding suggests that future management feasibility will hinge on improvements to road and trail networks, or development of alternative management strategies that reduce travel costs and time. © 2017","Climate change; Climate change, Hawai‘i; Decision support; Ecosystem management; Hydrology modeling; Invasive species","Biodiversity; Catchments; Climate models; Complex networks; Conservation; Costs; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Highway administration; Hydrology; Information management; Rain; Roads and streets; Runoff; Transportation; Watersheds; Alternative management; Climate change scenarios; Decision support tools; Decision supports; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem Management Decision Support; Hydrology modeling; Invasive species; Climate change; biodiversity; biological invasion; catchment; climate change; decision support system; dicotyledon; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; forested catchment; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; invasive species; island biogeography; prioritization; spatial distribution; species conservation; water yield; watershed; Hawaii [United States]; United States; Psidium cattleianum",2-s2.0-85020873895

A pilot study demonstrated that samples could be pooled (5 samples per pool), and the overall process simplified without loss of detection of important known pathogens. In a full-scale study, pools of 5 samples were organized in a 5 × 5 matrix to facilitate attribution of a sequence to a precise sample directly from analysis of the matrix.

Furthermore, two types of potential mis-assembly were analyzed, and were shown to not affect the conclusions regarding the presence of the pathogens identified, but show that mis-assembly can affect the results when the objective is determining complete bona fide viral genome sequences.

Under current and future climate warming the frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing and will cause the plant community and organic soil to become more susceptible to fire. The organic soil consumption by fire is commonly used as a proxy for fire severity and is a large source of carbon release. However, the role of organic soils in both above- and belowground fire behavior has only rarely been studied. In this study we collected soil and branches from Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies/obovata from the taiga/tundra ecotone across a large spatial scale. In laboratory fire experiments we burned different fuel type combinations to examine the fire spread through fuel ladders both from branches to soil and vice versa. We found that the tree species identity influences the fire spread from branches to soil and vice versa. The combination of chemical and structural plant traits could explain the stronger interaction between soil and coniferous spruce and pine fuels in a fire ladder compared to the deciduous birch. Therefore, total carbon emission from a boreal forest fire may not only depend on burned plant fuel, but also on the species-specific potential of the trees to ignite the soil. Carbon emission models and forest management could be improved if not only the aboveground plant fuel consumption is considered, but also the interaction between fuels in a fuel ladder and the probability of soil ignition by a forest crown fire and vice versa. © 2017 The Authors","Boreal forest; Combustion; Fuel type interaction; Soil ignition; Species community","Combustion; Deforestation; Forestry; Fuels; Ignition; Ladders; Soils; Boreal forests; Fire experiments; Fuel types; Large spatial scale; Plant communities; Soil carbon stock; Species communities; Species specifics; Fires; aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; boreal forest; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; combustion; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; ecotone; experimental study; forest fire; fuel consumption; organic carbon; plant community; soil carbon; soil-vegetation interaction; Betula pubescens; Picea; Pinus sylvestris",2-s2.0-85021189943

More than 70% of the IOCBF has been lost to development, resulting in fragmented forest remnants within a mosaic of different land uses. We conducted camera-trap surveys with 5796 trap-days in 82 forest patches of various sizes across a gradient of land-use types in the IOCBF during the winter seasons of 2014–2016 to establish occupancy (Ψ) of SGT. We used occupancy modelling and incorporated forest microhabitat characteristics and surrounding land-use classifications to compare sites and determine SGT distribution across the habitat mosaic. The top model estimated an average Ψ = 0.39 ± 0.09, and detection probability (P) = 0.11 ± 0.03. At the landscape scale, larger, less isolated patches had a higher Ψ of SGT while P decreased with proximity to cultivated land. At the microhabitat scale, a high percentage of bare ground influenced Ψ positively but P negatively, as did short grass cover. However, short herbaceous cover and high stem density of large (11–15 m) trees influenced P positively. These results detail the influence of landscape-scale factors including forest fragmentation and conversion to agriculture in conjunction with forest microhabitat-scale characteristics, on patch selection and distribution of a cryptic, ground-dwelling species that is both threatened and under-studied.

However, the differences in post-fire vegetation dynamics between these ecosystems have seldom been compared using a uniform set of parameters. Additionally, post-fire dynamics of forest-savanna ecotones is poorly characterized. With the hypothesis that closed forest, savannas and ecotones will exhibit different post-fire responses, we studied the vegetation diversity, structure and dynamics in an upland forest-savanna vegetation mosaic in Minas Gerais, Brazil following a fire that occurred in September 2011. In January 2012, we identified, tagged, and measured the basal diameter of all regenerating juvenile tree stems within forty-six 4 m2 plots in closed forest, savanna and ecotone vegetation, and conducted recensuses in 2013 and 2014. We modelled the relationship between short-term dynamics parameters (recruitment, mortality, basal area loss and gain, and the turnover and net changes in the number of individual stems and basal areas) and vegetation type. Species diversity was higher in closed forests and ecotones than in savanna. Across all vegetation types, stem density decreased and basal area increased. Parameters such as recruitment, net changes in the number of individuals, and the gain, loss and turnover in basal area did not differ across vegetation types. However, stem mortality was higher in closed forest and ecotones combined than in savannas, and the net change in the number of individuals was the lowest in the savanna. Overall, our results support that within a climatically-similar vegetation mosaic, closed forests exhibit different post-fire regeneration dynamics from savanna as expected. Ecotones exhibited post-fire responses and dynamics more similar to closed forests than to savanna, but more studies will be needed to establish if this pattern is applicable to other areas. Understanding the longer-term vegetation dynamics and plant regeneration patterns is a potential next step that will help inform fire management strategies for forest-savanna mosaics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative stable states; Diversity; Fire disturbance; Forest-savanna ecotones; Structural change; Vegetation dynamics","Dynamics; Ecology; Ecosystems; Fires; Forestry; Plants (botany); Vegetation; Alternative stable state; Diversity; Fire disturbance; Forest-savanna ecotones; Structural change; Vegetation dynamics; Reforestation; basal area; biodiversity; ecotone; environmental factor; fire management; forest; heterogeneity; mortality; regeneration; savanna; upland region; vegetation dynamics; vegetation type; Brazil; Minas Gerais",2-s2.0-85020394129

Currently, a role for human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) is also emerging in some autoimmune/immune-mediated diseases, particularly in multiple sclerosis (MS). Both exogenous and endogenous retroviruses have the potential to elicit the processes leading to autoimmune disease. The pathogenicity of the retroviral envelope protein (Env) is a key player with notable importance in neuroimmune diseases. An essential prerequisite of retroviral infection is the interactions between Env (the retroviral adhesion) proteins on the virion and specific surface receptors on the host cell. These interactions facilitate fusion of the viral envelope and cellular membranes. Additional fusiogenic activities mediated by Env may be beneficial (establishment of the syncytiotrophoblast induced by a HERV-encoded Env) or detrimental to the host (syncytia formation, induction of apoptosis), and Envs are further implied in the direct induction of proinflammatory cytokines, the regulation of autophagy, and pathways of cell death. The pathogenic potential of retroviral Env is therefore not limited to the pathogenetics of infection but also comprise the pathogenic/toxic capacity of the Env protein itself. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Envelope protein; Human endogenous retroviruses; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1; Neuropathogenesis","membrane fusion protein; peptide; R peptide; unclassified drug; virus envelope protein; Alpharetrovirus; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; antiretroviral therapy; Betaretrovirus; cell membrane; Deltaretrovirus; endogenous retrovirus; Epsilonretrovirus; Gammaretrovirus; HIV associated dementia; HTLV-1 infection; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Human immunodeficiency virus infection encephalitis; Human T lymphotropic virus 1 associated myelopathy; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Lentiretrovirus; malignant neoplasm; multiple sclerosis; neurologic disease; neuropathology; nonhuman; priority journal; Retroviridae; retrovirus infection; Review; Simian foamy virus; spinal cord disease; tropical spastic paraparesis; virion; virus envelope",2-s2.0-85026213703

The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is a tree-killing bark beetle native to western North America but constrained by cold temperatures in the northern limits of its distribution. In recent years, this insect has spread north and east of its historical range, and continued expansion, or accidental introduction, could result in the mountain pine beetle becoming invasive in eastern North America. The limiting effect of cold temperatures among novel host pines is unknown, yet crucial for understanding the risk posed to northeastern North American forests. We report the susceptibility of mountain pine beetle to cold temperatures while overwintering in six different pine species. Brood developed in two western pine hosts (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm. and P. ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.) as well as four eastern pines (P. banksiana Lamb., P. resinosa Ait., P. strobus L. and P. sylvestris L.) novel to this insect. The cold tolerance and cold tolerance strategy of the most common overwintering stage varied by host and year. Models describing lower lethal temperatures more accurately predicted observed field mortality of overwintering larvae than models based on temperatures at which larvae froze. Rapid development to less cold tolerant pupal and adult stages by brood in novel hosts prior to winter may constitute a trade-off between increased host suitability and winter mortality. We demonstrate that overwintering survival of mountain pine beetles in novel hosts depends on a match between the climate and ecophysiological effects of pine species. These results have implications for risk assessment models and management planning for eastern forests as mountain pine beetle continues to expand its range. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bark beetle; Chill intolerant; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Range expansion; Supercooling point","Economic and social effects; Landforms; Risk assessment; Value engineering; Bark beetle; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Eastern north america; Life-history traits; Management planning; Mountain pine beetle; Range expansion; Risk assessment models; Forestry; beetle; biological invasion; cold tolerance; coniferous forest; ecophysiology; herbivore; host plant; invasive species; life history trait; limiting factor; mortality; overwintering; range expansion; supercooling; temperature tolerance; trade-off; vulnerability; North America; Coleoptera; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Hexapoda; Pinus contorta; Pinus mugo; Scolytinae",2-s2.0-85020196826

Though relatively narrow (∼2–3 m) and constructed with light-weight equipment, these lines cause forest fragmentation, and with their high density and potential edge influence extending into adjacent forest, their impact may be considerably underestimated. We assessed the effects of 3- to 4-year-old LIS lines in upland coniferous sub-boreal forests in northwestern Alberta (Canada) by investigating the distance of influence from the LIS line centre, through the edge and into the adjacent forest on vascular and non-vascular plant species diversity and cover and on several environmental factors. We also assessed whether cardinal orientation of the edge affects influence on plants and environmental factors. Edge orientation had no effect on extent of edge influence on plants or environmental variables, but distance from seismic line edge did. Species diversity of herbaceous plants was lowest from the seismic line edge up to 15 m into the adjacent forest, when compared to mid- (25 m) and far-interior (75 m) forest. In contrast, cover was lower 5 m from the seismic line edge in comparison to far-interior forest, but conditions on the seismic lines did not differ from the seismic line edge or any sampled distance up to 75 m from the edge. Non-vascular species had lower diversity and cover on the seismic lines and along the edges in comparison to any distance away from the edge. There was no effect of distance from the seismic line edge on live woody plants, but deadwood was more frequently encountered near the seismic line edges in comparison to interior forest. Soil temperature was higher on the seismic lines and along the line edges whereas soil moisture on the seismic lines was about twice as high as at the edges and adjacent forest. Seismic lines and edges also received more light than the forest near the edge, but not more than the far-interior forest. With edge influence detectable up to 15 m from edge 3 to 4 years post-construction, long-term and regular monitoring of LIS lines is recommended, as active management and remedial reclamation actions might be required to bring the recovery of these disturbances on the right trajectory. © 2017","Best management practices; Forest fragmentation; Industrial footprint; Linear disturbances; Oil and gas development","Biodiversity; Geological surveys; Plants (botany); Reclamation; Seismology; Soil moisture; Best management practices; Forest fragmentations; Industrial footprint; Linear disturbance; Oil and gas; Forestry; best management practice; boreal forest; coniferous forest; disturbance; edge effect; environmental factor; environmental impact; forest cover; fragmentation; gas production; oil production; seismic data; soil temperature; upland region; vegetation type; Alberta; Canada; Tracheophyta",2-s2.0-85020902021

Accurate mapping of ash species is required to monitor the host resource, predict EAB spread and better understand the short- and long-term effects of EAB on the ash resource. Hyperspectral remote sensing technologies have been used to successfully map forest species, although most efforts are focused on healthy canopies for relatively homogeneous forested stands. This study uses imagery collected by the NASA Goddard LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Thermal (GLiHT) airborne imager to map ash species at the tree level in an EAB infested urban setting. The overall goal of the study is to understand how canopy condition impacts species mapping accuracy and identify data collection and image processing techniques to more accurately map the location of ash species in infested regions. Results indicate that while overall independent validation mapping accuracy of ash and non-ash trees was 81%, correct identification of ash canopies dropped from 62% for vigor 1 trees to 22% for vigor 2 trees. To minimize these errors, we developed a multiple endmember, spectral unmixing technique to overcome challenges presented by a spectrally complicated target in a complex urban environment. This hinges on the use of endmember spectra from trees across a range of canopy condition, including the derivation of vegetation indices to inform the spectral unmixing calibration. This approach was more accurate than calibrations performed using traditional unmixing based only on pure endmember spectra. Implications for this work suggest that urban forest managers may attain more accurate maps by conducting remote sensing data collections prior to infestation while the trees are still healthy. Where this is not possible, mapping efforts must reflect a range of canopy conditions and include vegetation indices concurrent with reflectance data. The resulting ash species maps provide urban forest managers spatially explicit products to help estimate the extent of possible impacts in their communities, guide the implementation of management and monitoring efforts and provide the basis for planning as EAB continues to spread. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Emerald ash borer; Forest decline; Forest health; Forest species classification; GLiHT; Hyperspectral; OBIA; Spectral unmixing","Calibration; Data acquisition; Image processing; Managers; Mapping; NASA; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Urban planning; Vegetation; Emerald ash borer; Forest decline; Forest health; Forest species; GLiHT; HyperSpectral; OBIA; Spectral unmixing; Forestry; accuracy assessment; angiosperm; beetle; ecosystem health; image processing; lidar; mapping method; pest control; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; urban area; urban ecosystem; vegetation classification; vegetation index; United States; Agrilus planipennis; Fraxinus",2-s2.0-85026773808

Short-term alterations of the epigenome are primarily changes in the post-translational modification status of nucleosome-forming histone proteins, the consequences of which are i) a local increase or decrease in chromatin accessibility and ii) the activation or repression of gene transcription. Vitamin D has via VDR a direct effect on the expression of several hundred primary target genes implying numerous effects on the epigenome. Next-generation sequencing methods, such as ChIP-seq and FAIRE-seq, were applied to cellular model systems of vitamin D signaling, such as THP-1 human monocytes, and provided data for a chromatin model of vitamin D signaling. Key points of this model are that i) in the absence of ligand VDR binds to a limited number of loci within accessible chromatin, ii) a stimulation with ligand increases the number of DNA-bound VDR molecules, iii) VDR's access to genomic DNA is supported by pioneer factors, such as PU.1 in monocytes, iv) VDR binding leads to local opening of chromatin and v) the binding strength of topologically associating domain anchor forming CCCTC-binding factor sites upstream and downstream of prominent VDR binding sites is changing in response to ligand stimulation. This model provides the present basis of the molecular endocrinology of vitamin D and will be in future refined by the integration of vitamin D-sensitive chromatin markers and other genome-wide data, such as the 1,25(OH)2D3-sensitive binding of co-factors, chromatin modifying enzymes and chromatin remodeling proteins. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","ChIP-seq; Chromatin; Chromatin modifying enzymes; CTCF; Epigenome; FAIRE-seq; PU.1; Vitamin D","calcitriol; genomic DNA; histone; transcription factor CTCF; vitamin D; vitamin D receptor; binding affinity; binding site; cellular model; chromatin; chromatin accessibility; chromatin assembly and disassembly; DNA binding; endocrinology; epigenome; gene expression; gene interaction; genome; human; molecular endocrinology; molecular model; monocyte; next generation sequencing; priority journal; protein function; protein processing; receptor binding; Review; signal transduction; transcription regulation",2-s2.0-85015403172

A species richness survey was conducted along altitude in Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, Eastern China. Topographic variables, such as altitude, slope, aspect, terrain roughness, relief degree and the topographical wetness index, were extracted from the digital elevation model. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM), the linear model and the quadratic model were used to fit response curves of species richness to topographic variables. The results indicated that altitude and the topographical wetness index have a significant relation to species richness. Species richness has a unimodal response to altitude and a linear response to the topographical wetness index. However, no significant correlations were observed between slope, aspect and species richness. The predicted species richness by GAM is significantly correlated with the observed species richness, whereas the prediction error tends to increase with the increment of species richness.

Here, I address the relationship between 2 regulating forces, parasitism and epibiosis, in a Danish population of periwinkles serving as host to trematode parasites (Himasthla elongata and Renicola roscovita) as well as substrate for encrusting fucoids (Ralfsia sp.). Results show a strong positive relationship between shell size (i.e. snail age) and epibiont coverage, but also a significant positive link between parasitism and epibiosis after statistical correction for shell size. Because epibiosis of periwinkles is controlled solely by mutual shell grazing, the relationship between parasitism and epigrowth likely stems from reduced grazing of infected snails' shells by conspecifics that are known to avoid parasitized individuals. Trematode parasitism may thus indirectly facilitate the community of epibionts and in turn reinforce fouling as a regulator of periwinkle populations. © 2017 The Authors.","Epiphyte; Facilitation; Fouling; Littorina littorea; Trematode infection","biofouling; coastal zone; epibiont; epibiosis; facilitation; gastropod; host-parasite interaction; keystone species; parasitism; population dynamics; shell; snail; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Denmark; Gastropoda; Himasthla elongata; Littorina littorea; Ralfsia; Renicola roscovita; Trematoda; Vinca minor",2-s2.0-85029493502

Mean density of C. dilatata was homogeneous during most of the study period (ca. 50–200 ind/100 g) and reached their maximum in May (ca. 650 ind/100 g), while C. equilibra did not show any differences during the sampling period (ca. 30 ind/100 g). Juveniles of C. dilatata reached their highest densities in May, while ovigerous females were at their maximum values in late spring, summer and early autumn, and no correlation was found between seawater temperature and monthly density. On the other hand, C. equilibra reached its maximum juvenile and ovigerous female densities in summer, and showed a positive correlation with seawater temperature. Sex-ratio was female biased in C. dilatata, but in C. equilibra it was equal between sexes. The number of eggs carried by females was positively correlated to the size in both species. The present study suggests that the population dynamics of C. equilibra are intimately related to seawater temperature, while for C. dilatata no relationship was found.

Lionfish are not active during the day and stay in their refuges, sharing these spaces with various other fishes. The aim of this study is to determine which fishes are associated with the lionfish in their shelters, and what characteristics of both the invasive and native species may influence and explain such coexistence between a predator and its potential prey. Through diving and snorkelling, we visited 141 lionfish refuges, mostly caves, where we observed 204 lionfish and 494 other fish from 16 native species. We recorded species and abundance, as well as lionfish size and abundance. Half of the lionfish were observed in groups and the majority were large-sized. The association with most fish species seems fortuitous, but three species, Gramma loreto, Chromis cyanea and Canthigaster rostrata, were frequently observed in association with lionfish. Numerous fish juveniles, most likely Scarus coeruleus, were also observed together with the invasive predator. The more commonly associated fishes, particularly G. loreto, are mostly associated with large-sized lionfish that were found in groups. The associated fishes are also generally found in groups. Gramma loreto is a potential cleaner of the lionfish; the reasons for the association between these fish species and the invasive lionfish may be more complex than a simple predator-prey relationship and are discussed based on their biological traits and previously reported lionfish trophic ecology and predation behaviour. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Behaviour; Gramma loreto; invasive species; predation; Pterois volitans","behavioral response; cleaner fish; coexistence; coral reef; diurnal activity; ecological impact; fish; invasive species; native species; predation; predator-prey interaction; refuge; trophic environment; Caribbean Islands; Canthigaster rostrata; Chromis cyanea; Gramma loreto; Pisces; Pterois; Pterois volitans; Scarus coeruleus",2-s2.0-85021250446

In this study, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) construct was designed to target the AC1 gene of Cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus-Burewala (CLCuKoV-Bu) and the βC1 gene and satellite conserved region of the Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB). The AC1 gene and CLCuMB coding and non-coding regions function in replication initiation and suppression of the plant host defense pathway, respectively. The construct, Vβ, was transformed into cotton plants using the Agrobacterium-mediated embryo shoot apex cut method. Results from fluorescence in situ hybridization and karyotyping assays indicated that six of the 11 T1 plants harbored a single copy of the Vβ transgene. Transgenic cotton plants and non-transgenic (susceptible) test plants included as the positive control were challenge-inoculated using the viruliferous whitefly vector to transmit the CLCuKoV-Bu/CLCuMB complex. Among the test plants, plant Vβ-6 was asymptomatic, had the lowest amount of detectable virus, and harbored a single copy of the transgene on chromosome six. Absence of characteristic leaf curl symptom development in transgenic Vβ-6 cotton plants, and significantly reduced begomoviral-betasatellite accumulation based on real-time polymerase chain reaction, indicated the successful knockdown of CLCuKoV-Bu and CLCuMB expression, resulting in leaf curl resistant plants. © 2017 by the authors.

Among the wheat proteins, glutenin proteins, especially, high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are major determinants of processing quality. Wheat and its primary gene pool have limited variation in terms of HMW-GS alleles. Wild relatives of wheat are an important source of genetic variation. For improvement of wheat processing quality its wild relative Thinopyrum elongatum with significant potential was utilized. An attempt was made to replace Th. elongatum chromosome long arm(1EL) carrying HMW-GS genes related to high dough strengthwith chromosome 1AL of wheat with least or negative effect on dough strength while retaining the chromosomes 1DL and 1BL with a positive effect on bread making quality. To create chromosome specific translocation line [1EL(1AS)], double monosomic of chromosomes 1E and 1A were created and further crossed with different cultivars and homoeologous pairing suppressor mutant line PhI. The primary selection was based upon glutenin and gliadin protein profiles, followed by sequential genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). These steps significantly reduced time, efforts, and economic cost in the generation of translocation line. In order to assess the effect of translocation on wheat quality, background recovery was carried out by backcrossing with recurrent parent for several generations and then selfing while selecting in each generation. Good recovery of parent background indicated the development of almost near isogenic line (NIL). Morphologically also translocation line was similar to recipient cultivar N61 that was further confirmed by seed storage protein profiles, RP-HPLC and scanning electron microscopy. The processing quality characteristics of translocation line (BC4F6) indicated significant improvement in the gluten performance index (GPI), dough mixing properties, dough strength, and extensibility. Our work aims to address the challenge of limited genetic diversity especially at chromosome 1A HMW-GS locus.

In this study, we explored long-term (1975 to 2014) changes in predator-prey interactions following concurrent changes in predatory epibenthic fish and crustaceans as well as their prey, macrozoobenthic bivalves and polychaetes, in the western Wadden Sea. Historical and recent invasions have resulted in an increase in relatively large and long-lived bivalves (Mya arenaria, Ensis directus, Crassostrea gigas) which have found a size refuge from epibenthic predators in the Wadden Sea. While bivalves dominated the macrozoobenthic biomass, polychaetes were the main food source of epibenthic predators, with the invasive polychaete Marenzelleria viridis probably becoming an important food source during the early 2000s. Food requirements of epibenthic crustaceans, mainly Crangon crangon, almost doubled from 5 to 10 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m-2 yr-1, and requirements of epibenthic fish decreased by more than 80%, mainly due to the local disappearance of Pleuronectes platessa. While the overall food requirements of the epibenthic predators stayed more or less constant, the edible fraction of the macrozoobenthic biomass increased from 5 to 20 g AFDM m-2 until the 2000s and decreased to 10 g AFDM m-2 thereafter. This was the result of changes in native (Nereis diversicolor and Heteromastus filiformis) and invasive (M. viridis) polychaetes. These findings illustrate that coinciding species-specific changes and interactions of both predators and prey should be taken into account to determine the impact of invasions on the food web structure and functioning of coastal systems. © 2017 The Authors.","Crustaceans; Epibenthos; Fish; Intertidal; Long-term dynamics; Predation; Wadden sea","benthos; biomass; bivalve; coastal zone; crustacean; fish; food supply; food web; intertidal environment; polychaete; predation; predator; predator-prey interaction; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Wadden Sea; Bivalvia; Crangon crangon; Crassostrea gigas; Crustacea; Ensis directus; Heteromastus filiformis; Marenzelleria viridis; Mya arenaria; Neanthes diversicolor; Pleuronectes platessa; Polychaeta",2-s2.0-85029468138

Tree water-use measurements have therefore become an important component of recent hydrological studies. It is difficult for South African government initiatives, such as the Working for Water (WfW) alien clearing program, to justify alien tree removal and implement rehabilitation unless hydrological benefits are known. Consequently, water use within a riparian forest along the Buffeljags River in the Western Cape of South Africa was monitored over a 3-year period. The site consisted of an indigenous stand of Western Cape afrotemperate forest adjacent to a large stand of introduced <i>Acacia mearnsii</i>. The heat ratio method of the heat pulse velocity sap flow technique was used to measure the sap flow of a selection of indigenous species in the indigenous stand, a selection of <i>A. mearnsii</i> trees in the alien stand and two clusters of indigenous species within the alien stand. The indigenous trees in the alien stand at Buffeljags River showed significant intraspecific differences in the daily sap flow rates varying from 15 to 32ĝ€Lĝ€dayĝ'1 in summer (sap flow being directly proportional to tree size). In winter (June), this was reduced to only 7ĝ€Lĝ€dayĝ'1 when limited energy was available to drive the transpiration process. The water use in the <i>A. mearnsii</i> trees showed peaks in transpiration during the months of March 2012, September 2012 and February 2013. These periods had high average temperatures, rainfall and high daily vapor pressure deficits (VPDs-average of 1.26ĝ€kPa). The average daily sap flow ranged from 25 to 35ĝ€L in summer and approximately 10ĝ€L in the winter. The combined accumulated daily sap flow per year for the three <i>Vepris lanceolata</i> and three <i>A. mearnsii</i> trees was 5700 and 9200ĝ€L, respectively, clearly demonstrating the higher water use of the introduced <i>Acacia</i> trees during the winter months. After spatially upscaling the findings, it was concluded that, annually, the alien stand used nearly 6 times more water per unit area than the indigenous stand (585ĝ€mmĝ€aĝ'1 compared to 101ĝ€mmĝ€aĝ'1). This finding indicates that there would be a gain in groundwater recharge and/or streamflow if the alien species are removed from riparian forests and rehabilitated back to their natural state.",,"Forestry; Groundwater; Transpiration; Ground water recharge; Heat ratio methods; Intra-specific differences; Mediterranean climates; Riparian forests; South African government; Vapor pressure deficit; Western Cape , South Africa; Water resources; evergreen tree; groundwater; intraspecific variation; introduced species; legume; rainfall; recharge; riparian forest; sap flow; seasonal variation; stand structure; streamflow; temperate forest; water resource; Buffels River; Northern Cape; South Africa; Western Cape; Acacia; Acacia mearnsii; Lanceolata",2-s2.0-85029547121

Respondents identified a wide diversity of ecosystem services provided by gardens, with social ones being more recognized than ecological, and economic services the least. Approximately two-thirds of respondents visited a sacred site garden weekly or more often. The majority of respondents (96%) felt that a garden was necessary because it added to their feelings of connection with God, or helped them relax and so be better able to concentrate, and 54% stated that a garden enhanced their overall spiritual experience. Regression analysis revealed that aesthetic appreciation of a garden was significantly related to woody plant species richness, number and basal area in the garden. On the other hand, spiritual experience was positively related to woody plant basal area, but not species richness nor tree number. Neither size of the garden, nor number of years the respondents had been vising a particular sacred site had any influence on the rated spiritual or aesthetic experiences. These results reveal the widely appreciated ecosystem services provided by urban sacred spaces and their centrality in enhancing spiritual satisfaction for some. © 2017 by the authors.","Church gardens; Cultural services; Plant abundance; Species richness; Spiritual services","abundance estimation; cultural relations; ecosystem service; esthetics; garden; greenspace; questionnaire survey; species richness; sustainability; urban area; urban ecosystem; woody plant; South Africa",2-s2.0-85029536951

Control of this weed is difficult, and it spreads easily and causes damage to native habitats and agriculture. In this study, our goal was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the ability of A. philoxeroides to invade new habitats, to adapt to environmental stresses, and to cause damage. We developed a simple and highly effective potato virus X-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach. The VIGS approach was first used to silence the phytoene desaturase gene, which resulted in the expected photo-bleaching phenotype. Next, the VIGS approach was used to silence two additional genes, drought-induced protein gene 15 (ApDRI15) and salinity-induced protein gene 1 (ApSI1). When ApDRI15 was knocked down, the plants were more sensitive to drought stress than the control plants, with smaller leaves, shorter internodes, and lower biomass. The ApDRI15-silenced plants had lower relative water content, lower free proline levels, and higher water loss rates than the control. Silencing of ApSI1 significantly decreased tolerance to salinity, and the ApSI1-silenced plants were withered and smaller. These results indicate that the pgR107 VIGS approach is a simple and highly effective tool for dissecting gene function in A. philoxeroides. Further experiments with the VIGS approach will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the adaptability and plasticity of A. philoxeroides and improve our ability to combat the damage caused by this weed. © 2017 Bai, Wang, Fan, Fu, Wang, Zhang, Song, Zhang and Wu.","Alternanthera philoxeroides; Drought stress; pgR107 VIGS vector; Salinity stress; Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS)",,2-s2.0-85030859041

In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel visual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the global ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of interest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level.

To analyse these changes, we build upon Tilly’s theory of durable inequalities by adding the concepts of redress and retrenchment, reflecting the dynamics of change among countervailing powers in a policy field. We employ this theoretical framework to investigate the ways the ACA has selectively reduced barriers for certain categories of immigrants, but not others. Some of these strategies date back to the ways the white power elite in Confederate states set out to regain control as Congress acted after 1865 to grant freed slaves full citizen’s rights. These barriers became blueprints for political strategies to block or subvert federal reforms. Additionally, we describe the ACA effort to reduce the legacy of de facto barriers for immigrants. We also detail how the federalist nature of the Act continued to allow wide-ranging forms of retrenchment and redress at state and local levels. Through this theoretical and historical analysis, we show how the ACA sought to redress certain historical inequalities of immigrant health care access but also solidified others, particularly in the case of undocumented immigrants. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","health care; Immigration; inequality; medical sociology; political sociology; racism","accessibility; health care; health policy; historical perspective; immigrant population; immigration; policy analysis; policy reform; racism; theoretical study; United States",2-s2.0-85020740180

We use the native red squirrel and invasive grey squirrel system on the Island of Anglesey, UK, as a case study system in which to parameterise a mathematical model that includes the control of grey squirrels. We develop a stochastic, spatial model that represents the real habitat structure, distribution and linkage on Anglesey and the neighbouring mainland and includes the key population and epidemiological dynamics of the red-grey-squirrelpox system. The model also includes a representation of the trapping and removal of grey squirrels which is parameterised from field data on Anglesey in which grey squirrel were removed and red squirrels reintroduced between 1998–2013. The model is used to assess different management procedures to protect red squirrels from island re-invasion by grey squirrels, including the threat of squirrelpox spread posed by endemic mainland grey populations. The findings have important implications for the conservation of threatened red squirrels throughout the UK and in Europe. Moreover, the modelling framework is based on well-understood, classical models of competitive and epidemiological interactions and therefore the techniques can be adapted and applied more generally to manage the threat of invasive species in a wide range of natural systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Grey squirrel control; Invasive species management; Mathematical modelling; Red squirrel conservation","Mathematical models; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Classical model; Habitat structures; Invasive species; Invasive species management; Management procedures; Modelling framework; Spatial modeling; Species management; Conservation; correlation; habitat structure; invasive species; native species; numerical model; parameterization; rodent; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; species conservation; trapping; Isle of Anglesey; United Kingdom; Wales; Sciuridae; Tamiasciurus",2-s2.0-85020900112

Therefore, we reviewed literature regarding potential contributions of sediment-reducing BMPs to conservation of riparian and aquatic wildlife, while realizing that BMPs also minimize thermal, nutrient, and chemical pollution. We reached five important conclusions: (1) a significant body of research confirms that forestry BMPs contribute to the protection of water quality and riparian forest structure; (2) data-specific relationships between forestry BMPs and reviewed species are limited; (3) forestry BMPs for forest road construction and maintenance, skid trails, stream crossings, and streamside management zones (SMZs) are important particularly for protection of water quality and aquatic species; (4) stream crossings should be carefully selected and installed to minimize sediment inputs and stream channel alterations; and (5) SMZs promote retention of older-age riparian habitat with benefits extending from water bodies to surrounding uplands.

Mapping QTLs to narrow chromosomal regions provides an effective means of characterizing the genetic basis of these complex traits. Orychophragmus violaceus is a crucifer with long siliques, many SS, and heavy seeds. A novel B. napus introgression line with many SS was previously selected from multiple crosses (B. rapa ssp. chinesis × O. violaceus) × B. napus. In present study, a doubled haploid (DH) population with 167 lines was established from a cross between the introgression line and a line with far fewer SS, in order to detect QTLs for silique-related traits. By screening with a Brassica 60K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, a high-density linkage map consisting of 1,153 bins and spanning a cumulative length of 2,209.1 cM was constructed, using 12,602 high-quality polymorphic SNPs in the DH population. The average recombination bin densities of the A and C subgenomes were 1.7 and 2.4 cM, respectively. 45 QTLs were identified for the three traits in all, which explained 4.0–34.4% of the total phenotypic variation; 20 of them were integrated into three unique QTLs by meta-analysis. These unique QTLs revealed a significant positive correlation between SS and SL and a significant negative correlation between SW and SS, and were mapped onto the linkage groups A05, C08, and C09. A trait-by-trait meta-analysis revealed eight, four, and seven consensus QTLs for SS, SW, and SL, respectively, and five major QTLs (cqSS.A09b, cqSS.C09, cqSW.A05, cqSW.C09, and cqSL.C09) were identified. Five, three, and four QTLs for SS, SW, and SL, respectively, might be novel QTLs because of the existence of alien genetic loci for these traits in the alien introgression.

The aim of this study was to analyze how disturbance-induced changes in plant species abundance patterns account for variations in annual CO2 sequestration flow (CS) of Mediterranean sand dune areas. Two sites characterized by a high (site HAD) and a lower (site LAD) anthropogenic disturbance level were selected. At both sites, plant species number, cover, height and CS based on net photosynthesis measurements were sampled. At the plant species level, our results highlighted that Ammophila arenaria and Pancratium maritimum, had a key role in CS. Moreover, the results revealed a patchy species assemblage in both sites. In particular, HAD was characterized by a higher extension of the anthropogenic aphytoic zone (64% of the total transect length) than LAD. In spite of the observed differences in plant species composition, there were not significant differences between HAD and LAD in structural and functional traits, such as plant height and net photosynthesis. As a consequence, HAD and LAD had a similar CS (443 and 421 Mg CO2 ha−1 y−1, respectively). From a monetary point of view, our estimates based on the social costs of carbon revealed that the flow of sequestered CO2 valued on an average $ 3181 ± 114 ha−1 year−1 (mean value for the two sites). However, considering also the value of the CO2 negative flow related to loss of vegetated area, the annual net benefit arising from CO2 sequestration amounted to $ 1641 and $ 1772 for HAD and LAD, respectively.

The recent proposal for Canis dingo as the most appropriate name is not sustainable under zoological nomenclature protocols nor based on the genetic and morphological evidence. Instead we proffer the name C. familiaris for all free-ranging dogs, re-gardless of breed and location throughout the world, including the Australian Dingo. The suggested nomenclature also provides a framework for managing free-ranging dogs including Dingoes, under Australian legislation and policy. The broad principles of nomenclature we discuss here apply to all free-roaming dogs that coexist with their hybrids, including the New Guinea Singing Dog.

Long-term monitoring programmes are mandatory to monitor the status of amphibian populations in changing landscapes and climatic conditions. In this study, we showed the population dynamic of the Italian crested newts Triturus carnifex living in four artificial ponds in Central Italy over a 20-year period. Adult newts were recognised through a capture-mark-recapture protocol, involving the analysis of belly patterns. The first best population model showed a constant newt survival among years and a complete recapture rate; the second supported model showed a sex-dependent survival, with slightly higher values for males with respect to females, and corroborated a complete recapture rate. A high philopatry occurred: we observed less than 10% of individuals dispersing from a birth site to other ponds. In 20 years of continuous monitoring, the population of Italian crested newt increased. The removal of goldfish Carassius auratus from one of the ponds in 2010 allowed adult newts to overwinter within the pond and to have two reproductive periods, with overwintering larvae after the second spawning. © 2016 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.","alien species impacts; amphibian decline; belly pattern; capture-mark-recapture; Carassius auratus; long term monitoring","amphibian; biomonitoring; climate change; climate conditions; conservation status; cyprinid; introduced species; landscape change; management practice; mark-recapture method; overwintering; population decline; population structure; spawning ground; survival; Italy; Amphibia; Carassius auratus; Salamandridae; Triturus carnifex",2-s2.0-84994579845

This lens is able to disclose the gender rhetoric through which the Western feminist eye has framed the ‘Other Woman’, depicting her as bounded by cultural ties. This is well exemplified by the stereotype of the Muslim woman as veiled, victim and powerless. The deconstructive strategy and the intersectional approach will fruitfully interact with the vivid experience of some Italian and British Muslim women activists, to show that the agency of Muslim women emerges in different contexts, thus breaking the Western mainstream essentialist perspective. The concept of fluid identity is proposed to make sense of the processes of identity formation with a focus on the intertwining of religious, gender and political dimensions vis-à-vis controversial practices such as the veil and arranged marriages.

Combined, these portrayals may garner specialized services and contribute to success in the legal realm.

In this context, the systematic promotion of Russian ethno-nationalism for the purpose of achieving the regime’s general stability began not at the time of Crimea’s annexation, as it is often assumed, but at the time of Putin’s re-election amidst public protests in 2012. The goal of representing the authorities as attentive to public grievances in a society where opinion polls register high levels of xenophobia has prompted state-controlled broadcasters to use ethnoracial definitions of the nation that they had previously avoided.

Large-scale government-funded management initiatives are underway to reduce the extent of invasions in this region. Among the many challenges are the huge spatial extent of the invasions and difficulties in coordinating management efforts across large areas of invaded land in private ownership. Very little information is available on the success of privately-funded alien plant control initiatives. This study investigated the effectiveness of one large project in reducing alien plant cover, the challenges faced and the costs associated with long-term clearing operations on privately-owned land in the CFR. Results for the study area (Vergelegen) show that the cover of dense invasive plant stands declined by 70% over 10 years since management operations began, but that operations cost 3.6 times more than was originally estimated (ZAR 43.6 vs 12.19 million, respectively). The challenges associated with managing invasive alien plants (IAPs) on private land are very similar to those faced on state-owned land, with the efficiency of management being constrained by multiple interacting environmental and socio-economic factors. However some success in managing IAPs can be achieved by adhering to basic principles, including careful planning with clear achievable goals in mind, a commitment to stable long-term funding and regular monitoring. Most private land owners cannot afford the substantial investment of resources that would be required to clear large stands of IAPs and to ensure that cleared areas are maintained to prevent re-invasion, and finding ways to fund this remains a challenge. © 2017 Royal Society of South Africa.","biological invasions; fynbos; invasive species; management; tree invasions",,2-s2.0-85014774636

Examining remedies requires considering the roles and responsibilities of home and host states, as well as the companies involved. A child rights lens is applied to the analysis of international guidelines and company policies, noting the quasi-absence of children in these documents. However, the discussion recognises some positive developments and the strengths of certain remedy mechanisms.

The structuration of the network was achieved at this scale through multi-level coordination groups: local, departmental regional and basin levels. Each group relaying bottom-up and top-down the information and the needs for tools, the coherence of the action is multiplied on most parts of the basin. The members of the group are experts, management project leaders, territorial structures as well as institutions and non-profit organizations. It relies on a network of practitioners. Based on the learnings of more than 10 years, the Loire basin invasive alien species management strategy 2014–2020 is articulated with the strategies at European, national and regional levels. It aims to coordinate relevant actions at the scale of a large river basin and to exchange on the management of freshwater invasive plants and animals methods. This document identifies guidelines for emerging invasive alien species management projects. The 24 priority actions for this period (2014–2020) are grouped in 5 main subjects: Coordination, Knowledge and Exchanges, Monitoring and Early intervention, Management and Awareness, Communication and Training. Each action is detailed with aim, context, partners, evaluation and expected products. The deployment of the strategy will take place in the frame of the Loire nature program 2014–2020. It will promote the monitoring, the rapid response to new populations (e.g. new species or on colonization fronts). An accent is also given on awareness raising and information exchange in this European funded program. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 REABIC.","Invasive alien species management; Loire water catchment; Mutualisation; Shared tools",,2-s2.0-85027686186

Molecular phylogenetic analysis using two sets of nuclear and mitochondrial markers showed that the species was well grouped with the genus Ricania while it was clearly distinct from the genus Pochazia. We conducted haplotype analysis using a total of 215 samples collected from six provinces and found that the Korean populations were composed of eight haplotypes. The haplotype and nucleotide diversity of the samples were 0.544 and 0.005, respectively. The ‘Hap_1’ haplotype occurred at the highest frequency at approximately 65.6%. The genetic distance among the populations ranged from − 0.049 to 0.93 and there was no apparent relationship with geographic distance (r2 = 0.083). The neutrality test detected no rapid population expansion, and a mismatch distribution analysis also supports this finding with a clear multimodal pattern. Instead, severe haplotype decline was detected in almost all of the local populations, which were composed of only 1–3 haplotypes, suggesting the existence of a founder effect. In our UPGMA phylogenetic tree construction, the 12 Korean populations were mainly grouped into four groups that had a significant FSC value (0.446, P &lt; 0.001) from AMOVA analysis. In summary, genetic difference was not associated with geographical distance and demographic equilibrium was found with severe haplotype decline. Further analysis is needed to trace its origin and dispersal route to establish a management system for invasive alien pests in Korea. © 2017","Genetic relationship; Invasive alien species; Population genetic analysis; Ricania shantungensis",,2-s2.0-85021282356

Dormant seeds typically require specific stimuli as cues for germination, resulting in mass recruitment. Sound understanding of germination stimuli may provide options to aid the management of invasives. We investigated the response of two invasive trees, Acacia mearnsii and A. melanoxylon, and an indigenous ecological analogue, Virgilia divaricata, to different germination stimuli (chipped (manually), hot water exposure, dry heat pulse, smoke, and no treatment) at two temperature regimes (winter ~ 12 °C and summer ~ 20 °C) to explore how their germination requirements may be used to favour V. divaricata in areas cleared of the invasives. Chipped and hot water exposure resulted in the highest germination in all three species. Virgilia divaricata responded marginally better than the invasives to the dry heat pulse, particularly at 20 °C. However, the three species mostly responded comparably to the stimulus–temperature combinations, suggesting that manipulation of stimuli is not a feasible option for management of the invasives at a large scale. In the absence of any stimulus (~ akin to conditions associated with aboveground clearing of alien vegetation cover), germination was poorer in V. divaricata than in the invasive species especially at 20 °C, providing motivation for focusing Acacia management operations in cooler seasons in areas where V. divaricata seed banks occur. Another option is to sow V. divaricata seeds that have been chipped or exposed to hot water in areas cleared of the invasives of which the seeds would not have received stimuli. © 2017 SAAB","Acacia mearnsii; Acacia melanoxylon; Germination requirements; Habitat management; Invasive alien plants; South Africa; Virgilia divaricata","agricultural management; dicotyledon; germination; habitat management; invasive species; native species; seed bank; seed dormancy; sustainability; vegetation cover; South Africa; Acacia; Acacia mearnsii; Acacia melanoxylon; Virgilia divaricata",2-s2.0-85019366677

It is far less invasive than two congeneric species from the same area, I. glandulifera and I. parviflora. The factors responsible for its limited success are poorly known, though they may be related to low frost tolerance and low popularity as an ornamental plant. Maladaptive habitat preferences, a factor not studied to date, may also play an important role. The aim of this study was to determine those responsible factors and to examine the consequences of habitat selection by I. balfourii on the Swiss-Italian border, where the species is assumed to be invasive. After exhaustive mapping of its distribution and measurement of the plants' performance parameters, we checked for signs of disease and pest attack on individual plants growing in different habitats, and analysed the local abiotic characteristics. The distribution pattern differed significantly between the two studied countries. There were four times as many Italian localities of I. balfourii and they were clearly concentrated along roadsides, whereas the few Swiss localities were scattered among other habitats. The level of leaf damage along roadsides was lower, suggesting higher release from natural enemies there, which, however, did not translate into investment in plant size or fecundity. Patch area along roadsides correlated positively with the presence of buildings and shading; the plant's ability to spread decreased with elevation. These results confirm that invasion by this shade-tolerant species is driven by propagule pressure and that its dispersal ability is low; that may change with climate warming. Although roads provide suitable conditions and invasion corridors, and despite possibly higher propagule pressure on the Swiss side, in Switzerland the preference for this habitat is maladaptive for I. balfourii, due to intensive mowing, which seems to create an ecological trap. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Biological invasions; Garden escapes; Invasion corridors; Kashmir balsam; Potentially invasive alien species; Road maintenance","adaptation; alpine environment; biological invasion; fecundity; habitat corridor; habitat selection; herb; introduced species; invasive species; limiting factor; natural enemy; ornamental species; patch dynamics; propagule; roadside environment; shade tolerance; twentieth century; Himalayas; Italy; Switzerland; Impatiens balfourii",2-s2.0-85028855827

However, a standardized approach for systematically monitoring alien species and tracking biological invasions is still lacking. This Perspective presents a vision for global observation and monitoring of biological invasions. We show how the architecture for tracking biological invasions is provided by a minimum information set of Essential Variables, global collaboration on data sharing and infrastructure, and strategic contributions by countries. We show how this novel, synthetic approach to an observation system for alien species provides a tangible and attainable solution to delivering the information needed to slow the rate of new incursions and reduce the impacts of invaders. We identify three Essential Variables for Invasion Monitoring; alien species occurrence, species alien status and alien species impact. We outline how delivery of this minimum information set by joint, complementary contributions from countries and global community initiatives is possible. Country contributions are made feasible using a modular approach where all countries are able to participate and strategically build their contributions to a global information set over time. The vision we outline will deliver wide-ranging benefits to countries and international efforts to slow the rate of biological invasions and minimize their environmental impacts.

Location: Europe. Methods: We extracted data from 251,740 vegetation plots stored in the recently compiled European Vegetation Archive. After filtering (resulting in 83,396 plots; 39 regions; 1970–2015 time period), we analysed the species pool and frequency of alien vascular plants with respect to geographic origin and life-forms, and the levels of invasion across the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) woodland habitats. Results: We found a total of 386 alien plant species (comprising 7% of all recorded vascular plants). Aliens originating from outside of and from within Europe were almost equally represented in the species pool (192 vs. 181 species) but relative frequency was skewed towards the former group (77% vs. 22%) due, to some extent, to the frequent occurrence of Impatiens parviflora (21% frequency among alien plants). Phanerophytes were the most species-rich life-form (148 species) and had the highest representation in terms of relative frequency (39%) among aliens in the dataset. Apart from Europe (181 species), North America was the most important source of alien plants (109 species). At the local scale, temperate and boreal softwood riparian woodland (5%) and mire and mountain coniferous woodland (<1%) had the highest and lowest mean relative alien species richness (percentage of alien species per plot), respectively. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that European woodlands are prone to alien plant invasions especially when exposed to disturbance, fragmentation, alien propagule pressure and high soil nutrient levels. Given the persistence of these factors in the landscape, competitive alien plant species with a broad niche, including alien trees and shrubs, are likely to persist and spread further into European woodlands. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","EUNIS; exotic; forest; invasive plants; life-form; neophyte; non-native; origin; tree","Impatiens parviflora; Tracheophyta",2-s2.0-85026766774

So far, 1,579 alien terrestrial and marine species have been introduced to Galápagos by humans. Of these, 1,476 have become established. Almost half of these were intentional introductions, mostly of plants. Most unintentional introductions arrived on plants and plant associated material, followed by transport vehicles, and commodities (in particular fruit and vegetables). The number, frequency and geographic origin of pathways for the arrival and dispersal of alien species to and within Galápagos have increased over time, tracking closely the increase in human population (residents and tourists) on the islands. Intentional introductions of alien species should decline as biosecurity is strengthened but there is a danger that unintentional introductions will increase further as tourism on Galápagos expands.

Most management strategies that should prevent or reduce the impact of alien species include prevention and eradication programs that both rely on an early detection of introduced species. Early detection requires an up to date inventory of present species and efficient monitoring programs to identify newly arrived species. This study surveyed potential invasion ‘hot spots’ in the coastal waters of the central Wadden Sea, including commercial ports (‘port’ stations) as well as fairways, roads, groynes and oyster reefs (‘Wadden Sea’ stations) to establish lists of macrobenthic species as baseline for future monitoring. In the ports we also applied simultaneously the HELCOM/OSPAR protocol (H/O) and a regional established rapid assessment (RA) to enable the evaluation of the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of both methods. While the RA is mainly based on the visual screening of species in easy accessible habitats in the field, the H/O includes an extensive sampling by operation of scientific divers and boat times and a 4-times higher time effort for sample processing. We identified among all sites 273 species including 37 alien species. The fauna was composed of 210 native and 32 alien species, while the flora was composed of 26 native and 5 alien species. The ports were a diverse habitat with species numbers from 65 to 109. At the Wadden Sea stations, exclusively monitored by the less extensive RA, only half of the species numbers (36–66 species) were detected. However, on the oyster reefs the relative occurrence of alien species compared to natives was similar to the ports and one oyster reef (Nordland) even had the highest ratio (25%, 14 species) of alien species of all investigated sites. The H/O protocol identified 179 species compared to 114 species identified by the RA. Concerning to alien species, the H/O provided 85% of alien species, the RA only 67%. Especially with regard to the actual discussion on harmonized monitoring protocols within the Northeast Atlantic and Baltic regions, we recommend that future port surveys should apply the more extensive H/O protocol, since restrictions to the RA decrease drastically the chance of an early detection of alien species. We also recommend complementing the survey of ports with natural invasion ‘hot spots’ like the oyster reefs by rapid assessment. This combined monitoring design would increase significantly the early detection of alien species as demonstrated in our study. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioinvasion hot spots; HELCOM/OSPAR guidelines; Invasive species; Management strategies; Monitoring; Neobiota; Species inventory; Wadden Sea","Ecosystems; Hulls (ship); Molluscs; Monitoring; Screening; Shellfish; Surveys; HELCOM/OSPAR guidelines; Hot spot; Invasive species; Management strategies; Neobiota; Species inventory; Wadden Sea; Reefs; ballast water; coastal water; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; guideline; introduced species; invasive species; macrobenthos; species inventory; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Nordland; North Sea; Norway; Wadden Sea; Ostreidae",2-s2.0-85020298513

This study focuses on species’ habitat partitioning of edge habitats in the San Francisco Estuary, a highly altered novel ecosystem that supports mixed assemblages of native and alien fishes and macroinvertebrates. We used minnow traps to address two questions about the demersal assemblage along levees in large tidal sloughs: (1) What is the relative abundance of demersal fish and macroinvertebrate species in shallow water adjacent to levee edges? and (2) Do native and alien species occupy different habitat types? We used our findings to address the broader question: do native and non-native species show habitat segregation, suggesting development of assemblage structure similar to that of co-evolved assemblages? Results indicate that habitat partitioning occurs among some clusters of species, but not all. Native Prickly Sculpin was found most often near riprapped levee edges, while alien Yellowfin Goby occupied adjacent muddy habitat, and the alien Shimofuri Goby showed no preference. Where two non-native species of caridean shrimp co-occurred, Siberian Prawn occupied unvegetated mud, while Oriental Grass Shrimp used primarily riprap. However, when only Siberian Prawn was present, it showed no preference for habitat type. Habitat associations changed slightly in response to seasonal shifts in habitat and spawning requirements.

To develop D. erucoides-specific markers, 72 million single end reads were obtained using Ion-Torrent platform. Quality reads (67.6 million) were checked against Brassica database and the redundant reads were eliminated. De novo assembly of the remaining 14.6 million reads gave 3895 contigs (> 1 kb), which were used to design 101 donor-specific (DS) STS markers. Of these, 89 markers showed polymorphism between D. erucoides and B. juncea. Genotyping of 90 randomly picked plants with 31 donor-specific STS markers detected 22 plants containing 17 markers. Alien introgression was also detected in eight of the 22 lines displaying phenotypes deviating from B. juncea parent. The marker DSSTS 70 was found in six of the nine lines showing glossy leaf suggesting its association with the trait. This is the first study demonstrating the use of molecular markers for implementing reverse genetics approach for alien introgression into crop plants. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Advanced backcross population; Brassica; Donor-specific STS markers; Introgression; Next generation sequencing; Reverse genetics",,2-s2.0-85027711283

While effects of alien tree invasions on riparian plants are well studied, effects on animals are less well understood. Invasive alien trees can have a positive effect by adding habitat and food sources, or have a negative effect, by replacing native food plants. Here we use birds as indicators to determine the impacts of an invasive Eucalyptus tree species in riparian areas of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa. Birds are an ideal study group because they are mobile, respond quickly to habitat changes and feed at different trophic levels. Fixed-point bird counts were done during winter and spring at near-pristine and Eucalyptus camaldulensis invaded riparian habitats. A total of 1142 birds from 44 species were recorded. Bird assemblages in invaded sites are almost a complete subset (24 species) of those in near-pristine areas (42 species). Invaded areas were missing 18 species and contained a total of 128 fewer individuals. This is due to declines in insectivores, frugivores, granivores, raptors and omnivores and the absence of nectarivores in invaded sites. From a bird’s perspective, the prioritisation of E. camaldulensis removal from the CFR’s river systems is justified, but whether bird species will return to cleared areas needs to be determined. © 2017, The Ecological Society of Japan.","Bird feeding guilds; Cape Floristic Region; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Nectar feeding birds; Plant invasions; Raptor","abundance; bioindicator; Cape Floristic Region; evergreen tree; frugivory; guild; invasive species; mutualism; nectarivory; raptor; removal experiment; riparian vegetation; species richness; trophic level; South Africa; Animalia; Aves; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Raptores",2-s2.0-85022098683

Key to their strategies is prevention, including assessment of establishment risk for alien species. Despite establishment of some of the worst globally invasive species across the Antarctic region, assessments of establishment potential of these species are non-existent. Here, we address this deficit and determine whether these invasive species constitute a significant conservation threat to the broader Antarctic region both now and in response to future regional climate change. Location: Antarctica and the Southern Ocean islands (45°–90° S). Methods: We used ensemble species distribution models to assess the current and future climate suitability of the Antarctic region for 69 of the worst globally invasive species and 24 insect and plant species that have already established somewhere in the region. Results: The Antarctic continent is unsuitable for all of the worst globally invasive species under current conditions, but areas of the Antarctic Peninsula are predicted to become climatically suitable for up to six globally invasive species within the next century. By contrast, all Southern Ocean islands are presently climatically suitable for additional non-native species, with the threat increasing in the future. Main conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that climate, which is often cited as a key barrier to alien species establishment, may afford some protection to continental Antarctica, but that this protection is not currently extended to the Southern Ocean islands. Furthermore, existing climatic barriers to alien species establishment will weaken as warming continues across the region. This not only illustrates the value of applying distribution modelling methods to this largely ice-covered region, but demonstrates how these methods can be used to inform targeted surveillance of introduction pathways and sites that have the highest risk of establishment of invasive alien species. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alien species; biological invasions; environmental niche; invasive species risk-assessment; species distribution modelling; sub-Antarctic Islands","Antarctic Treaty; biodiversity; biological invasion; climate change; conservation status; ecological modeling; ice cover; insect; introduced species; invasive species; plant; regional climate; risk assessment; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Antarctica; Southern Ocean; West Antarctica; Hexapoda",2-s2.0-85028566416

There has been a lack of research on appropriate guidelines and estimation procedures for declaring eradication success for programs aimed at eradicating alien reptiles. Here we develop quantitative rules for confirmation monitoring in eradication campaigns of the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans). We used a database of slider trapping data from control and eradication campaigns conducted in localities across the Iberian Peninsula and southern France to construct models for inferring appropriate trapping efforts for confirming slider turtle eradication. Basking traps were slightly more efficient than net traps in capturing sliders, although trapping was an inefficient monitoring method given the low capture probabilities estimated. The results of our spatially-explicit eradication scenarios revealed the importance of habitat configuration in declaring eradication success. Declaration of eradication success is contingent on the thresholds set to minimise false positives (i.e., falsely declaring eradication successful), but in any scenario large trapping efforts were required to confirm eradication. Given the low estimated capture probabilities, alternative methods such as eDNA and visual surveys should be considered for monitoring sliders. We suggest that if the costs associated with the impact of alien sliders can be adequately estimated, then eradication can be confirmed by rules minimising both false positive and negative error rates. Otherwise., rules minimising false positive errors would be more appropriate. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Alien reptile; Capture probability; Environmental decision-making; False positive; Monitoring; Trachemys scripta elegans","biological invasion; biological survey; biomonitoring; capture method; database; decision making; ecological impact; environmental management; guideline; habitat restoration; introduced species; invasive species; population density; restoration ecology; turtle; France; Iberian Peninsula; Reptilia; Trachemys; Trachemys scripta; Trachemys scripta elegans",2-s2.0-85020532402

At the same time, it is well known that alien plant invasions in inland freshwaters can alter community structure, ecosystem functions and services with significant negative impacts on biodiversity and human activities. We assessed if the GBIF database has a geospatial homogeneous information for native and non-native aquatic plant species for South America and whether or not literature resources not yet digitalized (floras, checklists and other papers) could provide additional information. We selected a set of 40 native and 40 non-native aquatic species.

New records were manually compiled through classical literature research. All the georeferenced records (GBIF + literature) were used for the mapping and the comparative analysis. As a result, we can conclude that the two datasets provide quite significantly different information and the combination of the two offers new information that would not exist in a single data source.

Summary: Invasions of alien plants are typically studied as invasions of individual species, yet interactions between plants and symbiotic fungi (mutualists and potential pathogens) affect plant survival, physiological traits, and reproduction and hence invasion success. Studies show that plant–fungal associations are frequently key drivers of plant invasion success and impact, but clear conceptual frameworks and integration across studies are needed to move beyond a series of case studies towards a more predictive understanding. Here, we consider linked plant–fungal invasions from the perspective of plant and fungal origin, simplified to the least complex representations or ‘motifs’. By characterizing these interaction motifs, parallels in invasion processes between pathogen and mutualist fungi become clear, although the outcomes are often opposite in effect. These interaction motifs provide hypotheses for fungal-driven dynamics behind observed plant invasion trajectories. In some situations, the effects of plant–fungal interactions are inconsistent or negligible. Variability in when and where different interaction motifs matter may be driven by specificity in the plant–fungal interaction, the size of the effect of the symbiosis (negative to positive) on plants and the dependence (obligate to facultative) of the plant−fungal interaction. Linked plant–fungal invasions can transform communities and ecosystem function, with potential for persistent legacies preventing ecosystem restoration. © 2017 The Authors.

Due to the small size and isolation of islands, species have limited options for refuges and recolonization, making their rehabilitation a conservation priority. Robben Island is a continental island, isolated from the mainland ca. 15 000 years ago, and has been degraded by humans and alien species for nearly 400 years. Mainland areas with similar vegetation should be good reference sites for the biological restoration of the island due to historical connectedness. However, very little information exists as to which species were lost. Here we aim to identify the best mainland sites to use as reference sites for Robben Island based on remaining arthropod diversity on the island. Sites found to be most similar in terms of arthropod diversity to Robben Island were sites north of Robben Island (Elandsbaai and Dwarskersbos) rather than the geographically closest locations.

A large number of wheat-Dv aneuploid lines harboring whole or fragments of Dv chromosomes have been developed. However, the lack of sufficient molecular markers hindered accurate identification of Dv chromatin, especially when the introgressed fragments are small. Development of molecular markers covering the whole Dv genome and evenly distributed on different chromosome regions is not only useful for the detection of the introgressed alien chromatin in wheat background, but also provides evidence of the syntenic relationship between homoeologous chromosomes. In the present study, in order to develop high density and evenly distributed molecular markers on individual Dv chromosomes, genomic DNA of Dv leaves was sequenced and assembled. Sequence assemblies of all wheat chromosomes were first used to identify exon–exon junctions and localize introns in Dv. Intron length polymorphisms suitable for designing Dv primers flanking introns were evaluated, and a total of 1624 intron targeting (IT) markers was designed. By using the Chinese Spring, the Triticum durum-Dv amphiploid and the Dv sequenced DNA libraries, 841 IT molecular markers specific for Dv chromosomes were developed, with maximum efficiency up to 51.79%. We assigned the 841 IT markers to seven Dv chromosomes (1V–7V) using seven wheat–Dv chromosome addition and substitution lines: 135 to 1V, 175 to 2V, 120 to 3V, 89 to 4V, 140 to 5V, 71 to 6V, and 111 to 7V, respectively. Using T. aestivum-Dv telosomic and whole arm translocation lines, they were further located on the short or long chromosome arms. These specific markers for individual chromosomes of Dv provided efficient tools for the characterization of structural variation involving the individual chromosome of Dv, as well as for the selection of useful genes located on individual Dv chromosome in breeding programs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alien chromosome line; Dasypyrum villosum L; Intron-targeting markers; Next-generation sequencing; Triticum aestivum L",,2-s2.0-85028317569

Future research should focus on the early detection and prevention of newAcaciaintroductions and on a cost-effective and sustainable management of the novel ecosystems resulting from invasions. • Context Invasive alien plants (IAPs) strongly alter ecosystems reducing biodiversity, modifying ecosystem services and increasing negative impacts at social and economic level. Among invasive taxa, Acacia is a highly problematic genus worldwide. In fact, almost 500 papers have been published on several aspects of Acacia invasions for the last 25 years. • Aims We aim at reviewing the current knowledge on the consequences of the invasion by Acacia genus in Mediterranean ecosystems. We also collect and propose different approaches for the management and recovery of invaded areas and suggest future perspectives on Acacia research. • Methods We compile, summarise and discuss recent findings on physicochemical, ecological, microbiological and socioeconomic aspects of invasion related to Australian acacias (Acacia dealbata, Acacia longifolia, Acacia mearnsii, Acacia saligna and Acacia melanoxylon) focusing on Mediterranean areas. • ResultsAcacia invasion generally entails soil physicochemical alterations and changes in microbial function and structure. Consequences such as the decreased biodiversity, altered ecosystem structure, larger seed banks dominated by invasive species, new biotrophic relationships or alterations in water availability and fire regimes suggest that acacias are locally creating novel ecosystems. • Conclusions Forecasting invasions, modelling and managing ecosystems dominated by acacias are challenging tasks that should be addressed in the future, since climatic conditions and intensification in land uses are increasing the likelihood of Acacia invasions in Mediterranean areas. Unsuccessful management actions suggest that restoration should be meticulously monitored, but the magnitude of invasion or the inconsistency of economic investment indicate that eradication is often unfeasible. Alternatively, novel integrative and cost-effective solutions including the collaboration of society, politicians and stakeholders are necessary to prevent new introductions and achieve sustainable control of acacias.

A common characteristic of successful invaders seems to be a broad niche width, and their impact on native communities may increase with increasing niche size. Overall, successful invader predators are predicted to shift their niche width by broadening it from native to invaded conditions. The scarcity of ecological studies examining invasive species in their native ranges prevents researchers from knowing if the prevalence of generalist invaders represents conservatism of broad native-range niches or instead niche shifts as a result of different processes acting in the invaded areas. Here we reviewed literature on trophic niche of the predatory invader American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) in both native and invaded ranges. We used statistical and graphic tools to analyse possible shifts in dietary niche width and the effect of introduced crayfish on the feeding strategy of L. catesbeianus. Globally, our results indicate that food sources used by the species differed in native and invaded sites, with a narrower trophic niche width in invaded areas. However, this pattern was disrupted by the occurrence of introduced crayfish that represents the major driver of the observed niche-width variation. Our data shed light on possible complications in interpreting and predicting patterns of biological invasions due to the interaction among species from different trophic levels that apparently disrupt general patterns that are likely bound to be idiosyncratic and complex. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG Switzerland.","Alien predator; Amphibians; Feeding strategy; Introduction; Niche width","biological invasion; community structure; crustacean; feeding behavior; frog; generalist; introduced species; native species; niche breadth; predator; Amphibia; Astacoidea; Lithobates; Rana catesbeiana",2-s2.0-85020312906

In southeastern Australia, cane toads (Rhinella marina) are spreading into montane areas cooler than have been predicted to be suitable. We monitored the presence of active toads in two high-elevation sites (750–1010 m above sea level [asl]) and two adjacent low-elevation sites (150–210 m asl) in northeastern New South Wales over spring and summer. We radio-tracked 28 field-collected adult toads (n = 5–9 toads per site) and quantified their thermoregulatory opportunities and body temperatures. Toads were active at low-elevation sites in spring, but were not seen in high-elevation sites until late summer. At low elevations, toads had access to a wide range of temperatures and selected cool diurnal refugia. In montane sites, toads had less control over their temperatures, because thermal differentials between exposed and sheltered microhabitats were smaller. Overall though, body temperatures of toads at high-elevation sites in summer were not different to those of conspecifics at lower elevations in spring. As a result, toads at high elevations moved as far (mean daily displacement around 50 m) as did low-elevation conspecifics. Toads in high elevations spent the day in superficial shelter, often partly exposed. Thus., although toads only appear in high-elevation sites seasonally, their behaviour at those sites (spending the day exposed; moving extensively at night) likely exacerbates their ecological impact by bringing them to the attention of vulnerable native predators. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Alien species; Bufonidae; Habitat use; Marginal habitats; Rhinella marina; Thermal biology","biological invasion; body temperature; conspecific; ecological impact; habitat use; introduced species; invasive species; microhabitat; mountain environment; native species; thermoregulation; toad; Australia; New South Wales; Anura; Bufo marinus; Bufonidae",2-s2.0-85020496843

In the present study, life table parameters of H. halys populations were investigated in Italy under typical temperate/Mediterranean climate conditions representative of southern Europe. Our findings indicate that in Italy H. halys has two generations/year and very high reproductive rates for both generations (R0 = 24.04 and 5.44 for the overwintering and summer generation, respectively).

The fact that species tend to maintain their original climate niche allows predictive maps of invasion risk to anticipate potential invadable areas. Unravelling the mechanisms driving niche shifts can shed light on the management of invasive species. Here, we assessed niche shifts in one of the world's worst invasive species: the wild boar Sus scrofa. We also predicted potential invadable areas based on an ensemble of three ecological niche modelling methods, and evaluated the performance of models calibrated with native vs. pooled (native plus invaded) species records. By disentangling the drivers of change on the exotic wild boar population's niches, we found strong evidence for niche conservatism during biological invasion. Ecological niche models calibrated with both native and pooled range records predicted convergent areas. Also, observed niche shifts are mostly explained by niche unfilling, i.e. there are unoccupied areas in the exotic range where climate is analogous to the native range. Niche unfilling is expected as result of recent colonization and ongoing dispersal, and was potentially stronger for the Neotropics, where a recent wave of introductions for pig-farming and game-hunting has led to high wild boar population growth rates. The invasive potential of wild boar in the Neotropics is probably higher than in other regions, which has profound management implications if we are to prevent their invasion into species-rich areas, such as Amazonia, coupled with expansion of African swine fever and possibly great economic losses. Although the originally Eurasian-wide distribution suggests a pre-adaptation to a wide array of climates, the wild boar world-wide invasion does not exhibit evidence of niche evolution. The invasive potential of the wild boar therefore probably lies on the reproductive, dietary and morphological characteristics of this species, coupled with behavioural thermoregulation. © 2017 The Authors.

In this context, the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis is attracted by oviposition-induced plant volatiles emitted by Vicia faba plants as a consequence of feeding and oviposition by the pentatomid host Nezara viridula. However, this local tritrophic web could be affected by the recent invasion by the alien pentatomid bug Halyomorpha halys, an herbivore that shares the same environments as native pentatomid pests. Therefore, we investigated in laboratory conditions the possible impact of H. halys on the plant volatile-mediated signalling in the local tritrophic web V. faba–N. viridula–T. basalis. We found that T. basalis wasps were not attracted by volatiles induced in the plants by feeding and oviposition activities of H. halys, indicating specificity in the wasps’ response. However, the parasitoid attraction towards plant volatiles emitted as a consequence of feeding and oviposition by the associated host was disrupted when host, N. viridula, and non-associated host, H. halys, were concurrently present on the same plant, indicating that invasion by the alien herbivore interferes with established semiochemical webs. These outcomes are discussed in a context of multiple herbivory by evaluating the possible influences of alien insects on local parasitoid foraging behaviour. © 2017, The Author(s).","Halyomorpha halys; Insect invasion; Multiple attack; Oviposition-induced plant volatiles; Trissolcus basalis","biological invasion; herbivore; insect; invasive species; oviposition; pest species; plant; signaling; tritrophic interaction; Halyomorpha halys; Hexapoda; Nezara viridula; Pentatomidae; Trissolcus basalis; Vicia faba",2-s2.0-85019223169

A spectacular invasion of introduced Pacific oysters Magallana (formerly Crassostrea) gigas in the northern Wadden Sea (eastern North Sea, NE Atlantic) has relegated resident mussels Mytilus edulis on their beds to subtenant status. At the beginning of feral oyster establishment, mussel beds offered suitable sites with ample substrate to settle upon. After larval attachment to mussels, the fast-growing M. gigas overtopped and smothered their basibionts. With increasing Pacific oyster abundance and size, oyster larvae preferentially settled upon oysters, and the ecological impact of the invaders on the residents changed from competitive displacement to accommodation of mussels underneath a canopy of oysters. Oysters took the best feeding positions while mussels received shelter from predation and detrimental epibionts. The resident’s mono-dominance has turned into co-dominance with an alien, persisting in novel, multi-layered mixed reefs of oysters with mussels, which we term “oyssel reefs.” The first 26 yr of the Pacific oyster’s conquest of mussel beds in the northern Wadden Sea may question the overcome notions of natural balance, superiority of pristine over novel species combinations, and of introduced alien species threatening biodiversity and ecosystem stability in general. © 2017 Reise et al.","Coexistence; Competition; Crassostrea gigas Mytilus edulis; Ecosystem engineering; Facilitation; Invasive species; Magallana; Wadden Sea",,2-s2.0-85030215063

We used four plant species listed as noxious by local authorities in riparian systems to discern whether 1) the severity of these secondary invasions was related to the control method applied to the first alien; and 2) which species that were secondary invaders persisted over time. In a collaborative study by 16 research institutions, we monitored plant species composition following control of non-native Tamarix trees along southwestern U.S. rivers using defoliation by an introduced biocontrol beetle, and three physical removal methods: mechanical using saws, heavy machinery, and burning in 244 treated and 79 untreated sites across six U.S. states. Physical removal favored secondary invasions immediately after Tamarix removal (0–3 yrs.), while in the biocontrol treatment, secondary invasions manifested later (> 5 yrs.). Within this general trend, the response of weeds to control was idiosyncratic; dependent on treatment type and invader. Two annual tumbleweeds that only reproduce by seed (Bassia scoparia and Salsola tragus) peaked immediately after physical Tamarix removal and persisted over time, even after herbicide application. Acroptilon repens, a perennial forb that vigorously reproduces by rhizomes, and Bromus tectorum, a very frequent annual grass before removal that only reproduces by seed, were most successful at biocontrol sites, and progressively spread as the canopy layer opened. These results demonstrate that strategies to control Tamarix affect secondary invasions differently among species and that time since disturbance is an important, generally overlooked, factor affecting response. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological restoration; Invasive species management; Noxious weeds; Riparian systems; Secondary invasions; Tamarix control","beetle; biological invasion; defoliation; evergreen tree; grass; herbicide; invasive species; restoration ecology; riparian vegetation; weed; weed control; Acroptilon repens; Bassia scoparia; Bromus tectorum; Coleoptera; Salsola tragus; Tamarix",2-s2.0-85030652402

Historical and current connectivity with riverine and marine environments are the primary determinants of present-day fish assemblages in these systems. A small and remarkably consistent group of relict estuarine species have persisted in these coastal lakes and lagoons. The loss or reduction of connectivity with the sea has impacted on the diversity of marine fishes in all eight study systems, with no marine fishes occurring in those water bodies where connectivity has been completely broken (e.g. Sibaya, Groenvlei). In systems that have retained tenuous linkages with the sea (e.g., Verlorenvlei, Wilderness lakes), elements of the marine fish assemblage have persisted, especially the presence of facultative catadromous species. Freshwater fish diversity in coastal lakes and lagoons is a function of historical and present biogeography and salinity. From a freshwater biogeography perspective, the inflowing rivers of the four temperate systems reviewed here contain three or fewer native freshwater fishes, while the subtropical lakes that are fed by river systems contain up to 40 freshwater fish species. Thus, the significantly higher fish species diversity in subtropical versus temperate coastal lakes and lagoons comes as no surprise. Fish species diversity has been increased further in some systems (e.g., Groenvlei) by alien fish introductions. However, the impacts of fish introductions and translocations have not been studied in the coastal lakes and lagoons of South Africa. In these closed systems, it is probable that predation impacts on small estuarine fishes are significant. The recent alien fish introductions is an example of the growing threats to these systems during the Anthropocene, a period when human activities have had significant negative impacts and show potential to match the changes recorded during the entire Holocene. © 2017 The Authors.

Commonly assumed to benefit cold-limited invasive alien species, these climatic changes may also change their feeding preferences, especially in the case of omnivorous ectotherms. We investigated heat wave effects on diet choice, growth and energy reserves in the invasive red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. In laboratory experiments, we fed juvenile and adult crayfish on animal, plant or mixed diets and exposed them to a short or a long heat wave. We then measured crayfish survival, growth, body reserves and Fulton’s condition index. Diet choices of the crayfish maintained on the mixed diet were estimated using stable isotopes (13C and 15N). The results suggest a decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets at higher temperatures, as juveniles fed on the animal diet were unable to maintain high growth rates in the long heat wave; and a decreased efficiency of herbivorous diets at lower temperatures, as juveniles in the cold accumulated less body reserves when fed on the plant diet. Heat wave treatments increased the assimilation of plant material, especially in juveniles, allowing them to sustain high growth rates in the long heat wave. Contrary to our expectations, crayfish performance decreased in the long heat wave, suggesting that Mediterranean summer heat waves may have negative effects on P. clarkii and that they are unlikely to boost its populations in this region. Although uncertain, it is possible that the greater assimilation of the plant diet resulted from changes in crayfish feeding preferences, raising the hypotheses that i) heat waves may change the predominant impacts of this keystone species and ii) that by altering species’ trophic niches, climate change may alter the main impacts of invasive alien species. © 2017 Carreira et al.

Dimorphandra wilsonii seedlings were 50-week pot-cultivated under limiting (3 mM) or non-limiting (10 mM) N, with or without U. decumbens, and inoculated or not with a N-fixer (Bradyrhizobium sp.) and an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF – Glomus etunicatum), both forming symbioses in the field. Since D. wilsonii seedlings grew more and ‘lost' fewer nutrients under the symbionts' presence, symbionts mitigated plant-plant competition. Under limiting N, inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings grew more (despite no nodulation), but N fixation was only suggested when inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings competed with U. decumbens. D. wilsonii 13C, and substrate's carbon and respiration suggest that only the microbes performing key functions received plant carbon. Under non-limiting N, inoculated D. wilsonii seedlings became enriched in 13C, substrate accumulated carbon and microbial respiration increased, suggesting a more generalist microbial community.

Conversations between women and healthcare personnel about women's bodily experience in early pregnancy can contribute to increased body knowledge, which may have a positive impact in later stages of their pregnancy and in relation to delivery. The aim of the study was to describe first-time pregnant women's experiences of their body in early pregnancy (pregnancy weeks 10–14). Method: Twelve women were asked to draw pictures and answer questions freely about their experiences of their first pregnant body. Hermeneutical text interpretation was used to obtain an overall view of the experiences. Findings: A main theme emerged: ‘the body is connected to the cycle of life’. This theme comprised five subthemes: ‘bodily longing and a sense of ambivalence’, ‘being doubtful’, ‘welcoming changes in body and mind’, ‘feeling inner strength and struggle to find strength’ and ‘accepting a different body and mind’. This main theme and the subthemes were further interpreted and were understood as an experience of ‘me and my body’. Conclusions: The body reminded the women to take care of it and gave rise to positive thoughts. When the body exhibited uncomfortable reactions and sensations, these were taken as evidence of pregnancy, which was also seen positive but it also triggered a sense of dissatisfaction with the body and a feeling of it becoming alien. © 2016 Nordic College of Caring Science","body experience; caring science; first-time pregnant; hermeneutics",,2-s2.0-84996490490

These biological invasions have been studied from the niche conservatism and niche shifts perspective. Niche differentiation may result from changes in fundamental niche or realized niche or both; in biological invasions, niche differences between native and non-native ranges can appear through niche expansion, niche unfilling and niche stability. The American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus is an invasive species that can have negative impacts on native amphibian populations. This research examines the climate niche shifts of this frog, its potential range of expansion in Mexico and the risk of invasion by bullfrog in the habitats of 82 frog species endemic to Mexico, that based on their climatic niche similarity were divided in four ecological groups. The results indicate that species in two ecological groups were the most vulnerable to invasion by bullfrog. However, the climate niche shifts of L. catesbeianus may allow it to adapt to new environmental conditions, so species from the two remaining groups cannot be dismissed as not vulnerable.

A megaspore-like cell was observed in the following stages of development. The embryo sac is Polygonum type with persistent antipodals. Immature seeds have nuclear endosperm. Development patterns of embryo sac and non-meiotic origin of the megaspore lead us to reject the adventitious embryony and apospory cited for other taxa in the family and, instead, a possible disploporic origin of the embryo sac is proposed for the first time for Myrtaceae. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Asexual reproduction; Diplospory; Embryology; Invasive plant; Megasporogenesis; Reproductive biology","apomixis; asexual reproduction; embryonic development; gametophyte; introduced species; molecular analysis; morphology; ontogeny; reproductive biology; shrub; South America; Myrtaceae; Polygonum; Psidium",2-s2.0-85023645034

Sampling was performed in homogenous physiognomic-physiographic units along the altitudinal gradient from the plain to the mountainous areas. In a stratified random design, 38 sites on 12 asphalt roads were sampled, and 330 plant taxa of different chorotypes were identified. The altitudinal distribution of the chorotypes was examined fitting generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM). The results showed that native uni-regional taxa (Irano–Turanian elements) were the dominant chorotype of the roadside habitats in the rangeland areas. The altitudinal response curve of multi-regional (bi-regional to quadri-regional) chorotypes reflected climatic conditions in their contributing phytochoria. Quadri-regional taxa, with an optimum of the Gaussian response curve at mid-altitudes, reflected a moderate climate. The proportion of endemic species (3.6%) was high compared to the pluri-regional (4.6%) and the cosmopolitan taxa (1.2%). While the pluri-regional taxa increased with altitude, cosmopolitan species decreased monotonically and were absent from the high altitudes.

Data Sources MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched to March 2016. Reference lists of relevant publications were searched. No language restrictions were applied. Study Selection Eligible qualitative studies reported the experiences of carers of stroke survivors who underwent inpatient rehabilitation. The search yielded 3532 records; 93 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility, and 34 documents (33 studies) were included. Comprehensiveness of reporting was assessed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Health Research framework. Data Extraction Data on the characteristics of included studies were independently extracted by 2 authors. Differences in data extraction between authors were resolved through discussion or by a third author. All text in studies’ results and discussion sections were extracted for analysis. Data Synthesis Extracted texts were analyzed inductively using thematic synthesis. Seven analytical themes were developed that related to the carers’ experiences, needs, and preferences: (1) overwhelmed with emotions; (2) recognition as a stakeholder in recovery; (3) desire to be heard and informed; (4) persisting for action and outcomes; (5) being legitimate clients; (6) navigating an alien culture and environment; and (7) managing the transition home. Conclusions This systematic review provides new insights into the experiences, needs, and preferences of carers of stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Carers experienced distress as they navigated a foreign culture and environment without adequate communication and processes in place for their inclusion. We recommend deliberate efforts to provide a more inclusive environment that better supports and prepares carers for their new role. © 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine","Caregivers; Qualitative research; Rehabilitation; Review; Stroke","caregiver; caregiver burden; distress syndrome; hospital; hospital patient; human; personal experience; personal needs; qualitative research; Review; shared decision making; stroke patient; stroke rehabilitation; systematic review; caregiver; cerebrovascular accident; health service; interpersonal communication; patient preference; psychology; stroke rehabilitation; Caregivers; Communication; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Inpatients; Patient Preference; Qualitative Research; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation",2-s2.0-85019590389

To properly understand the factors behind this triangular relationship, we assessed: (1) the capacity of SDM to explain variations in population abundance, and (2) the effect of population growth in the dynamics on the triangular relationship by comparing its variation in two sampling periods in the case of a species that is increasing in numbers. Location: Mainland Spain. Methods: Data on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) relative abundance were obtained for 441 localities, of which 145 were surveyed twice (2006–2007 and 2011–2013). Species distribution was modelled using the favourability function. The relationship between favourability values for species occurrence and abundances were explored using quantile regressions. Results: The number of roe deer is increasing on a regional scale. The results from the earlier survey showed a weaker relationship than those obtained from the survey carried out later. Growth rates were significantly related to the residuals of the quantile regression fitted to the earlier survey (the higher the residual difference between observed and expected abundances, the higher the population growth rates). Main conclusions: Our results support the use of the residuals of the quantile regression as a proxy of the population growth rate. They also partly support the interpretation of the upper limit of abundance delimited by the regression as the environmental carrying capacity. Overall, the results are of general interest when using SDM to predict the population abundance of expanding species, such as alien species and/or in changing environments. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","population abundance; population growth rate; quantile regression; species distribution modelling; wild ungulates","abundance estimation; carrying capacity; deer; ecological modeling; introduced species; population dynamics; population growth; prediction; regression analysis; relative abundance; spatial distribution; species occurrence; ungulate; wild population; Spain; Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Ungulata",2-s2.0-85026444360

Sampling at five sites in each of these estuaries occurred in January 2012 (austral summer) to provide a species inventory and determine whether the number of species, total density and fish community composition differed between the two water bodies. A total of 18,148 fish were recorded, representing six species across four families. Three species that can complete their life cycle within estuaries, i.e. the atherinids Lepthatherina wallacei and Atherinosoma elongata and the gobiid Pseudogobius olorum, dominated the fish fauna, accounting for >99% of all fish collected. No significant inter-estuary differences were observed in the mean number of species, mean total density or fish community composition. Although the fish community was depauperate in terms of the number of species, total density was high, reflecting the presence of permanent and seasonal barriers to the immigration of marine species into these estuaries and the highly productive nature of this system, respectively. Two introduced freshwater species, i.e. the Eastern Gambusia Gambusia holbrooki and the Goldfish, Carassius auratus, were recorded in the Vasse Estuary. As C. auratus was found in mesohaline conditions, individuals may be able to use the estuary as a ‘saltbridge’ to gain access to other tributaries and/or the Wonnerup Estuary, and thus expand their distribution. These findings are of concern given the potential deleterious biological and ecological effects of these alien species. © 2017, The Author(s).","Introduced species; Ramsar; South-western Australia; Vasse-Wonnerup; Wetland",,2-s2.0-85029855694

In this study, research was conducted to acquire information on invasive alien species (IAS) of turtles and indigenous turtles and tortoises, living both free and in captivity, as possible reservoirs of Chlamydiaceae. Analysis of specimens (pharyngeal and cloacal swabs and tissues) from 204 turtles and tortoises revealed an overall Chlamydiaceae prevalence of 18.3% and 28.6% among free-living and captive animals respectively, with variable levels of shedding. Further testing conducted with a species-specific real-time PCR and microarray test was unsuccessful. Subsequently sequencing was applied to genotype the Chlamydiaceae-positive samples. Almost the full lengths of the 16S rRNA and ompA genes as well as the 16S-23S intergenic spacer (IGS) and 23S rRNA domain I were obtained for 14, 20 and 8 specimens respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons revealed two distinct branches. Group 1 (10 specimens), specific to freshwater turtles and reported here for the first time, was most closely related to Chlamydia (C.) pneumoniae strains and the newly described Candidatus C. sanzinia. Group 2 (four specimens), detected in Testudo spp. samples, showed highest homology to C. pecorum strains but formed a separate sub-branch. Finally, molecular analysis conducted on positive samples together with their geographical distribution in places distant from each other strongly suggest that Group 1 specimens correspond to a new species in the Chlamydiaceae family. In-depth studies of Chlamydia spp. from turtles and tortoises are needed to further characterise these atypical strains and address arising questions about their pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. © 2017 Mitura et al.

They do this by aggressively discriminating against non-nestmates with deviant cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) signatures. Studying nestmate recognition can be challenging as individual insects do not only vary in their discriminatory abilities, but also in their motivation to behave aggressively. To disentangle the influence of signaling and behavioral motivation on nestmate recognition, we investigated the ant Temnothorax nylanderi, where the presence of tapeworm-infected nestmates leads to reduced nestmate recognition among uninfected workers. The parasite-induced decline in nestmate recognition could be caused by higher intra-colonial cue diversity as tapeworm-infected workers are known to exhibit a modified hydrocarbon signature. This in turn may broaden the neuronal template of their nestmates, leading to a higher tolerance towards alien conspecifics. To test this hypothesis, we exchanged infected ants between colonies and analyzed their impact on CHC profiles of uninfected workers. We demonstrate that despite frequent grooming, which should promote the transfer of recognition cues, CHC profiles of uninfected workers neither changed in the presence of tapeworm-infected ants, nor did it increase cue diversity among uninfected nestmates within or between colonies. However, CHC profiles were systematically affected by the removal of nestmates and addition of non-nestmates, independently from the ants’ infection status. For example, when non-nestmates were present workers expressed more dimethyl alkanes and higher overall CHC quantities, possibly to achieve a better distinction from non-nestmates. Workers showed clear task-specific profiles with tapeworm-infected workers resembling more closely young nurses than older foragers. Our results show that the parasite-induced decline in nestmate recognition is not due to increased recognition cue diversity or altered CHC profiles of uninfected workers, but behavioral changes might explain tolerance towards intruders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cuticular hydrocarbons; Formicidae; Nestmate recognition; Parasite-induced changes; Sociobiology; Tapeworm; Temnothorax nylanderi","ant; behavioral ecology; conspecific; cuticle; environmental cue; host-parasite interaction; hydrocarbon; induced response; introduced species; nestmate recognition; parasite; parasite infestation; signaling; social insect; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Temnothorax nylanderi",2-s2.0-85028361990

The photosynthetic capability of wheat germplasm with different alien chromosomes was investigated and compared with bread wheat cultivars (BC) in this study, including wheat addition lines (CA), hexaploid triticale (HT), octoploid triticale (OT), and synthetic hexaploid wheat lines (SHW). Results indicated that HT, OT, and SHW produced significantly higher biomass plant−1(BMPP), with HT displaying the highest grain yield plant−1 (GYPP). Distinct superiority of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and carboxylation activities of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) was observed in HT and OT. Meanwhile, OT showed the highest expression of the Rubisco large subunit gene (rbcL) in the flag leaves at heading and grain-filling stages, though the coding region of rbcL was highly conserved in all investigated materials. Further analysis indicated that OT and Chinese Spring-rye disomic addition lines displayed higher expression of Rubisco small subunit gene (rbcS). Correlation analysis revealed significant and positive correlations between Pn and the expressions of rbcL (at both heading and grain-filling stages), the expression of rbcS (at heading stage), and the carboxylation activity of Rubisco (at grain-filling stage). Anatomical structure analysis of the chloroplasts showed SHW with longer chloroplasts and more chloroplast grana and grana lamella. In the present study, HT, OT, and Chinese Spring-rye disomic addition lines with rye chromosomes displayed greater photosynthetic capability than BC and SHW, and could be applied in breeding programs to improve the photosynthetic efficiency of wheat. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Bread wheat; Photosynthetic capability; Rubisco; Synthetic hexaploid wheat; Triticale; Yield potential",,2-s2.0-85022320055

We incorporate our detailed knowledge of the native-range source populations and global introduction history of brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys) to examine intraspecific variation in realized niche expansion and unfilling, and to investigate how niche modelling approaches are affected by that variation. Realized niche dynamics of H. halys were analyzed using an ordination method, ecological niche models (ENMs), and occurrence records from (1) East Asia, (2) North America, (3) Europe, (4) native-range source populations for North America and Europe introductions, and (5) global range. Patterns of niche filling and expansion were observed across the invaded ranges of H. halys in North America and Europe: niche unfilling (42.7 %) and expansion (0.0 %) in North America, and unfilling (80.5 %) and expansion (28.0 %) in Europe. Some invasive populations have expanded into climatically novel areas in central Europe. Results presented here provide evidence that H. halys has not yet occupied all suitable climatic habitats in North America and Europe that resemble its native range, and the central USA and most parts of Europe appear to be most at risk of H.halys spread in near future. When realized niche shifts dominated by niche unfilling, fully capturing species’ requirement by basing ENMs on native range may be more important for accurate invasion forecasts than non-native models.

In the present study, fine-scale diversity patterns in relation to depth were analyzed for three major megafaunal groups (fish, cephalopods and crustaceans) in three subareas of the eastern Mediterranean (Crete, Cyclades and Dodecanese islands). The analysis was based on data from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey conducted during 2005–2014 and the relationship between depth and two different diversity measures (species richness and Shannon-Weaver) was examined using Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) techniques. Species richness of fish decreased with depth in two of the three subareas (Cyclades, Dodecanese), while the opposite was true for crustaceans in all subareas. Cephalopods had higher species richness at intermediate depths, near the shelf break. Significant differences among subareas were found, with Crete showing a distinct species richness-depth pattern, which was more obvious for fish and cephalopods. The differences among subareas were also highlighted based on the occurrence of alien species of Indo-Pacific origin, which were more frequent in Crete. Our results suggested that the importance of depth-related factors in structuring communities was higher for cephalopods and less important for fish, and that Crete showed a distinct diversity-depth relationship, a fact that can be attributed to its specific geographical and oceanographic characteristics. These results support the current GFCM/FAO’s characterization of Crete as a unique geographic subarea. The findings of the study contribute to understanding the causes of underlying diversity patterns and would assist various environmental management actions, particularly those related to the establishment of marine-protected areas. © 2017 Peristeraki et al.

Pedigree reconstruction has been proven to be an efficient tool to correct pedigree errors and recover hidden relatedness in open pollinated progeny tests but the method can be limited by the lack of parental genotypes and the high proportion of alien pollen from outside the breeding population. Our study investigates the efficiency of sib-ship reconstruction in an advanced breeding population of Eucalyptus nitens with only partially tracked pedigree. The sib-ship reconstruction allowed the identification of selfs (4% of the sample) and the exploration of their potential effect on inbreeding depression in the traits studied. We detected signs of inbreeding depression in diameter at breast height and growth strain while no indications were observed in wood density, wood stiffness and tangential air-dry shrinkage. After the application of a corrected sib-ship relationship matrix, additive genetic variance and heritability were observed to increase where signs of inbreeding depression were initially detected. Conversely, the same genetic parameters for traits that appeared to be free of inbreeding depression decreased in size. It therefore appeared that greater genetic variance may be due, at least in part, to contributions from inbreeding in these studied populations rather than a removal of inbreeding as is traditionally thought. © 2017 Klápště et al.

There was no significant relationship between increased undocumented immigration and DUI deaths. Conclusions. This study provides evidence that undocumented immigration has not increased the prevalence of drug or alcohol problems, but may be associated with reductions in these public health concerns.",,"drug dependence; drunken driving; factual database; human; longitudinal study; migration; mortality; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; trends; United States; Accidents, Traffic; Databases, Factual; Driving Under the Influence; Emigration and Immigration; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Substance-Related Disorders; United States",2-s2.0-85027881371

Unlike just a few years ago, however, foreign nations have begun their own investigations as well, in many instances probing the same (mis)conduct as the United States. While a welcomed change to some, intersections between U.S. and foreign investigations have triggered novel constitutional issues for American actors. For the first time, this Note will discuss a question that arises from these intersections: is testimony independently compelled by a foreign sovereign, under threat of sanction, ""compelled"" under the Constitution's Fifth Amendment? This Note argues that it is. To arrive at this conclusion, this Note first engages with the same-sovereign rule, a rule endorsed by the Supreme Court's recent venture into the extraterritoriality of the Fifth Amendment. Finding that the rule creates an interpretive tension with other terms in the Self-Incrimination Clause (the ""Clause""), this Note suggests an alternative rule, one that achieves harmony among terms within the Clause. Following this interpretation, this Note argues that foreign compulsion triggers the Fifth Amendment, even when the United States is in no way involved in the compulsion. After finding that foreign compulsion is ""compelled,"" this Note moves on to decide how American courts should treat that testimony. While testimony compelled by U.S. authorities is owed use and derivative use immunity, this Note, upon noting the lack of absolute commitment to any one immunity standard in the Court's precedents, decides if a lesser immunity standard, such as use only immunity, is more fitting. Acknowledging the weighty concerns to the contrary, this Note concludes that foreign-compelled testimony is owed use and derivative use immunity, but with the caveat that the government may make nonevidentiary uses of foreign-compelled testimony.",,,2-s2.0-85030655542

Water imbibition of the seeds can be achieved through manual piercing of the seed coat, but this method remains time consuming and heterogeneous. We tested several ecologically friendly methods to break seed dormancy, including manual pin puncture, water soaking, oven dry-heating (two temperatures) and sanding. Sanding was performed using an automatic grinder to control shaking duration (three durations) and get a homogeneous scraping of the coat. All methods, except dry-heating, resulted in successful dormancy breaking; water soaking was the least efficient method, attaining 57% germination. Sanding proved to be as efficient as puncturing (97%) but long duration sanding (10 or 15 min) could damage cotyledons, which would impede further development of the plant. Short-time sanding (5 min) proved to be the best method to reach high total germination and healthy (undamaged cotyledon) seedlings, and was successfully applied to 500 seeds. The reference puncture method and the automatic sanding were also tested on seeds of nine Fabaceae species and proved to be efficient for some species. Automated sanding can thus be used as a standard to break physical dormancy of black locust or other Fabaceae seeds to allow further comparative studies of plant populations or genotypes. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","automated grinder; dormancy breaking; Fabaceae; germination; sanding; scarification; standard protocol",,2-s2.0-85020187203

Seeds were collected from a riparian population to conduct germination, floatation, and dispersal experiments. Data were analysed in comparison with a real invasion case that was initiated about 10 years ago along a river system. In Québec, giant hogweed individuals produce on average 14,000 to 16,000 seeds with a germination rate of 75–85%. Seeds with endosperm that fall in water likely sink within 5 hr. Along a small brook, most disperse over short distances (<40 m) in summer, although some can travel 100–300 m. These data suggest that late-summer or early-fall water dispersal of seeds would not explain the magnitude and rapidity of the invasion patterns observed along streams. We suggest that late-fall and, especially, spring floods are the most efficient dispersal vectors for giant hogweed seeds and are likely responsible for the establishment of populations kilometres downstream from introduction points along river systems. The spread of giant hogweed would consequently be less influenced in the near future by a rise in temperature than by a change in the magnitude or timing of flood events.

Drawing from both actual as well as fictional accounts of the period, this article explores how images of violent encounters with the Muslim Orient were produced, borrowed and reconstructed within the American literary and national landscape. In this respect, this article seeks to address the artificiality of these narratives, where the production of a ‘general truth’ (as the editors of The Narrative of Robert Adams defined it), is more essential than the account’s adherence to factuality. At the same time, this article explores the manner with which representations of violence by ‘merciless Barbarians’, although referring to acts of immediate violence and calling for an immediate response, were also heavily mediated both in their production and consumption, contributing in this manner to the ideological processes of constructing new ‘imagined communities’ in the American post-revolutionary nation. © 2017 Intellect Ltd Article.","American; Barbary captivity; Muslim Orient; Orientalism textual attitudes authenticity mediation heteroglossia",,2-s2.0-85032731444

With assistance from the London-based law firm Leigh Day, the aim is to reach a negotiated settlement with the governments of Britain, France and the Netherlands. What makes this case different from previous discussions on Caribbean reparations is that the claim includes an indigenous component, with 'native genocide' included in the title and an 'indigenous peoples' development program' included within the ten-point plan for reparations. Yet reparations are problematic in the Caribbean context due to the ongoing violation of indigenous rights internally. This article analyzes the various dimensions of the Caribbean reparations discourse with regard to contemporary indigenous communities in the region. It highlights the problems at regional level with regard to state responsibility and indigenous rights, particularly in relation to land, and argues that this presents a problematic element in the claim due to the fact that violations are being perpetrated against indigenous peoples by the same states who are representing them in the Caribbean Reparations Commission. Finally, it discusses the onus on European governments to acknowledge past wrongs and the potential of 'cultural reparations' to contribute to the Caribbean reparatory justice programme more generally.

These seeds display a large viability and their germination is stimulated by heat. To control the populations, it is necessary to remove adults and young individuals, and to prevent seedling establishment after fire occupying the space with rapid growth and high competitive native species. Context: Acacia melanoxylon displays a widespread distribution in South West Europe, and an improved knowledge of its reproductive characteristics is required in order to control its expansion. Aims: This experiment was designed to provide useful indicators for an efficient management of A. melanoxylon populations based on its biological cycle in relation to fire. Methods: We explored the reproductive biology of A. melanoxylon, from seed dissemination—–quantifying seed rain over a year, their germination with and without fire—the seedling and sapling banks and the structure of the adult population. We analysed the effects of fire, seed maturation and scarification on the viability of seeds and the stimulation of seed germination in the aerial seed bank and in the different strata of the soil seed bank. Results: Our results indicate that A. melanoxylon produced millions of seeds per ha and per year, half of which germinated and the other half went to the soil seed bank, maintaining the viability many years. The germination was the most critical step in the population dynamics of this species, and fire stimulates germination up to 90%. Conclusion: A. melanoxylon adults and seedlings removal, followed by colonization of rapid growth and high competitive native species that cover the ground very quickly would be a good control action. © 2017, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS.","Black wattle; Germination; Seed banks; Seed dissemination; Tree population structure","Acacia; Acacia melanoxylon",2-s2.0-85027833356

Yet the debate over the ‘democratic boundary problem’ has been hindered by the way contributors work with different understandings of democracy, of democratic legitimacy and of what it means to participate in a demos. My argument is that these conceptual issues can be clarified if we recognize that the ‘demos’ constitutive of democracy is essentially dual in character: it must be defined from a third-person, observer’s perspective from which it can be represented as a whole entity; but it must also be seen as arising out of an association of numerous and ongoing second-person relationships that participants negotiate among one another. Both perspectives are essential to conceptualizing the demos, but their relation to each other has been obscured by democratic theory’s historical reliance on the imaginary of the sovereign state. Drawing on literature from deliberative democratic theory, this article reconstructs the concept of the demos in a way that better distinguishes the logic of democracy from the logic of the state, allowing us to think more clearly about how demotic boundaries may be subjected to standards of democratic legitimation. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","boundaries; deliberative; democracy; demos; legitimacy",,2-s2.0-85026907852

Whereas the novel was originally praised as a landmark text in Philippine literature in English, His Native Soil was later dismissed by postwar critics as an imitative, formally flawed, and stylistically inferior work. Taking up Roberto Schwarz's challenge to advance a reading practice that takes into account the difference between literature and social structure in the colonial periphery, I argue that rather than viewing His Native Soil 's improbabilities of plot and tonal dissonances as artistic flaws, they are more meaningfully read as the author's attempt to adapt the realist protocols of the bildungsroman to capture the double-edged nature of independence: The adoption of a trade policy that would economically bind together the Philippines and the United States and that would render political freedom impossible for Filipinos unless relations of colonial dependency were to be continued after independence. © 2017 by Duke University Press.","Bildungsroman; Global anglophone literature; Novel; Peripheral realism; Philippines; Remittance fiction; US empire",,2-s2.0-85027728871

While most policy work aim at establishing trusting and collaborative state-citizen relations, the perspective of the residents in Gellerupparken illuminate that the social effects of urban regeneration can be seen as paradoxical ones. Although Danish gentrification policies resonate with some sections of the residents, and can even count on the active participation of many residents in the self-administration of their neighborhood, the state's interventions only seem to strengthen its conflicts with other residents, as well as enhance the distance between resident groups.

A comparison with Prudentius sheds light on Cha's innovative fusion of Christian hagiography and the classical tradition with meditations on Korean history and women's bodies.

Known as “a nation of immigrants”, religion has often been seen as a way to integrate newcomers into its national project. That may have worked for European immigrants, who could become ‘White’; it has not worked so well for other ethnic migrants, who could not. The result is a diverse intersectionality that as the present moment is a source of significant religious, ethnic, and political division. Are calls for a vaguely defined “pluralism” enough? No, because deeper social factors are at work. These include increasing economic inequality, a complex split between socio-economic elites and the rest of the population, and shifts in the nature of the religious field. The latter include increased religious individualism, individually oriented prosperity theology, and a sectarian turn among American Evangelicals. Such factors make any simple call for pluralist engagement at best naïve. It is an open question whether or how social unity might be sufficiently reforged. © 2017 by the author.","Civil religion; Diversity; Global economy; Immigration; Inequality; Pluralism; Race; United States",,2-s2.0-85028758432

At the same time, state-enforced labor compulsions and restrictions are increasingly part and parcel of what scholars call neoliberal exceptionalism. This article argues that agricultural and neoliberal exceptionalisms are related, by tracing the historical genealogy and juridical production of a restrictive work status, the deportable temporary labor migrant, across political economies in the modern United States, from imperial construction in the Panama Canal Zone, to agriculture, to the knowledge economy. Contrary to existing notions of temporary work visas as a new form of unfreedom in neoliberalized advanced capitalist states, I show how the threat of deportation is older and rooted in the rise of the liberal regulatory state in a post-slavery, yet persistently racial capitalist political economy. The import of understanding this history of government intervention increases as the liberal regulatory state's coercive logics and practices intensify and circulate in agriculture and under a post-Fordist regime of accumulation, reproducing racial capitalism in the labor process. © 2016 The Author.

Through putting these contexts and experiences into dialogue, we identify common legal processes of punishment experiences across both contexts. Specifically, the U.S. legal system re-labels immigrants (as deportable noncitizens) and supermax prisoners (as dangerous gang offenders). This re-labeling begins a process of othering, which ends in categorical exclusions for both immigrants and supermax prisoners. As individuals experience this categorical exclusion, they cross multiple borders and boundaries—often against their will—moving from prison to detention center to other countries beyond the U.S. border, and from isolation to prison to “free” society. In both cases, the state action that subjects experience as punishment is civil and, therefore, nominally not punitive. Ultimately, excluded individuals find themselves in a space of legal nonexistence. By examining these common processes and experiences, we argue that a new kind of subject is revealed: a disintegrating subject (as opposed to a juridical or disciplinary subject) whose exclusion reinforces the power of the state. © 2017 Law and Society Association",,,2-s2.0-85027353507

So far, few mechanistic, semi-mechanistic or statistical solutions like dispersal constraints or propagule limitation have been applied. We evaluated a novel quasi-semi-mechanistic approach for regional scale models, using historical proximity variables (HPV) representing a state of the population in a given moment in the past. Our aim was to test the effects of addition of HPV sets of different minimal recentness, information capacity and the total number of variables on the quality of the species distribution model for Heracleum mantegazzianum on 116000 km2 in Poland. As environmental predictors, we used fragments of 103 1×1 km, world- wide, free-access rasters from WorldGrids.org. Single and ensemble models were computed using BIOMOD2 package 3.1.47 working in R environment 3.1.0. The addition of HPV improved the quality of single and ensemble models from poor to good and excellent. The quality was the highest for the variants with HPVs based on the distance from the most recent past occurrences. It was mostly affected by the algorithm type, but all HPV traits (minimal recentness, information capacity, model type or the number of the time periods) were significantly important determinants. The addition of HPVs improved the quality of current projections, raising the occurrence probability in regions where the species had occurred before. We conclude that HPV addition enables semi-realistic estimation of the rate of spread and can be applied to the short-term forecasting of invasive or declining species, which also break equal-dispersal probability assumptions. © 2017 Mędrzycki et al.

The colonisation of Europe’s first artificial surf reef (ASR) was investigated at Boscombe on the south coast of England (2009–2014) and compared with assemblages on existing natural and artificial habitats. The ASR consists of geotextile bags filled with sand located 220m offshore on a sandy sea bed at a depth of 0-5m. Successional changes in epibiota were recorded annually on differently orientated surfaces and depths using SCUBA diving and photography. Mobile faunal assemblages were sampled using Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV). Distinct stages in colonisation were observed, commencing with bryozoans and green algae which were replaced by red algae, hydroids and ascidians, however there were significant differences in assemblage structure with depth and orientation. The reef is being utilised by migratory, spawning and juvenile life-history stages of fish and invertebrates. The number of non-native species was larger than on natural reefs and other artificial habitats and some occupied a significant proportion of the structure. The accumulation of 180 benthic and mobile taxa, recorded to date, appears to have arisen from a locally rich and mixed pool of native and non-native species.

In this regards, our study explores the determinants of attraction of inward FDIs in China, at the county level. It focuses on the pharmaceutical industry and attempts to assess whether factors related to location advantages, agglomeration dynamics, information cost effects and environmental regulation costs affect foreign firms’ localization choices as well as invested amounts in that location. By means of discrete choice models, our paper confirms the findings of the prevalent literature about the positive effects of location advantages on pharmaceutical FDI attraction. Different from our expectations, a higher proportion of foreign enterprises do not stimulate significant effects on FDI localization, while preferential policies and sectoral agglomeration are positively correlated with the localization of pharmaceutical foreign firms. Finally, our results suggest that investing firms tend to avoid areas with strict environment regulation. © 2017 by the authors.

Land managers have a multitude of prioritization frameworks from which to choose, but the vast majority only consider entire species across a landscape rather than individual populations. Here, we discuss the Spatial Invasive Infestation and Priority Analysis (SIIPA) model (built in ESRI ArcGIS software), a customizable tool for rapid application of a prioritization framework to known invasive populations within a preserve, management area, or region. The SIIPA model is based on the framework provided in The Nature Conservancy's Draft Weed Management Plan and prioritizes invasive species based on four characteristics common to many other schema: 1) current extent of the species; 2) current and potential impacts of the species; 3) value of habitats the species infests; and 4) difficulty of control and establishing replacement species. We describe how the model can be customized to have different classes for each characteristic, different weights for each class, and include other characteristics. To demonstrate how the model performs at different scales and for different land management objectives, we consider the application of this model in three different case studies: The Nature Conservancy's Disney Wilderness Preserve in Kissimmee, Florida; the U.S. Forest Service's Apalachicola National Forest near Tallahassee, Florida; and the Heartland Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area in central Florida.

So far, there has been limited discussion about the temporal variation of Lessepsian populations, which may be a key to better understanding the establishment, persistence and spreading dynamics of these species. The objective of this study was, therefore, to develop an understanding of inter-annual variations of Lessepsian fish populations through investigating the effects of climate conditions. For this purpose, we evaluated the data obtained from the seasonal bottom trawl surveys conducted over the course of 12 years, from 2004 to 2015, at the infra-littoral zone of Iskenderun Bay. Our results indicated that Lessepsians constituted 27%, 62% and 85% of total teleost fishes in the number of species (LS-%), biomass (LW-%) and abundance (LN-%), respectively. The linear trends showed that the dominance of Lessepsian fishes increased with annual rates of 1.9 (p <.01, LS-%), 2.77 (p <.01, LW-%) and 1.43% (p <.05, LN-%) per year during the study period. In contrast, seasonal trend decomposition based on GAMMs revealed that the true shape of trends was non-linear. The majority of the new Lessepsians entered the study area after 2009 when warmer conditions prevailed. Those new invaders such as Nemipterus randalli, Pomadasys stridens and Apogon smithi successfully settled in a short time and remarkably altered the composition of fish assemblages after 2010.

Here, we test the effects of logging on functional traits and evolutionary relatedness, over and above effects that can be explained by changes in species richness alone. We hypothesised that strong environmental filtering will result in more clustered (under-dispersed) functional and phylogenetic structures within communities as logging intensity increases. We surveyed understorey plant communities at 180 locations across a logging intensity gradient from primary to repeatedly logged tropical lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia. For the 691 recorded plant taxa, we generated a phylogeny to assess plot-level phylogenetic relatedness. We quantified 10 plant traits known to respond to disturbance and affect ecosystem functioning, and tested the influence of logging on functional and phylogenetic structure. We found no significant effect of forest canopy loss or road configuration on species richness. By contrast, both functional dispersion and phylogenetic dispersion (net relatedness index) showed strong gradients from clustered towards more randomly assembled communities at higher logging intensity, independent of variation in species richness. Moreover, there was a significant nonlinear shift in the trait dispersion relationship above a logging intensity threshold of c. 65% canopy loss (±17% CL). All functional traits showed significant phylogenetic signals, suggesting broad concordance between functional and phylogenetic dispersion, at least below the logging intensity threshold. Synthesis. We found a strong logging signal in the functional and phylogenetic structure of understorey plant communities, over and above species richness, but this effect was opposite to that predicted. Logging increased, rather than decreased, functional and phylogenetic dispersion in understorey plant communities. This effect was particularly pronounced for functional response traits, which directly link disturbance with plant community reassembly. Our study provides novel insights into the way logging affects understorey plant communities in tropical rain forest and highlights the importance of trait-based approaches to improve our understanding of the broad range of logging-associated impacts. © 2017 The Authors.

It finds that, in part due to the competing public service and commercial ideologies of the BBC, Torchwood was a glocalised text from the beginning, despite its positioning as Welsh, which then became glocalised again in series 4.

Therefore, this study qualitatively investigates the various readings produced by audience members in the US, UK and Canada, as well as transnational fans who are long-term residents of one of those nations with a focus upon the interactions between fan and national cultural capital. The study finds that the audience is pseudo-reflexive when it comes to interpretation; though all express an awareness and acceptance that national identity is constructed and fluid, they still express an underlying essentialism when discussing national identity in the context of the series.","Fan cultural capital; Glocalisation; National cultural capital (Source: Unesco Thesaurus); National identity; Telefantasy; Transnational television",,2-s2.0-85021426516

The two primary objectives were to assess the impact of this invasive plant on floral diversity as well as its potential for spread into new areas. A quadrat based assessment was conducted to estimate the impact of M. micrantha on floral diversity at 69 terrestrial sites which were subsequently grouped on the basis of the infestation size of M. micrantha. A significant reduction in the number of native species with increasing infestation size of M. micrantha was noted. The clay component of soil texture along major roadsides, as found in this study, significantly favoured extra-large growth of M. micrantha in contrast to the sandy loam soil type which generally favours their luxuriant growth in forest areas. The ‘distance from road network’ analysis revealed that most of the large infestations were along highways and that the satellite infestations of M. micrantha did not readily progress into larger infestations along minor roads. Application of remote sensing technology identified the vulnerability of the ‘sparse vegetation’ land use class for future spread of infestation. Although majority of the infested sites comprised of satellite populations with very few extra-large patches, the rapid rate of urbanization within cities highlights the need for ‘early detection and rapid response’ to prevent large scale invasion in future. © 2015, The National Academy of Sciences, India.","Invasion; Land use; Mikania micrantha H.B.K; Native species richness; Road network; Soil",,2-s2.0-85026270699

This study investigated the possibility to sterilize male individuals of this species in order to use the sterile male release technique in controlling these invasive populations. The technique can be adopted in aquaculture facilities as well to prevent new introductions by incidental releases or escapes. In order to produce sterile individuals a cold and pressure shock protocol were used on fertilized eggs to create triploid individuals. The cold shock did not result in triploid individuals while 54% triploids were obtained from pressure shock, the remaining individuals being aneuploid. The triploid and control larvae were reared for more than one year and the control larvae had a greater length after 7 and 9 months, their weight did not differ. At metamorphosis no difference in length and weight was found between the two groups. The subadult bullfrogs from both groups showed 9 months post metamorphosis a similar scaled body mass index but lower than individuals living in the wild. The pressure shock protocol needs further refinement in respect to the timing of the shock. Further research on the reproductive behavior of these sterile frogs is necessary to evaluate the possible use in the sterile male release technique. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 REABIC.","Cold shock; Hydrostatic shock; Invasive species; Rana catesbeiana; Sterile male release technique; Triploidy",,2-s2.0-85027722512

In this study, a noxious invasive riparian plant, Alternanthera philoxeroides, and its native congener, Alternanthera sessilis were cultivated in three different riparian soils with different statuses of disturbance by cow manure addition. After harvest, we measured plant morphological traits including the internode length (INL), rooted node number (RNN), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass ratio (LMR), and physiological traits including the maximal quantum yield (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll content (Ct), leaf nitrogen content (Nmass), leaf carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio), leaf construction cost per leaf area (CCarea), and non-structural carbohydrate content (NSCC). Fertilization was found to improve the performances of most traits for both species similarly. Both species shared some similarities in trait values of SLA, LMR, CCarea and NSCC, and trait plasticity in NSCC in unfertilized sediments and SLA, LMR, C/N ratio, and CCarea in fertilized sediments. Moreover, compared to A. sessilis, A. philoxeroides showed some advantages in trait values of RNN in unfertilized sediments and Ct, Nmass, and C/N ratio in the most fertile treatments, and trait plasticity in INL, RNN, SLA, Ct, Nmass, and CCarea across different sediments.

The invasion process of A. dealbata is mainly favoured by environmental disturbances. However, this species is currently invading unaltered plant communities and environmental factors influencing its spread in these ecosystems remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the A. dealbata growth related to environmental factors in non-altered shrublands and pine forests in North-Western of the Iberian Peninsula. Permanent sampling plots were placed along the invasion edge in each plant community and height and stem diameter increments were recorded on labelled A. dealbata individuals throughout two years. The number of new A. dealbata saplings was recorded at the end of the study. Environmental factors such as physicochemical soil properties, native vegetation cover and plot features were evaluated in each sampling plot in order to determinate their effect on the A. dealbata growth. Our results showed a different growth pattern of A. dealbata depending on the studied plant community. Pine forests had A. dealbata individuals with significantly higher height and diameter increments and higher number of new A. dealbata individuals than shrublands. Additionally, results also showed a clear seasonality effect on A. dealbata growth that was stimulated in spring in pine forests, while it did not variate along the year in shrublands. Regarding environmental parameters influencing the growth of A. dealbata, we found a negative effect by the photosynthetically active radiation and plot orientation, but also a positive effect by soil potassium content and plot elevation. However, our results indicated that other environmental factors not evaluated here might be also influencing. We conclude that A. dealbata can invade unaltered areas and the intensity of the invasion depends on the ecosystem. The natural shrubland could be an effective barrier to slow down the rapid invasion of A. dealbata. These results contribute to new knowledge of A. dealbata colonization without help of environmental disturbances in the field, which may help to define hot-priority areas and stablish new control strategies. Thus, we suggest that the management of A. dealbata in pine forests should receive preferential treatment on South-Western Europe. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Acacia dealbata; Invasive plants; Photosynthetically active radiation; Pine forests; Shrublands; Soil nutrients","Ecosystems; Forestry; Soils; Acacia dealbata; Invasive plants; Photosynthetically active radiation; Pine forest; Shrublands; Soil nutrients; Ecology; biological invasion; colonization; coniferous forest; environmental disturbance; environmental factor; evergreen tree; growth rate; invasive species; photosynthetically active radiation; plant community; seasonality; shrubland; soil nutrient; vegetation cover; Iberian Peninsula; Acacia dealbata",2-s2.0-85019894700

Building upon multispecies ethnography, science and technology studies interrogations of nature/culture divides and the practical work of classification, this article explores the indeterminacy – the very plasticity – of the category of ‘species’ as it is engaged in seriousness and irony, with living and nonliving bodies. First, I draw on participant observation at a nonprofit marine institute laboratory in California to trace the travels of plastic-creatures through attempts to disentangle them in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. Here volunteers sort tiny plastic bits from animal ones under the microscope, enacting material boundaries as they decide what gets counted as life (not plastic) and what does not (plastic). Second, I follow movements of plastic-creatures through public education campaigns, paying particular attention to assumptions about belonging and agency enacted with assumptions about whether and when plastic-species should or should not meet. I argue that the ‘danger’ of plastic relationships lurks not in associations but in the very categories used to know and live with forms of plastic and forms of life, in the kinds of belonging that emerge with kinds of materials, and in the failure to recognize the impossibility of their separation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","care; classification; environment; materiality; motion; multispecies ethnography; natureculture; science studies",,2-s2.0-85029420482

This observational study was conducted in a rapidly urbanizing Indian metropolis. It examined the native and exotic species separately as a function of richness and abundance of two focal exotic species, namely Mikania micrantha and Alternanthera philoxeroides, to find support for the hypothesis that an overall native-exotic relationship does not provide a true picture of the community composition. The richness of exotic species did not turn out to be a good predictor for the native-exotic richness relationship even after focal exotics were considered. However, when the richness components were analysed separately, Poisson log-linear models identified M. micrantha as the community-dominant, by virtue of its extensive cover. Neither soil resource availability nor the presence of other exotics had any influence on native species richness. The negative relationship of M. micrantha cover with other exotic species could be associated with a lower risk of native species loss in a community invaded by multiple exotic species. M. micrantha appeared to be a ‘passenger’ of habitat alteration, but was likely to become a ‘driver’ once it attains high covers due to its reported superior competitive abilities. Therefore, in tropical areas there is a need to prioritize management initiatives in order to identify the dominant invader species in a community and effectively manage the dominant-homogenized plots. © 2017, The Ecological Society of Japan.","Alternanthera philoxeroides; Invasion; Mikania micrantha; Tropical; Urban","abundance; angiosperm; community composition; competitive ability; invasive species; metropolitan area; native species; plant community; resource availability; species richness; tropical region; urban area; vine; weed; India; Alternanthera philoxeroides; Mikania micrantha",2-s2.0-85020526904

Seasonal catch per unit effort, sex, size, and color were determined and the role of habitat variables, including temperature, salinity, water depth, and substrate, were evaluated. Seasonal catch per unit effort was highest in the fall (October-December), followed by summer (July-September), spring (April-June) and winter (January-March). Few crabs were captured when water temperature dropped below 5 °C. Crabs captured at sites with very fine sand were larger than those captured on other sediment types. Females comprised 73% of the total catch of 7,822 crabs. Only 57 individuals exceeded 70 mm carapace width. Females were larger (mean = 51.7 mm) than males (mean = 48.8 mm). Green-phase crabs comprised 56.8% and red-phase crabs 43.2% of the catch. Green-phase crabs were significantly smaller (mean = 48.1 mm) than red-phase crabs (mean = 53.6 mm, P < 0.0001). Red-phase females were most common in the spring and green-phase in the fall, whereas red-phase males were most common in the spring and fall and green-phase in the summer. A yellow-phase category is proposed as a distinct intermediate between red and green phases. Merits of various types of traps and of bait were evaluated based on different trapping requirements and goals.

To date, nothing is known about the environmental factors that constrain its distribution and there is only inconclusive information about its location of origin. We used reciprocal distribution models (RDM) to assess invasion risk of F. foetida across Brazil and to identify source regions in its native range. We also tested the niche conservatism hypothesis using Principal Components Analyses and statistical tests of niche equivalency and similarity between its native and invaded ranges. For RDM analysis, we built two models using maximum entropy, one using records in the native range to predict the invaded distribution (forward-Ecological Niche Model or forward-ENM) and one using records in the invaded range to predict the native distribution (reverse-ENM). Forward-ENM indicated invasion risk in the Cerrado region and the innermost region of the Atlantic Forest, however, failed to predict the current occurrence in southern Brazil. Reverse-ENM supported an existing hypothesis that F. foetida originated in the Orinoco river basin, Amazon basin and Caribbean islands. Prediction errors in the RDM and multivariate analysis indicated that the species expanded its realized niche in Brazil. The niche similarity test further suggested that the niche differences are because of differences in habitat availability between the two ranges, not because of evolutionary changes. We hypothesize that physiological pre-adaptation (especially, the crassulacean acid metabolism), human-driven propagule pressure and high competitive ability are the main factors determining the current spatial distribution of the species in Brazil.

With this study, we ask: What are the climate and landscape conditions conducive to woody plant encroachment at the landscape scale, and how has historical climate variation affected tree recruitment in subalpine meadows over time? We measured density of encroaching trees across 340 subalpine meadows in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and used generalized additive models (GAMs) to determine the relationship between landscape-scale patterns of encroachment and meadow environmental properties. We determined ages of trees in 30 survey meadows, used observed climate and GAMs to model the relationship between timing of recruitment and climate since the early 1900s, and extrapolated recruitment patterns into the future using downscaled climate scenarios. Encroachment was high among meadows with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon var. murrayana (Balf.) Engelm.) in the immediate vicinity, at lower elevations, with physical conditions favoring strong soil drying, and with maximum temperatures above or below average. Climatic conditions during the year of germination were unimportant, with tree recruitment instead depending on a 3-yr seed production period prior to germination and a 6-yr seedling establishment period following germination. Recruitment was high when the seed production period had high snowpack, and when the seedling establishment period had warm summer maximum temperatures, high summer precipitation, and high snowpack. Applying our temporal model to downscaled output from four global climate models indicated that the average meadow will shift to forest by the end of the 21st century. Sierra Nevada meadow encroachment by conifers is ubiquitous and associated with climate conditions increasingly favorable for tree recruitment, which will lead to substantial changes in subalpine meadows and the ecosystem services they provide. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","climate variation; lodgepole pine; Pinus contorta; recruitment; Sierra Nevada, California; subalpine meadow; tree establishment; woody encroachment; Yosemite National Park","biodiversity; climate change; climate conditions; climate variation; coniferous tree; ecosystem service; ground-based measurement; landscape change; meadow; recruitment (population dynamics); remote sensing; seed production; seedling establishment; subalpine environment; wood; woody plant; California; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Yosemite National Park; Coniferophyta; Pinus contorta",2-s2.0-85028616284

Documenting spatiotemporal variability in ecological patterns can yield insights into the key processes influencing the distributions of species and structure of communities. Many previous studies conducted in natural habitats have recorded systematic shifts in assemblage structure along broad-scale latitudinal gradients, largely because of individual species’ thermal affinities. However, it remains unclear as to whether similar patterns occur in artificial habitats, where patterns could be decoupled from natural processes. In this study, we examined patterns of spatial variability in the structure of sessile invertebrate assemblages in coastal infrastructure at multiple scales, including along a large-scale latitudinal gradient in Western Australia (WA). We deployed settlement panel arrays to sample invertebrate assemblages at 5 regions (in 2 seasons) along a latitudinal gradient spanning about 16° and > 2000 km along the coast of WA. As sea temperature co-varies predictably with latitude in this system, the study also encompassed a temperature gradient of about 10 °C. We examined spatiotemporal variability in several assemblage-level metrics, including total biomass, total cover, taxonomic richness and multivariate structure, as well as variability patterns for individual taxa. Unlike assemblages associated with natural habitats along the WA coastline, sessile invertebrate assemblages on coastal infrastructure did not vary systematically with latitude/temperature. Assemblage structure demonstrated little predictability at the regional scale, driven by processes including variability in temperature and adjacent species pools. Rather local-scale variability (and presumably processes and conditions acting at this scale) was far more important. This is an important consideration for coastal managers as local factors (e.g. the design of coastal infrastructure, human activities, hydrodynamic processes and propagule pressure) are likely to be important determinants of ecological pattern, with implications for the spread and establishment of non-indigenous species, biofouling and general ecological structure and functioning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biofouling; Coastal infrastructure; Non-indigenous species; Temperature","artificial ecosystem; biofouling; biomass; coastal zone; community dynamics; community structure; infrastructure; invasive species; invertebrate; latitudinal gradient; sessile species; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; species richness; temperature gradient; Australia; Western Australia; Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85020180610

Previous research on sessile epifauna suggests that artificial habitats act as a refuge for nonindigenous species, which results in highly homogenous communities across locations. However, vertebrate assemblages that live in association with artificial habitats are poorly understood. Here, we quantify the biodiversity of small, cryptic (henceforth “cryptobenthic”) fishes from marine dock pilings across six locations over 35° of latitude from Maine to Panama. We also compare assemblages from dock pilings to natural habitats in the two southernmost locations (Panama and Belize). Our results suggest that the biodiversity patterns of cryptobenthic fishes from dock pilings follow a Latitudinal Diversity Gradient (LDG), with average local and regional diversity declining sharply with increasing latitude. Furthermore, a strong correlation between community composition and spatial distance suggests distinct regional assemblages of cryptobenthic fishes. Cryptobenthic fish assemblages from dock pilings in Belize and Panama were less diverse and had lower densities than nearby reef habitats. However, dock pilings harbored almost exclusively native species, including two species of conservation concern absent from nearby natural habitats. Our results suggest that, in contrast to sessile epifaunal assemblages on artificial substrates, artificial marine habitats can harbor diverse, regionally characteristic assemblages of vertebrates that follow macroecological patterns that are well documented for natural habitats. We therefore posit that, although dock pilings cannot function as a replacement for natural habitats, dock pilings may provide cost-effective means to preserve native vertebrate biodiversity, and provide a habitat that can be relatively easily monitored to track the status and trends of fish biodiversity in highly urbanized coastal marine environments. © 2017 The Authors.

Location: Czech Republic, central Europe. Methods: Nineteen plots with strong dominance of the invader were compared to 20 plots with native deciduous trees on sites with similar conditions. Species richness was compared using marginal models, species composition and the distribution of species traits by ordination analyses. Functional relationships between the three groups of organisms were investigated using a path analysis. Results: Only minor differences in species richness between invaded and uninvaded plots were detected for plants and birds, but the invaded stands hosted significantly fewer species of nocturnal Lepidoptera. On the contrary, all three groups differed in species composition and in the distribution of traits between the invaded and uninvaded stands. Nitrophilous plants, supported by human disturbances, were more represented in the invaded stands, while habitat specialist birds preferred uninvaded forest. Within nocturnal Lepidoptera, species of open habitats and fast life cycle preferred the invaded stands, and forest and canopy species and habitat generalists of larger sizes preferred the uninvaded stands. Path analysis showed a minor effect of R. pseudoacacia on the numbers of plants which were unrelated to species richness at higher trophic levels. However, R. pseudoacacia had a negative direct effect on nocturnal Lepidoptera, contributing to a weak negative indirect impact on birds. Main conclusions: The impacts of R. pseudoacacia on species richness differed across the trophic levels, questioning the existence of simple cascading effects as a consequence of its invasion. Invasive plants do not always reduce the diversity of species per se, but cause shifts in species composition by replacing some of the pre-invasion biota by species with traits enabling tolerance to the invaded habitat. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biodiversity; ecosystem-level approach; impact; invasive trees; native species; Robinia pseudoacacia","biodiversity; biological invasion; community composition; deciduous tree; dominance; ecosystem approach; functional role; geographical distribution; invasive species; native species; path analysis; species richness; trophic level; Czech Republic; Aves; Lepidoptera; Robinia pseudoacacia; Tracheophyta",2-s2.0-85028543976

However., the area of origin of TEP C. riisei remains unknown and its potential invasive status has not been addressed yet. We evaluated geographical scenarios for the colonization of the Colombian TEP by conducting phylogeographical analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial sequences of 306 individual specimens from across the species’ (native/non-native) range and applying hypothesis-specific operational criteria. Additionally., we assessed whether C. riisei has to be considered an invasive species based on the previously proposed ‘unified framework for biological invasions’.

In contrast, we could not identify genetic differentiation and significant isolation by distance (IBD) between Colombian TEP and Tropical Atlantic populations. C. riisei might have been introduced from the Atlantic into the Colombian TEP, possibly via the Panama Canal.

We found that species, or groups of species, responded differently to the effects of urbanization, roads, and proximity to conspecific populations. Occurrences of halophyte species were best predicted by road variables; halophytes were more commonly associated with major roads such as interstates and federal highways, road types that are likely to receive greater applications of de-icing salts. Several species were associated with proximity to Chicago. Proximity to Chicago may serve as a proxy for the degree of urbanization; or alternatively, may reflect a pattern of outward dispersal from an initial establishment point in the urban center.

To assess factors influencing plant communities on San Clemente Island, USA, we conducted an islandwide vegetation survey in which we measured plant species richness and percent cover of native and non-native plants, as well as physical environmental variables, soil chemical properties, abundance of soil microbial functional groups (e.g., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF]), and a human disturbance variable (distance to road). We found that total plant species richness decreased with increasing non-native plant cover, soil pH, and AMF abundance. Native plant cover increased with increasing distance to a major paved road and decreased with increasing soil moisture and pH. Non-native plant cover decreased with increasing distance to a major paved road and increased with increasing soil moisture, AMF abundance, and from southwest to northeast, a geographic/climatic gradient that represents increasing moisture. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination further illustrated that trends in plant community composition were correlated with elevation, distance to a major paved road, and soil moisture, organic matter, and ammonium. These results suggest complex effects of physical environmental, soil chemical, and human-related factors on plant community structure on an oceanic island, and moreover, that different factors affect cover of native and non-native plants. Notably, our observation of apparent moisture limitation of non-native plants suggests that, in some contexts, drought conditions can limit plant invasions and may even represent an opportunity for efficient control or eradication of invasive plants. The apparent negative effect of non-native plants on native plant cover and overall plant species richness represents a conservation concern for native biodiversity on oceanic islands and suggests the potential for community reassembly as invasive species increasingly dominate due to anthropogenic disturbances. © 2017 Paudel et al.","Climate; Disturbance; Island; Plant cover; Roads; Soil microbes; Species richness; Topography",,2-s2.0-85030246742

For invasive plants, current management recommendations to control local population growth are often based on data from a limited number of populations per species, and the assumption of stable population structure (asymptotic dynamics). However, spatial variation in population dynamics and deviation from a stable structure may affect these recommendations, calling into question their generality across populations of an invasive species. Here, I focused on intraspecific variation in population dynamics and investigated management recommendations generated by demographic models across 37 populations of a short-lived, invasive perennial herb (Lupinus polyphyllus). Models that relied on the proportional perturbations of vital rates (asymptotic elasticities) indicated an essential role for plant survival in long-term population dynamics. The rank order of elasticities for different vital rates (survival, growth, retrogression, fecundity) varied little among the 37 study populations regardless of population status (increasing or declining asymptotically). Summed elasticities for fecundity increased, while summed elasticities for survival decreased with increasing long-term population growth rate. Transient dynamics differed from asymptotic dynamics, but were qualitatively similar among populations, that is, depending on the initial size structure, populations tended to either increase or decline in density more rapidly than predicted by asymptotic growth rate. These findings indicate that although populations are likely to exhibit transient dynamics, management recommendations based on asymptotic elasticities for vital rates might be to some extent generalised across established populations of a given short-lived invasive plant species. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG Switzerland.","Demography; Elasticity; Invasive species; Management; Population model; Transient dynamics","demography; fecundity; growth rate; herb; intraspecific variation; invasive species; perennial plant; population dynamics; population growth; population modeling; population structure; size structure; spatial variation; Lupinus polyphyllus",2-s2.0-85020242981

These costs need to be considered when assessing control options and developing public policy. We investigate the preferences and willingness to pay of the UK general public for a range of forest disease control measures using a choice experiment with a sample of 605 people. Respondents were relatively well informed about general tree disease-related issues, such as causes and general measures to minimise the risk of disease spread. They were less knowledgeable about specific tree diseases, with Dutch elm disease and chalara ash dieback being the most well known. We find that disease control programmes in publicly-owned forests and forests owned by charitable trusts are more likely to be supported by the public than equivalent control programmes in privately-owned and/or commercial forests. The nature of scientific uncertainty about diseases does not affect peoples’ preferences for disease control measures significantly. Higher respondent income, greater ex-ante knowledge about tree diseases, and more frequent visits to forests are correlated with greater willingness to support publicly-funded tree disease control programmes in forests. Better knowledge about tree diseases also improves the clarity of respondents’ choices.

It involves rearing genetically modified samples of the invasive species and introducing them into the environment to alter the sex ratio of the invasive population. The paper is devoted to finding the optimal implementation of the TYC eradication strategy of an invasive species as well as a modified, potentially more cost-effective strategy. The modified TYC strategy (MTYC) eliminates one round of exposure to sex hormones compared to the TYC strategy. After introducing both strategies, the optimal control problems for each are formulated. The two strategies are compared through numerical simulations.

Benyus’s approach, I show, promotes biomimicry as a science of nature in which nature is treated as a source for innovative design that can be emulated in technological apparatus. Such an approach is problematic, I argue, for its valorization of organic form, which results in both a rigid system of ethics demanding absolute separation of nature and technology. By contrast, Oxman’s work, I show, pursues biomimicry as a technology of nature. In so doing, I argue, it mobilizes a neomaterialist style of interaction with organic materials that ultimately enjoins a radically different way of thinking nature, technology, and technoethics. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","biomimicry; design; ethics; nature; technology",,2-s2.0-85026859317

Given the heterogeneity across aridland ecosystems, it is important to understand how trends and drivers of fire vary, so management can be customized accordingly. We examined historical trends and quantified the relative importance of and interactions among multiple drivers of fire patterns across five aridland ecoregions in southeastern California from 1970 to 2010. Fire frequency increased across all ecoregions for the first couple decades, and declined or plateaued since the 1990s; but area burned continued to increase in some regions. The relative importance of anthropogenic and biophysical drivers varied across ecoregions, with both direct and indirect influences on fire. Anthropogenic variables were equally important as biophysical variables, but some contributed indirectly, presumably via their influence on annual grass distribution and abundance. Grass burned disproportionately more than other cover types, suggesting that addressing exotics may be the key to fire management and conservation in much of the area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecoregion; Exotic grass; Grass-fire cycle; Land use; Structural equation modeling","anthropogenic effect; arid region; biophysics; conservation management; desert; ecoregion; fire management; grass; heterogeneity; land use change; parameterization; California; United States; Poaceae",2-s2.0-85019539836

Drawing from Michel Foucault's discussion of the confession, this article complicates and extends this analysis. First, it situates memoirs by Elizabeth Smart, Amanda Berry and Gena DeJesus, Jaycee Dugard, Michelle Knight, and Josefina Rivera as examples of the Foucauldian sexual confession. It then maps the ways memoirs enable the authors to voice their understanding of the social and economic factors that both gave rise to their plight and inform media discussions that blame them for their suffering.

We used Mississippi River Basin fish community data collected by the Long Term Resource Monitoring program and the Missouri Department of Conservation to evaluate possible interaction between Asian Carp and native fishes. Results from two decades of long-term monitoring throughout much of the Mississippi River suggest that Silver Carp relative abundance has increased while relative abundance (Bigmouth Buffalo [F 3, 8240 = 6.44, P&lt;0.01] and Gizzard Shad [F 3, 8240 = 31.04, P&lt;0.01]) and condition (Bigmouth Buffalo [slope = -0.11; t = -1.71; P = 0.1014] and Gizzard Shad [slope = -0.39; t = -3.02; P = 0.0073]) of native planktivores have declined. Floodplain lake qualitative evaluations yielded similar results; floodplain lake fish communities were likely altered (i.e., reductions in native species) by Silver Carp. Furthermore, laboratory experiments corroborated field evidence; Silver Carp negatively influence native planktivores through competition for prey (all comparisons, P &gt; 0.05). To this end, this study provides evidence that Silver Carp are likely adversely influencing native fishes; however, mere presence of Silver Carp in the system does not induce deleterious effects on native fishes. To the best of our knowledge, this evaluation is the first to describe the effects of Asian Carp throughout the Mississippi River Basin and could be used to reduce the effects of Asian Carp on native biota through an integrated pest management program as suggested by congressional policy. Despite the simplicity of the data analyzed and approach used, this study provides a framework for beginning to identify the interactions of invasive fish pests on native fishes (i.e., necessary first step of integrated pest management). However, knowledge gaps remain. We suggest future efforts should conduct more in depth analyses (i.e., multivariate statistical approaches) that investigate the influence on all native species. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

However, there has not been a large-scale attempt to determine how international pet trade and national and international governmental regulations have played a part in colonization, and when the species appeared in different areas. We describe the changes in regulations that led the international pet trade market to shift to Mexico, then used international trade data to determine how many parakeets were commercially imported each year and where those individuals originated. We also quantified the recent increases in Monk Parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) sightings in Mexico in both the scientific literature and in citizen science reports. We describe the timeline of increased reports to understand the history of nonnative Monk Parakeets in Mexico. As in other areas where the species has colonized, the main mode of transport is through the international pet trade. Over half a million Monk Parakeets were commercially imported to Mexico during 2000–2015, with the majority of importation (90%) occurring in 2008–2014, and almost all (98%) were imported from Uruguay. The earliest record of a free-flying Monk Parakeet was observed during 1994–1995 in Mexico City, but sightings of the parakeets did not become geographically widespread in either the scientific literature or citizen science databases until 2012–2015. By 2015, parakeets had been reported in 97 cities in Mexico. Mexico City has consistently seen steep increases in reporting since this species was first reported in Mexico. Here we find that both national and international legal regulations and health concerns drove a rise and fall in Monk Parakeet pet trade importations, shortly followed by widespread sightings of feral parakeets across Mexico. Further monitoring of introduced Monk Parakeet populations in Mexico is needed to understand the establishment, growth and spread of introduced populations. © 2017 Hobson et al.

We examined how both dispersal-related geospatial characteristics and environmental factors influence an ongoing invasion of wetlands in a south-central Florida ranchland by non-native apple snails (Pomacea maculata, Ampullariidae). We found P. maculata in 73 (43%) of a random set of 171 wetlands in 2014. We used model selection to evaluate multiple hypotheses of predictors of P. maculata occurrence in 95 wetlands with standing water, including spatially-explicit distances in ditches from wetlands to the presumed entry point, Euclidean (overland) distances, presence/absence of ditches in wetlands, and environmental variables (e.g. pH). We also performed a 5-month field experiment in 20 wetlands to evaluate if snail absence was associated with conditions that limit survival and growth (i.e. unfavorable habitats). Snail occurrence was primarily associated with presence of ditches in wetlands and more neutral wetland pH. These variables more plausibly explained snail occurrence than did Euclidean (overland) distance and minimum ditch travel (rectilinear) distance from propagule sources (a major waterway). Wetland pH best explained survival and growth under the experimental conditions. We found no evidence that prior occupancy by conspecifics affected survival and growth, suggesting that dispersal limitation may contribute to lack of occupancy of wetlands, despite suitable pH. Our study supports man-made conduits as facilitators of dispersal by non-native species, where environmental characteristics (here pH) then also affect colonization within habitats.

The commercial importance of polychaetes and sipunculids, that has increased in the early 2000's because of its use as a food source for the aquaculture sector and a growing demand of worms for use as sea angling bait, seems to be declining nowadays. In Portugal bait harvesting from natural populations became insufficient to meet market demands and as a result, polychaetes and sipunculids have been imported in recent years. Due to this it was important to know the ways of the live bait import to Portugal, and to assess the risk of introduction of non-indigenous species associated to that live bait trade. The origin and quantities of imported live bait were determined by examining the landing's records at Lisbon airport, from two periods: 2002–2003 and 2012–2015. Live worms imported to Portugal arrived almost exclusively from China, USA and Vietnam. Monthly import data and bait registers at fish auction landings were significantly correlated, showing that bait captures and imports are directly related to higher bait demand. In addition, the risk of live bait's importation as an introduction vector for non-indigenous species was evaluated by examining the bait boxes content. Five worm species were identified in bait boxes with foreign species: Glycera dibranchiata, Namalycastis rhodochorde, Perinereis cultrifera, Perinereis linea, and Sipunculus (Sipunculus) nudus. The examination of bait boxes in Portugal suggested that there is a low risk of associated hitchhiker species introduction and dissemination, mostly because of packaging procedures, which should be advised.

Their size, estuarine distribution, and diet preference for crustaceans and mollusks in their native range suggest that these shrimp may have significant impacts on a variety of species native to the northern Gulf of Mexico and Southeastern US. However, to date no studies have investigated this possibility. We examined tiger shrimp prey choice in mesocosm predation experiments. In these experiments, blue crabs and polychaetes exhibited the lowest survival rates (<25%) while small flat fish, grass shrimp, and juvenile penaeid shrimp exhibited the highest survival (>60%). In separate video observations tiger shrimp searched for prey by probing the sediment; consequently, juvenile blue crabs Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, 1896 that were buried were easily located and consumed. This suggests that demersal or buried prey are more likely to be consumed than species occurring on the sediment surface or in the water column. It is currently unknown how often tiger shrimp may encounter juvenile blue crabs, as tiger shrimp are still rare and adult tiger shrimp are typically caught on commercial shrimping grounds.

This study evaluated the seed longevity and physical dormancy (PY)-break of two species of Dimorphandra endemic to Brazilian biodiversity hotspots. Longevity was tested in situ, by burying seeds in their natural habitats (12 months), and ex situ, by storage in a cold chamber (5°C; 24 months). Seeds were taken at regular intervals to assess germinability at 30°C (12 h photoperiod) using intact and scarified seeds. Intact seeds (freshly collected, and after 12 months storage) were analysed using scanning electron microscopy. The germinability of freshly collected seeds of both species reached approximately 10% for intact seeds and >85% for scarified seeds. Cold storage maintained seed viability in both species, and broke dormancy for 35% of D. wilsonii seeds. After 12 months, only 55% (for D. exaltata) and 41% (for D. wilsonii) of the buried seeds were recovered; more than 90% of which remained viable in both species. Seeds gradually overcame PY during burial, with a higher germination increase for D. wilsonii (71%) than D. exaltata (32%). Dimorphandra exaltata seeds did not show clear structural changes after cold storage although D. wilsonii seeds evidently experience an increase in the depth of fracture lines. Burial promoted deep seed coat changes in both species, more intense in D. wilsonii, indicating that temperature and humidity variations throughout the year are among the main factors releasing Dimorphandra seeds from PY. The seeds of both studied species overcame PY during burial and are able to form small persistent soil seed banks. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Atlantic Forest; Cerrado; scanning electron microscopy; seed burial; seed germination; soil seed bank",,2-s2.0-85025473140

The most effective control of exotic annual grass is usually achieved with pre-emergent herbicides; however, species seeded simultaneously with these herbicides will likely experience nontarget damage. Thus, seeding often occurs 1 yr later to reduce herbicide effects to seeded vegetation, but by this time annual grasses may already be reinvading and limiting revegetation success. Activated carbon can be used to protect seeded species from herbicide damage because it has a high absorption capacity that can deactivate many herbicides. A pot study in a grow-room suggested that a pod containing activated carbon and seeds, herbicide protection pods (HPPs), may allow desired species to be seeded simultaneously with annual grass control with the preemergent herbicide imazapic. However, HPPs have not been field tested. We evaluated two seeding treatments (crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum [Fisch.] Schuft.) incorporated into HPPs and bare seed, simultaneously with an imazapic application to control annual grasses at two sites invaded by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) and medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae [L.[ Nevski). Crested wheatgrass abundance was 300% greater with HPPs compared with bare seed in late June. Imazapic application reduced exotic annual grass density at both sites by approximately half. These results suggest that HPPs can be used to allow desired species to be seeded simultaneously with imazapic application. This will allow seeded species a longer window to become established before experiencing pressure from exotic annuals and enable a single-entry approach compared with multiple entries currently employed to revegetate annual grass - invaded rangelands. Though further field testing is needed, in particular with multiple species and higher herbicide applications rates, these results suggest that HPPs could improve our ability to restore and revegetate exotic annual grass - invaded rangelands. © Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.","cheatgrass; herbicide protection pods; imazapic; medusahead; restoration; seed technologies","Agropyron cristatum; Agropyron desertorum; Bromus tectorum; Poaceae; Taeniatherum; Taeniatherum caput-medusae",2-s2.0-85028365943

The samples were screened for the presence or absence of DNA from nine plant species using PCR and plant species-specific primers for the rbcL gene of chloroplast DNA. In the red-eared slider, our analysis identified seven plant species in the fecal DNA samples of adults and three plant species in those of young individuals. In Reeves’ pond turtle, our analysis identified two plant species from adult fecal samples and one species from those of young individuals. Thus, adult red-eared sliders consume a greater range of plants than young red-eared sliders or Reeves’ pond turtles. Both turtle species, independently of age, consumed lotus plants and were likely to cause feeding damage to lotus roots. Considering the plant species detected in adult red-eared sliders and these plant habitats, we suggest that this adult turtle is likely to travel between the agricultural canals and the lotus root paddies.

The American mink (Neovison vison), native to North America, is an important invasive species in the Iberian Peninsula. Here, we used mitochondrial DNA sequences data to investigate the genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure of invasive versus native populations of this species. We also evaluated whether genetic diversity in invasive populations could be explained by the genetic characteristics of the native sources from which they derived. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two major lineages in the native range, which indicated a clear separation between western and eastern populations. On the contrary, we found no evidence of genetic structure in the invasive range. This was probably the result of the diverse origins of the released specimens and the rapid expansion and encounters of the introduced populations. We detected spatial mixing of both North American lineages in several sampling localities of the north central area of the Iberian Peninsula, giving rise to high levels of genetic diversity in some areas compared to North American populations. This could potentially lead to higher fitness of these individuals and thus increase the population viability and invasiveness of this species.

The somatic signal detection task (SSDT) provides a behavioural marker by which to clarify the spatial extent of such visuotactile interactions in peripersonal space. Whilst previous evidence suggests a limit to the spatial extent over which visual input can distort the perception of tactile stimulation during the rubber hand illusion, the spatial boundaries of light-induced tactile sensations are not known. In a repeated measures design, 41 participants completed the SSDT with the light positioned 1 cm (near), 17.5 cm (mid) or 40 cm (far) from the tactile stimulation. In the far condition, the light did not affect hit, or false alarm rates during the SSDT. In the near and mid conditions, the light significantly increased hit rates and led to a more liberal response criterion, that is, participants reported feeling the touch more often regardless of whether or not it actually occurred. Our results demonstrate a spatial boundary over which visual input influences veridical and non-veridical touch perception during the SSDT, and provide further behavioural evidence to show that the boundaries of the receptive fields of visuotactile neurons may be limited to reach space. © 2017, The Author(s).","Peripersonal space; Reach space; Rubber hand illusion; Somatic signal detection task; Touch; Vision","adult; Article; female; human; human experiment; light; male; normal human; perceptive discrimination; priority journal; sensory perception test; somatic signal detection task; spatial discrimination; tactile discrimination; tactile stimulation; visuotactile interaction",2-s2.0-85019675323

Free-ranging wild pigs (Sus scrofa) have caused considerable ecological and agricultural damage throughout their global range, including Canada. Objectives were to assess the spatial and temporal patterns in domestic wild boar and test the propagule pressure hypothesis to improve predictive ability of an existing habitat-based model of wild pigs. We reviewed spatiotemporal patterns in domestic wild boar production across ten Canadian provinces during 1991–2011 and evaluated the ability of wild boar farm distribution to improve predictive models of wild pig occurrence using a resource selection probability function for wild pigs in Saskatchewan. Domestic wild boar production in Canada increased from 1991 to 2001 followed by sharp declines in all provinces. The distribution of domestic wild boar farms in 2006 improved the fit and predictive ability of the habitat-based model, and the number of boar farms in adjacent rural municipalities had a relative variable importance of 0.84. Our results support the propagule pressure hypothesis, which states that establishment success is linked to source dynamics. Although eradication of wild pigs is rarely feasible after establishment over large areas, effective management will depend on strengthening regulations and enforcement of containment practices for Canadian domestic wild boar farms. Initiation of coordinated provincial and federal efforts to implement population control procedures for established wild pig populations are urgently needed to limit the spread of wild pigs and their impacts, and should focus on areas with existing or historic domestic wild boar farms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative livestock; Canada; Invasive species; Sus scrofa; Wild boar; Wild pigs","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Mammals; Probability distributions; Alternative livestock; Canada; Invasive species; Sus scrofa; Wild boars; Wild pigs; Population distribution; habitat type; invasive species; livestock; livestock farming; pig; propagule; resource selection; spatiotemporal analysis; wild population; Canada; Canada; Saskatchewan; Suidae; Sus scrofa",2-s2.0-85019597960

Recently, Prussian Carp were genetically confirmed in Alberta, Canada, documenting the first detection of this species in North America. Given the close morphological similarity to their sister species, the Goldfish (Carassius auratus Linnaeus, 1758), it is likely that this species has been undetected for some time. We document the spread of Prussian Carp since arrival (circa 2000), and contribute a trait-based risk assessment to potential recipient communities in western North America. Using a meta-analysis of geo-referenced fisheries data in conjunction with original sampling in 2014, we show that the Prussian Carp range has increased by eight- to eleven-fold over 15 years in Alberta at a rate of approximately 233–1,250 km2 per year. Range expansions in the near future are possible through the Saskatchewan River drainage and south into the Missouri River basin, with easily accessible routes to Midwestern North America through irrigation canals. We show high life history trait overlap with other successful invasive species, such as Goldfish and Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758). Additionally, there was high life history trait overlap with several species of native sunfish (Centrarchidae) and suckers (Catostomidae). This study highlights Prussian Carp’s potential to widely impact North American freshwater ecosystems and to successfully compete with native taxa. Considered one of the worst invaders in Eurasia, the arrival of Prussian Carp in North America poses serious concern for fisheries managers. There is an urgent need to develop management plans before further range expansion and disruption of freshwater ecosystems by this new invasive species. © 2017 The Author(s).

The morphological traits of propagules that increase buoyancy can enhance the spread of those species throughout the landscape. The goal of this study was to analyse the water dispersal capabilities of achenes of the morphologically diverse hybrid complex Fallopia x bohemica through the relationship between achene morphology and buoyancy. The achenes of F. x bohemica were collected from 60 stands growing along watercourses in the Rhône-Alpes region (France). Achene buoyancy was measured experimentally using a load cell. The shape of the achenes was quantified by principal component analyses based on elliptic Fourier descriptors of 2D wing shape. A spatial distribution analysis of the stands along different watercourses was performed to determine the relationship between the achene buoyancy and the dispersal potential. Across the 60 studied stands, flotation was positively correlated to the achene wing area. The flotation force, corrected for the achene mass, differed between the F. x bohemica stands sampled and was correlated to achene shape; in particular, the rounded achenes had a higher buoyancy than the elongated ones. Furthermore, the spatial autocorrelation of the flotation force suggested dispersal along rivers. These results highlight the water dispersal potential of the achenes of the Fallopia complex. Even if vegetative dispersal affects dispersal patterns, the morphological variation of achenes leading to different dispersal capabilities should be considered a major evolutionary driver of the complex. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Achene; Biological invasions; Buoyancy; Fallopia complex; Morphology; Water dispersal","achene; autocorrelation; biological invasion; buoyancy; dicotyledon; dispersal; hybrid; invasive species; morphology; principal component analysis; river; shape; spatial distribution; France; Rhone-Alpes; Fallopia bohemica",2-s2.0-85026435573

In 2005 it was found in the Dresden Island Pool of the Upper Illinois River, placing it within 100 river kilometers of Lake Michigan, and it is considered a high risk for continuing its spread into the Laurentian Great Lakes. During summer 2015 we conducted what we believe is the only sampling for this species to have taken place upstream of the Dresden Island Pool since 2005. We sampled at 25 sites from the Dresden Island Pool upstream to Lake Michigan, including six Lake Michigan harbors. A. lacustre was found at a single site in the Dresden Island Pool, indicating that the species has not spread over the last decade. This result could occur because of a physical or chemical barrier to further movement, or because our sampling was not sufficient to locate the population.

Endangered Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi) populations have been fragmented into a north-isolated population (NI) and a south-large population (SL) caused by predation pressure from the invasive small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) on Amami Oshima Island in southern Japan. We investigated the genetic structure of these rabbit populations to determine the effects of fragmentation. We collected rabbit feces from most of the Amami Oshima Island habitat and sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region along with its 5′-flanking region (312 bp) and genotyped eight microsatellite DNA loci. Genetic diversity was lower in the NI than that in the SL population, and FST values between the two populations were significantly higher than zero in both the mtDNA and microsatellite DNA. Bayesian clustering analyses suggested four ancestral clusters of Amami rabbit, but clear genetic structure was not observed. A partial Mantel test supported isolation-by-distance but not habitat fragmentation. These results suggest that the low genetic diversity in the NI population was caused by the small population size after fragmentation; however, the difference in genetic structure between the two populations was caused by isolation-by-distance and the structure has been maintained. © 2017, The Ecological Society of Japan.","Genetic diversity; Invasive carnivore; Isolation-by-distance; Pentalagus furnessi; Small Indian mongoose","carnivore; endangered species; felid; genetic isolation; genetic marker; genetic structure; genetic variation; habitat fragmentation; invasive species; isolated population; lagomorph; mitochondrial DNA; native species; population decline; population size; predation risk; Amami Island; Amami Islands; Japan; Kagoshima [Kyushu]; Kyushu; Herpestes auropunctatus; Herpestes javanicus; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Pentalagus furnessi",2-s2.0-85026557155

In “follower” ungulate species, vocal and visual cues have been found to play a leading role in the mother-young identification process from the first days postpartum, with olfactory cues also important in establishing the initial selective mother-young bond immediately after birth. In “hider” species, however, much less has been documented of mother-young recognition behaviors, especially in their natural habitat. In this paper, we investigated this process in goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), a typical hider species, in its native environment in Kazakhstan. Over the course of our study period, we investigated the behaviors of 257 females with twins and 158 females with singles through visual observations. We found that within the first month after birth, when females spend only a short time with their young, mothers recognized their fawns using mostly olfactory cues, while vision was used to locate their hiding offspring. Fawns vocalized very rarely, producing only distress calls that did not seem intended for individual identification. Licking of young by their mothers was observed frequently, not only during the first week after birth, when this action was very important for fawn stimulation for a number of physiological functions, but for several weeks after (until one month of age), when licking lost its physiological importance and likely became more of a recognition procedure. Fawns did not recognize their mothers at all, either through vision or vocalizations, since during their first weeks after birth, they responded to any gazelle that approached their hiding area. By a month after birth, when mothers and fawns began to stay together for longer periods of time, their recognition process became more enhanced, and in addition to olfactory cues, the mother and her young began to use more and more visual cues for longer distance identification, as well as vocalizations for shorter distances. Similar dynamics are likely typical for most hiding species, although information for wild ungulates is still very limited, especially for those with strong hider behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Gazella subgutturosa; Hider ungulates; Mother-young recognition; Olfactory cues; Vocal/visual cues","behavioral ecology; growth; olfactory cue; parent-offspring interaction; physiology; recognition; survival; temporal period; ungulate; vision; visual analysis; vocalization; adult; animal behavior; animal experiment; Article; association; fawn; female; Gazella subgutturosa; gazelle; Kazakhstan; licking; maternal behavior; mother child relation; mother young recognition; nonhuman; running; standing; suckling animal; vision; visual memory; vocalization; Kazakhstan; Gazella subgutturosa; Ungulata",2-s2.0-85019840292

For each province in South Africa, we used generalized linear mixed models to determine the combination of variables that explain spatial variation in sampling effort (number of visits per 5′ × 5′ grid cell, or “pentad”). The explanatory variables were distance to major road and exceptional birding locations or “sampling hubs,” percentage cover of protected, urban, and cultivated area, and the climate variables mean annual precipitation, winter temperatures, and summer temperatures. Further, we used the climate variables and plant biomes to define subsets of pentads representing environmental zones across South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland. For each environmental zone, we quantified sampling intensity, and we assessed sampling completeness with species accumulation curves fitted to the asymptotic Lomolino model. Sampling effort was highest close to sampling hubs, major roads, urban areas, and protected areas. Cultivated area and the climate variables were less important. Further, environmental zones were not evenly represented by current data and the zones varied in the amount of sampling required representing the species that are present. SABAP2 volunteers' preferences in birding locations cause spatial bias in the dataset that should be taken into account when analyzing these data.

As impacts can include the negative consequences of resource sharing with native species, the application of in situ cohabitation field experiments can test hypotheses relating to invasion ecology via competitive interactions and processes. As fishes are adaptable and tractable experimental organisms, they are strong model species for use in studies on competitive interactions. The trophic consequences of invasion by two globally invasive freshwater fishes, common carp Cyprinus carpio and goldfish Carassius auratus, were tested on the threatened native fish crucian carp Carassius carassius. Cohabitation experiments, completed in pond enclosures, used all species in allopatric and sympatric treatments using a substitutive design where the number of fish per treatment was kept constant. Stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) assessed alterations in the trophic ecology of each species across treatments, with growth rates used to assess any consequent impacts on the fish. When in sympatry with C. auratus and C. carassius, the Cy. carpio isotopic niche was at a significantly lower trophic position compared to allopatry. This resulted in niche overlap with C. auratus, while for C. carassius, their isotopic niche shifted to a higher trophic position compared with allopatry. The growth rate of Cy. carpio was always significantly higher in sympatry than in allopatry, whereas growth rates for C. carassius and C. auratus were significantly depressed in Cy. carpio presence. In contrast, the isotopic niche sizes and positions and growth rates of the Carassius fishes were not significantly different between allopatry and when they cohabited. Plasticity in the isotopic niche of Cy. carpio resulted in significant alterations in their trophic position between allopatry and sympatry and, when coupled with their depressed growth in allopatry, suggests the competitive processes driving this were intra-specific rather than inter-specific. This then resulted in detrimental impacts on cohabiting Carassius fishes. These results emphasise that ecological consequences of Cy. carpio in invaded freshwaters include impacts on the trophic ecology of native fishes. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Cyprinus carpio; invasion; isotopic niche; non-native species; stable isotope analysis",,2-s2.0-85026392054

Methods: A pot culture experiment was carried out to simulate the changes in photosynthesis, biomass, and biomass allocation in P. virgatum and to identify the main soil nutrient factors in various soils collected from local plant communities. P. virgatum was grown in soils collected from communities of P. virgatum (PS treatment), Setaria viridis (SS treatment), Bothriochloa ischaemum (BS treatment), and Artemisia sacrorum (AS treatment) and in a mixed soil from the communities of S. viridis, B. ischaemum, and A. sacrorum (MS treatment). Results: Photosynthesis in P. virgatum differed significantly among the soil treatments. Net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) were highest in PS, whereas single-photon avalanche diode values were highest in PS and SS. The variation of biomass differed significantly in different tissues of P. virgatum in the treatments. Leaf and stem biomasses were highest in PS and SS, and root biomass was highest in PS and MS. Total biomass differed significantly among the treatments, except between BS and MS. Both the leaf to total and stem to total biomass ratios were highest in AS and SS, but the root to total biomass ratio was lowest in these two treatments. A constrained redundancy analysis and a path analysis suggested that the water-soluble nitrate-nitrogen (W-NN) concentration of the soil could significantly affect photosynthesis, biomass, and biomass allocation in P. virgatum. Conclusions: Photosynthesis, biomass, and biomass allocation in P. virgatum differed significantly when grown in soils from different local plant communities on the Loess Plateau. The soil W-NN concentration in these local plant communities likely has a large impact on the invasive success of P. virgatum. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Biomass allocation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Exotic species invasion; Plant community; Soil nitrogen concentration; SPAD value","biomass; biomass allocation; chlorophyll; grass; invasive species; photosynthesis; plant community; root system; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; stomatal conductance; China; Loess Plateau; Artemisia gmelinii; Bothriochloa ischaemum; Panicum virgatum; Setaria viridis",2-s2.0-85019927052

To prevent invasions and the impacts of invasions, a better understanding of species-specific invasion routes, establishment processes, demographic histories and range expansions is needed. Such valuable biological information can be obtained using population genomics approaches that allow fast and simultaneous screening of thousands of loci and SNP markers without prior knowledge of the genome of studied species. As a result, invasion genomics has the potential to reveal previously undetected population relationships, invasion routes and evolutionary patterns. Here, we characterized the genetic diversity, structure, temporal stability and putative footprints of selection in introduced Baltic Sea populations of the mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii using restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Similar to earlier mtDNA reports, analysis of 1013 SNPs revealed strong differentiation between the native and introduced populations. At a regional scale, clear evidence of population structuring was detected between Finnish and Estonian samples indicating that R. harrisii does not form a single panmictic population in the Baltic Sea. Clustering of samples according to the age groups (juvenile and adult) instead of geographical location within the Archipelago Sea revealed the presence of significant temporal variation at small spatial scale. Finally, we identified a number of outlier loci under temporal divergent selection between cohorts suggesting that contemporary selection in newly established areas may be stronger than selection associated with spatial heterogeneity within the Baltic Sea. These results demonstrate the utility of next-generation sequencing to increase understanding of the population diversity and structuring, and highlight the importance of temporal genetic analysis when dissecting fine-scale genetic structure for introduced marine species with high reproductive potential. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,"Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhithropanopeus harrisii",2-s2.0-85028012436

In intergeneric crosses between hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.), postzygotic barriers may occur at different stages of hybrid development. One such mechanism is embryo lethality, which is genetically determined by the interaction and expression of two incompatible genes in wheat (Eml-A1) and rye (Eml-R1). Using in vitro culture methods as stressors, we overcame this hybrid lethality. Normal and abnormal embryos were observed to build embryogenic calli and produce regenerated plantlets in a similar manner. The high regenerative capacity of the abnormal embryos led us to conclude that the reproductive barrier in these intergeneric hybrids may have an epigenetic origin that can be easily overcome by culturing immature embryos via callus induction. After colchicine treatment during callus culture, amphidiploid plants were obtained. However, most of these plants did not produce seeds, due mainly to sterility of the pollen but also of the embryo sacs. These findings demonstrate that hybrid sterility affects both male and female gametophytes in plants obtained from abnormal embryos. The key roles of double fertilization and stress factors in the implementation of the apical meristem formation program in embryos from incompatible intergeneric crosses between hexaploid wheat and rye during in vitro culture are discussed. We also propose a hypothetical model for a wheat–rye lethality system involving differential expression of incompatible wheat Eml-A1 and rye Eml-R1b alleles in an identical genetic background. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Chromosome doubling; Embryo lethality; Embryo rescue; Post-zygotic incompatibility; Stress-induced changes; Wheat–rye hybrids",,2-s2.0-85018469442

While causes and consequences of woody expansion have been well documented, few studies have addressed plant functional traits that promote dramatic and rapid expansion in range. Our objectives were to investigate plant functional traits that contribute to the colonization, rapid expansion, and thicket formation of an invasive, N-fixing shrub, Elaeagnus umbellata Thunb. (Elaeagnaceae), and a native, N-fixing shrub Morella cerifera (L.) Small (Myricaceae) and compare to native, sympatric, non-expanding shrub species. Quantified functional traits included morphological (e.g., specific leaf area, leaf area) and physiological characteristics (e.g., electron transport rate, hydraulic conductivity) and were linked to two primary resources: light and water, which directly influence plant growth. Elaeagnus umbellata and M. cerifera rely on different strategies to maximize carbon gain, yet resulting physiological efficiency is similar. Elaeagnus umbellata invests a substantial amount of energy into growth during a short amount of time (i.e., deciduous growing season), using an acquisitive trait strategy to outcompete co-occurring woody species, while M. cerifera is productive year-round and uses a combination of conservative and acquisitive traits to outcompete co-occurring woody species. The majority of quantified functional traits of E. umbellata and several of M. cerifera are indicative of efficient light capture, utilization, and internal water movement. These factors contribute to rapid range expansion and thicket formation by promoting enhanced productivity while simultaneously inhibiting colonization and expansion of co-occurring species. Suites of functional traits are important for expansive success and thicket formation, yet differences in functional traits represent alternative strategies for colonization, rapid expansion, and thicketization. © 2017 Shiflett et al.","Electron transport rate; Functional traits; Hydraulic conductivity; Nitrogen fixation; Thicket formation; Woody expansion",,2-s2.0-85030225669

Neviski (synonym, Thinopyrum ponticum Podp., 2n = 70) has been used extensively as a valuable source for wheat breeding. Numerous chromosome fragments containing valuable genes have been successfully translocated into wheat from A. elongatum. However, reports on the transfer of powdery mildew resistance from A. elongatum to wheat are rare. In this study, a novel wheat-A. elongatum translocation line, 11-20-1, developed and selected from the progenies of a sequential cross between wheat varieties (Lankaoaizaoba, Keyu 818 and BainongAK 58) and A. elongatum, was evaluated for disease resistance and characterized using molecular cytogenetic methods. Cytological observations indicated that 11-20-1 had 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis using whole genomic DNA from A. elongatum as a probe showed that the short arms of a pair of wheat chromosomes were replaced by a pair of A. elongatum chromosome arms. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, using wheat D chromosome specific sequence pAs1 as a probe, suggested that the replaced chromosome arms of 11-20-1 were 5DS. This was further confirmed by wheat SSR markers specific for 5DS. EST-SSR and EST-STS multiple loci markers confirmed that the introduced A. elongatum chromosome arms belonged to homoeologous group 5. Therefore, it was deduced that 11-20-1 was a wheat-A. elongatum T5DL5AgS translocation line. Both resistance observation and molecular marker analyses using two specific markers (BE443538 and CD452608) of A. elongatum in a F2 population from a cross between line 11-20-1 and a susceptible cultivar Yannong 19 verified that the A. elongatum chromosomes were responsible for the powdery mildew resistance. This work suggests that 11-20-1 likely contains a novel resistance gene against powdery mildew. We expect this line to be useful for the genetic improvement of wheat. © 2017 Li et al.

However, significant vegetation colonization can currently be observed in these riparian areas, and understanding the cause of this colonization is important for management. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of sediment deposition and erosion on vegetation colonization in gravel bed rivers. The delay in colonization by herbs and trees after sediment deposition or erosion was investigated using aerial photos of 6 Japanese rivers. A field study was conducted before and after a large flood at depositional and erosional locations. The colonization of vegetation after flushing was substantially delayed at sites where gravels were deposited compared with that at erosional sites, and it was faster in sandy reaches compared with gravelly reaches. Little tree colonization was observed at the depositional sites of gravelly sediments, whereas at erosional sites, new shoots sprouted from the collapsed live trees in the following spring, achieving a rapid increase in tree density. The nutrient and moisture contents of the sediment were significantly higher at the erosional sites. Gravels are deposited after washing and being segregated from fine sediment during floods. This coarse-sediment layer is low in moisture and nutrients compared with the erosional sites, at which the underlying sediments are exposed by flooding. However, moisture and nutrients are the primary requirements for vegetation colonization. Therefore, the reduction in gravelly sediments due to gravel mining, river regulation, and modification of river basins can have a substantial effect on vegetation colonization.

In the Great Plains, resource managers have initiated efforts to control the eastward incursion of Tamarix as a non-native bottomland plant (Tamarix ramosissima) along the Cimarron River in southwestern Kansas, United States. To understand how native avifauna interact with non-native plants, we studied the effects of Tamarix removal on riparian bird communities. We compared avian site occupancy of three foraging guilds, abundance of four nesting guilds, and assessed community dynamics with dynamic, multiseason occupancy models across three replicated treatments. Community parameters were estimated for Tamarix-dominated sites (untreated), Tamarix-removal sites (treated), and reference sites with native cottonwood sites (Populus deltoides). Estimates of initial occupancy (ψ2006) for the ground-to-shrub foraging guild tended to be highest at Tamarix-dominated sites, while initial occupancy of the upper-canopy foraging and mid-canopy foraging guilds were highest in the treated and reference sites, respectively. Estimates of relative abundance for four nesting guilds indicated that the reference habitat supported the highest relative abundance of birds overall, although the untreated habitat had higher abundance of shrub-nesters than treated or reference habitats. Riparian sites where invasive Tamarix is dominant in the Great Plains can provide nesting habitat for some native bird species, with avian abundance and diversity that are comparable to remnant riparian sites with native vegetation. Moreover, presence of some native vegetation in Tamarix-dominated and Tamarix-removal sites may increase abundance of riparian birds such as cavity-nesters. Overall, our study demonstrates that Tamarix may substitute for native flora in providing nesting habitat for riparian birds at the eastern edge of its North American range. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration","Great Plains; invasive bottomland plants; land management; occupancy; relative abundance; salt cedar","abundance; bird; community dynamics; foraging behavior; grassland; invasive species; land management; plant; Great Plains; Kansas; United States; Animalia; Aves; Populus; Populus deltoides; Tamarix; Tamarix ramosissima",2-s2.0-85011343386

If so, do native and non-native species differ in their shifts of mean elevation range, upper elevation limit or lower elevation limit?. Location: Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, southeast slope of Mauna Loa, Hawai'i. Methods: We resurveyed an elevation belt transect of vegetation plots that was first surveyed in the early 1970s. Differences between 1970 and 2010 were calculated for 69 plant species’ mean elevation, upper elevation limit, lower elevation limit and elevation range. Statistical significance of differences was assessed by Monte Carlo permutation tests. Results: Averaging across all 69 species, a statistically significant upward shift of 65.2 m was detected in mean elevation. Both upper and lower elevation limits shifted significantly upward by 31.6 and 90.5 m, respectively. Elevation range did not change significantly. For the 49 native species, the upper elevation limit did not change, but the lower elevation limit shifted significantly upward by 94.1 m. In contrast, the 20 non-native species displayed a different pattern of a significant upward shift in both their upper and lower elevation limits, by 126.4 and 81.6 m, respectively. Native species seemed to display a contracting elevation range of 101.2 m, but this was not significant (P = 0.053), while non-native species maintained a stable elevation range (P = 0.365). Conclusions: Vascular plants have shifted upward in elevation on the tropical island of Hawai'i, but the shifting trend differs between native and non-native species. Non-native species, which were often found at lower elevations, are in an upward niche expansion phase. Native species show trends toward range contraction due to lack of expansion in upper elevation limit, probably due to drought stress correlating with a trade-wind inversion (TWI) that severely limits rainfall at higher elevations. As more non-native species reach the TWI elevation, their upward expansion may also become more limited. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","Climate change; Elevation distribution shift; Elevation range; Oceanic Island; Tropical plants; Upper and lower elevation limit","climate change; drought stress; elevation; native species; plant; rainfall; tropical environment; vascular plant; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Hawaiian Islands; Mauna Loa; North Province; Rwanda; Volcanoes National Park; Tracheophyta",2-s2.0-85026470246

(Asteraceae syn. C. tenuifolia) in the eastern Lesotho Highlands. This shrub species is argued to be a Karroid invasive introduced anthropogenically within the last century. Historical botanical records in Lesotho are scarce, so the origins of this species in the region are as yet uncertain. Speculation is based on the contemporary abundance of these shrubs in overgrazed areas throughout the highlands. This study presents fossil pollen records for the eastern Lesotho Highlands which confirm the presence of this species intermittently throughout the past ~6000 cal yr BP. In so doing, this study refutes claims that the species was introduced anthropogenically within the past 100 years, and of its narrow definition as a Karoo species invasive in Lesotho. The intermittent appearance of this species in the pollen record, however, indicates that it is climate sensitive, colonising the wetlands under conditions unsuitable to other plant species. Evidence presented here calls for a re-evaluation of the categorisation of C. ciliata as an invasive in the Lesotho Highlands, and more critically, for a redevelopment of the environmental management policies which involve this species. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Chrysocoma ciliata; Eastern Lesotho; Invasives; Pollen","anthropogenic effect; fossil record; invasive species; pollen; shrub; upland region; wetland; Lesotho; Asteraceae; Chrysocoma ciliata",2-s2.0-85020423393

Throughout the tropics, the historical demand for cropland and pastures in the lands adjacent to streams has led to the replacement of forests by exotic grasses. In order to find new methods for initiating the restoration of riparian forests, we evaluated the use of the pioneer shrubs Tithonia diversifolia and Piper auritum as nurse species for their effects on (1) competition with dominant grasses; (2) natural regeneration and the ecological facilitation of six native tree species of different successional stages; and (3) influence on microclimate. Over a period of 15 months, 4.4% coverage of P. auritum was insufficient to inhibit grasses. In contrast, 81% coverage of T. diversifolia limited the growth of dominant grasses such as Cenchrus purpureus, Paspalum paniculatum, and Cynodon plectostachyus likely by intercepting more than 90% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), even though other factors cannot be ruled out. T. diversifolia showed simultaneous effects of facilitation and competition by promoting higher survival of the planted native trees while slowing the growth of pioneer species and inhibiting the regeneration of native woody plants probably as a result of high light interception. This study suggests that planting T. diversifolia as a nurse shrub may facilitate early stages of restoration by inhibiting the growth of pastures, but requires pruning, both to increase light availability and promote the growth of planted trees and the recruitment of woody plants. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration","arrested succession; natural regeneration; nurse-plants; pasture; Piper auritum; Tithonia diversifolia","agricultural ecosystem; competition (ecology); grass; growth; regeneration; restoration ecology; riparian forest; shrub; succession; woody plant; Andes; Colombia; Cenchrus; Cynodon plectostachyus; Paspalum paniculatum; Piper auritum; Poaceae; Tithonia diversifolia",2-s2.0-85029809916

Bleached! draws on in-depth interviews and participatory observations with coral scientists and managers to explore the management of the corals’ ecological catastrophe to come. The article starts by describing the unique life of corals, the importance of calculability in catastrophe management, and the coral scientists’ preoccupation with classifying, counting, and seeing in their attempt to comprehensibly monitor corals and anticipate their decline. Algorithmic models and elaborate temporal analyses are central to this governmental project of “knowing bleaching.” What happens after such bleaching events are foreseen is the topic of my next exploration, which highlights the emergence of yet more monitoring as the central coral conservation “action” in the face of the looming catastrophe. The “resilience” concept is of growing importance in the world of coral management. Since it underlines unpredictability and nonlinearity, resilience as well seems to fly in the face of any anticipatory action, instead scientifically justifying forms of inaction. Finally, Bleached! discusses the heated debates among coral scientists about whether to focus present actions on “buying time” for corals, or whether the only way to prevent or limit imminent coral catastrophe is to deal directly with the elephant in the room: the global regulation of climate change. I argue that, in the case of corals at least, scientific knowledge is not power. Quite the contrary, the real political story here seems to lie in the ways in which scientists’ knowledge is neutralized and prevented from having political effects, such that it does not lead to anticipatory action to restore the ecological order. As one of the prominent coral scientists I interviewed for this project put it: current conservation efforts are akin to reorganizing the chairs on the Titanic, rather than to changing the ship's deadly course. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anticipating bleaching; Calculability; Catastrophe governance; Climate change; Coral management; Resilience","algorithm; biomonitoring; bleaching; climate change; conservation management; coral; ecological modeling; ecosystem resilience; population decline; Anthozoa",2-s2.0-84998772632

Gandhi was the undisputed leader of India's struggle for independence. Yet his vision for postcolonial India was completely marginalized at the moment of decolonization. The article takes this seemingly paradoxical juncture as the vantage point from which to offer a critique of Gandhi's political thought and more broadly an analysis of the shift from anticolonial movements to postcolonial rule. Through the voices of Gandhi's two most significant contemporary critics-B.R. Ambedkar and Jawaharlal Nehru-the article shows how his ideas failed to either inspire the struggle of the ruled (Ambedkar), or address the anxieties of the would-be rulers (Nehru). Gandhi's vision for a postcolonial India persisted within the conceptual constellation of negating colonial modernity, rather than the historical possibilities of postcolonial futures. These predicaments provide an opportunity to analyze the persistence of modern western political imaginaries in the decolonized world. Not through mere assertions of continuity or mimicry, but rather through the concrete struggles, aspirations, and anxieties that constituted the strands of those transitional moments.

We report on the efficacy and the prey preference of the predator to control these pests on different host plants under laboratory conditions.

Our results show that O. albidipennis prefers T. turkestani to B. tabaci on both host plants but its preference for T. turkestani on sweet pepper is significantly greater than on cucumber. Moreover, on sweet pepper, preference values are completely fitted by Murdoch's no-switch line.

Three morphologically similar species, namely X. atrata, M. galloprovincialis, and X. securis were further examined for distinctions in their morphology.

All anabantoids have a pair of suprabranchial chambers that each house an air-breathing organ known as the labyrinth apparatus: a complex bony structure lined with thin, highly vascularised respiratory epithelium. The labyrinth apparatus allows anabantoids to extract oxygen from air and is a morpho-physiological innovation that has had a dramatic influence on the behaviour of these fishes. Air-breathing influences a wide range of anabantoid behaviours, including territorial displays, courtship and breeding and parental care and also equips these fishes to persist in hypoxic and polluted water. These traits also make anabantoids successful invaders of novel habitats, a global problem compounded by their popularity in the aquarium trade. By reviewing the functionality and evolution of air breathing in anabantoids, this review aims to examine the role of the labyrinth apparatus in modulating behaviour within this group. The anabantoids are a fascinating group and have often been cited as a model organism due to the stereotypical and easily identifiable behaviours that they adopt during social interactions.

This ambition has strong ecological justifications, and inspires other initiatives such as the IUCN red list of ecosystems. Evaluating this policy is therefore pivotal to identify and reproduce best practices. However, the habitat aspect of this policy has so far not been systematically assessed. To make up for this lacuna, we take advantage of decision-aiding methodologies to introduce a new normative framework. According to this framework, a conservation policy is positively evaluated if it contributes to conservation, is science-based, operational, and legitimate. Based on an exploration of the published literature and unpublished reports and databases, we identify knowledge gaps plaguing the European habitat conservation policy. We argue that, due to these knowledge gaps, the contribution of this policy to the conservation of habitats is unproven, it is not science-based, not operational and not legitimate. Our study draws heavily on the French implementation. Analyzing this example, we highlight knowledge gaps that carry lessons for European conservation policies as a whole, but also for conservation initiatives focused on habitats in a broader geographical and political context.

Correct timing of diapause termination is vital for synchronization of emergence with conspecifics and for mobilizing resources when conditions for growth and reproduction become favourable. Although critical to survival, the intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of diapause termination timing are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate diapause development under a range of durations (10–24 weeks) spent at different temperatures (−2 to 10 °C) in the pupal diapausing butterfly Pieris napi Linnaeus (Lepidoptera:Pieridae). We determine: (i) the maximum cold temperature for diapause development; (ii) if pupae in diapause count cold days or cold sums; and (iii) whether diapause termination is distinct or gradual. The results indicate large and idiosyncratic effects of high and low nonlethal temperatures on diapause development in P. napi. Although all temperatures tested lead to diapause termination, a thermal optimum between 2 and 4 °C is observed. Lower temperatures lead to decreased eclosion propensity, whereas higher temperatures slow down development and increase emergence desynchronization. These data suggest that, rather than a simple cold-summing process with a distinct diapause termination point, there are trade-offs between time and temperature at the low and high end of the thermal range, resulting in a nonlinear thermal landscape showing a ridge of increasing eclosion propensity at moderate temperatures. The present study suggests that the effects of temperature on diapause development should be included in projections on post-winter phenology models of insects, including pest species. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society","Biological clock; butterfly; climate change; phenology; Pieridae; stress","butterfly; circadian rhythm; climate change; developmental biology; diapause; emergence; environmental stress; phenology; pupa; temperature effect; temporal variation; winter; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Pieridae; Pieris napi",2-s2.0-85017389779

The DH population was grown at the University of Sydney’s Plant Breeding Institute site at Cobbitty in 2006 and 2007. The Diversity Array Technology (DArT) approach was employed to genotype the population. Resistance genes Yr7, Sr36 and Lr13 mapped on chromosome 2B, while linked stem rust and leaf rust resistance genes Sr24 and Lr24 were placed on the long arm of chromosome 3D. Rust resistant loci Sr36, Lr13 and Yr7 were flanked by the marker loci wPt-0395 and wPt-0981. The rust resistance gene combination, Sr24/Lr24, was flanked by DArT markers wPt-7752 and wPt-8845 on chromosome 3D. QTL analysis for adult plant stripe rust responses indicated the involvement of chromosomes 2B, 3B, 4B and 5B. QTL on chromosome 4B (QYr.sun-4B) can be revealed as the second component of YrA. Two QTLs (QLr.sun-2B and QLr.sun-3D) detected on chromosomes 2B and 3D, controlling low leaf rust response, corresponded to genomic locations of seedling leaf rust resistance genes Lr13 and Lr24. DM/H45 population possessed low Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity, good YAN colour stability and sprouting tolerance. The lines of this population were identified having high levels of adult plant rust (APR) to rust diseases and having good end-use quality. Genetic associations of DArT markers with rust resistance genes Lr13, Sr36, Yr7 and Lr24/Sr24 would be useful to identify PCR-based markers for tracing these genes in diverse wheat germplasm. © Society for the Advancement of Breeding Research in Asia and Oceania (SABRAO) 2017.","Adult plant resistance; DArT markers; Molecular mapping; Quantitative trait loci; Rust resistance",,2-s2.0-85029423444

To obtain a clearer picture about the kinds of environmental features that can be modelled using Flickr tags, we consider the problem of predicting scenicness, species distribution, land cover, and several climate related features. Our focus is on comparing the predictive power of Flickr tags with that of structured data from more traditional sources. We find that, broadly speaking, Flickr tags perform comparably to the considered structured data sources, being sometimes better and sometimes worse. Most importantly, we find that combining Flickr tags with structured data sources consistently, and sometimes substantially, improves the results.

Collection of such large-scale information typically requires engagement of volunteer citizens and tends to consist of non-repeated surveys made with a survey effort varying over space and time. We here used a hierarchical single-census open population N-mixture model, which was recently developed to handle such challenging census data, to describe the dynamics in the Finnish population sizes of the reintroduced native Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) and the invasive North American beaver (Castor canadensis). The numbers of beaver winter lodges (i.e., family groups) were counted by volunteers in the municipalities of Finland every third year during 1995–2013. The dynamics of both species followed Gompertz logistic growth with immigration. Initial abundance of North American beavers increased with proximity to the introduction sites as well as with the amount of water in the municipality. The intensively hunted North American beaver population declined and the Eurasian beaver population increased during the study period. The model generated reasonable estimates of both total Finnish and local numbers of lodges, corrected for the incomplete detection.

Here we examined whether physiological integration can increase the ability of phalanx clonal plants to withstand defoliation. On a high mountain grassland in southwestern China, we subjected the phalanx clonal plant Iris delavayi within 10 cm × 10 cm plots to three levels of defoliation intensity, i.e., control (no defoliation), moderate (50% shoot removal to simulate moderate herbivory) and heavy defoliation (100% shoot removal to simulate heavy herbivory), and kept rhizomes at the plot edges connected (allowing physiological integration) or disconnected (preventing integration) with intact ramets outside the plots. Defoliation significantly reduced leaf biomass, root biomass and ramet number of I. delavayi. Clonal integration did not affect the growth of I. delavayi under control, but significantly increased total biomass, rhizome and root biomass under heavy defoliation, and leaf biomass and ramet number under moderate defoliation. We conclude that clonal integration associated with resource reallocation plays an important role in maintaining the productivity of the alpine and subalpine grassland ecosystems in SW China where clonal plants are a dominant component of the grasslands and are commonly extensively managed with moderate grazing intensity.

Temperature and time of day are frequently cited as key drivers of activity; however, complex interactions between multiple contributing factors have also been proposed. Here, we report individual Bayesian network models to assess the probability of flight activity of three exotic insects, Hylurgus ligniperda, Hylastes ater, and Arhopalus ferus in a managed plantation forest context. Models were built from 7,144 individual hours of insect sampling, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, photon flux density, and temporal data. Discretized meteorological and temporal variables were used to build naïve Bayes tree augmented networks. Calibration results suggested that the H. ater and A. ferus Bayesian network models had the best fit for low Type I and overall errors, and H. ligniperda had the best fit for low Type II errors. Maximum hourly temperature and time since sunrise had the largest influence on H. ligniperda flight activity predictions, whereas time of day and year had the greatest influence on H. ater and A. ferus activity. Type II model errors for the prediction of no flight activity is improved by increasing the model’s predictive threshold. Improvements in model performance can be made by further sampling, increasing the sensitivity of the flight intercept traps, and replicating sampling in other regions. Predicting insect flight informs an assessment of the potential phytosanitary risks of wood exports. Quantifying this risk allows mitigation treatments to be targeted to prevent the spread of invasive species via international trade pathways. © 2017, Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

Field studies showed that the non-native P. elegans had wider geographical range compared to native species although the level of habitat specialization was similar in both Palaemon species. There were clear differences in shrimp habitat occupancy with P. elegans inhabiting lower salinity areas and more eutrophicated habitats compared to the native species. Consequently, the non-native shrimp has occupied large areas of the northern Baltic Sea that were previously devoid of the native shrimps. Experiments demonstrated that the non-native shrimp had higher affinity to vegetated substrates compared to native species. The study suggests that the abilities of the non-native shrimp to thrive in more stressful habitats (lower salinity, higher eutrophication), that are sub-optimal for native shrimps, plausibly explain the invasion success of P. elegans. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Baltic Sea; Caridean shrimps; Distribution; Ecological niche; Non-native species","biodiversity; biological invasion; crustacean; geographical distribution; native species; salinity; specialization; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Crangon crangon; Decapoda (Crustacea); Palaemon; Palaemon adspersus; Palaemon elegans",2-s2.0-85019893962

In two different experiments, we showed that the illusory ownership over a fake hand (induced by the rubber hand illusion) triggered also an illusory agency over its movements at both explicit and implicit level. Specifically, when the fake (embodied) hand pressed a button delivering an electrical stimulus to the participant's body, the movement was misattributed to participant's will (explicit level) and the stimulus intensity was attenuated (implicit level) exactly as it happened when the own hand actually delivered the stimulus.

Eighteen years after initial restoration (ungulate exclusion, invasive plant control, and out planting native species) at a 4 ha site on Maui, Hawai'i, we compared invasive rodent communities in a restored native dry forest and adjacent non-native grassland. Quarterly for 1 year, we trapped rodents on three replicate transects (107 rodent traps) in each habitat type for three consecutive nights. While repeated trapping may have reduced the rat (Black rat, Rattus rattus) population in the forest, it did not appear to reduce the mouse (House mouse, Mus musculus) population in the grassland. In unrestored grassland, mouse captures outnumbered rat captures 220:1, with mice averaging 54.9 indiv./night versus rats averaging 0.25 indiv./night. In contrast, in restored native forest, rat captures outnumbered mouse captures by nearly 5:1, averaging 9.0 indiv./night versus 1.9 indiv./night for mice. Therefore, relatively recent native forest restoration increased Black rat abundance and also increased their total biomass in the restored ecosystem 36-fold while reducing House mouse biomass 35-fold. Such a community shift is worrisome because Black rats pose a much greater threat than do mice to native birds and plants, perhaps especially to large-seeded tree species. Land managers should be aware that forest restoration (i.e. converting grassland to native forest) can invoke shifts in invasive rodent populations, potentially favoring Black rats.

Three apicomplexan parasite species of Sarcocystis (S. singaporensis, S. zamani, and S. villivillosi) use the reticulated python as their definitive hosts and several species within the Rattus genus as intermediate hosts, and they form a system useful for studying interactions between host–parasite and predator–prey relationships, as well as anthropogenic impacts on parasite transmission. Based on predictions from a 1998 survey, which detected an inverse relationship between urban development and Sarcocystis infection in Rattus, we tested the hypothesis that Sarcocystis transmission in Singapore will decrease over time due to anthropogenic activities. Despite a large proportion of the reticulated python diet consisting of Rattus species at all sizes of pythons, Sarcocystis infection rates decreased from 1998 to 2010. Pythons found in industrial areas had lower Sarcocystis infection rates, particularly in the western industrial area of Singapore Island. Average python size also decreased, with implications that we predict may disrupt host–parasite relationships. Anthropogenic activities such as habitat modification, fragmentation, and systematic removal and translocation of pythons have negative impacts on Sarcocystis transmission in Singapore, which in turn may augment pest rat populations.

However, the effects of invasive preys on native predators have been poorly studied. Here, we first reviewed hypotheses describing potential relationships between native predators and invasive preys. Second, we examined how an invasive prey, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), affected a native terrestrial amphibian community. In the field, we looked at the structure of the amphibian community in invaded versus uninvaded areas and characterized amphibian trophic ecology. The amphibian community sampled seemed to show a species-dependent response in abundance to invasion: adults of the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita), the species demonstrating the highest degree of ant specialization, were less abundant in invaded areas. Although available ant biomass was significantly greater in invaded than in uninvaded areas (only Argentine ants occurred in the former), amphibians consumed relatively fewer ants in invaded areas. In the lab, we quantified amphibian consumption of Argentine ants versus native ants and assessed whether consumption patterns could have been influenced by prior exposure to the invader. The lab experiments corroborated the field results: amphibians preferred native ants over Argentine ants, and prior exposure did not influence consumption. Differences in preference explained why amphibians consumed fewer Argentine ants in spite of their greater relative availability; they might also explain why the most ant-specialized amphibians seemed to avoid invaded areas. Our results suggest the importance to account for predator feeding capacities and dietary ranges to understand the effects of invasive species at higher trophic levels. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Biotic resistance; Enemy release; Exotic prey naïveté; Invasive prey; Linepithema humile","ant; biological invasion; biotic factor; community structure; enemy release hypothesis; invasive species; native species; predator; predator-prey interaction; specialization; terrestrial ecosystem; toad; trophic environment; trophic level; Amphibia; Anura; Bufo calamita; Formicidae; Linepithema humile",2-s2.0-85027841697

Native biota within these stressed systems are also impacted by reductions in habitat availability, decreased hydraulic diversity, increased sedimentation, movement barriers, invasive species and altered flows that may profoundly change the character and functioning of rivers. Construction or enlargement of reservoirs is continuing, and whilst downstream impacts are often considered, upstream impacts receive far less attention. We develop a population model to examine the impacts of reservoir expansion on a threatened riverine species in South Eastern Australia: the two-spined blackfish. We examined two processes, loss of breeding habitat and increased predation, directly linked to reservoir expansion as well as a broader threat of recruitment failure due to sedimentation. These threatening processes were assessed using the expected minimum population size as an indicator of risk. As is often the case for threatened species, limited data were used to parameterise the model and sensitivity analysis performed to assess the appropriateness of the model parameterisation. The outcomes indicate that the two-spined blackfish population is vulnerable to the loss of breeding habitat particularly if two-spined blackfish are unable to spawn in the larger dam, although this vulnerability is ameliorated if the whole river is accounted for. Including possible impacts from the resident trout population for the whole river, indicates the two-spined blackfish to be vulnerable to low level predation particularly if the trout population have a high growth rate. Population modelling has rarely been used to predict the consequences of dam construction on aquatic species/communities.

A nine-year survey using sentinel and naturally laid H. halys was conducted to investigate the extent of natural biological control by parasitoids in managed and non-managed landscapes in northern Delaware, USA. Naturally laid egg masses of native pentatomids were collected to compare the resident parasitoid complex to the one attacking H. halys eggs. Mean parasitism rates of sentinel eggs were below 6% in any given year of the survey with a grand mean of 1.79%. Parasitism of naturally laid H. halys eggs was higher than that of sentinel eggs, but there was no significant difference in parasitism between years and the grand mean was 4.31%. Parasitoid species richness on sentinel and naturally laid H. halys eggs was similar but both were lower than the richness on native pentatomid eggs. H. halys eggs were parasitized by eight species in the genera Anastatus, Trissolcus, Telenomus, and Ooencyrtus. The level of parasitism by native egg parasitoids is insufficient to provide long-term control of H. halys. Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead), an Asian egg parasitoid that has been recovered in the USA in several locations since 2014, may be the most promising candidate for long-term biological control of H. halys. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).","Biological control; Brown marmorated stink bug; Parasitism; Scelionidae; Trissolcus","biological control; chemical control; egg parasitoid; parasitism; survey; wasp; Delaware; United States; Anastatus; Halyomorpha halys; Ooencyrtus; Pentatomidae; Scelionidae; Telenomus; Trissolcus",2-s2.0-85019038168

In urban breeding birds, the paucity of dietary specialists suggests that a lack of food resources, such as arthropod prey essential for reproduction and survival, may contribute to bird declines. Local plant species composition and abundance is influenced by the landscaping decisions of private homeowners and may be contributing to differences in insect prey availability. In this study, we examined whether non-native plants are a limiting factor to a resident breeding insectivore, the Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). We used caterpillar counts, chickadee foraging observations and detection-corrected hierarchical models, to determine the influence of local landscaping features on insect food availability, chickadee tree preference, site occupancy, site abundance and breeding territory selection. Native plants were more likely to host a higher biomass of caterpillars compared to non-native plants, and chickadees strongly preferred to forage in native plants that supported the most caterpillars. In addition, chickadees were less likely to breed in yards as the dominance of non-native plants increased. Chickadee occupancy increased with tree basal area and chickadee abundance declined as impermeable surface area increased and basal area decreased. Our results demonstrate that non-native plants reduce habitat suitability for chickadees by reducing insect food available for breeding. Improving human-dominated landscapes as wildlife habitat should include increasing native, and arthropod-producing, plant species to effectively support the life history needs of insectivorous birds. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Breeding birds; Chickadee; Food webs; Foraging; Lepidoptera; Urban landscapes","abundance; caterpillar; complexity; conservation management; food web; forage; insectivore; limiting factor; native species; passerine; population decline; reproductive strategy; Carolina; Puerto Rico; Arthropoda; Aves; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Paridae; Parus carolinensis",2-s2.0-85021843011

Insect predators utilize H. halys as prey; however, the chemical cues used by them in prey location are largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that tridecane, an H. halys-associated volatile, acts as a kairomone for the predaceous minute pirate bug, Orius insidiosus (Say). We conducted laboratory, greenhouse, and field experiments to: (1) assess the attraction of adult O. insidiosus to H. halys-damaged bean pods and tridecane in cage studies, and its effect on egg predation; (2) video record the behavioral response of O. insidiosus males and females to tridecane in a four-arm olfactometer; and (3) test whether Orius spp. are attracted to tridecane-baited sticky traps in peach, blueberry, and sunflower fields, and its effect on egg predation. In the greenhouse, O. insidiosus was attracted to H. halys-damaged pods and artificial plants baited with tridecane in the presence of prey (sentinel eggs); however, this attraction rarely led to increased egg predation. Although both O. insidiosus males and females spent more time in the arm of the olfactometer with tridecane, males were more responsive at a lower concentration than females. Similarly, Orius spp. were more attracted to tridecane-baited than unbaited traps in the field; however, there was no effect on egg predation. Altogether, while O. insidiosus is attracted to tridecane, this attraction did not always lead to higher predation, suggesting that this kairomone likely acts as an arrestant. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","BMSB; Conservative biological control; Halyomorpha halys; Invasive pests; Kairomones; Orius insidiosus","behavioral response; biological control; insect; invasive species; pest control; United States; Anthocoridae; Halyomorpha halys; Helianthus; Hexapoda; Orius; Orius insidiosus; Prunus persica; Vaccinium",2-s2.0-85007154331

SAV communities in the Upper Hudson River Estuary are comprised of species assemblages dominated by two very morphologically distinct species: the native Vallisneria americana, which has wide-strap shaped leaves that are completely submerged underwater, and the invasive Trapa natans, which produces leaf rosettes that float at the water's surface. Using characteristics of modeled tidal/riverine flow, we examined the distribution and composition of the predominant SAV in the estuary. SAV habitat space was, on average, well described by depth and flow. From a hydrodynamic standpoint however, the two species occupied very similar niche spaces. Species-specific distribution patterns and co-occurrence rates did not appear to be strongly controlled by physical tolerances of topography or flow. Other ecological drivers such as disturbance regimes, dispersal strategies, plant-animal interactions, and sediment chemistry and composition might explain distribution patterns and T. natans expansion more accurately, rather than hydrodynamics alone. Sixty years after reaching the Hudson River Estuary, T. natans appears unable to fully displace V. americana, despite significant overlap in habitat space and spatial distribution.

Due to a lack of statutory obligation and scientific evidence, the fishery has operated to date without any harvest-control rules that afford protection from overfishing. In response to fluctuations in landings and in pursuit of increased economic returns for their catch, some members of the fishing industry have adopted a size-selective harvesting regime, which we evaluate here using baseline data. Monthly samples were obtained from fishers operating out of five ports between October 2013 and May 2015 (N = 4233). All prawn were sexed, weighed and measured, whilst the fecundity of females was estimated for 273 (44%) individuals. Peak spawning occurred during the spring and females were estimated to undergo a 'puberty moult' at a carapace length (CL) of 7.7 mm, whilst functional maturity was estimated at a CL of 9.9 mm. The sampled population exhibited sexual dimorphism, with females attaining a greater size than males. The current harvesting regime results in a sex bias in landings as even large mature males remained under the recruitment size to the fishery, unlike the large mature females. The temporal trend in sex-ratio indicates a continual decrease in the catchability of female prawn through the fishing season; however, whether this is caused by depletion via fishing mortality or migratory behaviour is yet to be resolved.

We used a response-effect trait framework to characterize the impact of agricultural intensification on two ecosystem services delivered by arable plants to pollinator and non-pollinator insects and birds. Agricultural intensification was characterized by field position as a gradient of the impact of crop management at field scale and the surrounding landscape heterogeneity, which can be divided into compositional and configurational heterogenenity. Shifts in functional assemblages of response and effect traits were analyzed by multivariate analyses, whereas changes in single trait metrics were analyzed by mixed-model effects. At field scale, we found a trade-off between ruderal and competitive species. The contrasting disturbance regime from boundaries to inner-fields overflows the potential shifts in functional assemblages both for response and effect traits due to the gradient of landscape heterogeneity. Conversely, some response and effect single trait metrics changed along gradients of landscape heterogeneity. We thus propose a response-effect trait framework to capture functional relationships along different trophic levels. Compositional heterogeneity affected traits linked to the provision of suitable habitat for insects and birds, whereas configurational heterogeneity affected traits linked to pollination.

A possibility for CGMMV control is the use of cross-protection, for which stable attenuated isolates are required. In this study, an infectious clone was constructed for the hn isolate of CGMMV. Unexpectedly, this clone carried a nonconserved mutation involving a single nucleotide change resulting in the replacement of Arg by Cys at residue 284 of the replicase protein; this mutation correlated with delayed symptom induction and RNA accumulation, as shown in time-course experiments. Sequencing of the viral progeny showed that restoration of wild-type symptoms and increased RNA accumulation correlated with reversion of the mutation to the wildtype sequence, a phenomenon that occurred at approximately 7 to 10 days postinoculation. Thus, Arg284 seems to be crucial but not strictly necessary for virus infection. Subsequently, four other mutants in the triplet encoding Arg284 were constructed and assayed. Results showed that symptoms and their timing were diverse for the different mutants, with enhanced pathogenicity and RNA accumulation always correlating with reversion to Arg284. Therefore, the nature of the mutation strongly influenced the genetic stability of the mutant.

In this work, we investigated the effects of the exposure to a low environmental-simulated dose of UVB radiation on food consumption of tadpoles of the forest specialist Hypsiboas curupi [Hylidae, Anura] species. After UVB treatment tadpoles were divided and exposed to a visible light source or kept in the dark, in order to indirectly evaluate the efficiency of DNA repair performed by photolyases and nucleotide excision repair (NER), respectively. The body mass and the amount of food in tadpoles’ guts were verified in both conditions and these data were complemented by the micronuclei frequency in blood cells. Furthermore, the keratinized labial tooth rows were analyzed in order to check for possible UVB-induced damage in this structure. Our results clearly show that the body weight decrease induced by UVB radiation occurs due to the reduction of tadpoles’ food consumption. This behavior is directly correlated with the genotoxic impact of UVB light, since the micronuclei frequency significantly increased after treatments. Surprisingly, the results indicate that photoreactivation treatment was ineffective to restore the food consumption activity and body weight values, suggesting a low efficiency of photolyases enzymes in this species. In addition, UVB treatments induced a higher number of breaks in the keratinized labial tooth rows, which could be also associated with the decrease of food consumption.

Yet how they interact in natural settings remains unclear. Experiments have revealed two major mechanisms for the observed increase in primary productivity with plant species richness. Plant productivity may rise with species richness due to the increased amount of resources used by more diverse communities (niche complementarity) or through the increased probability of including a highly productive, dominant species in the community (sampling effect). Current evidence suggests that niche complementarity is the most relevant mechanism, whereas the sampling effect would only play a minor and transient role in natural systems. In turn, exotic species can invade by using untapped resources or because they possess a fitness advantage over resident species allowing them to dominate the community. We argue that the sampling effect can be a significant biodiversity mechanism in ecosystems invaded by dominant exotic species, and that the effect can be persistent even after decades of succession. We illustrate this idea by analyzing tree species richness–productivity relationships in a subtropical montane forest (NW Argentina) heavily invaded by Ligustrum lucidum, an evergreen tree from Asia. We found that the forest biomass increased along a natural gradient of tree species richness whether invaded by L. lucidum or not. Consistent with the sampling effect, L. lucidum invasion tripled total tree biomass irrespective of species richness, and monocultures of L. lucidum were more productive than any of the most species-rich, uninvaded communities. Hence, the sampling effect may not be restricted to randomly assembled, synthetic communities. We emphasize that studying invaded ecosystems may provide novel insights on the mechanisms underlying the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function. © 2017 The Authors",,"biodiversity; biological invasion; biomass; community dynamics; complementarity; ecosystem function; evergreen tree; invasive species; montane forest; primary production; sampling; species richness; subtropical region; succession; Argentina; Asia; Ligustrum lucidum",2-s2.0-85018311025

The responses of these networks to extreme environmental fluctuations are key to understanding the evolution of these networks and their roles in stabilizing ecological communities. From 2008 to 2009 we observed the effects of extreme differences in annual precipitation on a network of plants and flower-visiting insects in a xeric grassland. Significant decreases in plant and insect diversity in the dry year were mirrored by decreases in the number of network nodes and links. However, the relative density of network connections increased in the dry year and other important topological features, such as nestedness and modularity, were largely unchanged. The resilience of the network to node (plants or insect species) loss was high in both years. Though bees tend to dominate pollination communities in drier climes, we did not observe a shift in the relative richness of bee species in the dry year. Our results indicate that well-linked, drought-resistant plants are important to community resilience during ecologically challenging periods and that networks of plants and flowering-visiting insects may be robust to extreme climatic change, at least over short periods, as long as those critical, resilient hubs are protected. © 2017","Ecological network; Flower-visiting insects; Grassland; Pollination; Precipitation","bee; climate change; drought resistance; ecosystem resilience; environmental factor; flower visiting; grassland; nestedness; pollination; precipitation intensity; Apoidea; Hexapoda",2-s2.0-85017346006

We develop a system of integrodifference equations to explore the potential release of a castrating barnacle parasite Sacculina carcini to control spread and abundance of an invasive species, Carcinus maenas, the European green crab. We find that the parasite does not completely eradicate the green crab population, but has the potential to reduce its density. Our model suggests that the crab population is likely to outrun the spread of the parasite, causing two waves of invasion travelling at different speeds. By performing a sensitivity analysis, we investigate the effects of the demographic parameters on the speed of invasion.

Despite the importance of Batrachium species as an indicator of the sustainability of riverine ecosystems, studies on the genetic variation of Batrachium populations are rather scarce. Therefore, it is crucial to study Batrachium species diversity and population structures to understand the status of Batrachium species and populations and provide measures for evaluating the future risk of diversity loss. Sixteen Batrachium populations were analyzed using morphological characters and molecular markers (inter simple sequence repeats [ISSRs] and trnH-psbA sequences). The study revealed agreement between these types of data in distinguishing separate groups of species found in Lithuanian rivers. Our study revealed a clonal structure and a low level of genetic diversity in most of the studied Batrachium populations. The low degree of genetic diversity, high level of genetic differentiation and low level of gene flow between populations of riverine Batrachium species in Lithuania indicated that a conservation strategy should be adopted. Long-term observations should be carried out, and the condition of Batrachium species and the impact of anthropogenic activities should be evaluated.

The aim of this study was to search comprehensively for the Festuca pratensis chromosome regions affecting winter hardiness-related traits when introgressed into the Lolium perenne genome. Association between F. pratensis introgression and winter hardiness-related traits (fall and winter hardiness indexes, early-spring dry matter yield, and freezing tolerance) were screened in the diploid introgression populations (n = 203) that had some F. pratensis chromosome segments introgressed. Eighty-four intron markers corresponding to unique rice genes randomly distributed across the genome were used for genotyping. Winter hardiness of almost all plants in the introgression populations was lower than that of the F. pratensis and triploid hybrid parents, but the average was higher than that of L. perenne. A significant positive effect of F. pratensis introgression on early-spring dry matter yield was detected on chromosome 7. This quantitative trait locus (QTL) was confirmed by linkage analysis using a backcross population with F. pratensis introgression in the target region of chromosome 7. However, the contribution of the newly identified QTL was rather small (6.7–9.6%), suggesting that superior winter hardiness of F. pratensis compared to L. perenne is conferred by multiple small-effect QTLs. We also detected a previously unreported negative effect of Festuca introgression on winter hardiness.

Most knowledge on restoration is focused on planting seedlings of tree species from forest physiognomies. Alternatively, direct seeding can be an appropriate method to re-introduce plants of different life forms to restore savannas. We evaluated the initial establishment success under field conditions of 75 “Cerrado” native species (50 trees, 13 shrubs, and 12 grasses) in direct seeding experiments in four sites in Central Brazil for 2.5 years. For that, we tagged and measured tree and larger shrub species and estimated ground cover by small shrub and grass species. Sixty-two species became established (42 trees, 11 shrubs and 9 grasses) under field conditions. Thirty-eight of the 48 tagged species had relatively high emergence rates (>10%) and 41 had high seedling survival (>60%) in the first year.

However, it is selective of plants from which it forages. The preferred species are called bee-plants. The concept of bee-plants recognises that flowers do not have the same pollen and nectar value to honeybees. Thus, the strength of honeybee colonies is dependent on the presence of bee-plants throughout the year at any given locality. A study was conducted during March 2013-February 2015 to establish the presence of bee-plants and their phenology within 2 km radius of the apiary at ARC-Plant Protection Research Institute's farm in Rietondale, a suburb of Pretoria. A total of 247 flowering plant species from 70 families, comprising indigenous and exotic trees, shrubs and grasses, was recorded during March 2013-February 2014. Most plant species flowered during April, a smaller proportion during February and October, and only a few during June. Flowers of each plant species were sampled in order to make reference pollen grain slides. To determine bee-plants, a pollen trap was fitted to the entrance of one of five Langstroth hives on a fortnightly rotation during March 2014-February 2015 in order to intercept pollen pellets from the hind legs of returning foragers. A total of 2403 pollen pellets were recovered, most of which (1263) were collected during April and none during October. At the laboratory, about a quarter of each pellet was dissolved in distilled water and pollen grain slides were prepared. These slides were matched against reference pollen grain slides using a compound microscope. It was established that honeybees foraged from only 30 plant species. During summer (December-February), pollen was collected mostly from Persicaria capitata (Polygonaceae), Tithonia rotundifolia (Asteraceae) during autumn (March-May), Acacia galpinnii (Fabaceae) during winter (June-August), and Ageratum conyzoides (Asteraceae) during spring (September-November). These results show that honeybees had access to pollen sources that were sufficient to sustain their colonies throughout the year.

The experimental group (E.G.) learned with the AR-based contents, while the control group (C.G.) learned with the online-based support. The findings demonstrated the potential of AR techniques for supporting students' learning motivation and peer learning interaction, and the AR-based contents could be used as scaffolding to better support blended learning strategies. The AR-based learning interaction could also be a trigger arousing learners' interest in becoming active learners and the students presented great learning involvement after the AR-based supports were removed, while the learners in the C.G. were passive once the supports had been removed. Moreover, it was found that (1) their lack of experience with AR interaction and applications, (2) the slow speed of the Internet in the school, (3) the affordances of each learner's mobile learning devices, (4) the screen size of the learning interface and (5) the overloading of the learning information from the AR contents and teacher lectures might be the reasons why the learners were still more used to the online-based support.

We tested the hypothesis that D. sellowiana increases plant diversity in Brazilian Restinga forest, a biodiversity hotspot, by augmenting the habitat heterogeneity at a fine scale. To do this we quantified α-diversity and β-diversity in three habitat types: on the tree fern trunks, immediately beneath the trunks and away from the trunks. In total, 40 ferns were sampled. Overall we recorded 2602 individuals belonging to 61 phanerophyte species in 30 families. The number of individuals sampled varied among habitats but rarefaction showed that richness did not differ. In contrast, species composition varied markedly amongst habitats. Both statistical approaches detected high levels of β-diversity, particularly between the species found in the vicinity of the fern, and those in the samples away from the trunks. Indicator species analysis was used to identify the species characteristic of the different habitats. About 30% of the species were exclusively found in “away plots”, 17% were exclusively “below plots” and 15% were found only on the trunks, 13% were found on the trunks and below them, 12% on “bellow” and “away plots”, 10% of species occurred in all areas and 3% were found on trunks and “away plots”. Our results lead us to conclude that the endangered fern D. sellowiana plays an important role in promoting habitat heterogeneity within the Restinga forest.

However, previous studies have focused on hexaploid wheats, and few studies on the morphological and physiological plasticity of wheat plants. Six different wheat genotypes were tested under chilling stress to investigate the physio-morphological parameters as well as the loss of grain yield in growth chambers. RESULTS: Chilling stress resulted in significant loss in grain yield in all genotypes. Under chilling stress, diploid wheats generated zero harvest, and tetraploid genotypes also suffered from a pronounced loss in grain yield, compared with the control group. In contrast, hexaploid genotypes acquired relatively high maintenance rate of grain yield among three species. CONCLUSIONS: Diploid and tetraploid wheat genotypes maintained relatively large leaf area and high photosynthetic rates, but they were subjected to significant declines in vascular bundle number and productive tillers as a consequence of the inhibition by sink growth under chilling stress. The hexaploid wheats were found to have relatively low leaf area and photosynthetic rates. These genotypes also stored more soluble carbohydrates and exhibited stronger sink enhancement, ensuring the translocation and redistribution of assimilates.

This perspective combines insights from the philosophical tradition of phenomenology with commitments to the anti-essentialism and nonfoundationalism of American pragmatism. One of postphenomenology’s central positions is that technologies always remain “multistable,” i.e., subject to different uses and meanings. But I suggest that as this perspective matures, philosophical problems are emerging around the notion of multistability, what I call “the problem of invariance” and “the problem of grounding.” These problems point out things that remain unclear within the postphenomenological framework, such as how it handles structural claims regarding a technology’s various stabilities, and how it grounds its claims. How can postphenomenology make structural claims about technology and yet remain anti-essentializing? And on what epistemological basis does it ground its claims about human-technology relations? The paper concludes with a series of prescriptions that, if followed, enable postphenomenology to make edifying claims about technology, all while avoiding the problems of invariance and grounding, and maintaining its commitments to anti-essentialism and nonfoundationalism. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Multistability; Nonfoundationalism; Philosophy of technology; Postphenomenology; Pragmatism","Social sciences; Multi stabilities; Nonfoundationalism; Philosophy of technology; Postphenomenology; Pragmatism; Philosophical aspects",2-s2.0-84955312414

Tetraploid wheat ears exhibited higher relative water content and water-use efficiency than that of hexaploid wheat, under WS. The change in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity and carbon isotope composition indicated the absence of C4 metabolism in the ears of both species under both conditions. The improved performance of the tetraploid wheat ears under WS was associated with better water relations. © 2017, The Institute of Experimental Botany.","carbon isotope; ear photosynthesis; enzyme activity; water relations",,2-s2.0-85027953634

J.G. Sm. (Alismataceae) is an emergent aquatic plant native to southern USA. Imported into Australia and South Africa as an ornamental and aquarium plant, the species is now a serious invader of shallow freshwater wetlands, slow-flowing rivers, irrigation channels, drains and along the margins of lakes and reservoirs. As a first step towards initiating a classical biological control program, a population genetic study was conducted to determine the prospects of finding compatible biological control agents and to refine the search for natural enemies to source populations with closest genetic match to Australian and South African genotypes. Using AFLP markers we surveyed genetic diversity and population genetic structure in 26 populations from the USA, 19 from Australia and 7 from South Africa. Interestingly, we have established that populations introduced into South Africa and to a lesser extent Australia have maintained substantial molecular genetic diversity comparable with that in the native range. Results from principal coordinates analysis, population graph theory and Bayesian-based clustering analysis all support the notion that introduced populations in Australia and South Africa were founded by multiple sources from the USA. Furthermore, the divergence of some Australian populations from the USA suggests that intraspecific hybridization between genetically distinct lineages from the native range may have occurred.

We modeled occupancy (psi) and detection probability (P) and local- and landscape-scale environmental covariates. We developed a set of a priori candidate models for each species and ranked models using (Q)AICc. Detection probabilities and occupancy estimates differed among crayfish species with Orconectes eupunctus, O. marchandi, and Cambarus hubbsi being relatively rare (psi < 0.20) with moderate (0.46–0.60) to high (0.81) detection probability and O. punctimanus and O. ozarkae being relatively common (psi > 0.60) with high detection probability (0.81). Detection probability was often related to local habitat variables current velocity, depth, or substrate size. Important environmental variables for crayfish occupancy were species dependent but were mainly landscape variables such as stream order, geology, slope, topography, and land use.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive tool for species detection. However, most eDNA survey methods have been developed and applied in temperate zones. We tested the feasibility of using eDNA to survey anurans in tropical streams in the Brazilian Atlantic forest and compared the results with short-term visual and audio surveys. We detected all nine species known to inhabit our focal streams with one single visit for eDNA sampling. We found a higher proportion of sequence reads and larger number of positive PCR replicates for more common species and for those with life cycles closely associated with the streams, factors that may contribute to increased release of DNA in the water. However, less common species were also detected in eDNA samples, demonstrating the detection power of this method. Filtering larger volumes of water resulted in a higher probability of detection. Our data also show it is important to sample multiple sites along streams, particularly for detection of target species with lower population densities. For the three focal species in our study, the eDNA metabarcoding method had a greater capacity of detection per sampling event than our rapid field surveys, and thus, has the potential to circumvent some of the challenges associated with traditional approaches. Our results underscore the utility of eDNA metabarcoding as an efficient method to survey anuran species in tropical streams of the highly biodiverse Brazilian Atlantic forest. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","12S mitochondrial gene; amphibians; biodiversity; monitoring methods; next-generation sequencing; site occupancy–detection modelling",,2-s2.0-85031419468

Here, we investigated the distribution of L. kasmira on shallow and mesophotic reefs of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) using fish survey data collected from 2007 to 2016. L. kasmira was recorded at all islands or atolls of NWHI except for Gardner Pinnacles, Maro Reef, and Laysan Island—the middle region of the NWHI. It was most abundant at French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa at the southern end of the NWHI. On mesophotic reefs, L. kasmira was not observed at any locations north of French Frigate Shoals, except for one individual at Lisianski Island at an upper mesophotic depth. Small-bodied individuals were found more frequently at greater depths. L. kasmira was often observed along with Mulloidichthys vanicolensis (Valenciennes, 1831), Chromis acares Randall and Swerdloff, 1973, and Naso hexacanthus (Bleeker, 1855) on shallow-water reefs.

Much of the variation in the balance of facilitation and competition that individuals experience can be explained by the degree of physical stress and the sizes or ages of plants during the interaction. Germination phenology partly controls both of these factors, but its role in defining the facilitation-competition balance has not been explicitly considered. I performed an experiment in a population of the winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) to test whether germinating during physically stressful periods leads to facilitation while germinating during periods that promote growth and reproduction leads to competition. I manipulated germination and neighbor presence across two years in order to quantify the effects of the local plant community on survival, fecundity, and total fitness as a function of germination phenology. Neighbors increased survival when germination occurred under conditions that were unsuitable for survival, but they reduced fecundity in germinants that were otherwise the most fecund. Later germination was associated with facilitation in the first year but competition in the second year. These episodes of facilitation and competition opposed each other, leading to no net effect of neighbors when averaged over all cohorts. These results indicate that variation in germination timing can explain some of the variation in the facilitation-competition balance in plant communities. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","Arabidopsis thaliana; competition; facilitation; ontogeny; phenology; seed germination","angiosperm; competition (ecology); facilitation; fitness; germination; growth; ontogeny; phenology; plant community; reproduction; Arabidopsis thaliana; Brassicaceae",2-s2.0-85026675877

With jet travel arriving in Hawai'i the same year as statehood, the tourism industry, aided by the new state government, exploited Hawai'i's newfound prominence, luring planeloads of American tourists who thronged its beaches, hotels, and cultural spectacles. Tourism helped turn racial tolerance into a saleable, if intangible, commodity. Marketers invited mainlanders to partake in the islands' celebrated 'Aloha Spirit': An elusive vision of social harmony said to be the defining feature of the Hawai'i vacation. By attending ethnic festivals, eating exotic food, and interacting with locals, visitors might even bring some Aloha Spirit home with them. Hawai'i's society thus became not only a site of consumption, but an object of consumption itself. What such utopian ideas obscured was that the broader construction of Hawai'i as a multi-cultural paradise was part of state efforts both to transform Hawai'i's economy and to promote US influence in the Pacific. While the limited historiography on multi-culturalism situates its emergence in grassroots protest, this article argues for the elite origins of the multi-cultural ideal, which served the interests of both business and US foreign policy. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.",,"commodity; foreign policy; heritage tourism; historical perspective; minority group; multiculturalism; race; state role; tourism economics; twentieth century; Hawaii [United States]; United States",2-s2.0-85012206951

This important fungal pathogen is a major cause of larval death in invasive gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations in the United States. Airborne conidia of this pathogen are relatively large (similar in size to pollen), with unusual characteristics, and require specialized methods for collection and quantification. Initially, dry sampling (settling of spores from the air onto a dry surface) was used to confirm the detectability of E. maimaiga at field sites with L. dispar deaths caused by E. maimaiga, using quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods. We then measured the signal degradation of conidial DNA on dry surfaces under field conditions, ultimately rejecting dry sampling as a reliable method due to rapid DNA degradation. We modified a chamber-style trap commonly used in palynology to capture settling spores in buffer. We tested this wet-trapping method in a largescale (137-km) spore-trapping survey across gypsy moth outbreak regions in Pennsylvania undergoing epizootics, in the summer of 2016. Using 4-day collection periods during the period of late instar and pupal development, we detected variable amounts of target DNA settling from the air.

As a generalist, it is the most important eriophyoid mite attacking bulbous plants such as garlic, onion and tulip. To date, DBM has been recorded on host plants belonging to the families Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Melanthiaceae and Asparagaceae. However, a precise understanding of DBM host range is lacking as it is largely based on casual records of mites on plants, some of which may include accidental hosts. Moreover, the possible existence of cryptic species has not been considered. In this study the hypothesis that DBM may be a complex of distinct genetic lineages or cryptic species was tested by comparing the common barcode sequence marker mtDNA COI of specimens from several populations originating from the Netherlands and Poland. The population growth rate of DBM on seven agriculturally important plant species and on various parts of the garlic plant was also experimentally assessed in the laboratory. The results did not support the first hypothesis, and indicated that DBM populations originating from Poland and the Netherlands shared essentially the same genome. In addition, they indicated that DBM reached the highest population growth rate on leek and also displayed high growth rates on garlic, chive and red onion, whereas white onion and wheat were not colonized by the mites. Answering the question of whether DBM is a single polyphagous species rather than a complex of cryptic lineages is of particular importance since the misidentification of pests may lead to ineffective control strategies. Moreover, improved knowledge of DBM host range is essential for assessing risk to crops. © 2017, The Author(s).","Cryptic species; Garlic pest; Host adaptation; Host range; Host specificity; Laboratory rearing","adaptation; crop pest; crop plant; generalist; genetic analysis; genome; growth rate; herb; host range; host specificity; laboratory method; mite; population growth; risk assessment; taxonomy; wheat; Netherlands; Poland [Central Europe]; Acari; Acariformes; Aceria tulipae; Allium atrorubens; Allium cepa; Allium porrum; Allium sativum; Allium schoenoprasum; Amaryllidaceae; Asparagaceae; Eriophyidae; Eriophyoidea; Liliaceae; Melanthiaceae; Triticum aestivum; Tulipa",2-s2.0-85028601831

The premise is that Earth's entry into the “Anthropocene” represents what might be, from an astrobiological perspective, a predictable planetary transition. We explore this problem from the perspective of the solar system and exoplanet studies. Our classification discriminates planets by the forms of free energy generation driven from stellar forcing. We then explore how timescales for global evolutionary processes on Earth might be synchronized with ecological transformations driven by increases in energy harvesting and its consequences (which might have reached a turning point with global urbanization). Finally, we describe quantitatively the classification scheme based on the maintenance of chemical disequilibrium in the past and current Earth systems and on other worlds in the solar system. In this perspective, the beginning of the Anthropocene can be seen as the onset of the hybridization of the planet – a transitional stage from one class of planetary systems interaction to another. For Earth, this stage occurs as the effects of human civilization yield not just new evolutionary pressures, but new selected directions for novel planetary ecosystem functions and their capacity to generate disequilibrium and enhance planetary dissipation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Astrobiology; Biosphere; Climate change; Coupled Earth systems; Dissipation; Thermodynamics","Anthropocene; biosphere; civilization; climate change; climate modeling; Earth; energy dissipation; planet; solar system; thermodynamics",2-s2.0-85028699970

(Verbenaceae) is one of the most problematic plant invaders in South Africa and has been targeted for biological control for over 50 years. Essential oil constituents which often change in response to insect herbivory are reported to play a crucial role in plant-insect interactions. However, nothing is known about the chemical profiles of essential oils of L. camara varieties in South Africa and how this changes under herbivory. Therefore, essential oils were collected using hydrodistillation from undamaged and insect-damaged leaves of four L. camara varieties and analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to elucidate their chemical profiles. A total of 163 compounds were identified from the undamaged leaves of the various L. camara varieties. Feeding by the biocontrol agent Falconia intermedia Distant (Hemiptera: Miridae) resulted in changes in the quality and quantity of chemical constituents of the essential oils. Only 75 compounds were identified from the insect-damaged leaves of L. camara varieties.Terpenes were the major components across the varieties, while caryophyllene, hexane, naphthalene, copaene and α-caryophyllene were commonin all the varieties tested from both undamaged and insect-damaged leaves. Results from this study indicated the chemical distinctiveness of the Whitney Farm variety from other varieties. The changes in chemical concentrations indicated that feeding by the mirid on L. camara varieties causes an induction by either reducing or increasing the chemical concentrations. These inductions following the feeding by F. intermedia could be having a negative impact on the success of biological control against L. camara varieties. However, the focus of this paper is to report on the chemical baseline of L. camara varieties. Hence, comparisons of chemical compound concentrations of L. camara essential oils tested and the feeding-induced changes with respect to their quality and quantity are discussed. © Entomological Society of Southern Africa.","GC-MS; hydrodistillation; Miridae; South Africa; Verbenaceae.",,2-s2.0-85031128691

This article analyses discourses on LGBTI asylum in the UK, and focuses in particular on the relationship between liberalism, nationhood and hospitality. Using the methods of discourse analysis it demonstrates that, with asylum, queerness becomes a porous frontier in and out of the nation. Looking firstly at narratives of asylum cases, the article shows how they create a specific temporality, where queer futures are deemed impossible outside of the UK. Then, it looks at how the tropes of the domestic homophobic past and the homophobic elsewhere interact in discourses to produce a unique type of politicization of asylum, whereby British liberal queers can be invested in defending the rights of LGBTI asylum seekers. Finally, the article unpacks what constitutes the promise of ‘happy queer futures’ in the UK. Doing so, it shows that homonationalism is more than a collusion between certain gay and lesbian subjectivations and the liberal state, but rather that it provides complex ways of understanding and articulating sexuality, nationhood and homonormative practices. The article will thus argue that happiness works as an exhortation as much as a promise in asylum, and that the queer futurism offered by homonationalist discourses on asylum perpetuate a dream of the good life – albeit a homonormative conception of it, where happiness, individual freedom and autonomy on the market are closely intertwined. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","asylum; liberalism; migration; nation; queer",,2-s2.0-85026877740

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of high soil compaction and low soil moisture content on inhibition of the germination of understory seeds in Eucalyptus forests and thus would result in the scarcity of understory vegetation. Materials and methods: The soil water content above the depth of 1 m of six major understory vegetation types was analyzed to determine if there was a correlation between soil water content and understory vegetation. The effects of soil treatment (soil-loosening vs. no soil-loosening) and water supply amount (2500, 2000, 1500, 1000, 500, 250, or 0 ml of water per day) on the seed germination rate of Stylosanthes sp. were explored using an artificial climate chamber experiment. Influence of soil source (five Eucalyptus forest soils vs. two non-Eucalyptus forest soils) and water supply (0, 50, 150, 200, or 400 ml of water every day) on the germination rate of five types of seed were assessed using a three-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results and discussion: Soil-loosening and water supply significantly (P < 0.05) increased seed germination rate with the contribution rates of 26.14 and 42.93 %, respectively. Analysis of variance for three-factor experiments revealed a significant (P < 0.05) effect of water supply and vegetation seed type on the germination rate of plant seeds. No significant effect of soil type was observed on germination rate, indicating that germination rate was not affected by soils in Eucalyptus forest. Conclusions: The conservation of soil characteristics, such as water content and compaction, during the development of a Eucalyptus forest plantation may be an effective strategy for encouraging the growth of understory vegetation. This study highlights the importance that in dry areas or areas prone to long-term drought, it would be preferable to retain native vegetation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Environmental degradation; Eucalypt forest; Soil drought; Soil seed bank; Understory vegetation","compaction; drought; environmental degradation; evergreen forest; forest soil; germination; inhibition; interspecific interaction; legume; plantation forestry; seed bank; soil quality; soil type; soil water; understory; vegetation type; water availability; Eucalyptus; Stylosanthes",2-s2.0-84963762203

Vespa velutina has since spread rapidly across Europe, facilitated by suitable climatic conditions and the ability of a single nest to disperse many mated queens over a large area. Yellow-legged hornets are a major concern because of the potential impact they have on populations of many beneficial pollinators, most notably the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), which shows no effective defensive behaviours against this exotic predator. Here, we present the first report of this species in Great Britain. Actively foraging hornets were detected at two locations, the first around a single nest in Gloucestershire, and the second a single hornet trapped 54 km away in Somerset. The foraging activity observed in Gloucestershire was largely restricted to within 700 m of a single nest, suggesting highly localised movements. Genetic analyses of individuals from the Gloucestershire nest and the single hornet from Somerset suggest that these incursions represent an expansion of the European population, rather than a second incursion from Asia. The founding queen of the Gloucestershire nest mated with a single male, suggesting that sexual reproduction may have occurred in an area of low nest density. Whilst the nest contained diploid adult males, haploid ‘true’ males were only present at the egg stage, indicating that the nest was detected and removed before the production of queens. Members of the public reported additional dead hornets associated with camping equipment recently returned from France and imported timber products, highlighting possible pathways of incursion. The utility of microsatellites to inform surveillance during an incursion and the challenge of achieving eradication of this damaging pest are discussed. © 2017 Budge et al.

The study includes a spatial survey along the coast of North Holland (Netherlands) and an in-situ experiment for the burial of silt. Densities of E. directus appeared highest close to the coast in the siltiest sediment, where also the highest body mass index values (BMI) were found suggesting the best conditions for growth. The largest specimens with the lowest BMI were found at the less silty, outermost off-shore stations. In the shallow (10 m) zone a “lander” frame was deployed at the seabed containing ~ 100 pvc tubes filled with silt free sand that each hosted either a living E. directus, an empty shell, or bare sand. After three 3-weeks periods the silt content in the different tubes was determined and compared. The silt content around a living E. directus appeared 34% (spring) and 12% (autumn) higher than around an empty vertical shell, and 56% (spring) higher than in bare sand. We discuss the different pathways along which silt is brought into subsurface sediment layers and speculate about the potential role of E. directus in the coastal sediment and silt dynamics. It is estimated that E. directus facilitates the (temporal) burial of up to 6 Mton of fine particles in the coastal zone annually. This equals up to 27% of the annual SPM transport along the Dutch coast and is between 45 and 85% of the annual influx into the western Wadden Sea.

If the human body is to maintain thermal equilibrium, then this metabolic heat must be transferred to the ambient surroundings at the same rate. The heat loss from the human body occurs through a combination of heat transfer processes, such as respiratory heat exchange, convection, radiation and evaporation. If the heat loss from the human body to the ambient surroundings is less than the metabolic heat produced, the excess will be accumulated within the human body, which will result in a rise in the core and skin temperatures.

We used matrix models to describe how density and population growth rate of Centaurea solstitialis varies in time and space. Matrix models were parameterized with data collected over 4 years from invasions at the coast, interior valleys and Sierra Nevada Mountains in California (USA). Asymptotic population growth rates (λ) varied dramatically across all populations and years (0.24–6.45), density varied by an order of magnitude and had a measurable effect on survival and λ in all populations. We used simulations to estimate the degree to which a biocontrol agent would need to reduce plant survival to control the weed. Because seedling survival was dependent on density, an agent that reduced seedling density had the effect of increasing the probability that the remaining plants survived to flowering. Interestingly, this meant that in the highest density populations the plant had the largest compensatory response to agent attack and experienced decline (λ ≤ 1.0) only after heavy losses (≥90%) to the agent. Conversely, in populations where density was so low that it had only a weak effect on survival, the agent was able to control the plant (λ ≤ 1.0) at much lower levels of attack (≤50%). In other words, the impact of a biocontrol agent is predicted to be lower where the plant reaches its highest densities because the surviving plants, now experiencing less intraspecific competition, are more likely to survive to flowering and produce more seeds. This may also be true for other invasive species in which strong density dependent processes are operating. For this reason, prospective agents ought to target density-independence vital rates. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Biocontrol; Density dependence; Matrix model","biocontrol agent; biological control; density dependence; ecological modeling; flowering; herb; intraspecific competition; invasive species; population growth; spatiotemporal analysis; survival; weed control; California; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Centaurea solstitialis",2-s2.0-85020498805

We monitored plant composition following Tamarix control along hydrologic, soil, and climatic gradients in 244 treated and 172 reference sites across six U.S. states. This represents the largest comprehensive assessment to date on the vegetation response to the four most common Tamarix control treatments. Biocontrol by a defoliating beetle (treatment 1) reduced the abundance of Tamarix less than active removal by mechanically using hand and chain-saws (2), heavy machinery (3) or burning (4). Tamarix abundance also decreased with lower temperatures, higher precipitation, and follow-up treatments for Tamarix resprouting. Native cover generally increased over time in active Tamarix removal sites, however, the increases observed were small and was not consistently increased by active revegetation. Overall, native cover was correlated to permanent stream flow, lower grazing pressure, lower soil salinity and temperatures, and higher precipitation. Species diversity also increased where Tamarix was removed. However, Tamarix treatments, especially those generating the highest disturbance (burning and heavy machinery), also often promoted secondary invasions of exotic forbs. The abundance of hydrophytic species was much lower in treated than in reference sites, suggesting that management of southwestern U.S. rivers has focused too much on weed control, overlooking restoration of fluvial processes that provide habitat for hydrophytic and floodplain vegetation. These results can help inform future management of Tamarix-infested rivers to restore hydrogeomorphic processes, increase native biodiversity and reduce abundance of noxious species. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","Diorhabda; exotic species control; management of biological invasions; plant communities; saltcedar; tamarisk","abundance; angiosperm; beetle; biodiversity; biological control; biological invasion; disturbance; plant community; weed control; United States; Coleoptera; Diorhabda; Tamaricaceae; Tamarix",2-s2.0-85028586428

Quagga mussel D. bugensis (Andrusov, 1897), a second invasive mussel to North America, has yet to be detected in Manitoba waters. The establishment and continued spread of zebra mussels is of concern. Accordingly, we developed two species-specific and one Dreissena-specific qPCR-based environmental DNA (eDNA) assays designed as a single multiplexed reaction able to identify the presence of zebra mussel and infer the presence of quagga mussel in water samples from at-risk and invaded locations. In 2014, samples were collected from four invaded harbours on Lake Winnipeg during the early (May) and late (October) seasons. Zebra mussel eDNA was detected in 0–33.3% of samples per site early in the season, whereas late season sample detection ranged from 42.9 to 100%. In order to confirm that there was no nonspecific amplification of DNA from local biota, samples were also collected from sites where neither adult nor veliger-stage zebra mussels had been previously observed. These sites included three harbours on Lake Winnipeg and six sites within the Manitoban portion of the Red River. No amplification of eDNA was recorded at these sites except for that at a float-plane dock in the Red River upstream of Lake Winnipeg. Zebra mussels were subsequently detected at this location by sampling for transformed attached individuals.

One of the key characteristics supporting species invasiveness may be species ability to adapt to wide range of environmental conditions. It has been hypothesized that increased ability to adapt to wide range of conditions may be related to polyploidization. Experimental studies comparing the ability to adapt to novel conditions between native and invasive populations of different cytotypes of the same species are, however, still largely missing. We used Vicia cracca, a species known to occur in two different cytotypes in its native range in Europe and being an important invader in North America. We investigate if known cytotypes of Vicia cracca from the native and invasive range differ in their ability to adapt to environmental variation. To do this, we grew plants of both cytotypes from the native and invasive range in a common garden and exposed half of the plants to experimental shading to simulate environmental variation potentially occurring at the localities of the species. The study confirmed previous expectation that only polyploid plants occur in the invasive range. The study, however, did not support the expectation that the tetraploids would be superior to the diploids from the native range or have better ability to cope with shading. The performance and plasticity of tetraploids from the invasive range was in most cases different from the European tetraploids and differed between the two areas in the invasive range. This may suggest that the tetraploids underwent strong post-invasive evolution and have adapted in different ways to the specific condition of the different parts of the invaded area. Alternatively, it may indicate that the invasive range was created by colonizers from different areas possessing distinct adaptations. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Autopolyploid; Biological invasions; Common garden experiments; Cytotype; EICA hypothesis; Evolutionary change; Phenotypic plasticity","cytology; divergence; environmental conditions; evolutionary biology; experimental study; introduced species; invasive species; invasiveness; legume; native species; phenotypic plasticity; polyploidy; range expansion; Europe; North America; Vicia cracca",2-s2.0-85028840291

Examining changes in species abundance structures at a continental scale enables robust evaluation of climate change influences, but few studies have conducted these evaluations due to limited data and methodological constraints. In this study, we estimate temporal changes in abundance from North American Breeding Bird Survey data at the scale of physiographic strata to examine the relative influence of different components of climatic factors and evaluate the hypothesis that shifting species distributions are multidirectional in resident bird species in North America. We quantify the direction and velocity of the abundance shifts of 57 permanent resident birds over 44 years using a centroid analysis. For species with significant abundance shifts in the centroid analysis, we conduct a more intensive correlative analysis to identify climate components most strongly associated with composite change of abundance within strata. Our analysis focus on two contrasts: the relative importance of climate extremes vs. averages, and of temperature vs. precipitation in strength of association with abundance change. Our study shows that 36 species had significant abundance shifts over the study period. The average velocity of the centroid is 5.89 km·yr−1. The shifted distance on average covers 259 km, 9% of range extent. Our results strongly suggest that the climate change fingerprint in studied avian distributions is multidirectional. Among 6 directions with significant abundance shifts, the northwestward shift was observed in the largest number of species (n = 13). The temperature/average climate model consistently has greater predictive ability than the precipitation/extreme climate model in explaining strata-level abundance change. Our study shows heterogeneous avian responses to recent environmental changes. It highlights needs for more species-specific approaches to examine contributing factors to recent distributional changes and for comprehensive conservation planning for climate change adaptation.

It became established in Hong Kong in 1965, in Japan in the 1990’s and South America in 1991 through ballast water discharge into the La Plata River basin in Argentina. It has since expanded to Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil in South America. Populations have steadily increased in these countries since their first reported incidence. The golden mussel is not yet present in North America. A Risk Assessment of golden mussel for the Province of Ontario, Canada was performed using a four step process, developed by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry: While the potential impacts of an invasion of golden mussel in the Great Lakes has been well documented, the likelihood of a wide spread invasion (i.e., the likelihood of arrival, survival, establishment and spread) was further investigated. Uncertainty for each of the four stages of invasion was also estimated. The risk assessment ranked ballast water exchange of Atlantic transoceanic vessels from South America as the primary potential pathway for introduction of golden mussel directly into the Great Lakes. A “back door” entry into the Great Lakes was also considered via overland dispersal (e.g. trailered boats) following a ballast water exchange introduction by transoceanic vessels from Asia to the Pacific coast of North America. However, the overall probability of arrival through these two pathways was ranked low. The probability of survival, establishment, and spread of golden mussel in Ontario was deemed to be low, primarily because of its physiological intolerance of cold, winter waters. The level of uncertainty was considered moderate as there has been no golden mussel invasion reported from lakes that freeze over in Asia or South America for at least two months. Based on the current distribution of golden mussel being limited mostly to waters with minimum temperatures of 10 °C to 12 °C at 36º latitude, the Climatch analysis, and the number of degree days required for reproduction and establishment, the level of risk for invasion into Ontario waters is low and the level of uncertainty is moderate. This would likely apply to all of Canada and most of the USA north of the 36th parallel that is covered by snow or where lakes have ice cover for at least two months of the year. An analysis of the impact of climate change on golden mussel in Ontario suggests that summer temperatures in Lake Erie could rise to levels that would support reproduction and establishment by 2040. However, the lowest temperature reported to support establishment of mussels is 5 °C and it is estimated it would likely take more than 200 years to reach and maintain this temperature in Lake Erie. © 2017 The Author(s) and 2017 REABIC.","Aquatic invasive species; Arrival; Establishment; Spread; Survival",,2-s2.0-85027700706

Higher expression of stress-responsive proteome contributes for greater defence against abiotic stresses. Thus, P. hysterophorus could be a rich source of genes that encode stress-imparting mechanisms and systems. The present study utilizes comparative physiological and proteomic approaches for identification of key proteins involved in stress-defence of P. hysterophorus. Thirty-days-old plants were exposed to drought (10% PEG 6000) and salinity (160 mM NaCl) for 10 days duration. Both stresses induced oxidative stress estimated in terms of TBARS and H2O2. Levels of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were elevated, more by drought than salinity. Particularly, SOD, GR, CAT and GST proved to be assisting as very commendable defence under drought, as well as salinity. Levels of ascorbate, glutathione and proline were also increased by both stresses, more in response to drought. Comparative proteomics analysis revealed a significant change in relative abundance of 72 proteins under drought and salinity. Drought and salinity increased abundance of 45 and 41 proteins and decreased abundance of 24 and 26 proteins, respectively. Drought and salinity increased and decreased abundance of 31 and 18 proteins, respectively. The functions of identified proteins included those related to defence response (26%), signal transduction (13%), transcription and translation (10%), growth and development (8.5%), photosynthesis (8.5%), metabolism (7%), terpenoid biosynthesis (5.5%), protein modification and transport (7%), oxido-reductase (4%) and Miscellaneous (11%). Among the defence related proteins, antioxidants and HSPs constituted 26% and 21%, respectively. Present study suggests a potential role of defence proteins. Proteins involved in molecular stabilization, formation of osmolytes and wax and contributing to stress-avoiding anatomical features emerged as key and complex mechanisms for imparting stress tolerance to P. hysterophorus. © 2017 Ahmad et al.

Among the unsorted, alcohol-preserved material stored in the Formicidae Collection of the ‘El Colegio de la Frontera Sur’ Research Center (Chetumal, Mexico), we found nine colonies of the ponerine ant Neoponera villosa, that had been collected in bromeliads at Calakmul (Campeche, Mexico) in 1999. Ants and their brood were revised for the presence of any sign of parasitism. Cocoons were dissected and their content examined under a stereomicroscope. Six N. villosa prepupae had been attacked by the ectoparasitoid syrphid fly Hypselosyrphus trigonus Hull (Syrphidae: Microdontinae), to date the only known dipteran species of the Microdontinae with a parasitoid lifestyle. In addition, six male pupae from three colonies contained gregarious endoparasitoid wasps. These were specialized in parasitizing this specific host caste as no gyne or worker pupae displayed signs of having been attacked. Only immature stages (larvae and pupae) of the wasp could be obtained. Due to the long storage period, DNA amplification failed; however, based on biological and morphological data, pupae were placed in the Encyrtidae family. This is the first record of an encyrtid wasp parasitizing N. villosa, and the second example of an encyrtid as a primary parasitoid of ants. Furthermore, it is also the first record of co-occurrence of a dipteran ectoparasitoid and a hymenopteran endoparasitoid living in sympatry within the same population of host ants. Our findings highlight the importance of biological collections as reservoirs of hidden biodiversity, not only at the taxonomic level, but also at the behavioral level, revealing complex living networks.

This study was conducted at six representative sites with increasing signs of canopy disturbance attributed to grazing pressure. We used faeces density as a proxy of grazing pressure at each site. We assessed the total plant cover, shrub and perennial grass cover, total standing aboveground biomass (AGB), litter mass and belowground biomass (BGB) at each site. We further estimated the content of organic C, lignin and soluble phenols in plant compartments and the content of organic C, organic C in humic substances (recalcitrant C) and water soluble C (labile C) in soil at each site. Total plant cover was significantly related to grazing pressure. Standing AGB and litter mass decreased with increasing canopy disturbance while BGB did not vary across sites. Total organic C stock and the organic C stock in standing AGB increased with increasing total plant, shrub, and perennial grass cover. The organic C stock in litter mass increased with increasing total plant and shrub cover, while the organic C stock in BGB did not vary across sites. Lignin content in plant compartments increased with increasing total and shrub cover, while soluble phenols content did not change across sites. The organic C stock and the water soluble C content in soil were positively associated with perennial grass cover. Changes in total plant cover induced by grazing pressure negatively affected the size of the total organic C stock, having minor impact on the size of belowground than aboveground components. The reduction of perennial grass cover was reflected in decreasing chemical quality of the organic C stock in soil. Accordingly, plant managerial strategies should not only be focused on the amount of organic C sequestered but also on the chemical quality of organic C stocks since C chemistry could have an important impact on ecosystem functioning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Arid ecosystems; C chemistry; Grazing disturbance; Organic C stocks perennial grass; Water soluble C","lignin; phenol derivative; aboveground biomass; arid environment; belowground biomass; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; ecosystem function; environmental disturbance; grass; grazing pressure; litter; rangeland; sheep; shrub; soil carbon; soil-vegetation interaction; vegetation cover; Argentina; Article; biomass; canopy; chemistry; density; feces; grazing; humic substance; nonhuman; pressure; rangeland; sheep; soil; Argentina; Monte; Patagonia; Ovis aries",2-s2.0-85019619894

In response, artificial cavities are often implemented as a conservation strategy. Effective artificial cavity programs require recognition of specific nest-site characteristics, which can be major determinants of survival and persistence of cavity-nesting seabirds. In Bermuda, we monitored 158 natural and 178 artificial cavities of the White-tailed Tropicbird (Phaethon lepturus catesbyi) from 2013-2015 to determine if specific nest-site characteristics could explain cavity selection, nest survival, and predation by introduced rats (Rattus spp.) and the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). We found that tropicbirds preferred natural cavities lined with sand, and which had smaller entrances and were located on steeper cliffs. Occupancy of artificial cavities on the mainland varied across years and increased with cavity depth, whereas neither variable had any effect on artificial cavity occupancy on satellite islands. Clutch survival declined in cavities with rubble in nesting sand, and those with shallower cavity depths and larger entrance heights. Nestling survival varied by year, declined as the nesting season progressed, and increased with nestling age. Rat predation was significantly higher on mainland sites compared with satellite islands. Crow predation occurred only on offshore island sites, where natural cavities and shallower cavities with larger entrance heights were vulnerable. Rat and crow predation rates varied across years. Our results suggest multiple nest-site characteristics and temporal factors are important predictors of productivity in White-tailed Tropicbirds. Conservationists should simultaneously consider nest-cavity siting and dimensions, while they conduct biosecurity and predator control to improve the nest success of cavity-nesting seabirds.","Artificial nests; cavities; crow predation; nest selection; nest success; rat predation; tropicbirds","artificial nest; clutch size; conservation planning; habitat selection; monitoring; nest site; nesting success; nestling; nestmate recognition; persistence; predator control; rodent; seabird; survival; vulnerability; Bermuda; Corvus brachyrhynchos; Phaethon lepturus; Phaethon lepturus catesbyi; Phaethontidae; Rattus",2-s2.0-85029533590

Detecting extrapolation into novel conditions is a critical step in evaluating bioclimatic projections of how species and ecosystems will respond to climate change. However, biologically informed novelty detection methods remain elusive for many modeling algorithms. To assist with bioclimatic model design and evaluation, we present a first-approximation assessment of general novelty based on a simple and consistent characterization of climate. We build on the seminal global analysis of Williams et al. (2007 PNAS, 104, 5738) by assessing of end-of-21st-century novelty for North America at high spatial resolution and by refining their standardized Euclidean distance into an intuitive Mahalanobian metric called sigma dissimilarity. Like this previous study, we found extensive novelty in end-of-21st-century projections for the warm southern margin of the continent as well as the western Arctic. In addition, we detected localized novelty in lower topographic positions at all latitudes: By the end of the 21st century, novel climates are projected to emerge at low elevations in 80% and 99% of ecoregions in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, respectively. Novel climates are limited to 7% of the continent's area in RCP4.5, but are much more extensive in RCP8.5 (40% of area). These three risk factors for novel climates – regional susceptibility, topographic position, and the magnitude of projected climate change – represent a priori evaluation criteria for the credibility of bioclimatic projections. Our findings indicate that novel climates can emerge in any landscape. Interpreting climatic novelty in the context of nonlinear biological responses to climate is an important challenge for future research. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bioclimate; climate change; climate envelope; Mahalanobis distance; model extrapolation; no-analog; novel climates; species distribution modeling","algorithm; bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; spatial distribution; species diversity; climate change; ecosystem; food chain; forecasting; North America; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Forecasting; North America",2-s2.0-85014392636

After its partial foundering in 2012, the Costa Concordia remained adjacent to the eastern coast of Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), in the Tyrrhenian Sea, for over two years. Its salvage required high-impact engineering works, during the course of which monitoring of benthic communities was undertaken.

Sampling activity was performed during the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014. In parallel, chemical and physical water parameters were measured continuously from summer 2012 to the end of summer 2014, in order to detect any perturbation in natural conditions caused by salvage activities. We assessed the ecological quality of coralligenous habitats by applying the COARSE (COralligenous Assessment by ReefScape Estimate) index, based on the RVA approach. Slight modifications were applied to one of the descriptors of the COARSE index in order to adjust for study site features. There was clear evidence of a reduction in coralligenous habitats quality. Assemblages, slope, type of pressure, and distance from the source of disturbance played a pivotal role in characterizing bottom quality. The index was shown to have an easy and cost-effective application, even in waters deeper than its calibration specification; furthermore, the modification reported here may increase its potential applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioconcretions; COARSE index; Coralligenous habitats; Costa Concordia; Mediterranean benthic communities","Biodiversity; Cost effectiveness; Reefs; Salvaging; Benthic communities; Bioconcretions; COARSE index; Costa Concordia; Ecological quality; Mediterranean sea; Natural conditions; Visual assessments; Ecosystems; benthos; calibration; coastal zone; coral reef; environmental disturbance; environmental monitoring; habitat quality; habitat structure; salvaging; visual analysis; wreck; Argentina; Argentina; Concordia; Entre Rios; Giglio; Grosseto [Tuscany]; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Tuscan Archipelago; Tuscany; Tyrrhenian Sea",2-s2.0-85019234225

Compared to global plant element concentrations and stoichiometry, the leaves of larch stands had higher C, P, C:N and C:P but lower N and N:P, and the roots had greater P and C:N but lower N, C:P and N:P. Our study provides baseline information for describing the changes in nutritional elements with plant growth, which will facilitates plantation forest management and restoration, and makes a valuable contribution to the global data pool on leaf nutrition and stoichiometry. © 2017 Li et al.

Here, we explored consensus methods as a means of reducing uncertainty and improving model transferability in anticipating the potential distribution of an invasive moth (Hyphantria cunea). Individual native-range niche models were calibrated using seven modelling algorithms and four environmental datasets, representing different degrees of dimensionality, spatial correlation, and ecological relevance, and showing different degrees of climate niche expansion. Four consensus methods were used to combine individual niche models; we assessed transferability of consensus models and the individual models used to generate them. The results suggested that ideal criteria for environmental variable selection vary among algorithms, as different algorithms showed different sensitivities to spatial dimensionality and correlation. Consensus models reflected the central tendency of individual models, and reduced uncertainty by consolidating consistency across individual models, but did not outperform individual models. The question of whether interpolation accuracy comes at the expense of transferability suggests caution in planning methodologies for processing niche models to predict invasive potential. These explorations outline approaches by which to reduce uncertainty and improve niche model transferability with vital implications for ensemble forecasting. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Algorithm; Biological invasion; Consensus model; Ecological niche models; Model transferability","algorithm; biological invasion; biological method; correlation; data set; ecological modeling; home range; individual-based model; interpolation; invasive species; moth; niche; range expansion; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; Hyphantria cunea; Lepidoptera",2-s2.0-85019640477

Smith); “YCA”) is known for its aggressive predatory ability and ability to exert exploitation competition on both native and other invasive ants via floral nectar. We argue that YCA invasion can exert both interference and exploitation competition on legitimate pollinators. In pumpkin fields (Cucurbita maxima L.) of south India, YCA infested the flowers, particularly the pistillate flowers, for nectar foraging. Pumpkin is a honey bee-mediated cross-pollinated monoecious plant that produces disproportionately very few pistillate flowers. We hypothesize that YCA presence in the flowers can affect the visitation rate and foraging time of honey bees in the flowers, the fruit set in pumpkins, and can exert predatory pressure on the honey bees if the bees linger in ant-colonized flowers. Both YCA and honey bees preferred to forage on the limited pistillate flowers in the plants. After colonizing the flowers, YCA did not retreat for hours, even upon disturbance by competitors, such as honey bees. Both the visitation frequency and the foraging time of honey bees were drastically reduced in ant-colonized flowers, and none of the ant-colonized flowers developed into fruits, suggesting that the YCA exert both an ecological and evolutionary pressure on pumpkin. The ants preyed upon about 17% of the honey bees that lingered in ant-colonized flowers, and the time the bees spent foraging predicted the fate of the bees. Exploitation competition exerted by the YCA on pumpkin may have far-reaching consequences for the pollination and productivity of this cash crop. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG Switzerland.","Competition; Crop production; Honey bee; Invasive species; Mutualism; Pollination; Pollination crisis","aggregation behavior; ant; competition (ecology); crop production; floral trait; flower visiting; honeybee; invasive species; mutualism; native species; pollination; vegetable; Anoplolepis gracilipes; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Cucurbita; Cucurbita maxima; Formicidae; Paratrechina longicornis",2-s2.0-85020730586

Potrero de los Funes Village (San Luis, Argentina) is experiencing not only a population increase during summer months due to tourism but also an accelerated growth of its permanent population. In order to evaluate the potential effects of urbanization, the environmental quality of Potrero de los Funes River and Las Chacras Stream was assessed, using physical–chemical and biological indicators. Macroinvertebrates, through the application of the Biotic Index for San Luis Sierras (BISLS), anuran amphibian richness and relative abundance, and riparian vegetation were used as bioindicators. While the Simplified Index of Water Quality (SIWQ) was used to characterize the physical–chemical quality of water at each site. SIWQ and BISLS scores were significantly different between sites (F7,28 = 9.88, p &lt;.001 and F7,28 = 24.18, p &lt;.001, respectively). SIWQ was significantly correlated with BISLS (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.8, p &lt;.001). Four anuran species were registered along Potrero River, with no significant differences in the intensity of vocalizations between sites. No species were detected in Las Chacras Stream. Average total plant species richness, exotic plants richness, and vegetation cover were higher at the most impaired system, Las Chacras Stream. The principal component analysis showed that the first two principal components (PCs) explained 76.3% of the total variance. PC1, with strong loadings of SIWQ, BISLS, and amphibian richness, was principally driven by chemical water quality and biological conditions. PC2 was mainly determined by plant richness. The chemical and biological water quality of Potrero and Las Chacras is somewhat impaired, being the upper Las Chacras Stream the most compromised area.

However, the consequences of this for litter decomposition, and the mechanisms that underpin ecosystem responses, remain poorly understood. Moreover, few studies have determined how nutrient pools and fluxes shift as invader density increases and whether these effects persist following invader removal, despite the importance of this for understanding the timing and magnitude of invader impacts in ecosystems. We tested how the decomposition rates of four co-occurring grass species were influenced by changes in the density of the globally invasive N-fixing shrub Cytisus scoparius L. (Scotch broom) and whether these effects persisted following invader removal. We used a series of laboratory decomposition assays to disentangle the roles of changes in both litter quality and soil properties associated with increases in broom density. Broom invasion created a soil environment, such as higher rates of net N-mineralisation, which retarded litter decomposition. Litter C/N ratios of co-occurring species decreased as broom density increased, yet this had no effect on decomposition rates. Most relationships between broom density and impacts were nonlinear; this could explain some of the reported variation in invasive species impacts across previous studies that do not account for invader density. Ecosystem properties only partially recovered following invader removal, as broom left a legacy of increased N-availability in both soils and litter. Our findings suggest that invasive N-fixer impacts on soil properties, such as N-availability, were more important than changes in litter quality in altering decomposition rates of co-occurring species. © 2016, The Author(s).","abundance–impact curves; density gradient; ecosystem legacy effects; invasive plant removal; nitrogen mineralisation rate; Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius); soil microbial community","abundance; biomineralization; coexistence; decomposition; ecological impact; ecosystem function; ecosystem response; grass; invasive species; litter; nitrogen fixation; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; population density; removal experiment; shrub; soil microorganism; species occurrence; Cytisus scoparius",2-s2.0-85008192218

Protecting this resource for human health depends upon understanding which plants are used and how use patterns will change over time. The increasing use of introduced plants in local pharmacopoeia has been explained by their greater abundance or accessibility (availability hypothesis), their ability to cure medical conditions that are not treated by native plants (diversification hypothesis), or as a result of the introduced plants’ having many different simultaneous roles (versatility hypothesis). In order to describe the role of introduced plants in Ecuador, and to test these three hypotheses, we asked if introduced plants are over-represented in the Ecuadorian pharmacopoeia, and if their use as medicine is best explained by the introduced plants’ greater availability, different therapeutic applications, or greater number of use categories. Drawing on 44,585 plant-use entries, and the checklist of >17,000 species found in Ecuador, we used multi-model inference to test if more introduced plants are used as medicines in Ecuador than expected by chance, and examine the support for each of the three hypotheses above. We find nuanced support for all hypotheses. More introduced plants are utilized than would be expected by chance, which can be explained by geographic distribution, their strong association with cultivation, diversification (except with regard to introduced diseases), and therapeutic versatility, but not versatility of use categories. Introduced plants make a disproportionately high contribution to plant medicine in Ecuador.

They have been designated based on the presence of old-growth species and structures, and are considered to indicate long-term forest cover. To test whether WKHs do particularly occur in continuous forest land and to explore the scale dependence of relationships between WKH presence and their historical and environmental properties, we analysed them at five spatial scales (from stand to landscape: 80–2500 m) and referring to four reference years (1790, 1860, 1910, and 2010) using univariate and multivariate analyses. We upscaled the georeferenced data using a moving window approach. The study area encompassed 94,886 contiguous forest stands in a boreo-nemoral region of southern Latvia (5178 km2) with a relatively short history of intensive land use. At the scale of stands, the presence of WKHs, ranging from 0.1 to 59 ha in size, best corresponded to highly variable land-use histories 100–220 years ago such as natural succession on abandoned land, drained bogs and wetlands, and only partly to continuous forest cover for more than 220 years. We identified short-term (50–70 years) and small-scale (up to 250 m) gaps in past forest cover as significant positive predictors of WKH presence, which resemble patterns caused by natural disturbances. At broader scales (800–2500 m), best explanatory variables were the presence of old forest fragments throughout the landscape, at least 100 years of continuous forest cover, changes in forest cover, i.e., afforestation, between 1790 and 1860, and the proximity to bogs and rivers. We also found that correlations between WKH presence and forest patch density converted from negative coefficients at small spatio-temporal scales to positive ones at broader spatio-temporal scales. Our results highlight the importance of using multi-scale information on land-use history to improve both the understanding and the management of biodiversity in cultural landscapes. In brief, instead of long-term continuous forest cover, we found a surprisingly diverse and dynamic land-use history in places that have been designated as WKHs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biodiversity conservation; Forest continuity; Land-use changes; Moving window approach; Scale dependence; Spatial and temporal scales; Temporal heterogeneity; Woodland key habitats","biodiversity; conservation; estimation method; forest cover; habitat type; heterogeneity; land use change; multivariate analysis; scale effect; spatiotemporal analysis; succession; woodland; Latvia",2-s2.0-85019749464

Its huge economic impact is due in part to the lack of specialised natural enemies suppressing population outbreaks in newly invaded areas. By establishing new associations, endemic parasitoid species native to the invaded areas can play an important role in controlling the pest. This study aims to provide a range of baseline information on the developmental parameters and parasitisation efficacy of three Italian populations of D. suzukii parasitoids at different temperatures. The species tested were a larval parasitoid, Leptopilina heterotoma (Thomson), and two pupal parasitoids, Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) and Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins). Two comparative experiments were set up: the first assessing longevity and the lifetime fecundity of each species at 23 °C, and the second investigating the effect of temperature on parasitisation efficacy, developmental time and sex-ratio. The results revealed different fecundity patterns for the three parasitoids, probably due to a different level of synovigeny. For T. drosophilae and P. vindemiae, the lifetime sex ratio was biased towards an increasing number of males, whereas L. heterotoma showed the opposite trend. Moreover, temperature markedly affected host-parasitoid interaction and was positively correlated with the parasitoid's developmental time, whereas the sex-ratio was not significantly influenced. On the basis of these experiments, T. drosophilae appears to be the best candidate for developing a biological control strategy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Leptopilina heterotoma; Longevity; Pachycrepoideus vindemiae; Spotted wing drosophila; Temperature; Trichopria drosophilae",,2-s2.0-85020899480

Hence, floodplain habitat has been identified as critical for the continued persistence of California’s Central Valley salmon, particularly the Yolo Bypass, the primary floodplain of the Sacramento River. To provide insight into factors supporting juvenile salmon use of this 240 km2, partially leveed floodplain, we examined inter- and intra-annual relationships between environmental correlates and residency time, apparent growth, emigration, migratory phenotype, and survival over more than a decade for natural-origin (“wild”) fish and experimentally-released hatchery fish. Flood duration was positively associated with hatchery juveniles residing longer and achieving larger size. Wild juveniles grew larger and emigrated later with cumulative temperature experience (accumulated thermal units) and warmer average annual temperatures during flood years. Within years, both wild and hatchery salmon departed the floodplain as flood waters receded. Parr-sized juveniles dominated outmigrant composition, though fry and smolt-sized juveniles were also consistently observed. Survival to the ocean fishery was not significantly different between hatchery fish that reared in the Yolo Bypass versus those that reared in the main stem Sacramento River.

Recent work has especially focused on land governance, post-conflict restructuring of tenure relations, and large-scale land acquisitions. A less researched topic as of late, though one deserving of greater consideration, pertains to how social differentiation on the local-level shapes relations to land, and how these processes are rooted in specific historical developments. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in Teso sub-region of eastern Uganda, this paper analyses three specific land conflicts and situates them within a broad historical trajectory. I show how each dispute illuminates changes in class relations in Teso since the early 1990s. I argue that this current period of socioeconomic transformation, which includes the formation of a more clearly defined sub-regional middle class and elite, constitutes the most prominent period of social differentiation in Teso since the early 20th century. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.",,"class; conflict management; fieldwork; governance approach; land tenure; land use conflict; rural planning; socioeconomic conditions; twentieth century; Teso [Uganda]; Uganda",2-s2.0-85028310062

We compared local (within-community) and landscape (among-community) species richness and community composition between thyme-dominated communities in France (native range) and New Zealand (introduced range). From 7 native sites (France) and 10 introduced sites (New Zealand), all plant species present in 20 (New Zealand, 25 in France) randomly placed 100 cm × 50 cm quadrats were recorded. Local species richness was determined by calculating mean species richness/quadrat inside and outside thyme-dominated plant communities and tested for significance with the factors of range and across sites. Landscape scale differences were determined by comparing total species richness inside and outside thyme communities across all sites from both ranges. Species differences between native and introduced thyme communities were analysed using similarity percentages. We found native range microenvironments with thyme harbour more species than microenvironments without thyme and this pattern was reversed in the introduced range with thyme decreasing local species richness. A higher percentage of shared species occurred both with and without thyme in the native range compared to the introduced range. In both ranges and across all sites (except for one) species composition of thyme-associated plant communities differed from communities without thyme. Native plant communities with thyme were more similar in species composition than plant communities without thyme, but in the introduced range species composition was most similar in plant communities without thyme. These results suggest thyme’s ecosystem engineering consequences are context-dependent. Thyme may filter out competitive species that could negatively impact local species richness in its native range, but when introduced to a disturbed landscape in a novel biogeographic region, thyme reduces local species richness. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Aromatic plant communities; Invasive species; Mediterranean garrigue vegetation; Species diversity; Species richness; Thymus vulgaris","biogeographical region; ecosystem engineering; introduced species; invasive species; plant community; shrub; species diversity; species richness; vegetation cover; France; Mediterranean Region; New Zealand; Thymus vulgaris",2-s2.0-85019846775

Several studies suggest that even small structural elements in the landscape can make a substantial contribution to the overall biodiversity value of the agricultural landscapes. Pastures can have high biodiversity potential. However, their intensive and monofunctional use typically erodes its natural capital, including biodiversity. Here we address the ecological value of fine scale structural elements represented by sparsely scattered trees and shrubs for the spider communities in a moderately intensively grazed pasture in Transylvania, Eastern Europe. The pasture was grazed with sheep, cattle and buffalo (ca 1 Livestock Unit ha-1) and no chemical fertilizers were applied. Sampling sites covered the open pasture as well as the existing fine-scale heterogeneity created by scattered trees and shrub. 40 sampling locations each being represented by three 1 m2 quadrats were situated in a stratified design while assuring spatial independency of sampling locations. We identified 140 species of spiders, out of which 18 were red listed and four were new for the Romanian fauna. Spider species assemblages of open pasture, scattered trees, trees and shrubs and the forest edge were statistically distinct. Our study shows that sparsely scattered mature woody vegetation and shrubs substantially increases the ecological value of managed pastures. The structural complexity provided by scattered trees and shrubs makes possible the co-occurrence of high spider diversity with a moderately high intensity grazing possible in this wood-pasture. Our results are in line with recent empirical research showing that sparse trees and shrubs increases the biodiversity potential of pastures managed for commodity production. © 2017 Gallé et al.

Here, we use a meta-analysis to test the prediction that predation pressure on sea urchins, a group of consumers with a particularly strong influence on community structure in the world's oceans, is strongest in the tropics. We then examine which biotic and abiotic factors best correlate with biogeographic and within habitat patterns in sea urchin responses to predation. Consistent with expectations, predator impacts on sea urchins were highest in tropical coral reefs and decreased towards the poles in rocky reef habitats (> 25° absolute latitude). However, latitude and temperature were weakly correlated with effect sizes, and the strongest predictor of predator impacts was sea urchin species. This suggests an important role of prey identity (i.e. traits including behaviour, physical, and chemical defences) rather than large scale abiotic factors in determining variation in interaction strengths. Ecosystem-shaping sea urchins such as Tripneustes gratilla, Diadema savignyi and Centrostephanus rodgersii were strongly impacted by consumers, indicating a tight coupling between predators of these species and their boom and bust prey. Anthropogenic activities such as over-fishing, climate change and habitat destruction are causing rapid environmental change, and understanding how predation pressure varies with temperature, across habitats and among prey species, will aid in predicting the likelihood of ecosystem wide effects (via trophic cascades). © 2016 The Authors",,"abiotic factor; biogeography; biotic factor; climate change; community structure; coral reef; echinoderm; ecosystem modeling; herbivory; human activity; latitudinal gradient; meta-analysis; population decline; predation; predator; trophic cascade; Anthozoa; Centrostephanus rodgersii; Diadema savignyi; Echinoidea; Tripneustes gratilla",2-s2.0-84997787336

As a consequence these tree taxa are widely considered as ‘non-native’ to Ireland. The present study examines the currently available palynological evidence to test this assumption. Over 500 Holocene pollen records from across Ireland were examined for the occurrence of ‘non-native’ tree pollen types. A database was created to summarize the available evidence, using G.F. Mitchell's Irish pollen zones for biostratigraphic assignment. Over 38% of Irish pollen archives document the presence of ‘non-native’ tree pollen types during the Holocene. Pollen of Carpinus and Tilia was present during the Boreal period. Acer and Fagus pollen was first recorded for the Irish Neolithic, while Juglans pollen has been present since later prehistoric times. Abies and Picea pollen occur largely during the Afforestation period. The evidence presented here suggests that the occurrence of individual ‘non-native’ tree pollen in Holocene archives from Ireland cannot be simply explained by contamination, reworking, or long-distance transport. Although the pollen archives do not exhibit closed pollen curves or high pollen abundances prior to the Afforestation period, the large number of records from across the island provides evidence that ‘non-native’ trees formed part of the Holocene vegetation. Based on these findings, a revision of the phytogeographic status of the ‘non-native’ tree taxa is proposed. Carpinus and Tilia are considered as being native to Ireland, while Acer, Fagus, and Juglans represent archaeophytes. Abies and Picea are neophytes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Holocene; Ireland; Irish pollen zones; Pollen dispersal; Vegetation history; ‘Non-native’ tree taxa","afforestation; biostratigraphy; dispersal; Neolithic; palynology; phytogeography; plant community; pollen; prehistoric; tree; vegetation history; Ireland; Abies; Acer; Carpinus; Fagus; Juglans; Picea; Tilia",2-s2.0-85019948229

More recent studies demonstrated that these impairments are enhanced for speech stimuli with negative content. Nonetheless, few studies probed the temporal dynamics of self versus nonself speech processing in schizophrenia and, particularly, the impact of semantic valence on self–other voice discrimination. In the current study, we examined these questions, and additionally probed whether impairments in these processes are associated with the experience of hallucinations. Fifteen schizophrenia patients and 16 healthy controls listened to 420 prerecorded adjectives differing in voice identity (self-generated [SGS] versus nonself speech [NSS]) and semantic valence (neutral, positive, and negative), while EEG data were recorded. The N1, P2, and late positive potential (LPP) ERP components were analyzed. ERP results revealed group differences in the interaction between voice identity and valence in the P2 and LPP components. Specifically, LPP amplitude was reduced in patients compared with healthy subjects for SGS and NSS with negative content. Further, auditory hallucinations severity was significantly predicted by LPP amplitude: the higher the SAPS “voices conversing” score, the larger the difference in LPP amplitude between negative and positive NSS. The absence of group differences in the N1 suggests that self–other voice processing abnormalities in schizophrenia are not primarily driven by disrupted sensory processing of voice acoustic information. The association between LPP amplitude and hallucination severity suggests that auditory hallucinations are associated with enhanced sustained attention to negative cues conveyed by a nonself voice. © 2017 Society for Psychophysiological Research","auditory hallucinations; schizophrenia; self; speech; valence; voice identity",,2-s2.0-85018775052

However, the mechanism and extent of responses of gut microbiota to pathogenic infection are poorly understood. This study investigated the gut bacterial communities and immune responses of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) upon exposure to Vibrio anguillarum. The succession of V. anguillarum infection was evidenced by increased expression of immune genes and bacterial loads in ayu tissues, which in turn altered the composition and predicted functions of gut bacterial community. The dynamics of gut bacterial diversity and evenness were temporally stable in control ayu but were reduced in infected subjects, particularly at the late stages of infection. Variations in the gut microbiota were significantly associated with the expression levels of TNF-α (P = 0.019) and IL-1 β (P = 0.013). The profiles of certain gut bacterial taxa were indicative of V. anguillarum infection. Compared with healthy controls, the ayu infected with V. anguillarum possessed less complex, fewer connected, and lower cooperative gut bacterial interspecies interaction, coinciding with significant shifts in keystone species. These findings imply that V. anguillarum infection substantially disrupted the compositions and interspecies interaction of ayu gut bacterial community, thereby altering gut microbial-mediated functions and inducing host immune responses.

The observed negative impact of an invasive weed species may be driven by allelopathy or nutrient availability. Methodology: Sorghum halepense is one of the worst invasive weeds in crop fields. We quantified the species richness in the S. halepense-invaded communities and communities not yet invaded by the weed. Sorghum soil and no-sorghum soil were analysed for total phenolics, microbial activity, available nitrogen (N) and organic carbon. Manipulative experiments were carried out to understand the interference potential of S. halepense. Soil was amended with root or shoot leachate of S. halepense, and its impact on plant growth and soil properties was studied. Results: Out of four S. halepense-sites, lower plant species richness was observed in one site compared to uninvaded sites. S. halepense-invaded soil had higher levels of total phenolics and lower levels of available N. Higher inhibition in the root growth of Brassica juncea or Bidens pilosa was observed in root leachate-amended soil than shoot leachate-amended soil. Shoot leachate-amended soil had higher levels of total phenolics and available N than root leachate-amended soils. Significant reduction in the available N was observed in soil amended with root leachate. Significant decline in the total phenolics over a period of time was observed in soil amended with root leachate or shoot leachate of S. halepense. Higher CO2 release was observed 24 h after amending soil with root leachate or shoot leachate of S. halepense. Conclusions: Sorghum halepense interference potential in its soil is likely due to lower levels of available N. Greater reduction in root dry weight of assay species in root leachate amended soil compared to shoot leachate amended soil was likely due to lower levels of available N in root leachate-amended soil.

In the present study we applied satellite remote sensing (a Landsat-8 image) in order to evaluate the SAV coverage area and its biomass for the peak growth period, which is mainly in September or October (2013 to 2016), in the eutrophic and shallow south basin of Lake Biwa. We developed and validated a satellite-based water transparency retrieval algorithm based on the linear regression approach (R2 = 0.77) to determine the water clarity (2013-2016), which was later used for SAV classification and biomass estimation. For SAV classification, we used Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), a Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and a binary decision tree, giving an overall classification accuracy of 86.5% and SAV classification accuracy of 76.5% (SAV kappa coefficient 0.74), based on in situ measurements. For biomass estimation, a new Spectral Decomposition Algorithm was developed. The satellite-derived biomass (R2 = 0.79) for the SAV classified area gives an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26 kg dry weight (DW) m-2. The mapped SAV coverage area was 20% and 40% in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Estimated SAV biomass for the mapped area shows an increase in recent years, with values of 3390 t (tons, dry weight) in 2013 as compared to 4550 t in 2016. The maximum biomass density (4.89 kg DW m-2) was obtained for a year with high water transparency (September 2014). With the change in water clarity, a slow change in SAV growth was noted from 2013 to 2016. The study shows that water clarity is important for the SAV detection and biomass estimation using satellite remote sensing in shallow eutrophic lakes. The present study also demonstrates the successful application of the developed satellite-based approach for SAV biomass estimation in the shallow eutrophic lake, which can be tested in other lakes. © 2017 by the authors.","Remote sensing; SAV biomass; Shallow lake; Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); Water transparency","Binary trees; Biomass; Data mining; Decision trees; Eutrophication; Image resolution; Lakes; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Satellites; Transparency; Vegetation; Classification accuracy; Root mean square errors; Satellite remote sensing; Shallow lakes; Spectral decomposition algorithm; Spectral mixture analysis; Submerged aquatic vegetations; Water transparency; Ecology",2-s2.0-85029689811

We present a study of the genetic variation of A. cantonensis in P.R. China. Our aim was to deepen the current knowledge pertaining to its origin and global spread from a molecular perspective. Methods: Adult A. cantonensis were collected in the frame of a national survey and identified based on morphological criteria. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to amplify the target DNA sequences (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)). The PCR product of cox1 was directly submitted to sequencing, while clone sequencing was used for nad1 and ITS. The identity of the samples was verified by comparing the sequences to those of accepted A. cantonensis specimens. The specific composition of substitutions in each gene was analysed, and the genotypes were compared based on the complete cox1, nad1 and ITS genes. Results: We characterised the complete mitochondrial genes cox1 and nad1 of 130 specimens and obtained 357 nuclear sequences containing two complete ITS (ITS1 and ITS2) and 5.8S rRNA of the same samples. All specimens were genetically confirmed as A. cantonensis. Two major groups (i.e. I and II) were identified according to the phylogeny of cox1 sequences. Group I could be further categorised into six distinct clades. Almost half of the specimens (47.7%) belong to the clade Ia and 22.3% to the group II. The former was widely distributed across the study region. A variable number of repeat units in three microsatellites was observed, resulting in considerable length variation in ITS. Intragenomic variation of ITS sequences was found in a large proportion of the samples. Genotyping showed a striking difference between mitochondrial DNA and ITS. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that A. cantonensis is the only rat lungworm species in P.R. China and shows high genetic diversity. Results of diversity and genotyping of A. cantonensis can be impacted by the sequencing strategy and biomarker. Although ITS may be a valuable marker for interspecific identification, it is not suitable for studying the intraspecific variation of A. cantonensis due to its high intragenomic variation and current challenges for direct sequencing. © 2017 The Author(s).","Angiostrongylus cantonensis; cox1; Genetics; Internal transcribed spacer; nad1; People's Republic of China","cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor; Angiostrongylus cantonensis; Article; China; controlled study; cox1 gene; DNA sequence; eosinophilic meningitis; gene; genetic identification; genetic variability; genetic variation; human; mitochondrial gene; nad1 gene; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal",2-s2.0-85028597989

A decade after the accidental introduction of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, in Europe, two generalist native egg parasitoids, the eupelmid Anastatus bifasciatus and the encyrtid Ooencyrtus telenomicida, have been recorded from this invasive agricultural pest in the field. Both species are able to complete development to the adult stage within the new host. Trissolcus basalis (Platygastridae = Scelionidae), which is not associated with H. halys in the field, was reared from freeze-killed sentinel eggs placed on soybean plants in central Italy. We tested in a Y-tube olfactometer the behavioural responses of these egg parasitoids to volatiles from H. halys adults and from Vicia faba plants attacked by H. halys. Both A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida positively responded to adult H. halys male volatiles and to H. halys-induced plant volatiles, indicating ability to exploit cues associated with the new host for egg location, whereas T. basalis only reacted to female volatiles. A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida are generalist egg parasitoids, showing a much wider host range when compared to T. basalis. On the other hand, platygastrid egg parasitoids from the native area of H. halys, considered for classical biological control, may be too risky due to the possibility of attacking non-target species, including predaceous stink bugs. Therefore, indigenous A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida are presently under evaluation for augmentative biological control of H. halys in Europe. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Egg parasitoid; Encyrtidae; Eupelmidae; Halyomorpha halys; Invasive species; New association; Platygastridae; Vicia faba","biological control; egg parasitoid; host-parasitoid interaction; insect; invasive species; pest control; pest species; plant-herbivore interaction; soybean; Italy; Anastatus bifasciatus; Encyrtidae; Eupelmidae; Glycine max; Halyomorpha halys; Ooencyrtus; Pentatomidae; Platygastridae; Scelionidae; Trissolcus basalis; Vicia faba",2-s2.0-85017426845

Spectral signature provides the most complete remote description to characterize any algae. In this work spectral signatures are studied from the point of view of taxa separability to assess the potential use of remote sensors to map seaweed in coastal waters. Three approaches were tested: Red-Green-Brown colorimetry (sRGB), optimal spectral boundary separation based on True Skill Statistics (TSS-OB), and pigment absorbance band detection by Derivative Spectroscopy (DS). An extensive spectral library of 36 algal species present in the Atlantic Galician coast (NW of Spain) is used to test and validate these methods. The results show that the three broad taxa of red, green and brown algae can be separated by all three methods (Cohen's kappa of 0.697, 0.891 and 0.910, respectively). The TSS-OB and the DS approaches provide almost perfect classification (despite some anomalous specimens), with DS being slightly better.

Using recently developed molecule-based approaches exploiting DNA sequence variation among species/specimens, this study reconstructed a comprehensive phylogeny of the Nemipteridae, examined the validity of species and explored the cryptic diversity of the family, and tested previous phylogenetic hypotheses. A combined data set (105 taxa from 41 morphospecies) with newly determined sequences from two nuclear genes (RAG1 and RH) and one mitochondrial gene (COI), and a data set with only COI gene sequences (329 newly obtained plus 328 from public databases from a total of 53 morphospecies) were used in the phylogenetic analysis. The latter was further used for species delimitation analyses with two different tools to explore species diversity. Our phylogenetic results showed that all the currently recognized genera were monophyletic. The monotypic genus Scaevius is the sister group of Pentapodus and they together are sister to Nemipterus. These three genera combined to form the sister group of the clade comprising Parascolopsis and Scolopsis. The validity of most of the examined species was confirmed except in some cases. The combined evidence from the results of different analyses revealed a gap in our existing knowledge of species diversity in the Nemipteridae. We found several currently recognized species contain multiple separately evolving metapopulation lineages within species; some lineages should be considered as new species for further assignment.

Hitherto, most studies have focused on annual crops and the available information on the impacts of landscape structure in orchards is sparse. In this study, we evaluated the effects of pesticide use as cumulative toxicity on pest and predatory beetle (Coleoptera) assemblages in the canopy of apple orchards surrounded by different proportion of semi-natural vegetation, crop fields and settlements in Hungary. Laboratory data suggest that increasing pesticide toxicity negatively affects predators (coccinellids), but we did not find such a pattern. Supposedly, the effect of pesticides was masked by the continuous recolonisation of orchards from the surrounding landscape. On the contrary, for the less mobile pest species [Anthonomus pomorum, Phyllobius oblongus (Curculionidae)] we did find a decline in abundance along the gradient of increasing pesticide toxicity. Landscape composition around the orchards significantly influenced the abundance of predatory, fungivorous and tourist species, but had no effect on pests. Contrary to expectations, however, semi-natural habitats had a minor effect compared to arable fields, orchards and settlements which habitat types had various effects on the abundance of different coleopteran groups and species. For example, Harmonia axyridis (Coccinellidae) abundance was positively affected by its overwintering sites, i.e. human settlements in spring, semi-natural forests in summer, and arable fields in autumn. The mass immigration of other predatory, fungivorous and tourist species from the surrounding arable fields into the orchards started from July with senescence and harvesting of arable crops. These results suggest that arable fields, other orchards and settlements might be more important sources of colonisation for natural enemies in orchards than certain semi-natural habitats. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Coleoptera; Dispersal; Ecosystem service; Land-use systems; Perennial crops; Pest control","abundance; beetle; complexity; dispersal; ecosystem service; land use change; landscape ecology; landscape structure; natural enemy; orchard; pest control; pest species; pesticide; predator; toxicity; Hungary; Anthonomus pumorum; Coccinellidae; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Harmonia axyridis; Malus x domestica; Phyllobius oblongus",2-s2.0-85030545847

Cape Town is also inhabited by a rapidly growing culturally and economically diverse citizenry with distinct and potentially conflicting perspectives on access to, and management of, local natural resources. In a qualitative study of 58 locally resident traditional healers of distinct cultural groups, we examined motivations underlying the generally illicit activity of harvesting of wild resources from Cape Town protected areas. Resource harvester motivations primarily link to local economic survival, health care and cultural links to particular resources and practices, 'access for all' outlooks, and wholesale profit-seeking perspectives. We describe these motivations, contrast them with the current formal, legal and institutional perspectives for biodiversity protection in the city, and propose managerial interventions that may improve sustainability of ongoing harvest activities.

We hypothesized that grassland soil processes associated with C and N cycling decelerate with community turnover from short-lived forbs and grasses to long-lived native grasses, whereas invasion by exotic perennial grasses maintains fast cycling rates. We measured litter C and N turnover during decomposition, soil respiration, and soil N dynamics in synthetic plant communities resembling four successional stages, established on abandoned farmland in the Inland Pampa, Argentina. We also compared litter chemistry and decay rates of dominant species from each community stage in a common garden, and assessed mass loss for a standard litter type incubated in all communities. Litter decomposition and soil respiration decreased, while litter N retention increased from early through mid to late community stages dominated by forbs short-lived grasses and native perennial grasses, respectively. Soil process rates in exotic perennial grass communities were faster than in native grass communities, but similar to annual grass communities. Further, the standard litter decomposed more slowly in the native perennial than in the exotic perennial grass community. In the common garden, short-lived forbs and grasses decomposed faster than native or exotic perennial grasses, with species’ decay rates being negatively related to initial litter C : N ratio. Our results show that changes in soil processes across old-field communities arise chiefly through differences in the quality of litter produced by dominant functional groups. A dominance shift from native to exotic perennial grasses prevented the deceleration of C and N cycling expected with plant successional turnover. Thus, invasion by fast-growing exotic grasses may fundamentally alter ecosystem functioning in novel grasslands. A lay summary is available for this article. © 2017 The Authors.

The localization of the research component on one of the largest historical territories of the Russian North and the Russian Arctic makes it possible to examine more narrowly and in detail the provincial ethnocultural specifics. The retrospective analysis allows looking at the ethnopolitics of modern Russia taking into account regional specialization. The ethno-cultural issues considered in the article are of fundamental importance in connection with the socio-political and historical-legal discussion on the issue of the cultural collective rights of small ethnic groups: indigenous peoples and national minorities.

However, the phenomenon of delayed extinctions as a result of habitat loss has rarely been assessed on oceanic islands. In this study, we tested whether extinction debt (ED), in general, occurs on islands and for which taxonomical groups this phenomenon is most pronounced by assessing ED for multiple endemic taxa and for each of the main altitudinal ecosystems in a well-studied oceanic archipelago. Location: Canary Islands. Methods: We characterized habitat preferences for all endemic species of several taxonomic groups (vascular plants, ground and darkling beetles, flies and land snails). Using generalized linear mixed models and available data about habitat distributions, we tested for all taxa and habitat types to determine whether past habitat area better explained current richness of habitat specialists than current habitat area. If so, an extinction debt can be assumed. Results: For all five major habitat types and five taxonomic groups studied, present-day richness of habitat specialists fitted better with past than current habitat area, evidencing habitat- and taxon-specific extinction debts. This pattern was consistent for both long-lived vascular plants and short-lived invertebrates. Single island endemics in each taxonomic group showed steeper slopes of the species–area relationship (SAR) compared to archipelago endemics indicating higher sensitivity to habitat loss which might increase sizes of ED. Conclusion: Despite differences in species’ generation times, plants and invertebrates showed delayed extinctions after habitat destruction in the Canary Islands. Our SAR approach suggests that a considerable number of Canary Island endemics will eventually become extinct in the future without further habitat loss. The case of the Canary archipelago is probably not unique. Hence, we interpret our results as a warning for island conservationists that the worst of the extinction crisis on oceanic islands might be yet to come.

The widespread use of NHCs in scientific research makes it essential to characterize potential sources of spatial bias. In this study, we assessed spatial patterns in records from the Australian Virtual Herbarium (AVH), based on &gt;3 000 000 vouchered specimens of around 21 000 native plant species. The AVH is the main database for describing Australia's flora, and identifying its limitations is of paramount interest for the validity of conservation and environmental studies. We characterized how sampling effort is distributed across each Interim Bioregion of Australia (IBRA), then asked: (i) How complete are species inventories for each bioregion? We define completeness (C) as the ratio of observed to estimated species richness, using the Chao 1 estimator, (ii) How is sampling effort related to a commonly used Human Influence Index (HII)? and (iii) What is the probability that additional collections would result in the identification of previously unrecorded species in each bioregion? Sampling effort across bioregions is unequal, which partially reflects the collecting behaviour of naturalists in relation to species richness patterns. The density of records in bioregions ranges from 0.02–8.37 km−2. At the bioregional scale, completeness is generally high with 79% of bioregions estimated to have records for at least 80% of their species. Completeness is partly explained by sampling effort (r = 0.43, p = 0.01), although some bioregions (e.g. Northern Kimberley and Burt Plain) have high completeness yet relatively low sampling effort. The inventory of Hampton, however, is substantially less complete than other bioregions (C = 0.66). Bioregions with high HII consistently have high completeness, while regions with low HII span the full range of completeness values. We calculated that an additional specimen collected from a bioregion has a 0.33% (Wet Tropics) to 11.7% (Arnhem Coast) probability of representing a new species for that region. Our assessment can assist with directing future systematic survey efforts by identifying bioregions where additional surveying may result in the greatest return, in terms of increasing knowledge of species richness and diversity. © 2017 Ecological Society of Australia","Atlas data; biodiversity informatics; continental flora; digitized specimens; Wallacean shortfall","atlas; biodiversity; biogeography; bioinformatics; database; ecoregion; flora; herbarium; identification method; native species; new species; plant; probability; spatial analysis; species inventory; species richness; type specimen; Australia; Kimberley [Western Australia]; Western Australia; Gabaza",2-s2.0-85016787180

Constructed wetlands can be used to remove excess nutrients. In these wetlands, helophytes or free floating aquatic plants are traditionally used to absorb the nutrients. The nutrients are subsequently exported upon harvesting of the plants. However, rooted submerged plants may be more effective to extract nutrients from moderately eutrophicated ecosystems than helophytes or floating species. Here, we tested how the frequency of harvesting affected submerged biomass production, biomass nutrient content and the resulting amount of nutrients removed, as well as the vegetation composition and structure. Two Myriophyllum spicatum dominated shallow ponds, with moderately low surface water nutrient loading (∼5.6 mg N.m−2.d−1 and ∼1.32 mg P.m−2.d−1) were used. Each pond was subjected to four harvesting treatments: mowing 1x, 2x, 3 x or 5 x between May and September 2015. Harvesting 2 x or 3 x removed most biomass and nutrients, while mowing either 5 x or only once at the end of the growing season removed the lowest amount of nutrients from the system. Furthermore, the dominance of M. spicatum in the vegetation was best maintained in plots mown 2 x, while its cover declined in plots mown more frequently, resulting in an increase of charophyte abundance. We conclude that harvesting at an intermediate frequency is best when aiming to remove the maximum amount of nutrients under a moderately low nutrient loading. Harvesting more frequently may be a suitable management method to reduce dominance of M. spicatum in situations where it causes nuisance problems due to massive growth. © 2017","Biomass; Macrophyte; Myriophyllum spicatum; Nitrogen; Phosphorous; Potassium","Biomass; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Harvesting; Lakes; Nitrogen; Potassium; Surface waters; Vegetation; Water quality; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands; Floating aquatic plants; Freshwater ecosystem; Intermediate frequencies; Macrophytes; Myriophyllum spicatum; Phosphorous; Vegetation composition; Nutrients; abundance; aquatic plant; biomass; charophyte; constructed wetland; freshwater ecosystem; nutrient; phosphorus; pollutant removal; potassium; vegetation structure; water quality; Charales; Myriophyllum spicatum",2-s2.0-85020779990

In Italy, after the first detection in 2012, it has rapidly spread and economic damage has already been reported in commercial fruit orchards, eliciting enormous concern for Italian agricultural production. As a long-term solution, biological control investigations are focusing on the potential of natural antagonists, such as generalist predators, in the invaded areas. Due to their biology, ecology and behavior, ants represent one such generalist predator potentially suitable for inflicting mortality on H. halys. In this research, Crematogaster scutellaris was used as a study model. Specifically, the effect of ant predatory behavior on the survival of all H. halys pre-imaginal stages was tested in the laboratory environment. The results suggest that C. scutellaris has a significant predatory impact on all H. halys pre-imaginal stages except for eggs. The reduction of survivorship is between 95 and 85% for instars 1 and 2 and between 38 and 52% for instars 3, 4 and 5. The different levels of predation success suggest that these ants could act as useful generalist predators when associated with other antagonists and/or other control strategies. Although further field investigations are needed, the potential of ants as biocontrol agents of invasive species in agroecosystems deserves consideration in integrated pest management programs. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biological control; Cooperative predatory response; Generalist predators; Integrated pest management; Invasive species; Natural antagonists","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural production; ant; biological control; insect; integrated pest management; invasive species; mortality; pest species; predator; survival; Italy; Crematogaster scutellaris; Formicidae; Halyomorpha halys",2-s2.0-85020263956

Understanding these determining factors for genetic variation is critical for conservation of relict plants that are generally suffering from genetic deterioration. Working with 16 populations of the vulnerable relict shrub Cneorum tricoccon throughout the majority of its western Mediterranean distribution range, and using nine polymorphic microsatellite markers, we examined the effects of periphery (peripheral vs. central), population size (large vs. small), and seed disperser (introduced carnivores vs. endemic lizards) on the genetic diversity and population structure of the species. Contrasting genetic variation (HE: 0.04–0.476) was found across populations. Peripheral populations showed lower genetic diversity, but this was dependent on population size. Large peripheral populations showed high levels of genetic diversity, whereas small central populations were less diverse. Significant isolation by distance was detected, indicating that the effect of long-distance gene flow is limited relative to that of genetic drift, probably due to high selfing rates (FIS = 0.155–0.887), restricted pollen flow, and ineffective seed dispersal. Bayesian clustering also supported the strong population differentiation and highly fragmented structure. Contrary to expectations, the type of disperser showed no significant effect on either population genetic diversity or structure. Our results challenge the idea of an effect of periphery per se that can be mainly explained by population size, drawing attention to the need of integrative approaches considering different determinants of genetic variation. Furthermore, the very low genetic diversity observed in several small populations and the strong among-population differentiation highlight the conservation value of large populations throughout the species’ range, particularly in light of climate change and direct human threats. © 2017 The Authors.

In this study, the timing of seed release and seedling establishment were ascertained, and their consumption by invertebrates (carabids, isopods and slugs) was studied. Seeds dispersed in the autumn passed the winter on the ground surface, protected from invertebrate predation by low temperatures. In the following vegetative season, ungerminated black seeds exposed to predation on ground surface were preferred by a large carabid species, Pseudoophonus rufipes. Some black and all brown seeds escaped predation by germinating in early spring. The seedlings were little endangered by carabids and isopods but were preferred by an invasive slug, Arion vulgaris, the feeding of which can exterminate seedlings at places in which slugs are abundant.

The trophic ecology of invaders might be affected by both their body size and the characteristics of their habitat due to variation in energy requirements and resource availability. Here, using stable-isotope analysis, we investigated the trophic ecology of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii in 15 populations in southwest France over a gradient of individual (crayfish body size), population (crayfish abundance) and ecosystem (lake size, productivity and predation pressure) characteristics. We predicted that population niche width, level of omnivory and trophic position of individuals would change with abiotic and biotic conditions, but that these relationships would vary with lake size. The trophic position of individual crayfish increased with body size in lakes with low productivity, but decreased with body size in more productive lakes. As crayfish abundance increased (and therefore potential intraspecific competition), individual trophic position and population niche width decreased. This was most apparent in smaller lakes, suggesting it related to an increase in encounter rates with conspecifics. Body size, population abundance, lake size and lake productivity influenced the trophic ecology of invasive crayfish, which can affect their interactions with native species. Our results demonstrated that the trophic ecology of invasive species can be variable across invaded landscapes, with implications for their ecological impacts on native communities.

Although sympatry with a common, co-flowering species may somewhat alleviate the problem of pollinator visitation (pollination quantity), the interspecific pollen transfer, IPT, (pollination quality) may remain a barrier to reproduction in small populations such as new introductions. However, if the two species are crosscompatible, our hypothesis is that neutral hybridization can help the small founding population overcome the Allee effect by improving the quality of pollination. We tested this hypothesis by using a novel modelling approach based on the theory of kinetic reactions wherein pollinators act as enzymes to catalyse the reaction between the two substrates: pollen and unselfed ovule. Using a single locus, two-allele genetic model, we developed a generic model that allows for hybridization between the invading and the native genotypes. Analysing the stability properties of the trivial equilibria in hybridization model as compared with the single genotype invasion model, we found that hybridization can either remove or reduce the Allee effect by making an otherwise stable trivial equilibrium unstable. Our study suggests that hybridization can be neutral but still be the key driver of a successful invasion by mediating pollen limitation. Conservation programmes should therefore account for this cryptic role that hybridization could play in plant invasions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Allee effect; Introgression; Invasion facilitation; Ordinary differential equations; Phase plane analysis; Pollination quality","Allee effect; biological invasion; equation; hybridization; introgression; modeling; plant-pollinator interaction; pollen limitation",2-s2.0-85014734878

In dryland regions, it is likely that minimum streamflow will decrease with some perennial streams shifting to intermittent flow under climate-driven changes in precipitation and runoff and increases in temperature. Decreasing base flow and shifting flow regimes from perennial to intermittent could have significant implications for stream-dependent biota, including riparian vegetation. In this study, we asked, how do riparian plant communities vary along wet-to-dry hydrologic gradients on small (first–third order) streams? We collected data on geomorphic, hydrologic, and plant community characteristics on 54 stream sites ranging in hydrology from intermittent to perennial flow across the Upper Colorado River Basin (284,898 km2). We found that plant communities varied along hydrologic gradients from high to low elevation between streams, and perennial to intermittent flow. We identified indicator species associated with different hydrologic conditions and suggest how plant communities may shift under warmer, drier conditions. Our results indicate that species richness and cover of total, perennial, wetland, and native plant groups will decrease while annual plants will increase under drying conditions. Understanding how plant communities respond to regional drivers such as hydroclimate requires broad-scale approaches such as sampling across whole river basins.

Recent studies have suggested that pesticides may significantly impact bumblebee colonies - an important and declining group of pollinators. Here, we show that colony-founding queens, a critical yet vulnerable stage of the bumblebee lifecycle, are less likely to initiate a colony after exposure to thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide. Bombus terrestris queens were exposed to field-relevant levels of thiamethoxam and two natural stressors: the parasite Crithidia bombi and varying hibernation durations. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused a 26% reduction in the proportion of queens that laid eggs, and advanced the timing of colony initiation, although we did not detect impacts of any experimental treatment on the ability of queens to produce adult offspring during the 14-week experimental period. As expected from previous studies, the hibernation duration also had an impact on egg laying, but there was no significant interaction with insecticide treatment. Modelling the impacts of a 26% reduction in colony founding on population dynamics dramatically increased the likelihood of population extinction. This shows that neonicotinoids can affect this critical stage in the bumblebee lifecycle and may have significant impacts on population dynamics. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85027489115

In this article, we first analyze land cover change processes by developing transition matrices using the simplified Land and Ecosystem Account taxonomy, and next we compare and contrast processes that take place in areas characterized by different levels of environmental protection, which we identify as follows: natural protected areas, sites of the European Natura 2000 network, and unprotected areas.

This reorganization can also be associated with the extent to which species change their preference for types of niches available in their local sites. Despite the pervasiveness of these interaction changes, previous studies have revealed that network reorganizations have a minimal or insignificant effect on global descriptors of network architecture, such as connectance, modularity and nestedness. However, little is known about whether these reorganizations may have an effect on community dynamics and composition. To answer the question above, we study the multi-year dynamics and reorganization of plant–herbivore interaction networks across secondary successional stages of a tropical dry forest. We develop new quantitative tools based on a structural stability approach to estimate the potential impact of network reorganization on species persistence. Then, we investigate whether this impact can explain the likelihood of persistence of herbivore species in the observed communities. We find that resident (early-arriving) herbivore species increase their likelihood of persistence across time and successional stages. Importantly, we demonstrate that, in late successional stages, the reorganization of interactions among resident species has a strong inhibitory effect on the likelihood of persistence of colonizing (late-arriving) herbivores. These findings support earlier predictions suggesting that, in mature communities, changes of species interactions can act as community-control mechanisms (also known as priority effects). Furthermore, our results illustrate that the dynamics and composition of ecological communities cannot be fully understood without attention to their reorganization processes, despite the invariability of global network properties. © 2017 The Authors.

In its native and introduced range, H. halys is considered a pest of tree fruits, vegetables, legumes, and ornamental trees. The highly polyphagous nature of this insect as well as its vast dispersal capabilities, require an integrated approach to management. Here we focus on the potential impact of indigenous natural enemies on H. halys in woody ornamental nurseries in Maryland, USA. We sampled naturally field laid H. halys egg masses for mortality and parasitism rates in 2012 and 2013. Overall, egg mortality averaged 54% for both years, and increased within season and between years. The largest source of mortality was from egg parasitoids with mean parasitism rates of 30.73 and 39.63% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Mortality from predation was much lower and averaged 4.61% by chewing and 2.53% by sucking predators. We found seven species of Hymenopteran egg parasitoids attacking H. halys eggs, with Anastatus reduvii being the dominant species comprising 61.17 and 79.12% of all parasitoids in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

When the inoculum was homogenously distributed, a single EM fungal taxon dominated the roots of most pine seedlings, reducing the diversity of EM fungi at the treatment level, while substantially improving pine seedling performance. In contrast, clumped inoculum allowed the proliferation of several different EM fungi, increasing the overall EM fungal diversity.

Among them, marine caves support unique biodiversity and fragile communities but suffer lack of quantitative data on their structure and function, hindering their conservation status assessment. A first approach to the nondestructive ecological monitoring of marine caves by testing surrogates of structural and functional composition of sessile benthos was attempted in two species-rich Mediterranean marine caves. Photographic sampling was performed in different positions on the cave walls, across the horizontal axis, from the entrance inwards. Eighty-four taxa were identified and assigned to 6 biological traits and 32 modalities related to morphology, behavior and ecological affinities, with sponges being the dominant taxon in species richness and coverage. In quest of possible biological surrogates, we examined the spatial variability of the total community structure and function and separately the sponge community structure and function. The observed patterns of the above metrics were significantly correlated with the distance from the entrance, the small-scale variability and their interaction. A positive correlation was found between all examined pairs of those metrics, supporting that: (i) the developed functional approach could be used for the study of marine cave sessile communities, and (ii) sponges could be used as a surrogate taxon for the structural and functional study of these communities. The suggested method could be tested in other types of hard substrate habitats and in multiple locations of the Mediterranean waters, facilitating monitoring schemes and conservation actions. © 2017 Gerovasileiou et al.

They both rely on a ventral adhesive structure to define the suborders Acotylea and Cotylea, but superfamilies were defined according to eyespot arrangement (Prudhoe’s system) or prostatic vesicle characters (Faubel’s system). Molecular data available cover a very limited part of the known polyclad family diversity and have not allowed testing morphology-based classification systems on Polycladida yet. We thus sampled a suitable marker, partial 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), from Polycladida (19 families and 32 genera), generating 136 new sequences and the first comprehensive genetic dataset on polyclads. Our maximum likelihood (ML) analyses recovered Polycladida, but the traditional suborders were not monophyletic, as the supposedly acotyleans Cestoplana and Theama were nested within Cotylea; we suggest that these genera should be included in Cotylea. The partial 28S rDNA trees were generally well supported and robust but in conflict with both Faubel’s and Prudhoe’s superfamilies. Therefore, we compiled morphological and anatomical characters for all taxa used and examined their distribution on our molecular tree. Combining morphological and molecular evidence, we redefined polyclad superfamilies. Acotylea contain tentaculated and atentaculated groups and is now divided in three superfamilies. The suborder Cotylea can be divided in five superfamilies. In general, there is a trait of anteriorization of sensory structures, from the plesiomorphic acotylean body plan to the cotylean gross morphology. Traditionally used characters, such as prostatic vesicle, eyespot distribution, and type of pharynx, are all homoplastic and likely have misled polyclad systematics so far. © 2017, Gesellschaft für Biologische Systematik.","Acotylea; Cotylea; Marine flatworms; Molecular phylogenetics; Morphology; Platyhelminthes","cladistics; DNA; evolutionary biology; flatworm; marine environment; molecular analysis; morphology; phylogeny; sensory system; taxonomy; Acotylea; Cestoplana; Cotylea; Platyhelminthes; Polycladida",2-s2.0-85019146727

Within host communities predation can influence pathogen transmission rates, prevalence and impacts. However, the influence of predation on community resilience to outbreaks of generalist pathogens is not fully understood. The role of predation on host community resilience to disease was assessed using an epidemiological multi-host susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model. Sphaerothecum destruens, an emerging fungal-like generalist pathogen, was used as a model pathogen. Six cyprinid and salmonid fishes, including an asymptomatic carrier, were selected as model hosts that are known to be impacted by S. destruens, and they were used within a model host community. Pathogen release into the host community was via introduction of the asymptomatic carrier. Mortality from infection, pathogen incubation rate, and host recovery rate were set to a range of evidence-based values in each species and were varied in secondary consumers to predict top-down effects of infection on the resilience of a host community. Predation pressure within the fish community was varied to test its effects on infection prevalence and host survival in the community. Model predictions suggested that predation of the asymptomatic hosts by fishes in the host community was insufficient to eliminate S. destruens. Sphaerothecum destruens persisted in the community due to its rapid transmission from the asymptomatic host to susceptible host fishes. Following transmission, pathogen prevalence in the community was driven by transmission within and between susceptible host fishes, indicating low host community resilience. However, introducing low densities of a highly specific piscivorous fish into the community to pre-date asymptomatic hosts could limit pathogen prevalence in the host community, thus increasing resilience. The model predictions indicate that whilst resilience to this generalist pathogen in the host community was low, this could be increased using management interventions. The results suggest that this model has high utility for predicting community resilience to disease and thus can be applied to other generalist parasites to determine risks of disease emergence. © 2017 The Authors.

This paper argues for effective governance to support processes that apply principles of sustainable development and an ecosystem approach to decide about economic activities at sea such as aquaculture. It describes opportunities, benefits and synergies between aquaculture and MPAs as a basis for wider debate. The scope is not a comprehensive analysis of aquaculture and MPAs, but rather to present examples of positive interactions between aquaculture activities and MPAs. The unintended negative consequences are also discussed to present balanced arguments. This work draws from four workshops held in 2015 and 2016 and used to collect information from about 100 experts representing various sectors and perspectives. It is recognized that aquaculture is an important activity in terms of sustainable development. It can play a role in providing food security, poverty alleviation and economic resilience, in particular for MPA local communities, and contribute to wild stock enhancement, as an alternative to overfishing and for providing services to the ecosystem. This study showed that there is a need from both aquaculture and MPA sides for clarity of objectives and willingness for open and extensive dialogue. The paper concludes by describing a number of tools and methods for supporting greater synergies between aquaculture and MPAs.

In this study, we evaluate whether different assessments consistently assign species to the same risk categories and whether any of the existing methodologies perform well at identifying climate-threatened species. We compare the outputs of 12 climate change vulnerability assessment methodologies, using both real and simulated species, and validate the methods using historic data for British birds and butterflies (i.e. using historical data to assign risks and more recent data for validation). Our results show that the different vulnerability assessment methods are not consistent with one another; different risk categories are assigned for both the real and simulated sets of species. Validation of the different vulnerability assessments suggests that methods incorporating historic trend data into the assessment perform best at predicting distribution trends in subsequent time periods. This study demonstrates that climate change vulnerability assessments should not be used interchangeably due to the poor overall agreement between methods when considering the same species.

Location: Global. Methods: Here, we (1) evaluate how several predictors – namely mode of reproduction, symbiotic associations with fungi, host-plant type, utilization of specific host-plant clades, and level of host-plant specialization – influence geographical range size, and (2) explicitly test whether range size is associated with species diversification. Analyses were performed with a dataset of 109 genera using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck adaptation models which control for phylogenetic constraints. Results: We found regular inbreeding by sibling mating to predict an increase in geographical range size, whereas angiosperm hosts type predicted smaller geographical ranges compared to gymnosperm associated lineages. Variation in range size was also associated with utilization of specific host-plant clades, with conifers being the strongest predictor. Furthermore, the number of utilized host-plant clades showed a positive association with genera level range size. Our analyses also found fungus farming to predict a reduction in geographical range size, but with a smaller effect size than for inbreeding and host-type. Lastly, we found a strong positive association between biogeographical range size and species diversification rates. Main conclusions: We conclude that allopatric speciation is an important contributor to the distribution of species richness in bark beetles. Our study supports the idea that range expansion and speciation are intrinsically linked, and that reproductive behaviour and host-type preference – through their influence on biogeographical dispersal ability – are ultimately determining factors of species diversification in bark beetles. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bark beetles; biogeography; dispersal; fungus farming; host specificity; inbreeding; range size; Scolytinae; speciation; species diversification","angiosperm; beetle; biogeography; dispersal; ecological modeling; fungus; gymnosperm; host plant; host specificity; inbreeding; phylogenetics; range size; reproductive behavior; specialization; speciation (biology); species richness; Coniferophyta; Fungi; Gymnospermae; Magnoliophyta; Scolytinae",2-s2.0-85018839581

Under conditions of synchronous as well as asynchronous visuotactile stimulation, a thermal pain stimulus was delivered on the real arm of 20 participants and seemingly also on the rubber arm, before and after applying a sham analgesic and a control cream only to the rubber arm.

The ability of species to respond to climate change, in part, depends on their response to climate as a phenological cue in general. Species that are not phenologically responsive may suffer in the face of continued climate change. Comparative studies of phenology have found phylogeny to be a reliable predictor of mean leaf-out date and flowering time at both the local and global scales. This is less true for flowering time response (i.e., the correlation between phenological timing and climate factors), while no study to date has explored whether the response of leaf-out date to climate factors exhibits phylogenetic signal. We used a 52-year observational phenological dataset for 52 woody species from the Forest Botanical Garden of Heilongjiang Province, China, to test phylogenetic signal in leaf-out date and flowering time, as well as, the response of these two phenological traits to both temperature and winter precipitation. Leaf-out date and flowering time were significantly responsive to temperature for most species, advancing, on average, 3.11 and 2.87 day/°C, respectively. Both leaf-out and flowering, and their responses to temperature exhibited significant phylogenetic signals. The response of leaf-out date to precipitation exhibited no phylogenetic signal, while flowering time response to precipitation did. Native species tended to have a weaker flowering response to temperature than non-native species. Earlier leaf-out species tended to have a greater response to winter precipitation. This study is the first to assess phylogenetic signal of leaf-out response to climate change, which suggests, that climate change has the potential to shape the plant communities, not only through flowering sensitivity, but also through leaf-out sensitivity. © 2017 The Authors.

However, in human-dominated landscapes such as cities, conservation reserve systems are, by necessity, often determined without using conservation planning principles. This can result in reserve systems that are small, fragmented and disconnected. In this study, we conducted a floristic survey of 68 urban grassland conservation reserves to assess how reserves of different areas contribute to species conservation. Species accumulation curves, species-area relationships, and proportion of native cover were explored. We found that 87% of all native plant species were found in small reserves < 10 ha in size, more small reserves contained a greater number of species than few large reserves of a comparable area, and cover of native species in small reserves was no different than cover in large reserves. However, large reserves harboured more uncommon species than smaller reserves. This research has several important implications for conservation planning and design, highlighting that both small and large reserves can help to conserve native plant species in urban areas. However, a preference for large reserves over small ones is embedded in much conservation planning and management. There is a danger that a normative belief that large reserves are ‘good’ and small reserves are ‘bad’ has become entrenched in conservation thinking.

Logging is one of the main drivers of road construction in tropical forests. We evaluated forest fragmentation and impacts of logging roads on forest resilience and wildlife, considering the full life cycle of logging roads. Through an extensive evidence review we found that for logging road construction, corridors between 3 and 66 m (median 20 m) width are cleared, leading to a loss of 0.6–8.0 percent (median 1.7%) of forest cover. More severe impacts are increased fire incidence, soil erosion, landslides, and sediment accumulation in streams. Once opened, logging roads potentially allow continued access to the forest interior, which can lead to biological invasions, increased hunting pressure, and proliferation of swidden agriculture. Some roads, initially built for logging, become converted to permanent, public roads with subsequent in-migration and conversion of forest to agriculture. Most logging roads, however, are abandoned to vegetation recovery. Given the far-reaching impacts of the roads that become conduits for human access, its control after the end of logging operations is crucial. Strategic landscape planning should design road networks that concentrate efficient forest exploitation and conserve roadless areas. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","Amazonia; Congo Basin; deforestation; forest degradation; land sharing vs. sparing; reduced-impact logging; road ecology; Southeast Asia","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; deforestation; ecosystem service; forest cover; landscape planning; road; road construction; shifting cultivation; tropical forest; Amazonia; Congo Basin; Southeast Asia",2-s2.0-85020492977

Animal-instigated pollination can be complex. Plants are usually visited by a number of different animal species, which in turn may visit flowers of several plant species. Therefore, the identification of the pollen carried by flower visitors is an essential first step in pollination biology. The skill and time required to identify pollen based on structure and morphology has been a major stumbling block in this field. Advances in the genetic analysis of DNA, using DNA barcoding, extracted directly from pollen offers an innovative alternative to traditional methods of pollen identification. This technique, which is reviewed in detail, can be used on pollen loads sampled from bees in the field and from specimens in historic collections. Here the importance of pollination, the role-players involved, their management and the evolution of their interactions, behaviour and morphology are reviewed – with a special focus on South African bees. Significance: Pollen metabarcoding will enable the identification of pollen for a multitude of uses, including agriculture, conservation and forensics. Plant–pollinator interaction documentation through pollen identification gives a more certain record of a visitor being a pollinator rather than a flower visitor that could be a nectar gatherer. © 2017.

However, environmental flows are often constrained by other demands within the river system and thus typically are comprised of smaller water volumes than the natural flows they are meant to replace, which can limit their functional efficacy. We review environmental flow programs aimed at restoring riparian vegetation on four arid zone rivers: the Tarim River in China; the Bill Williams River in Arizona, U.S.; the delta of the Colorado River in Mexico; and the Murrumbidgee River in southern Australia. Our goal is to determine what worked and what did not work to accomplish restoration goals. The lower Tarim River in China formerly formed a “green corridor” across the Taklamakan Desert. The riparian zone deteriorated due to diversion of surface and groundwater for irrigated agriculture. A massive restoration program began in 2000 with release of 1038 million cubic meters of water over the first three years. Groundwater levels rose but the ecological response was less than expected politically, socially and within the scientific community. However, releases continued and by 2015 portions of the original iconic Populus euphratica (Euphrates poplar) forest were reestablished. The natural flow regime of the Bill Williams River was disrupted by construction of a dam in 1968, dramatically reducing peak flows along with associated fluvial processes. As a result, the channel narrowed and riparian vegetation expanded and was comprised largely of an introduced shrub species (Tamarix spp.). Environmental flow releases including small, managed floods and sustained base flows have been implemented since the mid 1990's to promote establishment and maintenance of native riparian trees (cottonwoods and willows) and have been successful, although in a “downsized” portion of the valley bottom. Experience from the Bill Williams was used to help design the Minute 319 environmental flow in the delta of the Colorado River in 2014. Water was released as a short, one-time pulse during spring with the intent of starting new cohorts of cottonwood and willow. However, fluvial disturbance was limited by the relatively small magnitude pulse, low flows did not continue throughout the growing season in some reaches, native tree recruitment was low, and most of the new plants recruited were Tamarix. The inundated portion of the floodplain did respond with a temporary increase in greenness as measured by satellite vegetation indices, however. The Murrumbidgee River in Australia is a tributary in the Murray-Darling River Basin, which supports iconic red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forests that depend on near-yearly floods for maintenance. During the recent Millennial Drought (2000–2010) environmental flows were provided on an experimental basis to small portions of the Yanga National Forest to see how much water was needed. As with the Colorado River delta, gains in vegetation vigor as measured by satellite vegetation indices following the flows were temporary. Environmental flows in the Bill Williams were able to restore enough overbank flooding and fluvial disturbance to promote some establishment of new cohorts of trees, but on the Colorado and Murrumbidgee Rivers larger volumes of total flows released over longer periods and targeted restoration will be needed to restore the ecosystems. A measure of success in restoring the Euphrates poplar forest on the Tarim and germinating new chorts of willows on the Bill Williams has been achieved after 15–20 years of environmental flows, but the Colorado River delta and Murrumbidgee Rivers have only received one or two flows. Success in enhancing native trees in the Colorado delta has been achieved in restoration plots, but the Murrumbidgee will require large overbank flows on a continuing schedule to rejuvenate the red gum forest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Colorado River; Environmental flows; Populus; Riparian restoration; Salix; Tamarix; Tarim River","Arid regions; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Floods; Forestry; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Restoration; Stream flow; Vegetation; Colorado River; Environmental flow; Populus; Riparian restoration; Salix; Tamarix; Tarim river; Rivers; arid region; deciduous tree; environmental impact; flooding; floodplain; growing season; NDVI; overbank flow; peak flow; restoration ecology; riparian vegetation; riparian zone; river system; shrub; tributary; Australia; China; Colorado River [North America]; Murray-Darling Basin; Murrumbidgee River; New South Wales; Taklimakan Desert; Tarim River; Xinjiang Uygur; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Populus; Populus euphratica; Salix; Tamarix",2-s2.0-85010282369

The present study aims to review the current biological knowledge on this squid. It is considered to be endemic in the Southern Ocean (SO) with a circumpolar distribution spreading from the Antarctic continent up to the Sub-Antarctic Front. Small juveniles (<40 mm mantle length) are mainly found from the surface to 500 m, and the late juvenile stages are assumed to undergo ontogenetic descent to depths reaching 2000 m. Thus, this giant spends most of its life in the meso- and bathypelagic realms, where it can reach a total length of 6 m. The maximum weight recorded so far was 495 kg. M. hamiltoni is presently reported from the diets of 17 different predator species, comprising penguins and other seabirds, fishes and marine mammals, and may feed on various prey types, including myctophids, Patagonian toothfish, sleeper sharks and other squid. Stable isotopic analysis places the colossal squid as one of the top predators in the SO. It is assumed that this squid is not capable of high-speed predator–prey interactions, but it is rather an ambush predator. Its eyes, the largest on the planet, seem to have evolved to detect very large predators (e.g., sperm whales) rather than to detect prey at long distances. The study of this unique invertebrate giant constitutes a valuable source of insight into the biophysical principles behind body-size evolution. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Colossal squid; Cranchiids; Gigantism; Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni; Southern Ocean","biology; body size; cephalopod; ecology; evolution; fish; invertebrate; marine mammal; predator; predator-prey interaction; seabird; Antarctica; Southern Ocean; Cephalopoda; Cranchiidae; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni; Myctophidae; Physeteridae; Pisces; Somniosus microcephalus",2-s2.0-85016642613

Effective implementation of genetic rescue requires an understanding of the evolutionary history and genetic distinctiveness of populations. The Eltham copper butterfly (ECB) is an endangered subspecies that exists as small, isolated populations across four disjunct regions in Victoria, Australia. Mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data were used to assess the genetic distinctiveness of ECB from its nearest relative: the fiery dull copper butterfly (FDC), explore the evolutionary history and population structure of ECB across its contemporary distribution, and assess the scope for genetic rescue of the most-threatened ECB population in Eltham-Greensborough. Findings support the current status of ECB and FDC as distinct evolutionary units, which should continue to be managed separately given current knowledge. Modest population genetic structure across the range of ECB was detected. However, low levels of historical gene flow and shared haplotypes between Eltham-Greensborough and the northern regions suggest relatively recent divergence. Given relatively recent divergence, low population numbers and low genetic diversity, the population located in the Eltham-Greensborough region is a strong candidate for genetic rescue. Using established criteria, explicit recommendations are made for the implementation of genetic rescue via translocations. Genetic rescue, together with ongoing habitat management, should improve genetic diversity, fitness and persistence of the ECB in the region most threatened by urban disturbance. Any risks associated with genetic rescue in conservation should be weighed against extinction risk as a result of inaction. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society","Conservation recommendations; genetic diversity; Lepidoptera; Lycaenidae; Paralucia pyrodiscus lucida; Paralucia pyrodiscus pyrodiscus; population structure",,2-s2.0-85018936385

In this review, we combine 98 indigenous natural enemy datasets spanning a variety of sampling methods, habitats, and geographic areas. To date, the vast majority of H. halys biological control research has focused on the egg stage, using sentinel egg masses to characterize indigenous parasitoid and predator communities and their contribution to H. halys egg mortality. Although egg parasitism and predation levels by indigenous natural enemies are low (typically <10% each) in most surveys, total egg mortality attributable to natural enemies can be higher (typically between 5 and 25%; up to 83%)—even though these values were likely underestimated in most cases because some mortality due to biological control was not recognized. In North America, where the most data are available, it appears that the relative prevalence of different indigenous parasitoid species varies among habitat types, particularly between crop and non-crop habitats. Predator species responsible for egg mortality are much less commonly identified, but appear to include a wide variety of generalist chewing and sucking predators. To date, studies of natural enemies attacking H. halys nymphs and adults are relatively rare. Based on our review, we identify a number of key research gaps and suggest several directions for future research. © 2017, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.","Biological control; Halyomorpha halys; Invasive species; Parasitoids; Pentatomidae; Predators","arthropod; biological control; invasive species; natural enemy; parasitoid; pest species; predator; Europe; North America; Arthropoda; Halyomorpha halys; Hemiptera; Pentatomidae",2-s2.0-85020403262

With three endemic species (Millepora brazilensis, M. nitida and M. laboreli) and one amphi-Atlantic species (M. alcicornis), fire coral diversity in the Brazilian Province rivals that of the Caribbean Province. Phylogenetic relationships and patterns of population genetic structure and diversity were investigated in all four fire coral species occurring in the Brazilian Province to understand patterns of speciation and biogeography in the genus. A total of 273 colonies from the four species were collected from 17 locations spanning their geographic ranges. Sequences from the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were used to evaluate phylogenetic relationships. Patterns in genetic diversity and connectivity were inferred by measures of molecular diversity, analyses of molecular variance, pairwise differentiation, and by spatial analyses of molecular variance. Morphometrics of the endemic species M. braziliensis and M. nitida were evaluated by discriminant function analysis; macro-morphological characters were not sufficient to distinguish the two species. Genetic analyses showed that, although they are closely related, each species forms a well-supported clade. Furthermore, the endemic species characterized a distinct biogeographic barrier: M. braziliensis is restricted to the north of the São Francisco River, whereas M. nitida occurs only to the south. Millepora laboreli is restricted to a single location and has low genetic diversity. In contrast, the amphi-Atlantic species M. alcicornis shows high genetic connectivity within the Brazilian Province, and within the Caribbean Province (including Bermuda), despite low levels of gene flow between these populations and across the tropical Atlantic. These patterns reflect the importance of the Amazon–Orinoco Plume and the Mid-Atlantic Barrier as biogeographic barriers, and suggest that, while M. alcicornis is capable of long-distance dispersal, the three endemics have restricted ranges and more limited dispersal capabilities. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biogeographic barriers; Endemics; Genetic diversity; Genetic structure; Peripheral populations; Phylogenetics","biogeography; connectivity; coral reef; dispersal; DNA; endemism; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genetic structure; morphometry; phylogenetics; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Bermuda; Anthozoa; Millepora; Millepora alcicornis; Millepora braziliensis; Millepora nitida; Milleporidae",2-s2.0-85015704672

The microbiome of pathogens can therefore have consequences that are relevant for managing disease prevalence and impact on affected hosts. Here, we investigate the microbiome of an invasive parasitic fly Philornis downsi, recently introduced to the Galápagos Islands, where it poses extinction threat to Darwin's finches and other land birds. Larvae infest nests of Darwin's finches and consume blood and tissue of developing nestlings, and have severe mortality impacts. Using 16s rRNA sequencing data, we characterize the bacterial microbiota associated with P. downsi adults and larvae sourced from four finch host species, inhabiting two islands and representing two ecologically distinct groups. We show that larval and adult microbiomes are dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, which significantly differ between life stages in their distributions. Additionally, bacterial community structure significantly differed between larvae retrieved from strictly insectivorous warbler finches (Certhidea olivacea) and those parasitizing hosts with broader dietary preferences (ground and tree finches, Geospiza and Camarhynchus spp., respectively). Finally, we found no spatial effects on the larval microbiome, as larvae feeding on the same host (ground finches) harboured similar microbiomes across islands. Our results suggest that the microbiome of P. downsi changes during its development, according to dietary composition or nutritional needs, and is significantly affected by host-related factors during the larval stage.

Changes in diagnostics, management, and treatment may have influenced the incidence of ARDS. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to evaluate whether there is a difference in the incidence of posttraumatic ARDS (1) over time, (2) attributable to geographic distribution, and 3) related to admitting surgical subspecialities. METHODS A comprehensive search of articles published in English and German language was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and the ISI Web of Science. Search terms included ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple trauma, polytrauma, and surgery. A meta-regression was performed to analyze differences between several decades of patient recruitment (decade 1, 1981-1990; decade 2, 1991-2000; decade 3, 2001-2010), geographic location (North America and Europe), and the type of admitting surgical service (general vs. orthopedic trauma), respectively. Statistical analyses were performed with R (version 3.1.2, metafor package). RESULTS The search included studies between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2015 and revealed 43 trials from 40 publications (117,951 patients, 7,816 with posttraumatic ARDS). The median incidences over the last three decades were similar between decade 1 (10.4%), decade 2 (7.7%), and decade 3 (8.0%) (p = 0.8322). Geographical observations comparing central Europe and North America revealed no statistically significant difference (Europe 13.0%) and North America (6.9%), (p = 0.0696). The ARDS incidence in patients published based on a general surgery service (9.8%) was comparable to those published by orthopedic trauma surgeons (7.0%) (p = 0.3436). CONCLUSION The results of this meta-analysis discard the assumption that the following factors have influenced the incidence of posttraumatic ARDS: There was neither a change in the incidence over the last decades, nor a geographical difference within western societies, nor associated with the admitting surgical subspeciality.

Delivery of environmental flows to promote native cottonwood (Populus spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) recruitment in human-impacted riparian systems can be unsuccessful due to flow-magnitude constraints and altered abiotic–biotic feedbacks. In 2014, an experimental pulse flow of water was delivered to the Colorado River in Mexico as part of the U.S.-Mexico binational agreement, Minute 319. We conducted a field experiment to assess the effects of vegetation removal, seed augmentation, and environmental flows, separately and in combination, on germination and first-year seedling establishment of cottonwood, willow, and tamarisk at five replicate sites along 5 river km. The relatively low-magnitude flow deliveries did not substantively restore natural fluvial processes of erosion, sediment deposition, and vegetation scour, but did provide wetted surface soils, shallow groundwater, and low soil salinity. Cottonwood and willow only established in wetted, cleared treatments, and establishment was variable in these treatments due to variable site conditions and inundation duration and timing. Wetted soils, bare surface availability, soil salinity, and seed availability were significant factors contributing to successful cottonwood and willow germination, while soil salinity and texture affected seedling persistence over the growing season. Tamarisk germinated and persisted in a wider range of environmental conditions than cottonwood and willow, including in un-cleared treatment areas. Our results suggest that site management can increase cottonwood and willow recruitment success from low-magnitude environmental flow events, an approach that can be applied in other portions of the Delta and to other human-impacted riparian systems across the world with similar ecological limitations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental flows; Populus; Regulated river; Riparian restoration; Salix; Tamarix","Cultivation; Forestry; Groundwater; Land use; Restoration; Seed; Soils; Vegetation; Wetting; Environmental flow; Populus; Regulated river; Riparian restoration; Salix; Tamarix; Rivers; angiosperm; anthropogenic effect; environmental conditions; germination; groundwater; growing season; land use change; restoration ecology; riparian vegetation; seedling establishment; Colorado River [North America]; Mexico [North America]; United States; Populus; Salix; Tamaricaceae; Tamarix",2-s2.0-85016033902

Here we present an algorithm for the detection of non-transiting short-period giant planets in the Kepler field. The procedure uses the phase curves themselves as evidence for the planets' existence. We employ a supervised learning algorithm to recognize the salient time-dependent properties of synthetic phase curves; we then search for detections of signals that match these properties. After demonstrating the algorithm's capabilities, we classify 142,630 FGK Kepler stars without confirmed planets or Kepler Objects of Interest, and for each one, we assign a probability of a phase curve of a non-transiting planet being present. We identify 60 high-probability non-transiting hot Jupiter candidates. We also derive constraints on the candidates' albedos and offsets of the phase curve maxima.

However, many mid-sized mammals disappeared around 1900 when dingoes had increased, cats were present but foxes were yet to arrive, and before newly built fences to manage rabbits and dingoes were amalgamated to form the current dingo barrier fence. By concentrating on predation to explain small mammal losses, alternatives including the spread of introduced rabbits are ignored. This is despite rabbits being both severe environmental pests and the main prey of all three predators. Since rabbit haemorrhagic disease was introduced 20 years ago, rabbits have been less abundant and in that time several native mammals deemed to be protected by dingoes have expanded their range, even into dingo-free areas where cats and foxes are not suppressed. Historic and recent evidence therefore weakens the case that dingoes are of paramount importance in protecting small native mammals.

Using standardised and repeatable methods, we present a national-scale assessment of the risks of range loss and opportunities for range expansion that climate change could pose for over 3000 plants and animals. Species were selected by their occurrence in England, the primary focus of the study, but climate change impacts were assessed across Great Britain, widening their geographical relevance. A basic risk assessment that compared projected future changes in potential range with recently observed changes classified 21% of species as being at high risk and 6% at medium risk of range loss under a B1 climate change scenario. A greater number of species were classified as having a medium (16%) or high (38%) opportunity to potentially expand their distribution. A more comprehensive assessment, incorporating additional ecological information, including potentially confounding and exacerbating factors (e.g. dispersal, habitat availability and other constraints), was applied to 402 species, of which 35% were at risk of range loss and 42% may expand their range extent. This study covers a temperate region with a significant proportion of species at their poleward range limit; the balance of risks and opportunities from climate change may be different elsewhere. The outcome of both risk assessments varied between taxonomic groups, with bryophytes and vascular plants containing the greatest proportion of species at risk from climate change. Upland habitats contained more species at risk than other habitats. Whilst the overall pattern was clear, confidence was generally low for individual assessments, with the exception of well-studied taxa such as birds. In response to climate change, nature conservation needs to plan for changing species distributions and an uncertain future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate envelope; Great Britain; Risk assessment; Vulnerability","bryophyte; climate change; climate effect; ecological impact; habitat loss; national planning; nature conservation; range expansion; risk; risk assessment; temperate environment; vascular plant; vulnerability; England; United Kingdom; Animalia; Aves; bryophytes; Tracheophyta",2-s2.0-85028674487

We studied the impact of environmental viral richness and abundance on functional diversity and differentiation of the MHC class Ia locus in populations of the black-spotted pond frog (Pelophylax nigromaculatus), an IUCN-listed species, on 24 land-bridge islands of the Zhoushan Archipelago and three nearby mainland sites. We found a high proportion of private MHC alleles in mainland and insular populations, corresponding to 32 distinct functional supertypes, and strong positive selection on MHC antigen-binding sites in all populations. Viral pathogen diversity and abundance were reduced at island sites relative to the mainland, and islands housed distinctive viral communities. Standardized MHC diversity at island sites exceeded that found at neutral microsatellites, and the representation of key functional supertypes was positively correlated with the abundance of specific viruses in the environment (Frog virus 3 and Ambystoma tigrinum virus).

Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) form dense assemblages in rivers, and affect nutrient transformations through feeding, biodeposition, and bioturbation. However, the effects of Unionid mussels on N and phosphorus (P) retention are not commonly measured. We quantified rates of filtration, retention, and biodeposition of carbon (C), N, and P for two Unionid species: Lasmigona complanata and Pyganodon grandis. We used continuous-flow cores with 15N tracers to measure denitrification in sediments alone and with a single individual of each species. We conducted measurements in an urban river near Chicago, IL, USA that is a target for Unionid restoration. Both Unionid species showed high rates of P-specific feeding and retention, but low N-specific rates. This was in agreement with high N:P ratio in the water column. Each species significantly increased denitrification relative to sediment alone. 15N tracers suggested direct denitrification of nitrate increased denitrification, although enhanced coupled nitrification–denitrification likely also contributed to denitrification. Finally, denitrification rates with and without mussels were used to estimate the value of N loss under different scenarios for mussel restoration at the river scale. Overall, restored Unionid populations may enhance P retention in soft tissues and shells and N loss via denitrification. Ecosystem managers may find greater support for restoration of Unionid populations with careful calculations of their ecosystem role in nutrient retention and removal. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Biodeposits; Bivalves; Clearance rate; Consumers; Eutrophication; Stoichiometry","aquatic ecosystem; bivalve; clearance rate; denitrification; eutrophication; feeding behavior; freshwater environment; infiltration; nutrient cycling; pollutant removal; river basin; stoichiometry; Chicago; Illinois; United States; Bivalvia; Lasmigona complanata; Pyganodon grandis; Unionidae",2-s2.0-85028999232

Different climate projections for the future (2030–2059) and the recent conditions (1980–2009) were investigated. A hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate water balance at the basin scale and streamflow in a number of river sections under various climate change scenarios, based on different combinations of global and regional models (global circulation models and regional climate models). The impact on water balance components was quantified at the basin and subbasin levels as deviation from the baseline (1980–2009), and the flow regime alteration under changing climate was estimated using a number of hydrological indicators. An increase in mean temperature for all months between 0.5–2.4 °C and a reduction in precipitation (by 4–7%) was predicted for the future. As a consequence, a decline of blue water (7–18%) and total water yield (11–28%) was estimated. Although the river type classification remains unvaried, the flow regime distinctly moves towards drier conditions and the divergence from the current status increases in future scenarios, especially for those reaches classified as I-D (ie, intermittent-dry) and E (ephemeral). Hydrological indicators showed a decrease in both high flow and low flow magnitudes for various time durations, an extension of the dry season and an exacerbation of extreme low flow conditions. A reduction of snowfall in the mountainous part of the basin and an increase in potential evapotranspiration was also estimated (4–4.4%). Finally, the paper analyses the implications of the climate change for river ecosystems and for River Basin Management Planning. The defined quantitative estimates of water balance alteration could support the identification of priorities that should be addressed in upcoming years to set water-saving actions.

These methods of paleoclimatic reconstruction are termed taxon-based and are ideally accomplished using pairs of fossil and extant species. However, in practice, they are often performed using higher taxonomic ranks, such as genera, families, or even orders. The use of higher taxonomic ranks has largely unknown effects on the performance of the taxon-based methods. In this study, we tested the effects of using species, genera, families and orders on the accuracy and precision of climatic predictions from the taxon-based method known as taxonomic calibration. We performed taxonomic calibration using the extant floras of US counties and compared our predictions with the reported values for the counties. We made predictions for mean annual temperature, minimum temperature during the coldest month, average temperature during the coldest quarter, and mean annual precipitation for the US counties. We evaluated our results from taxonomic calibration for accuracy and precision using several measures of differences between reported and predicted values and r2, respectively. Our results showed that genera performed as well as or better than species for all climatic variables according to our measures of accuracy and precision, and families performed only slightly less well. Orders performed relatively poorly, but still showed an unexpectedly high percentage of accurate predictions for annual temperature and average temperature during the coldest month. Our results validate the use of taxonomic calibration for inferring climates using taxonomic data at the ranks of species, genus, and family and suggest that orders may be used cautiously in some cases. We discuss the applicability of our findings to studies of paleoclimates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Paleoclimate prediction; Taxonomic calibration; Taxonomic rank","accuracy assessment; air temperature; calibration; climate prediction; flora; fossil record; paleobotany; paleoclimate; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); precision; reconstruction; taxonomy; United States",2-s2.0-85019763299

One of the challenges in protecting and restoring mussel biodiversity effectively is a lack of understanding of their natural distributions at relevant spatial scales. Without this information, assessing the current status of individual species and overall biodiversity or evaluating restoration success is difficult. We compiled records for 45 mussel species and a range of natural environmental variables describing climate, geology, soil, land cover, and watershed topography in Illinois wadeable streams. We used reaches (segments between 2 neighboring tributaries) as the basic spatial unit of the stream network for modeling species distributions with Maxent. We applied these models statewide to all identified wadeable reaches. Stacking the predictions of individual models yielded an estimate of species richness for each reach. The estimates were compared with observed richness from 2 sets of independent sites: 17 sites sampled multiple times over the past 50 to 100 y and 18 sites intensively sampled in 2009 to 2010. The latter set was expected to represent much more impaired mussel assemblages than the former. These sets of sites lost an average of 25 and 46%, respectively, of species expected under natural conditions. Observed occupancy of individual species decreased by 27 and 35%, respectively, from expected natural values. Listed species suffered heavy occupancy loss more frequently than nonlisted species. Estimated mussel species loss was negatively correlated with 2 existing indices of biological integrity. These results, together with maps of natural distributions for individual species and for species richness, will assist with mussel biodiversity conservation and the development and use of mussel-based biological indicators in stream assessment. © 2017 by The Society for Freshwater Science.","Biodiversity loss; Freshwater mussels; Historic Records; Illinois streams; Maxent modeling; Species distribution","Unionidae",2-s2.0-85027413265

Surprisingly little is known about the ecology of native C. fluminea populations in China, including how life-history parameters, such as growth, may respond to widely variable environmental conditions, especially water-level management. A native C. fluminea population that supports a local commercial fishery in Hongze Lake (the 4th-largest freshwater lake in China and the largest impounded lake on the East Route of the South to North Water Transfer Project [ESNT]) was studied. Age, growth, and climate-growth relationships were estimated based on thin-sectioned shells. Sclerochronological techniques were used to detrend individual growth measurement series and to investigate climate factors that influenced growth over time. Six age-classes of C. fluminea were identified. Lee's phenomenon (i.e., underestimated sizes at earlier age classes in survivors) was evident. A von Bertalanffy growth function was fitted to estimate shell height (SH)-at-age (SH85 45.2 mm, k 5 0.13 and to5 21.11). Growth rates of individuals were extremely synchronous over time (2007-2011) (interseries r 5 0.81), suggesting common growth drivers among individuals. Growth was positively correlated with food availability (chlorophyll a), annual runoff, regional annual total precipitation, and lake water level, and negatively correlated with extreme temperatures and annual temperature variance. The results suggest current water-level management practices that lower water level during summer may be limiting somatic growth and production of C. fluminea. Operation of the ESNT may have been working to benefit C. fluminea growth by increasing water availability from winter through early summer, a hypothesis that should be further investigated. © 2017 by The Society for Freshwater Science.","Annuli; Clam; Cross-dating; Sclerochronology; Thin-section; Water level","Bivalvia; Corbicula fluminea",2-s2.0-85027416481

The extended time and distance of space travel along with reduced involvement of Earth-based mission support increase the cumulative impact of the risks encountered in space. To respond to these challenges, it becomes increasingly important to develop the capability to manage animal safety and well-being during transportation and research experiments in space. One approach may be to take advantage of an organism's self-regulatory system, which enables them to better adapt and mitigate harmful environmental factors encountered in spaceflight. Recent technological advances have enabled researchers to suppress or enhance metabolism ""on demand"" in a variety of animal species. These animal models can be used as ""pathfinders,"" which are capable of tolerating the environmental extremes exhibited in spaceflight, including altered gravity, exposure to space radiation, chemically reactive planetary environments, and temperature extremes. In this report, we survey several of the pivotal metabolic flexibility studies and discuss the importance of utilizing animal models with metabolic flexibility with particular attention given to the ability to suppress the organism's metabolism in spaceflight experiments beyond LEO. The presented analysis demonstrates the adjuvant benefits of these factors to minimize damage caused by exposure to spaceflight and extreme planetary environments.

The oceanographical features included in the analysis were obtained from the literature or inferred from schemes of climatic oceanography. The most frequent oceanographic feature associated with a particular CPA is constant advection of a particular water mass, followed by local water mass transformation, seasonal ice zones, flaw polynyas, and external sources of nutrients. Particularly important are major frontal zones, and coastal phenomena such as coastal/offshore waters transition zones, massifs of fast ice and specific regimes of semi-isolated fjords and bays. Each Arctic sea in the study area or its large part (in the Barents Sea) is characterized by a distinct combination of oceanographical features associated with the respective CPAs. Although most oceanographical features were not involved in the process of developing the CPA network directly, the resulting CPAs are shown to have a solid oceanographical background. While this oceanographical background needs further understanding, it provides the possibility to refine the MPA boundaries and plan future studies.

However, our knowledge about these transfers is limited. Historic data are essential tools to trace back human-mediated gene flow and for interpretation of recent genetic studies. Context: Human-mediated gene flow can potentially have a major impact on the genetic composition of forest tree populations, yet our knowledge about seed sources used within the current species’ range is still limited. Norway spruce is one of the most important coniferous species in European forestry, and data drawing conclusions about the genetic composition of current populations are vital with regard to gene conservation and sustainable forest management. Because molecular data are not available on a more detailed scale, historic records provide crucial information about translocations. Aims: Our aim is to provide the first pan-European review on Norway spruce translocations from the seventeenth until the twentieth century. Methods: We analysed historic and recent literature compiling information on the cultivation and transfer of Norway spruce reproductive material. Historic records are compared with recent molecular studies. Results: Seed exchanges have profoundly altered the native genetic population structure of Norway spruce. Especially, Central European seeds have been used throughout and beyond the natural distribution area. Figures illustrating the historic plantings in Europe are provided.

Co, Ni, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn were mainly accumulated in the aerial parts (stems and leaves) of the plants, and their distributions depended on their mobility and their roles during the metabolism processes of S. alterniflora. The concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg, and Pb were significantly enhanced with the increasing of heavy metal concentrations in the sediments, while those of Co and Ni remained relatively constant. Bioaccumulation factors results showed that the serious heavy metal contamination in the sediments from the transect A may overwhelm the accumulation capability of the plants. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the sediments and the pore water therein also play a role in the heavy metal concentrations and accumulations in the plants, because they can influence the behaviors and bioavailabilities of heavy metals during nutrition and bioaccumulation processes of the plants. The sediments with vegetation did not show significantly decreased heavy metal concentration with respect to the unvegetated sediments, although the plants did absorb heavy metals from the sediments. Principal component analysis and correlation analyses indicated that Co–Ni, Cu–Cd–Hg behaved coherently during accumulation, which may be ascribed to their similar accumulation mechanisms.

Although most habitat fragmentation studies have been conducted on macroscopic organisms, microbial communities and fungal processes may also be threatened by fragmentation. This study investigated whether fragmentation, and the effects of fragmentation on plants, altered fungal diversity and function within a fragmented shrubland in southern California. Using fluorimetric techniques, we assayed enzymes from plant litter collected from fragments of varying sizes to investigate enzymatic responses to fragmentation. To isolate the effects of plant richness from those of fragment size on fungi, we deployed litter bags containing different levels of plant litter diversity into the largest fragment and incubated in the field for one year. Following field incubation, we determined litter mass loss and conducted molecular analyses of fungal communities. We found that leaf-litter enzyme activity declined in smaller habitat fragments with less diverse vegetation. Moreover, we detected greater litter mass loss in litter bags containing more diverse plant litter. Additionally, bags with greater plant litter diversity harbored greater numbers of fungal taxa. These findings suggest that both plant litter resources and fungal function may be affected by habitat fragmentation’s constraints on plants, possibly because plant species differ chemically, and may thus decompose at different rates. Diverse plant assemblages may produce a greater variety of litter resources and provide more ecological niche space, which may support greater numbers of fungal taxa. Thus, reduced plant diversity may constrain both fungal taxa richness and decomposition in fragmented coastal shrublands. Altogether, our findings provide evidence that even fungi may be affected by human-driven habitat fragmentation via direct effects of fragmentation on plants.

Pioneer researchers used morphological characters to describe this heterogeneous group, and physiological and genetic tools expanded knowledge of these microorganisms. However, research on oomycete diversification is limited by conflicting phylogenies. Using whole genomic data from 17 oomycete taxa, we obtained a dataset of 277 core orthologous genes shared among these genomes. Analyses of this dataset resulted in highly congruent and strongly supported estimates of oomycete phylogeny when we used concatenated maximum likelihood and coalescent-based methods; the one important exception was the position of Albugo. Our results supported the position of Phytopythium vexans (formerly in Pythium clade K) as a sister clade to the Phytophthora-Hyaloperonospora clade. The remaining clades comprising Pythium sensu lato formed two monophyletic groups. One group was composed of three taxa that correspond to Pythium clades A, B and C, and the other group contained taxa representing clades F, G and I, in agreement with previous Pythium phylogenies. However, the group containing Pythium clades F, G and I was placed as sister to the Phytophthora-Hyaloperonospora-Phytopythium clade, thus confirming the lack of monophyly of Pythium sensu lato. Multispecies coalescent methods revealed that the white blister rust, Albugo laibachii, could not be placed with a high degree of confidence. Our analyses show that genomic data can resolve the oomycete phylogeny and provide a phylogenetic framework to study the evolution of oomycete lifestyles. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Core orthologs; Genomics; Lifestyles; Oomycetes; Phylogenomics; Pythium",,2-s2.0-85021435400

However, field manipulations of predatory arthropods are common and could provide general insights into top-predator impacts. For example, observational studies suggest that conserving dingoes might indirectly benefit Australian small mammal populations. This is consistent with the effects of praying mantids in eastern U.S. meadows, where mantids indirectly benefit smaller herbivores by eating herbivorous competitors and dangerous mesopredators. However, in other cases predatory arthropods yield only occasional or context-dependent benefits to smaller prey, or even harm them; this suggests caution in assuming universal benefits of dingo conservation. Likewise, some experimental manipulations of predatory arthropods suggest that increasing plant diversity could protect African wild dogs from larger predatory mammals that steal their prey. However, other studies suggest that mesopredators may actually be harmed when the foraging environment becomes more complex. Finally, work with predatory spiders supports the idea that wolves, newly restored to the western U.S., might indirectly benefit some native plants by altering herbivore foraging patterns. However, other work suggests indirect, behaviorally-mediated effects on prey and plants that fall well outside of this type of simple, linear predator-herbivore-plant interaction chain. In summary, top predators that differ in size by orders of magnitude might impact their communities in broadly similar ways. At the same time, work with predatory arthropods indicates that subtle differences in ecological context can yield broadly different outcomes that also must be considered during top-predator conservation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Conservation; Context dependency; Mesopredator; Predator-prey; Trait-mediated interaction; Trophic cascade",,2-s2.0-85002374721

Through these questions, we aim to understand how these initiatives relate to environmental stewardship. Our results show that environmental, social, and self-motivations are the drivers behind gardeners' participation in the gardens. It seems that involvement in the gardens provides opportunities to fulfill those needs and/or motives through different interrelated processes between the individual with him/herself, the human collective, and nature such as: contemplating nature and benefiting from sensory experiences, having access to environmental education, experiencing individual and collective organization, renewing social–ecological relationships, and facing local challenges. We note that French community gardens provide arenas for new experiences of nature. In addition, even if gardens’ biophysical features and gardening practices allow a series of processes that provide social and ecological benefits and outcomes, these gardens refer to environmental stewardship practices by cultivating relational values.

Microplastics are generally referred to particles with a size lower than 5 mm. These microplastics are tiny plastic granules and used as scrubbers in cosmetics, hand cleansers, air-blasting. These contaminants are omnipresent within almost all marine environments at present. The durability of plastics makes it highly resistant to degradation and through indiscriminate disposal they enter in the aquatic environment. Today, it is an issue of increasing scientific concern because these microparticles due to their small size are easily accessible to a wide range of aquatic organisms and ultimately transferred along food web. The chronic biological effects in marine organisms results due to accumulation of microplastics in their cells and tissues. The potential hazardous effects on humans by alternate ingestion of microparticles can cause alteration in chromosomes which lead to infertility, obesity, and cancer. Because of the recent threat of microplastics to marine biota as well as on human health, it is important to control excessive use of plastic additives and to introduce certain legislations and policies to regulate the sources of plastic litter.

Despite the resulting degradation of forest structure, selectively logged forests still harbor a substantial amount of biodiversity leading to suggestions that their protection is the next best alternative to conserving primary, old-growth forests. Restoring carbon stocks under Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes is a potential method for obtaining funding to protect logged forests, via enrichment planting and liberation cutting of vines. This study investigates the impacts of restoring logged forests in Borneo on avian phylogenetic diversity, the total evolutionary history shared across all species within a community, and on functional diversity, with important implications for the protection of evolutionarily unique species and the provision of many ecosystem services. Overall and understorey avifaunal communities were studied using point count and mist netting surveys, respectively. Restoration caused a significant loss in phylogenetic diversity and MPD (mean pairwise distance) leaving an overall bird community of less total evolutionary history and more closely related species compared to unlogged forests, while the understorey bird community had MNTD (mean nearest taxon distance) that returned toward the lower levels found in a primary forest, indicating more closely related species pairs. The overall bird community experienced a significant loss of functional strategies and species with more specialized traits in restored forests compared to that of unlogged forests, which led to functional clustering in the community. Restoration also led to a reduction in functional richness and thus niches occupied in the understorey bird community compared to unlogged forests. While there are additional benefits of restoration for forest regeneration, carbon sequestration, future timber harvests, and potentially reduced threat of forest conversion, this must be weighed against the apparent loss of phylogenetic and functional diversity from unlogged forest levels, making the biodiversity-friendliness of carbon sequestration schemes questionable under future REDD+ agreements. To reduce perverse biodiversity outcomes, it is important to focus restoration only on the most degraded areas or at reduced intensity where breaks between regimes are incorporated. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","biodiversity; birds; Liana cutting; payments for ecosystem services; REDD+; restoration; selective logging; silviculture; Southeast Asia; sustainable forest management","bird; carbon sequestration; clearcutting; community response; ecosystem service; emission control; forest management; phylogenetics; restoration ecology; selective logging; silviculture; sustainable development; tropical forest; vine; Southeast Asia; Aves",2-s2.0-85028586717

Previous studies indicate a high presence of seaweeds from the genus Gelidium attached to floating bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica (Chamisso) Hariot. Herein, we analyzed the phylogeographic patterns of Gelidium lingulatum (Kützing 1868) and G. rex (Santelices and Abbott 1985), species that are partially co-distributed along the Chilean coast (28°S–42°S). A total of 319 individuals from G. lingulatum and 179 from G. rex (20 and 11 benthic localities, respectively) were characterized using a mitochondrial marker (COI) and, for a subset, using a chloroplastic marker (rbcL). Gelidium lingulatum had higher genetic diversity, but its genetic structure did not follow a clear geographic pattern, while G. rex had less genetic diversity with a shallow genetic structure and a phylogeographic break coinciding with the phylogeographic discontinuity described for this region (29°S–33°S). In G. lingulatum, no isolation-by-distance was observed, in contrast to G. rex. The phylogeographic pattern of G. lingulatum could be explained mainly by rafting dispersal as an epiphyte of D. antarctica, although other mechanisms cannot be completely ruled out (e.g., human-mediated dispersal). The contrasting pattern observed in G. rex could be attributed to other factors such as intertidal distribution (i.e., G. rex occurs in the lower zone compared to G. lingulatum) or differential efficiency of recruitment after long-distance dispersal.

Despite considerable research on species responses to changing climate, we still lack understanding of the role of specific climatic factors, and their interactions, for species responses. We also lack understanding of the relative importance of plasticity vs. adaptation in determining the observed responses. As a model, we use a dominant clonal grass, Festuca rubra, originating from a natural climatic grid of 12 localities in western Norway that allows factorial combinations of temperature (mean growing season temperatures ranging from 6·5 to 10·5 °C) and precipitation (annual precipitation ranging from 600 to 2700 mm). We grew clones from all populations in four growth chambers representing the four climatic extremes in the climate grid (warm/cold × wet/dry). Genetic differentiation and direction and magnitude of plastic responses vary systematically among populations throughout the climatic grid. Growth-related plant traits are highly plastic and their degree of plasticity depends on their origin. In contrast, the traits reflecting species' foraging strategy are not plastic but vary with the climate of origin. Levels of plasticity of growth-related traits and genetically differentiated foraging traits thus might constrain local populations' ability to cope with novel climates. Synthesis. Shifts in temperature and precipitation, at the scale and direction expected for the region in the next century, are likely to dramatically affect plant performance. This study illustrates how the interplay between genetic differentiation and plasticity in response to both temperature and precipitation will affect the specific responses of species to climate change. Such complex responses will affect how climate-change impacts scale up to the community and ecosystem levels. Future studies thus need to specifically consider regionally relevant climate-change projections, and also explore the role of genetic differentiation and plasticity and how this varies within local floras. Our study also demonstrates that even widespread species with seemingly broad climatic niches may strongly differ in their population performance and plasticity. Climate-change studies should therefore not be limited to rare and restricted species. © 2017 The Authors.

Context-dependent interactions between species are common but often poorly described. Caution must be expressed in seeing apex predators as ecological saviours because ecosystem services may not universally apply, particularly if inhibited by anthropogenic activity. This review examines how the impacts of large carnivores are affected by four major contexts (species assemblage, environmental productivity, landscape, predation risk) and the potential for human interference to affect these contexts. Humans are the most dominant landscape and resource user on the planet and our management intervention affects species composition, resource availability, demography, behaviour and interspecific trophic dynamics. Humans can impact large carnivores in much the same way these apex predators impact mesopredators and prey species — through density-mediated (consumptive) and trait/behaviourally-mediated (non-consumptive) pathways. Mesopredator and large herbivore suppression or release, intraguild competition and predation pressure may all be affected by human context. The aim of restoring ‘natural’ systems is somewhat problematic and not always pragmatic. Interspecific interactions are influenced by context, and humans are often the dominant driver in forming context. If management and conservation goals are to be achieved then it is pivotal to understand how humans influence trophic interactions and how trophic interactions are affected by context. Trade-offs and management interventions can only be implemented successfully if the intricacies of food webs are properly understood. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Apex predator; Interspecific competition; Landscape of fear; Large carnivore; Mesopredator release hypothesis; Predation risk",,2-s2.0-84962157639

They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns.

Osmoregulation is the main physiological mechanism that maintains the hydromineral homeostasis of these animals. The difference of osmoregulation capacities between an osmoconformer and an osmoregulator species is mainly explained by anisosmotic extracellular regulation (AER) and/or isosmotic intracellular regulation (IIR). This review will also discuss the particular acquisition of specific osmoregulation capacities in crustaceans from the first embryonic stages to the adult. Several findings revealed that gills and antennal glands are the primordial hydromineral regulation tissues, and they present the same structure and function in all crustaceans, except in shrimps. These tissues contain ionocytes that harbor membrane pumps implicated in ion regulation. Na+/K+-ATPase, the major of these membrane proteins, acts upon rapid ionic changes, usually in cooperation with several other membrane pumps.

It outlines the anticancer, anti-parasitic, and antimicrobial activities of Piper species in relation to drug discovery. The use of bioactive compounds from medicinal plants as therapeutic agents has been an important area in biomedical and natural product research. Piper species are effective medicinal plants used in folk medicine. They have traditionally been used to treat stomach ache, rheumatoid arthritis, diarrhoea and other general infections, and their efficacy has been attributed to their bioactive compounds. Bioactive compounds and extracts from Piper species have been examined and found to be of clinical importance for both malignant and non-malignant diseases. They have displayed pronounced efficacy as anticancer, antitumour and antimicrobial agents in various pharmacological studies. They have been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antimalarial activities. The alkaloids piperine, piperlongumine, guineensine, chabamide and pellitorine, which have been isolated from most Piper species, are able to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines inducing apoptosis and acting as nuclear export inhibitors. These bioactive compounds can improve the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs with minimal systemic toxicity to normal cells in cancer therapy. Pinoresinol, guineensine and other bioactive compounds from this species exhibited strong antimicrobial efficacy against various microorganisms including pathogenic Vibrio strains, which are often involved in host cell invasion during Vibrio cholera infection.

High-throughput variant discovery has been made possible in multiple species by the recent advent of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies. New genotyping methods that are high-throughput, accurate, and inexpensive are urgently needed for gaining full access to the abundant genetic variation of organisms. This approach is known as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), which holds great promise as a research tool because of its ability to allow simultaneous marker discovery and genotyping at low cost and with a simple molecular biology workflow for fisheries and aquaculture studies. Since it was first developed for rice in 2009, GBS has been applied in over 50 species/studies by the end of 2014. It is also increasingly in use in fisheries and aquaculture and has been applied in nearly 40 species/studies from 2015 to present. This review summarizes the genotyping methodologies, recent advances in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies to achieve GBS, and the promises this approach holds as a genome-wide genotyping application in fisheries and aquaculture. Additionally, we discuss the potential of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in GBS and present the advances of WGS in fisheries and aquaculture. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Fish; Genotyping-by-sequencing; Next-generation sequencing; Single nucleotide polymorphism markers; Whole-genome sequencing","aquaculture; biomarker; DNA; fishery; gene; genome; genotype; polymorphism",2-s2.0-85017022786

Here we describe general food web theory and the potential application of network theory to it; summarise the possible roles of predators in food webs; document the occurrence, diet and presumed functions that canids play in food webs throughout the world; give case studies of four threatened canid species of top, middle and basal trophic positions and six anthropogenically affected species; and identify knowledge limitations and propose research frameworks necessary to establish the roles of canids in food webs. Canids can be top-down drivers of systems or responsive to the availability of resources including suitable prey. They can be affected anthropogenically by habitat change, lethal control and changes to basic resource availability. They can be sustainable yield harvesters of their indigenous prey or passengers in complex ecosystems, and some are prey of larger canids and of other predators. Nevertheless, the roles of most canids are generally poorly studied and described, and some, e.g. Gray Wolves, Coyotes and Australian dingoes, are controversial.

The influence of the surfactant was analyzed in detail, particularly the formation of surfactant layers (complete or partial) connected with the length of the surfactant tail (16 and 18 methyl groups or number of carbons in the chain). Raw materials were characterized by XRD and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), SMZ and SMC were analyzed by FTIR. Results obtained from kinetic adsorption experiments shown that equilibrium time is less for materials modified with HDTMA (8 h) than materials with BODA (10 and 12 h). Materials modified with the largest chain surfactant (BODA) showed more resistance to atrazine masse transference. The chemisorption was presented in the adsorption mechanisms of atrazine and adsorbent materials. Based on the results of adsorption isotherms Langmuir isotherms showed the better correlation coefficients value. The qmax is greater for materials modified with BODA (0.9232 and 4.2448 mg/g) than for materials modified with HDTMA (0.6731 and 3.9121 mg/g).

For this purpose field experiments were conducted at two different locations having variable climatic conditions to manage P. hysterophorus through some suppressive plants. The study revealed that sorghum, buffel grass, millet and maize showed good suppressive ability of P. hysterophorus weed biomass as compared to control which produced higher biomass at both field sites. However, at lower altitude site i.e Swabi, the highest P. hysterophorus dry biomass (340.45 g m-2) was recorded in moth bean plots, while at high altitude site (Haripur), the maximum P. hysterophorus dry biomass (384.80 g m-2) was found in mung bean plots. Moreover, at both sites, the sorghum, buffel grass, millet and maize plants reduced the P. hysterophorus growth up to 84.0%, 79.0%, 70.2% and 67.5%, respectively. Whereas mung bean and moth bean were found poor suppressive plants to reduce the growth of P. hysterophorus. Furthermore, the competitive ability of P. hysterophorus with other plants were climatic condition dependent as this weed poorly compete with the tested plants in the warmer climatic condition at Swabi site than the cooler area at Haripur site.

It is therefore a priority to test the susceptibility of those species and their provenances, within Central and Northern Europe and find biological control agents (BCAs) against the disease.

This study has demonstrated, for the first time, the susceptibility of P. mugo to F. circinatum. Likewise, the susceptibility of P. abies was also confirmed. The fact that the Romanian provenance of P. sylvestris has not been susceptible to F. circinatum suggests genetic resistance as a potential tool to manage the disease.

Here, we review studies on predator neophobia and explore its underlying patterns within an ecological framework. Predator neophobia is typically assessed by observing behaviours in novel areas that bring potential risk from unknown predators, or by observing behaviours towards certain kinds of objects and odours that are novel. We conducted a literature review across taxa, surveying research on baseline and induced neophobia versus controls. We calculated effect sizes for the intensity of neophobic responses, and categorized data according to six factors (taxa, age class, background type, trophic position, test cue type and experimental treatment type). While accounting for each of the other factors, we found that baseline neophobia was stronger among birds and mammals, and towards novel areas, relative to other taxa and cue types. Baseline neophobiawas lower for wild-caught animals and for those that were higher in trophic position, compared with those reared in captivity and from lower trophic levels. By contrast, induced neophobia was similar in intensity across taxa, background types and testing cue types, while again being lower among upper trophic-level members and among juvenile animals. Although induced neophobia occurred across all treatment types, brain lesions induced stronger neophobia than predation risk or social isolation.

Grassland loss was assessed by an analysis of symmetric differences and the habitat suitability model was carried out by the method of overlapping layers raster. Our results showed a grassland loss of 63.7%; however, our current habitat suitability model points out that much of the grassland loss has occurred where the environmental conditions are suitable.

Likewise, the models for years 2050 and 2070 under the criteria RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, suggest that anthropic activity will continue be the main cause of the grassland loss.

The development of these ABs and IL eggplant populations had a low efficiency in the early stages, because of the lack of molecular markers and genomic tools. However, this dramatically improved after performing genotyping-by-sequencing in the first round of selfing, followed by high-resolution-melting single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping in subsequent selection steps. A set of 73 selected ABs covered 99% of the S. incanum genome, while 25 fixed immortal ILs, each carrying a single introgressed fragment in homozygosis, altogether spanned 61.7% of the S. incanum genome.

Sixty-eight candidate genes involved in drought tolerance were identified in the set of ILs.

Bird invasions have been frequently used as study models, and the foundation of current knowledge largely relies on species purposefully introduced during the 19th and early 20th centuries in countries colonized by Europeans. However, the profile of exotic bird species has changed radically in the last decades, as birds are now mostly introduced into the invasion process through unplanned releases from the worldwide pet and avicultural trade. Here we assessed the role of the three main drivers of invasion success (i.e., event-, species-, and location-level factors) on the establishment and spatial spread of exotic birds using an unprecedented dataset recorded throughout the last 100 y in the Iberian Peninsula. Our multimodel inference phylogenetic approach showed that the barriers that need to be overcome by a species to successfully establish or spread are not the same. Whereas establishment is largely related to event-level factors, apparently stochastic features of the introduction (time since first introduction and propagule pressure) and to the origin of introduced species (wild-caught species show higher invasiveness than captive-bred ones), the spread across the invaded region seems to be determined by the extent to which climatic conditions in the new region resemble those of the species’ native range. Overall, these results contrast with what we learned from successful deliberate introductions and highlight that different management interventions should apply at different invasion stages, the most efficient strategies being related to event-level factors. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

The differences in range shift capacity of the various types of species may disrupt long-term co-evolved relationships especially those belowground, however, this may be less so for seed-borne endophytic microbes. We collected seeds and soil of the range-expanding Centaurea stoebe and the congeneric Centaurea jacea from three populations growing in Slovenia (native range of both Centaurea species) and the Netherlands (expanded range of C. stoebe, native range of C. jacea). We isolated and identified endophytic fungi directly from seeds, as well as from roots of the plants grown in Slovenian, Dutch or sterilized soil to compare fungal endophyte composition. Furthermore, we investigated whether C. stoebe hosts a reduced community composition of endophytes in the expanded range due to release from plant-species specific fungi while endophyte communities in C. jacea in both ranges are similar. We cultivated 46 unique and phylogenetically diverse endophytes. A majority of the seed endophytes resembled potential pathogens, while most root endophytes were not likely to be pathogenic. Only one endophyte was found in both roots and seeds, but was isolated from different plant species. Unexpectedly, seed endophyte diversity of southern C. stoebe populations was lower than of populations from the north, while the seed endophyte community composition of northern C. stoebe populations was significantly different southern C. stoebe as well as northern and southern C. jacea populations. Root endophyte diversity was considerably lower in C. stoebe than in C. jacea independent of plant and soil origin, but this difference disappeared when plants were grown in sterile soils. We conclude that the community composition of fungal endophytes not only differs between related plant species but also between populations of plants that expand their range compared to their native habitat. Our results suggest that fungal endophytes of two Centaurea species are not able to systemically infect plants. We highlight that endophytes remain poorly studied and further work should investigate the functional importance of endophytes. © 2017 Geisen, Kostenko, Cnossen, ten Hooven, Vreš and van der Putten.","Cultivation; Endophytes; Fungi; Phylogeny; Range expanding plant species; Seeds; Soil; Soil Sterilization","Centaurea; endophytic fungus; fungal cell culture; habitat; human; human cell; instrument sterilization; nonhuman; phylogeny; plant root; plant seed; soil; species",2-s2.0-85028473669

During migration and particularly upon arrival at the Anatolian coast, they support an important fishery and valuable source of income for the regional community. Black Sea anchovy have undergone significant stock fluctuations partly related to climatic conditions; for example, migrating anchovy schools arrived late or failed to arrive at the Anatolian coast when fall temperatures increased. It is therefore of importance to understand the conditions required for successful overwintering migration and explore different migration routes. This study invokes a Lagrangian modeling approach applied to satellite derived circulation and temperature data as a first attempt to model anchovy migration dynamics in the Black Sea. This modeling approach takes the influence of the physical environment into account, while the quality of overwintering grounds, adaptive, schooling, and homing behavior is neglected. The model is used to investigate the possible influence of interannual and seasonal variability of temperature and surface currents, as well as the influence of migration behavior on the success of anchovy overwintering migration for both the Black Sea and Azov Sea anchovy. The results of the present work show the possibility that overwintering anchovy fished along the Turkish Eastern Anatolian coast may not exclusively originate from the northwestern shelf, but mainly from the eastern Black Sea basin. Migration pathways are identified for both Black Sea and Azov Sea anchovy, which are of importance for the national fisheries efforts of riparian countries. The modeling results are in agreement with general patterns of anchovy migration given in the literature indicating that the physical environment may be a major factor in shaping general migration patterns. Simulation results are used to hypothesize about alternatives to previously determined migration routes and provide potential reasons that explain the inability of the Bulgarian anchovy fishery to recover. Results show that the intensity and timing of autumnal cooling, coupled with current strength, can be of significant importance in determining annual and seasonal variability of migration success. Considering the need for fisheries management to account for the variability in fishable overwintering anchovy stocks a modeling approach as developed in the current study may provide such a tool. © 2017 Guraslan, Fach and Oguz.","Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus); Black Sea; Climate variability; Common Fisheries Policy; Overwintering migration",,2-s2.0-85028471695

Elite cultivars, landraces and wild relatives harbor useful genetic variation that needs to be more easily utilized in plant breeding. We review genome-wide approaches for assessing and identifying alleles associated with desirable agronomic traits in diverse germplasm pools of cereals and legumes. Major quantitative trait loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with desirable agronomic traits have been deployed to enhance crop productivity and resilience. These include alleles associated with variation conferring enhanced photoperiod and flowering traits. Genetic variants in the florigen pathway can provide both environmental flexibility and improved yields. SNPs associated with length of growing season and tolerance to abiotic stresses (precipitation, high temperature) are valuable resources for accelerating breeding for drought-prone environments. Both genomic selection and genome editing can also harness allelic diversity and increase productivity by improving multiple traits, including phenology, plant architecture, yield potential and adaptation to abiotic stresses. Discovering rare alleles and useful haplotypes also provides opportunities to enhance abiotic stress adaptation, while epigenetic variation has potential to enhance abiotic stress adaptation and productivity in crops. By reviewing current knowledge on specific traits and their genetic basis, we highlight recent developments in the understanding of crop functional diversity and identify potential candidate genes for future use. The storage and integration of genetic, genomic and phenotypic information will play an important role in ensuring broad and rapid application of novel genetic discoveries by the plant breeding community. Exploiting alleles for yield-related traits would allow improvement of selection efficiency and overall genetic gain of multigenic traits. An integrated approach involving multiple stakeholders specializing in management and utilization of genetic resources, crop breeding, molecular biology and genomics, agronomy, stress tolerance, and reproductive/seed biology will help to address the global challenge of ensuring food security in the face of growing resource demands and climate change induced stresses. © 2017 Dwivedi, Scheben, Edwards, Spillane and Ortiz.","Crop improvement; Epigenetic variation; Florigen pathways; Functional diversity; Genome editing; Genomic estimated breeding value; Haplotypes; TILLING",,2-s2.0-85029184256

In this paper we analysed the behavioural relationships between two species of crayfish, the native Astacus leptodactylus and the invasive Orconectes limosus in an ongoing invasion process in the Lower Danube, in Eastern Europe. We tested the species' ability to acquire shelter and food in laboratory experiments in both intra-A nd interspecific confrontations. The dominant behaviour of the invasive species is obvious even towards its own congeners, while the native species display a more tolerant conspecific behaviour. With respect to interspecific confrontation, the invasive crayfish males and females were inclined to sex-specific dominance regarding shelters. A roughly balanced behaviour was noted for intersexual confrontations. The results of this study also highlight that the occupancy of a shelter is more disputed than food resources, which appear to be opportunistically acquired. In the context of the current invasion process, we hypothesised that the effect caused by interference competition might lead to a decline of the native species.

From 2014 to 2016, many different strategies were applied to contact and engage the public and approximately 14,000 citizens were reached directly. Additionally, printed and online material informed the public about this project. Citizens could transmit data on the target species, accompanied by a photograph, via the web-site of the project or through a dedicated application (app) for smartphones and tablets. All records were validated by experts based on the photographs sent by citizens. A total number of 2,308 records were transmitted and 1,691 (73.2%) of these were confirmed. Most of the reports were submitted via the website, although the submission via the app increased over time. The species most commonly recorded was L. cervus, followed by M. asper/funereus and R. alpina. Data collected by citizen scientists allowed a detailed analysis to be made on altitudinal distribution and phenology of the species and the results obtained were compared with literature data on altitudinal distribution and phenology. For example, for L. cervus, 67% of the records collected were from the altitudinal range 0–400 m a.s.l. Interestingly, the data showed that the phenology of this species changed with altitude.

Climate change and the increasing magnitude and frequency of introductions of species across geographic barriers as a result of international trade are likely to change their establishment, spread, abundance, physiology or phenology, potentially also altering their human health impacts. Yet despite receiving increasing attention in the scientific literature, there have been few attempts to quantify recent changes in human health impacts. Here we report the findings from a systematic map of the literature identifying evidence of any change in the occurrence, frequency or severity of impacts of alien species on human health in Europe over the last 25 years. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the ecological and medical literature using English language search terms to identify potentially relevant studies. Search results were assessed against inclusion criteria published in an a priori protocol at title, abstract and full-text to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Repeatability was checked at each stage by comparing a subset between reviewers and testing for inter-rater agreement using Cohen's kappa test. Studies deemed relevant at full text were coded against bibliographic, inclusion and study design criteria to create a searchable database of evidence. Results: Searches retrieved over 15,700 results yet only sixteen cases met criteria for inclusion in the systematic map. Most of this evidence represents first records of impacts from different areas, and in particular first reports of transmission of exotic diseases by introduced mosquito species. Conclusions: There is currently limited published evidence demonstrating a change in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts caused by alien species in Europe over the last 25 years. Relevant studies relate to only a few species, often report specific cases and rarely link health impacts with ecology, distribution or spread of the species. Difficulties in attributing human health impacts, such as stings or allergies, to a specific alien species likely complicate attempts to measure changes, as may differences in professional interests between the environmental and health professions. Future studies could helpfully compare spread or abundance with reported, rather than potential, health impacts. Better cooperation between invasion ecologists and health professionals working in affected areas are likely to be necessary to improve the evidence base on this topic for the future. © 2017 The Author(s).","Allergens; Biological invasions; Bites; Dermatitis; Disease; Public health; Stings",,2-s2.0-85027855412

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for image tampering detection and localization, leveraging characteristic footprints left on images by different camera models. The rationale behind our algorithm is that all pixels of pristine images should be detected as being shot with a single device. Conversely, if a picture is obtained through image composition, traces of multiple devices can be detected. The proposed algorithm exploits a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract characteristic camera model features from image patches. These features are then analyzed by means of iterative clustering techniques in order to detect whether an image has been forged, and localize the alien region. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Cameras; Computer vision; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Convolutional neural network; Image capturing devices; Image composition; Image manipulation; Image tampering; Iterative clustering; Multiple devices; Tampering detection; Image processing",2-s2.0-85030231134

At all levels of ecosystems, biodiversity decreases with acidification, due to the elimination of species that are most sensitive to low pH. Forest ponds belong to a specific group that varied in location, a huge amount of leaf litter, and isolation from other aquatic environments. They are crucial in the industrial landscape with well-developed industry and human activity. The aim was to investigate the relative importance of water chemistry in explaining snail assemblage compositions and species richness in forest ponds of contrasting pH. Patterns in gastropod communities were determined from an analysis in 26 forest ponds with multivariate gradient analysis. Ponds ranged in a base mean pH from 3.0 to 9.0. pH has been found to be an important factor influencing gastropod fauna. Neutral ponds support diverse communities, typical of small water bodies. In two acidic pond types, snail fauna was different. Among the species characteristic for acidic ponds (pH < 6) were Anisus spirorbis and Aplexa hypnorum. The greatest distinct characterised alkaline ponds with the numerous appearance of alien Physa acuta. The most diverse gastropod fauna was found in neutral ponds, whereas the lowest degree of diversity was found in ponds with the lowest pH. Current knowledge of pH-associated changes in aquatic ecosystems is still incomplete because anthropogenic acidification is a recent phenomenon. It is extremely important in forest habitats, since they react more intensively to climatic factors and are often used in landscape management and planning.","Acidity; Forest; Forest landscape; Gastropods; pH; Woodland ponds","fresh water; animal; biodiversity; forest; pond; snail; Animals; Biodiversity; Forests; Fresh Water; Ponds; Snails",2-s2.0-85031703508

Current research has shown the importance of not only understanding the structure of these mutualistic interaction networks but also their temporal dynamics. Temporal changes in species abundance, such as those caused by vertebrate resource tracking, may create temporal variability in a network though neighborhood effects and influence the directedness of dispersal. While much research has been done on resource tracking, neighborhood effects, and directed dispersal individually, little research has been done into their interrelationships and, therefore, theory of how resource tracking can influence frugivory and seed dispersal networks remains poorly developed. We use the available literature to show the prevalence of resource tracking by vertebrate frugivores and hypothesize how, through neighborhood effects, resource tracking may influence short-term variation in network properties. We then discuss how resource tracking can influence long-term network properties by altering the dispersal of plant species. Lastly, we use this information to hypothesize how the introductions of new species into a community may alter the influence of resource tracking on frugivory and seed dispersal. While trait matching and links that are not possible between species in a community (i.e., forbidden links) play a large role in determining the structure of a network, temporal change in the abundance of species due to resource tracking may also affect the properties of networks. By increasing our understanding of the role resource tracking has in the temporal variability of frugivory and seed dispersal networks, we can better determine the full extent of species interactions and provide valuable information for the conservation of ecological communities. © 2017 Gleditsch, Hruska and Foster.","Frugivory; Neighborhood effects; Networks; Resource tracking; Seed dispersal; Temporal variation",,2-s2.0-85031737901

These climate change-induced shifts in distributions inevitably expose plants to novel biotic and abiotic environments, including altered solar ultraviolet (UV)-B (280–315 nm) radiation regimes. Do the greater migration potentials of non-native species into higher elevations imply that they have more effective UV-protective mechanisms than native species? In this study, we surveyed leaf epidermal UV-A transmittance (TUVA) in a diversity of plant species representing different growth forms to test whether native and non-native species growing above 2800 m elevation on Mauna Kea, Hawaii differed in their UV screening capabilities. We further compared the degree to which TUVA varied along an elevation gradient in the native shrub Vaccinium reticulatum and the introduced forb Verbascum thapsus to evaluate whether these species differed in their abilities to adjust their levels of UV screening in response to elevation changes in UV-B. For plants growing in the Mauna Kea alpine/upper subalpine, we found that adaxial TUVA, measured with a UVA-PAM fluorometer, varied significantly among species but did not differ between native (mean = 6.0%; n = 8) and non-native (mean = 5.8%; n = 11) species. When data were pooled across native and non-native taxa, we also found no significant effect of growth form on TUVA, though woody plants (shrubs and trees) were represented solely by native species whereas herbaceous growth forms (grasses and forbs) were dominated by non-native species. Along an elevation gradient spanning 2600–3800 m, TUVA was variable (mean range = 6.0–11.2%) and strongly correlated with elevation and relative biologically effective UV-B in the exotic V. thapsus; however, TUVA was consistently low (3%) and did not vary with elevation in the native V. reticulatum. Results indicate that high levels of UV protection occur in both native and non-native species in this high UV-B tropical alpine environment, and that flexibility in UV screening is a mechanism employed by some, but not all species to cope with varying solar UV-B exposures along elevation gradients. © 2017 Barnes, Ryel and Flint.","Alpine; Elevation gradient; Epidermal UV-A transmittance; Flavonoids; Hawaii; Native species; Non-native species; Ultraviolet radiation",,2-s2.0-85029179369

Plants divert substantial resources to produce nectar that attracts pollinators [3], but toxins in this reward could disrupt the mutualism and reduce plant fitness [4]. Alternatively, such compounds could protect nectar from robbers [2], provided that they do not significantly alter pollinator visitation to the detriment of plant fitness [1, 5–8]. Indeed, very few studies have investigated the role of plant toxins in nectar for defense against nectar robbers [4, 9, 10]. Here, we compared two Aconitum species (A. napellus and A. lycoctonum) that have flowers specialized for long-tongued bumblebee pollinators (Bombus hortorum) but are occasionally robbed by short-tongued bumblebees (B. terrestris) [6, 11–13]. Pollinator visits to flowers were much more frequent than by robbers, but visits correlated negatively with nectar alkaloid concentration and declined sharply between 200 and 380 ppm. However, alkaloid concentrations of >20 ppm were deterrent to B. terrestris, suggesting that robbers were less tolerant of nectar alkaloids. Nectar of both plant species contained similar concentrations of carbohydrates and toxic alkaloids, but A. lycoctonum was more likely to secrete nectar in each flower and was also visited more frequently by pollinators and robbers. We conclude that alkaloids in Aconitum spp. nectar affect rates of both pollinator visitation and robbery but may have co-evolved with nectar availability to maintain the fitness benefits of specialized plant-pollinator relationships. Chemical defense of nectar is, however, ultimately constrained by pollinator gustatory sensitivity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aconitum; alkaloids; Bombus; bumblebees; chemical defense; nectar larceny; nectar toxin; Rana automated monitoring; specialized pollinators",,2-s2.0-85028358977

The complex chemistry, multiple formation pathways, and lack of easily identifiable spectral features associated with aerosols make it especially challenging to constrain their key properties. We propose a transmission spectroscopy technique to identify the primary aerosol formation mechanism for the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters (HIHJs). The technique is based on the expectation that the two key types of aerosols - photochemically generated hazes and equilibrium condensate clouds - are expected to form and persist in different regions of a highly irradiated planet's atmosphere. Haze can only be produced on the permanent daysides of tidally locked hot Jupiters, and will be carried downwind by atmospheric dynamics to the evening terminator (seen as the trailing limb during transit). Clouds can only form in cooler regions on the nightside and morning terminator of HIHJs (seen as the leading limb during transit). Because opposite limbs are expected to be impacted by different types of aerosols, ingress and egress spectra, which primarily probe opposing sides of the planet, will reveal the dominant aerosol formation mechanism. We show that the benchmark HIHJ, WASP-121b, has a transmission spectrum consistent with partial aerosol coverage and that ingress-egress spectroscopy would constrain the location and formation mechanism of those aerosols. In general, using this diagnostic we find that observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and potentially with the Hubble Space Telescope should be able to distinguish between clouds and haze for currently known HIHJs. © 2017.

The objectives of the study were: (1) to determine what land-use changes took place that could have influenced the spread of IAPs; and (2) to document the patterns of spread of IAPs. Aerial photographs from 1938, 1966, 1977, 1989 and 2004 were used to determine the types and rates of land-use change over time. Key land-use changes involved agriculture, commercial plantations, urban development and the spread of IAPs. The spatial analysis identified the main drivers of change. Agricultural development was the main land-use change driver and affected 40% of the study area by 1977. Areas occupied by IAPs increased with land-use change from 8% cover in 1938 to 40% in 2004, and then declined to 15% in 2013 following the initiation of control operations in 2004.

A review of current literature, in which most species tested were from temperate or subtropical regions, shows that invasive ascidians can indeed tolerate a large range of salinities and temperatures. In this study, we used 4 tropical ascidians from Caribbean Panama as models to test survival of adults and their ability to maintain ionic gradients between blood and seawater in different salinities (10 to 45 ppt) and temperatures (15 and 29°C); we also measured early development success. We used these physiological data along with environmental information collected from ports to estimate the colonization pressure of these species in ports with shipping connections to Panama. Adults were more tolerant than gametes to both increased and decreased salinities; order of tolerance was Ascidia sydneiensis &gt; A. curvata &gt; Phallusia nigra &gt; A. panamensis. All species were able to regulate ions (Cl-, Na+, Mg++, K+) when tested at different salinities, indicating a mechanism for tolerance to varying environmental conditions. Preliminary colonization pressure analysis indicated that 31% of the ports we evaluated are at risk of colonization by the 3 most tolerant species, with a high of 78% risk by A. sydneiensis; only 22% of the ports studied were determined to be not at risk. We predict that A. sydneiensis will spread in the East Pacific and the expansion of the Panama Canal will increase opportunities for A. curvata (high proba - bility) and P. nigra (lower probability) to be transported to the Pacific coast of America. © Inter-Research 2017.","Colonization pressure; Exotic species; Invasion debt; Ion regulation; Panama; Phlebobranchia; Salinity tolerance; Temperature tolerance; Tunicata","Ascidia nigra; Ascidia sydneiensis; Ascidiacea; Phlebobranchia; Proba; Urochordata",2-s2.0-85027693352

Many invasive marine crabs (infraorder Brachyura) are regarded as particularly capable consumers; however, native crabs can also exert significant influence on community structure. We used marine crabs as a focal group to test whether non-native consumers have greater impacts than native consumers on native prey populations by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of 834 crab foraging experiments. In addition to the effect of crab origin (non-native or native) on prey abundance, we examined the effects of interaction type (direct or indirect), prey type, and experimental design. Overall, direct consumption by non-native crabs did not reduce prey abundance more than predation by native crabs, although the magnitude of reductions in prey abundance varied with prey type and experimental design. Indirect inter - actions with crabs (i.e. through trophic cascades with crabs as the initiators) generally increased the abundance of native species. The direct and indirect impacts of non-native crabs were significantly greater than those of native crabs on primary producers and in simplified experiments with low species diversity. Thus, detecting differences between native and non-native crabs may be heavily influenced by experimental design. Importantly, we found few studies that considered direct interactions (competitive or predatory) between native and non-native crabs. These inter - actions should be a focus of future research because they could greatly alter consumption rates and overall prey mortality in the wild. © Inter-Research 2017.","Aquatic invasive species; Ecological impact; Marine crustaceans; Meta-analysis; Taxonomic distinctiveness hypothesis","Brachyura; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea)",2-s2.0-85027686486

The use of physical features or coarse habitat types as surrogates of species distribution often does not provide an accurate enough (and hence useful) mapping of where species occur. This is further exacerbated in datapoor regions, where habitat maps in the marine environment are often patchy. A combination of satellite imaging analysis (for a rough classification of the main habitat types in shallow waters) and occupancy modelling based on data collected through dedicated underwater surveys is proposed as a relatively inexpensive and timely way to identify priority areas for the conservation of selected benthic species. The occupancy surveys provide estimates of the probability of presence, which can be used as weights of the importance of the available suitable habitat types in a potential habitat index (PHI). This approach was applied in the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) for 6 benthic hard-bottom species of conservation importance. Repetitive SCUBA diving surveys were conducted at six 5 m depth zones between 0 and 30 m at 47 locations in the Aegean Sea to detect the presence of the target species. Occupancy was modelled using several environmental spatial covariates. The applied method explicitly incorporated imperfect detectability in the modelling process. Predictive distributional maps of PHI were produced for each species, identifying areas that could be prioritized for conservation measures. Despite some limitations, this approach can provide a baseline for the protection of vulnerable species, in the framework of adaptive management for marine conservation planning. © Inter-Research 2017.","Biodiversity mapping; Detectability; Marine conservation; Occupancy; Species distribution; Underwater visual survey",,2-s2.0-85027727415

But because unauthorised immigrants are officially excluded from formal labour markets, housing markets and most welfare provisions, they can settle if they find other sources of work, income, housing, and social protection. In this regard, a crucial role is played by various intermediaries: people or institutions who favour the entrance of immigrants, their entry into the labour market, accommodation, response to their social needs, and possibly regularisation. They can act for profit, but also for moral reasons. They can break the laws and work in the shadows, but they can also work in legal forms. In this article, I will explore the identities of these intermediaries and their practices of support towards irregular migrants. My purpose is to show (1) what precisely constitutes intermediation, in what activities it can be factored, and what the main categories of intermediaries are; (2) that the implementation of migration policies is hindered not only by migrants’ practices to circumvent controls but also by the action of these intermediaries.

This paper provides an overview of the serpulid species found in North America, as part of a broader study of fouling invertebrates focused on NIS (non-indigenous species) in United States coastal ecosystems. Almost 4400 serpulid specimens were examined from selected fouling plates. Fouling plates were deployed in 26 bays and coastal lagoons along the continental coasts of the United States and Hawaiian islands, primarily in bays and lagoons with salinities averaging 20‰ or greater. Twenty-five serpulid species were identified, including four new records for the United States (Ficopomatus uschakovi, Hydroides cf. brachyacantha, H. longispinosa and Protula longiseta), three known NIS, two presumed NIS, three cryptogenic serpulids, and several range extensions. Crucigera websteri extends its northward range from Santa Barbara Island to Humboldt Bay, California; Ficopomatus enigmaticus, first recorded in North America from San Francisco, California in 1920, Rockport, Texas in 1952 and Barnegat Bay, New Jersey in 1980, is now recorded at additional localities on the east coast (Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina and Indian River, Florida) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Galveston Bay, Texas); F. miamiensis extends its westward range from Louisiana to Texas; F. uschakovi, an IndoPacific and Western African species, was recorded formally for the first time from the northern Gulf of Mexico (Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi, Texas) and the east coast of Florida (Jacksonville). Hydroides cf. brachyacantha extends its northward range from Curaҫao to Pensacola Bay, Florida; H. dirampha from Veracruz, Mexico to Corpus Christi, Texas; H. floridana extends its westward range from Louisiana to Texas; H. gracilis extends its northward range from Pacific Grove to San Francisco, California; Salmacina huxleyi from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Rhode Island; and Spirobranchus minutus from Veracruz, Mexico to Pensacola Bay, Florida. The following additional species range extensions are provisional in that they represent only one record or were not found in the most recent surveys (e.g., Hydroides elegans - east coast): H. longispinosa from Marshall Islands to Oahu, Hawaii; Protula balboensis from Florida to Texas; P. longiseta from the Mexican Caribbean to the Indian River, Florida; H. elegans from San Francisco to Humboldt Bay, northern California and on the east coast from the Indian River, Florida, to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Among surveyed bays, Biscayne Bay, Florida and Corpus Christi, Texas (northern Gulf of Mexico) had the greatest number of species (14 and 8, respectively); in contrast, almost all sites in Alaska, Washington, Oregon (northwest Pacific), Rhode Island, Virginia and South Carolina (Atlantic) had only one or two species each. Hydroides dianthus was, by far, the most abundant serpulid species on fouling plates in the northern Gulf of Mexico and the east coast, while Pseudochitinopoma occidentalis was the most abundant serpulid detected on the west coast.

Supported primarily by the decrease of substrate receptor (SR) proteins of CRLs in cells deficient of a CSN subunit, CSN-mediated cullin deneddylation is believed to prevent autoubiquitination and self-destruction of the SR in active CRLs. However, it is unclear whether the decrease in SRs is solely due to protein destabilization. Moreover, our prior studies have demonstrated that cardiac specific knockout of Cops8 (Cops8-CKO) impairs autophagosome maturation and causes massive necrosis in cardiomyocytes but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Given that Cops8 is nucleus-enriched and a prior report showed its binding to the promoter of several genes and association of its ablation with decreased mRNA levels of these genes, we sought to determine the dynamic changes of myocardial transcriptome in mice with perinatal Cops8-CKO and to explore their functional implications. Methods and Results: Myocardial transcriptomes of Cops8flox/flox, Cops8flox/+::Myh6-Cre, and Cops8flox/flox::Myh6-Cre littermate mice at postnatal 2 and 3 weeks were analyzed. The data were imported into an in-house analysis pipeline using Bioconductor for quantile normalization and statistical analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups at each time point or between time points within the group were revealed by t-test. Genes with p &lt; 0.05 after Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction for multiple hypothesis testing were considered as significant DEGs. We found that (1) the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed significant enrichment of DEGs in multiple pathways, especially those responding to oxidative stress, in homozygous Cops8-CKO hearts at both 2 and 3 weeks, corroborating the occurrence of massive cardiomyocyte necrosis at 3 weeks; (2) the decreases in multiple CRL SR proteins were associated with decreased transcript levels; and (3) enrichment of DEGs in the chromatin remodeling pathway and the microtubule motility and vesicle trafficking pathways. Conclusions: Our data are consistent with the notion that Cops8/CSN plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of CRL SRs and in the redox and vesicle trafficking pathways. © 2017 Abdullah, Eyster, Bjordahl, Xiao, Zeng and Wang.","Conditional gene targeting; COPS8 gene; Cullin-RING ligases; F-box proteins; Mouse; Myocardium; The COP9 signalosome; Transcription profiling",,2-s2.0-85027702776

Reduction in average body size has been suggested as one of the universal responses to global warming in aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, however, coincides with human-enhanced dispersal of alien species and can facilitate their establishment. We address effects of species introductions on the size structure of recipient communities using data on Red Sea bivalves entering the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal. We show that the invasion leads to increase in median body size of the Mediterranean assemblage. Alien species are significantly larger than native Mediterranean bivalves, even though they represent a random subset of the Red Sea species with respect to body size. The observed patterns result primarily from the differences in the taxonomic composition and body-size distributions of the source and recipient species pools. In contrast to the expectations based on the general temperature-size relationships in marine ectotherms, continued warming of the Mediterranean Sea indirectly leads to an increase in the proportion of large-bodied species in bivalve assemblages by accelerating the entry and spread of tropical aliens. These results underscore complex interactions between changing climate and species invasions in driving functional shifts in marine ecosystems. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Homing-based drives comprise an endonuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA) that are replicated during meiosis via homologous recombination. However, their efficacy for controlling wild populations is threatened by inherent polymorphic resistance and the creation of resistance alleles via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair. We used stochastic individual-based models to identify realistic gene-drive strategies capable of eradicating vertebrate pest populations (mice, rats and rabbits) on islands. One popular strategy, a sex-reversing drive that converts heterozygous females into sterile males, failed to spread and required the ongoing deployment of gene-drive carriers to achieve eradication. Under alternative strategies, multiplexed gRNAs could overcome inherent polymorphic resistance and were required for eradication success even when the probability of NHEJ was low. Strategies causing homozygotic embryonic non-viability or homozygotic female sterility produced high probabilities of eradication and were robust to NHEJ-mediated deletion of the DNA sequence between multiplexed endonuclease recognition sites. The latter two strategies also purged the gene drive when eradication failed, therefore posing lower long-term risk should animals escape beyond target islands. Multiplexing gRNAs will be necessary if this technology is to be useful for insular extirpation attempts; however, precise knowledge of homing rates will be required to design low-risk gene drives with high probabilities of eradication success. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

First, multiple species could share similar ecological roles, thus providing functional redundancy. Second, species may respond differently to environmental change (response diversity). However, ecosystem function would be best protected when functionally redundant species also show response diversity. This linkage has not been studied directly, so we investigated whether native and exotic pollinator species with similar traits (functional redundancy) differed in abundance (response diversity) across an agricultural intensification gradient. Exotic pollinator species contributed most positive responses, which partially stabilized overall abundance of the pollinator community. However, although some functionally redundant species exhibited response diversity, this was not consistent across functional groups and aggregate abundances within each functional group were rarely stabilized. This shows functional redundancy and response diversity do not always operate in concert.

It has a characteristic deep tap root, and forms dense impenetrable thickets along river banks, flood plains, and seasonal water courses. Several studies have quantified the water use by Prosopis, but there is limited information on how this compares with that of co-occurring groundwater dependent indigenous tree species in the arid and semi-arid tropics. Consequently the effects of removing Prosopis on groundwater, where they co-occur with indigenous trees, are not known. This study quantified the incremental water use by Prosopis invasions compared with the indigenous deep rooted Vachellia karroo (V. karroo) trees that normally replace Prosopis once it has been cleared. The study was done in an arid catchment in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Stem sap flow dynamics, groundwater levels, and weather data were collected hourly over 15 months in the invaded catchment. Data collection continued for a further 11 months after Prosopis had been cleared to monitor the recovery of the ecosystem from the invasions. There was no significant difference (P = 0.116) in the sap flux density of the two species although Prosopis had a much thinner sapwood depth than V. karroo due to its ring porous wood anatomy. However, at the stand scale Prosopis transpired more than five times more water (∼544 mm y−1) than V. karroo (∼91 mm y−1) since there were six times more Prosopis than the indigenous species.

Moreover, monitoring also provides context to marine science and over the last century has allowed development of a critical scientific understanding of the marine environment and the impacts that humans are having on it. The seas around the UK are currently monitored by targeted, impact-driven, programmes (e.g., fishery or pollution based monitoring) often using traditional techniques, many of which have not changed significantly since the early 1900s. The advent of a new wave of automated technology, in combination with changing political and economic circumstances, means that there is currently a strong drive to move toward a more refined, efficient, and effective way of monitoring. We describe the policy and scientific rationale for monitoring our seas, alongside a comprehensive description of the types of equipment and methodology currently used and the technologies that are likely to be used in the future. We contextualize the way new technologies and methodologies may impact monitoring and discuss how whole ecosystems models can give an integrated, comprehensive approach to impact assessment.

During early succession, the arrival and establishment of those propagules that can pass the environmental filters operating at a given site should be among the dominant processes leading to an initial increase in species richness. With ongoing succession, environmental filtering should decrease in relative importance compared to competitive interactions, which then should decrease species richness. Thereby, the phylogenetic structure of communities should change from random or clustered patterns during early succession to overdispersion. Disturbance is supposed to act as an additional filter, causing communities to be phylogenetically clustered. By analysing the species richness and phylogenetic structure of secondary succession in two different regions in Germany with three different disturbance levels each, we tested this general model. Although in one of the regions (Gimritz) we found the expected trajectory of species richness, phylogenetic structure did not follow the expected trend from random or clustered towards overdispersed communities. In the other region (Bayreuth), species richness did not follow the expected trajectory and phylogenetic structure remained clustered over the course of succession. A preliminary analysis of autecological characteristics of the species involved (Ellenberg indicator values) nevertheless showed clear contrasting trends. The idiosyncrasies of successional trajectories across sites might be due to the environmental context, the regional species pool as well as the legacy of former land use reflected in the seed bank. © Author(s) 2017..",,"autecology; disturbance; genetic structure; phylogenetics; plant community; propagule; secondary succession; species richness; Bavaria; Bayreuth; Germany",2-s2.0-85027458844

While residents initiate reproductive preparation and breed in the same geographic location, migrant birds simultaneously prepare for breeding and migration far from their breeding grounds. As a result, it is hypothesized that migrant and resident birds use environmental cues differently to prepare to breed and that there is adaptive specialization in mechanisms regulating reproductive preparation. Specifically, residents are expected to rely more on non-photic cues (e.g. food, temperature, social cues) than migrants. We tested this general prediction using a social cue manipulation. First, we compared the effects of subspecies-appropriate recorded male song on reproductive development in migrants and residents on a naturally increasing photoperiod. Second, we tested the sensitivity of migrant-specific life history events (fattening and pre-alternate molt) to song treatment. After 82 days, residents had higher luteinizing hormone and greater ovarian development than migrants, but song treatment had no effect on these metrics in either subspecies. Song advanced pre-alternate molt but had no effect on fattening in migrants. While our study does not support specialization in social cue use in migrants and residents, it is consistent with findings in the literature of specialization in photoperiodic response. It also demonstrates for the first time that social cues can influence molt in a migrant species. Additional findings from a pilot study looking at responses to a live male suggest it is important to test other kinds of social cues. © 2017.

For an environmentally sustainable solution, the seeds collected from wild plants indigenous to this area could be used as biodiesel producers to meet the energy demand. For this, the fatty acid profiles of seed oils from 127 species belonging to 30 plant families, all native of the Mediterranean Basin, were surveyed in a search for fossil-fuel substitutes. The saponification number (SN, mg KOH/g), iodine value (IV, g I2/100 g), cetane number (Ф), higher heating value (δ, MJ/kg), cold filter-plugging point (CFPP, °C), density (ρ, g/cm3), induction period (IP, h) and kinematic viscosity (η, mm2/s) were empirically determined and then used to establish the suitability of the different seed oils for biodiesel production. The aptness to serve as biodiesel was determined by applying the specification for biodiesel standard made by several organizations. In addition to three already well-characterized species, the fatty acid methyl esters from the seeds of Conium maculatum (Ф = 53.7; δ = 40.1), Eryngium maritimum (Ф = 53.2; δ = 40.2), Nigella damascena (Ф = 58.1; δ = 40.1), Portulaca oleracea (Ф = 62.9; δ = 40.5), Prangos uechtritzii (Ф = 52.8; δ = 40.1), and Tribulus terrestris (Ф = 59.4; δ = 40.1), meet the major quality standards set by several organizations, and thus are suitable for biodiesel production. Data from empirical models used for estimating biodiesel properties was compared with experimental data from biodiesel prepared with available seeds, and good correlations between the two methodologies were found. The sowing of selected species in natural habitats, in addition to providing a valuable resource, i.e. biodiesel, both the Mediterranean Basin ecoregions and unproductive agricultural lands could be improved as appropriate habitats for wildlife, and in parallel this action would create employment in rural areas using natural resources. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiesel standard; Cetane number; Clean energy; Fatty acid methyl ester; Renewable fuel","Antiknock rating; Biodiesel; Calorific value; Ecosystems; Energy resources; Esters; Fossil fuels; Fuel oils; Seed; Biodiesel production; Clean energy; Cold filter plugging point; Fatty acid methyl ester; Higher heating value; Renewable fuels; Saponification numbers; Sustainable solution; Fatty acids",2-s2.0-85020020585

We apply numerical bootstrap methods to derive upper bounds on scaling dimensions and operator product expansion coefficients for several low-lying, unprotected operators as a function of the central charge. We interpret our bounds in the context of N=4 super Yang-Mills theories, formulating a series of conjectures regarding the embedding of the conformal manifold- parametrized by the complexified gauge coupling- into the space of scaling dimensions and operator product expansion coefficients.

Contrasting willed attention with instructed attention (where attention is directed by external cues), we observed that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex was allied with the dorsal attention network in instructed attention, but shifted connectivity during willed attention to interact with the cingulo-opercular network, which then mediated communications between the frontoparietal network and the dorsal attention network.

Compared with the cultivar Jinmai47 under WW conditions, SHWs displayed increased plant height (PH), larger flag leaf area (FLA), longer spikes (SL) and more biomass plant−1 (BMPP), but SHWs displayed fewer grains spike−1 (GNPS) and less thousand-grain weight (TGW), resulting in lower grain yield plant−1 (GYPP) and a lower harvest index (HI). The membership function value of drought resistance (MFVD) analysis and drought resistance index (DI) under the two water regimes revealed six SHW lines (SHW1, SHW3, SHW10, SHW16, SHW21 and SHW34) identified with higher drought resistance.

This has allowed, for example, to calibrate models under past climate conditions or to validate projected models calibrated on current species distributions. However, these data also bear certain shortcomings when used in SDMs that may hinder the resulting ecological outcomes and eventually lead to misleading conclusions. Palaeodata may not be equivalent to present data, but instead frequently exhibit limitations and biases regarding species representation, taxonomy and chronological control, and their inclusion in SDMs should be carefully assessed.

Coral-associated bacteria serve a wide variety of functional roles with reference to the coral host, and thus, the composition of the overall microbiome community can strongly influence coral health and survival. Here, we synthesize the findings of recent studies (n = 45) that evaluated the impacts of the top three stressors facing coral reefs (climate change, water pollution and overfishing) on coral microbiome community structure and diversity. Contrary to the species losses that are typical of many ecological communities under stress, here we show that microbial richness tends to be higher rather than lower for stressed corals (i.e., in ∼60% of cases), regardless of the stressor. Microbial responses to stress were taxonomically consistent across stressors, with specific taxa typically increasing in abundance (e.g., Vibrionales, Flavobacteriales, Rhodobacterales, Alteromonadales, Rhizobiales, Rhodospirillales, and Desulfovibrionales) and others declining (e.g., Oceanosprillales). Emerging evidence also suggests that stress may increase the microbial beta diversity amongst coral colonies, potentially reflecting a reduced ability of the coral host to regulate its microbiome. Moving forward, studies will need to discern the implications of stress-induced shifts in microbiome diversity for the coral hosts and may be able to use microbiome community structure to identify resilient corals. The evidence we present here supports the hypothesis that microbial communities play important roles in ecological resilience, and we encourage a focus on the microbial contributions to resilience for future research. © 2017 McDevitt-Irwin, Baum, Garren and Vega Thurber.","Bacteria; Coral; Environmental stress; Global change biology; Global warming; Overfishing; Pollution; Symbiosis",,2-s2.0-85027729227

A fleet of about 73,000 vessels is widespread along the Mediterranean coasts. Artisanal activities are predominant in South Mediterranean and in the eastern basin, while trawling features GSAs in the western basin and the Adriatic Sea. The overall landings of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, after peaking during mid 90s at about one million tons, declined at about 700,000 tons in 2013. However, while landings are declining in EU countries since the 90s, in non-EU countries a decreasing trend was observed only in the last 5–10 years. The current levels of fishing effort determine a general overexploitation status of commercial stocks with more than 90% of the stock assessed out of safe biological limits. Indicators obtained from available ecosystem models were used to assess the sustainability of the fisheries. They included primary production required to sustain fisheries (PPR), mean trophic level of the catch (mTLc), the loss in secondary production index (L index), and the probability of the ecosystem to be sustainably exploited (psust ). In areas exploited more sustainably (e.g., Gulf of Gabes, Eastern Ionian, and Aegean Sea) fishing pressure was characterized by either low number of vessels per unit of shelf area or the large prevalence of artisanal/small scale fisheries. Conversely, GSAs in Western Mediterranean and Adriatic showed very low ecosystem sustainability of fisheries that can be easily related with the high fishing pressure and the large proportion of overfished stocks obtained from single species assessments. We showed that the current knowledge on Mediterranean fisheries and ecosystems describes a worrisome picture where the effect of poorly regulated fisheries, in combination with the ongoing climate forcing and the rapid expansion of non-indigenous species, are rapidly changing the structure and functioning of the ecosystem with unpredictable effects on the goods and services provided. Although this would call for urgent conservation actions, the management system implemented in the region appears too slow and probably inadequate to protect biodiversity and secure fisheries resources for the future generations. © 2017 Colloca, Scarcella and Libralato.","Ecosystem models; Fisheries; Fisheries management; Mediterranean; Overexploitation",,2-s2.0-85027675133

The main goal of this study was to predict in detail how changes in air temperature and precipitation will affect streamflow, the thermal habitat of a cold-water fish (the brown trout, Salmo trutta), and the synergistic relationships among these variables at the rear edge of the natural distribution of brown trout. Thirty-one sites in 14 mountain rivers and streams were studied in central Spain. Models of streamflow were built for several of these sites using M5 model trees, and a non-linear regression method was used to estimate stream temperatures. Nine global climate models simulations for Representative Concentration Pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were downscaled to the local level. Significant reductions in streamflow were predicted to occur in all of the basins (max. -49 %) by the year 2099, and seasonal differences were noted between the basins. The stream temperature models showed relationships between the model parameters, geology and hydrologic responses. Temperature was sensitive to streamflow in one set of streams, and summer reductions in streamflow contributed to additional stream temperature increases (max. 3.6 °C), although the sites that are most dependent on deep aquifers will likely resist warming to a greater degree. The predicted increases in water temperatures were as high as 4.0 °C. Temperature and streamflow changes will cause a shift in the rear edge of the distribution of this species. However, geology will affect the extent of this shift. Approaches like the one used herein have proven to be useful in planning the prevention and mitigation of the negative effects of climate change by differentiating areas based on the risk level and viability of fish populations. © Author(s) 2017.",,"Aquatic ecosystems; Aquifers; Climate models; Ecosystems; Fish; Fisheries; Geology; Hydrogeology; Linear regression; Population distribution; Regression analysis; Rivers; Stream flow; Global climate model; Hydrologic response; Natural distribution; Non-linear regression method; Precipitation patterns; Seasonal differences; Stream temperature models; Stream temperatures; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; edge effect; global climate; hydrological response; mountain region; population distribution; precipitation (climatology); river basin; salmonid; streamflow; water temperature; Spain; Salmo trutta",2-s2.0-85024493655

While the mechanisms underlying the establishment and spread of P. ramorum have been elucidated, this is the first attempt to investigate the environmental factors driving the recovery of bay laurel, the main transmissive host of the pathogen. Based on a large dataset gathered from a citizen science program, an algorithm was designed, tested, and run to detect and geolocate recovered trees. Approximately 32% of infected bay laurels recovered in the time period between 2005 and 2015. Monte Carlo simulations pointed out the robustness of such estimates, and the algorithm achieved an 85% average rate of correct classification. The association between recovery and climatic, topographic, and ecological factors was assessed through a numerical ecology approach mostly based on binary logistic regressions. Significant (p < 0.05) coefficients and the information criteria of the models showed that the probability of bay laurel recovery increases in association with high temperatures and low precipitation levels, mostly in flat areas.

Standardization is a definitive method of providing an end-To-end solution capable of defining, deploying, and managing applications and their components across heterogeneous cloud providers. TOSCA and CAMP, however, perform different functions with regard to cloud applications. TOSCA is focused primarily on topology modeling and orchestration, whereas CAMP is focused on deployment and management of applications. This paper presents a novel solution that not only involves the combination of the emerging standards TOSCA and CAMP, but also introduces extensions to CAMP to allow for multi-cloud application orchestration through the use of declarative policies. Extensions to the CAMP platform are also made, which brings the standards closer together to enable a seamless integration.

The primary axes of change include not only the climate system, but also the spread of invasive species, altered biogeochemical and hydrological cycles, modified disturbance regimes, and land degradation and conversion. These factors are influencing the distribution of species and the structure and function of ecosystems worldwide, interacting with climatic stressors that may preclude the persistence of many current species distributions and communities. Ecological disturbances such as wildfires and insect outbreaks can interact with climate variability to precipitate abrupt change on landscape scales. Such changes may limit the feasibility of historically based ecological restoration in many (although by no means all) instances. An alternative emerging approach is based on reinforcing the ecological processes that comprise resilience: resistance, recovery, and reorganization. While resistance and recovery processes fall within a conventional restoration framework, managing populations and ecosystems for reorganization represents a departure from a reference-based restoration approach. When applied to ecosystem management, resilience-based management supplements traditional ecological restoration where stressors of change make the reestablishment of historical communities difficult or maladaptive. We illustrate these ideas with examples drawn primarily from the interior of western North America.","Disturbance; ecological impacts of climate change; ecological resilience; reference condition; reorganization; resistance; restoration ecology",,2-s2.0-85028434279

Anthropogenic drivers linked to this decline include habitat changes, intensive agriculture, pesticides, invasive alien species, spread of pathogens and climate change. Recently, the rapid global increase in artificial light at night has been proposed to be a new threat to terrestrial ecosystems; the consequences of this increase for ecosystem function are mostly unknown. Here we show that artificial light at night disrupts nocturnal pollination networks and has negative consequences for plant reproductive success. In artificially illuminated plant-pollinator communities, nocturnal visits to plants were reduced by 62% compared to dark areas. Notably, this resulted in an overall 13% reduction in fruit set of a focal plant even though the plant also received numerous visits by diurnal pollinators. Furthermore, by merging diurnal and nocturnal pollination sub-networks, we show that the structure of these combined networks tends to facilitate the spread of the negative consequences of disrupted nocturnal pollination to daytime pollinator communities. Our findings demonstrate that artificial light at night is a threat to pollination and that the negative effects of artificial light at night on nocturnal pollination are predicted to propagate to the diurnal community, thereby aggravating the decline of the diurnal community. We provide perspectives on the functioning of plant-pollinator communities, showing that nocturnal pollinators are not redundant to diurnal communities and increasing our understanding of the human-induced decline in pollinators and their ecosystem service. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Does this sense of interracial competition have an association with the emergence of widespread xenophobic sentiment in the country? Using the 2013 South African Social Attitudes Survey, a nationally representative survey, this paper will investigate determinants of anti-immigrants attitudes. The results show that anti-immigrant sentiment is linked to a sense of interracial competition and alienation. A belief that immigrants were beneficial to society was also strongly (and negatively) correlated with attitudes towards immigrants.

In 2011 a UK charity began to clear brown rats Rattus norvegicus and house mice Mus musculus from the 170 km long, 3,500 km2 island using helicopters to spread bait containing Brodifacoum as the active ingredient. South Georgia's larger glaciers were barriers to rodent movement, resulting in numerous independent sub-island populations. The eradication could therefore be spread over multiple seasons, giving time to evaluate results before recommencing, and also reducing the impact of non-target mortality across the island as a whole. Eradication success was achieved in the 128 km2 Phase 1 trial operation. Work in 2013 (Phase 2) and early 2015 (Phase 3) covered the remaining 940 km2 occupied by rodents. By July 2017, 28 months after baiting was concluded, there was no sign of surviving rodents, other than one apparently newly introduced by ship in October 2014. A survey using detection dogs and passive devices will search the Phase 2 and Phase 3 land for rodents in early 2018. Seven (of 30) species of breeding birds suffered losses from poisoning, but all populations appear to have recovered within 5 years. The endemic South Georgia pipit Anthus antarcticus was the first bird to breed in newly rat-free areas, but there were also signs that cavity-nesting seabirds were exploring scree habitat denied them for generations.

Reading this labour history against the grain, with a greater attentiveness to questions of race and class, helps to make more transparent both the prevalence and structuring force of socialist antisemitism, as well as English and Jewish socialist opposition to it. In particular, the essay suggests that the dominant socialist discourse was intimately bound up with questions of national belonging and this directly contributed to a racialized politics of class that could not imagine migrant Jews as an integral component of the working class. At the same time, such socialist antisemitism was also challenged by a minority current of English Marxists whose conceptions of socialism refused to be limited by the narrow boundaries of the racialized nation-state. And they were joined in this collective action by autonomous Jewish socialist organizations who understood that the liberation of the Jewish worker was indivisible from that of the emancipation of the working class in general. With the help of Eleanor Marx and others, these latter strands entangled socialist politics with questions of combatting antisemitism, and thereby stretched existing conceptions of class to encompass the Jewish worker. © 2017 The Author(s).","Antisemitism; Ben Tillett; Class; Eleanor Marx; England; Jews; Race; Social democratic federation; Socialism; Socialist League",,2-s2.0-85021064563

In recent years, the infrastructural role of floating rice has become a matter of concern for many actors in and around the Chao Phraya delta. This paper examines the particular multispecies relations between water management infrastructure, farmers and rice in the delta. In particular, the paper traces moments of infrastructural inversion that shed light on rice's involutions as part of a multispecies infrastructure. Attention to these involutions, the paper argues, facilitates a reconsideration of infrastructure's relationship with nature. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","floating rice; infrastructural inversion; involution; Multispecies relations; Thailand; water",,2-s2.0-84954541097

This is certainly true with regard to Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis and the early socialist movement of the nineteenth century. However, anti-Jewish propaganda needs to be taken into account in order to understand why the Jewish proletariat joined the socialist ranks at such a late stage, that is, only after the reformist wing split from Domela Nieuwenhuis’s Social Democratic League (SDB) into the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAP) in 1894. Stutje aims to address this lacuna, and demonstrates that Domela Nieuwenhuis had been using antisemitic stereotyping against the parliament-orientated reformists because the latter’s main rival, P. J. Troelstra, was dependent on a modest group of Jewish diamond workers in Amsterdam.

Using the Mediterranean island of Crete, Greece as a case study, we suggest a framework for analyzing spatial data of alien species distributions, based on environmental predictors, aiming to gain an understanding of their spatial patterns and spread. Mediterranean islands are under strong ecological pressure from invading species due to their restricted size and increased human impact. Four hypotheses of invasibility, the ""propagule pressure hypothesis"" (H1), ""biotic resistance hypothesis vs. acceptance hypothesis"" (H2), ""disturbance-mediated hypothesis"" (H3), and ""environmental heterogeneity hypothesis"" (H4) were tested. Using data from alien, native, and endemic vascular plant species, the propagule pressure, biotic resistance vs. acceptance, disturbance-mediated, and environmental heterogeneity hypotheses were tested with Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM) of 39 models. Based on model selection, the optimal model includes the positive covariates of native species richness, the negative covariates of endemic species richness, and land area. Variance partitioning between the four hypotheses indicated that the biotic resistance vs. acceptance hypothesis explained the vast majority of the total variance. These results show that areas of high species richness have greater invasibility and support the acceptance hypothesis and ""rich-get-richer"" distribution of alien species. The negative correlation between alien and endemic species appears to be predominantly driven by altitude, with fewer alien and more endemic species at greater altitudes, and habitat richness. The negative relationship between alien and endemic species richness provides potential for understanding patterns of endemic and alien species on islands, contributing to more effective conservation strategies. © 2017 Bjarnason, Katsanevakis, Galanidis, Vogiatzakis and Moustakas.","Alien species; Biological invasions; Crete; Data mining, statistical interpretation; Endemic species; Island ecosystems; Statistical hypothesis testing",,2-s2.0-85031716107

This enables us to address questions such as: Following the first report of an invading pathogen, what is the likely incidence of disease? If no cases of disease have been found, how certain can we be that the disease was not simply missed by chance?

Shrimp from 34 families were housed individually and feed efficiency and growth traits were recorded during two successive growth periods. The objectives of this study were (1) to estimate the heritability of RFI and related traits, including feed efficiency ratio (FER), average daily gain (ADG) and daily feed intake (DFI), (2) to determine the relationships between RFI and other traits, and (3) to evaluate the variation of these traits across two growth periods. Results: Shrimp displayed large inter-individual variation in RFI, FER, ADG and DFI during each growth period. Heritability estimates of all these traits during both periods reached high values (0.577 ± 0.232 to 0.707 ± 0.252). RFI showed weak and no genetic correlations with ADG during the two growth periods between days 1 to 21 (0.135 ± 0.204) and 22 to 42 (-0.018 ± 0.128), respectively, but high positive genetic correlations with DFI (>0.8). Weak and moderate negative genetic correlations were observed between RFI and FER during the two periods (-0.126 ± 0.208 and -0.387 ± 0.183). As evidenced by the high genetic correlations between the two periods for each trait (>0.6), trait performance of the shrimp tended to be consistent across periods. Conclusions: For the first time, accurate measurement of individual feed efficiency on a large scale was achieved in shrimp. Although the estimated heritability reported here for RFI may be overestimated, it is a heritable trait in L. vannamei that can be improved by genetic improvement. For L. vannamei, the biggest potential advantage in using RFI as a measure of feed efficiency is that it is independent of growth rate, and thus genetic selection on RFI has the potential to improve feed efficiency and reduce feed intake, without compromising growth performance. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"annual variation; breeding population; crustacean; dietary intake; genetic analysis; genetic engineering; growth; growth rate; heritability; Decapoda (Crustacea); Litopenaeus vannamei",2-s2.0-85026821821

Using a 2-patch vector-pathogen population model and seabird ticks as biological examples, we explore how vector colonization rates and the spread of infectious agents may be shaped by life stage-dependent dispersal. We contrast hard (Ixodidae) and soft (Argasidae) tick systems, which differ strongly in blood- feeding traits. Results: We find that vector life history characteristics (i.e. length of blood meal) and demographic constraints (Allee effects) condition the colonization potential of ticks; hard ticks, which take a single, long blood meal per life stage, should have much higher colonization rates than soft ticks, which take repeated short meals. Moreover, this dispersal potential has direct consequences for the spread of vector-borne infectious agents, in particular when transmission is transovarial. Conclusions: These results have clear implications for predicting the dynamics of vector and disease spread in the context of large-scale environmental change. The findings highlight the need to include life-stage dispersal in models that aim to predict species and disease distributions, and provide testable predictions related to the population genetic structure of vectors and pathogens along expansion fronts. © 2017 The Author(s).","Allee effect; Borrelia burgdorferi; Climate change; Ixodes uriae; Lyme disease; Ornithodoros maritimus; Parasite spread; Range expansion; Vertical transmission","adult; Argasidae; Article; environmental change; feeding behavior; female; host parasite interaction; Ixodidae; larval stage; life cycle stage; male; nonhuman; nymph; parasite transmission; parasite vector; population dispersal; population dynamics; population structure; species distribution; species habitat",2-s2.0-85020186501

Each subsystem is examined through hypotheses involving three scenarios of tourism growth that are associated with different residential population expansions. A number of integrative and linked social-ecological effects in our model have been shown to severely shock the natural environment of the Galapagos and saturate the capacity of several socio-economic subsystems. Major concerns of the expanding human dimension in the Galapagos are represented by (1) the growing number of introduced species that threaten the Islands’ unique natural environment, and (2) the rapid saturation of the Galapagos National Park's tourism reception capacity. The model relies upon real data to specify rules, relationships, and rates of exchange that are derived through statistical functions and/or functions specified in theory or practice.

While COPE, especially in the case of Julien Deonna’s and Fabrice Teroni’s ‘attitudinal theory of emotion’ which has some pragmatist affinities, is focused on showing how emotional understanding is central to moral agency, it is my aim in this paper to offer a pragmatist account of emotional understanding as ‘passionate reasoning’ that goes one step further. By highlighting the way in which emotions ought to be interpreted even in the context of scientific or systematic inquiries it makes a case for moralizing science from within, i.e. without submitting it to values that are alien to inquiry.

This need is especially pressing for emerging and potential future invaders that have no invasion history. Such a metric would also ideally apply across diverse taxonomic and trophic groups. We derive a new metric of invader ecological impact that blends: (i) the classic Functional Response (FR; consumer per capita effect) and Numerical Response (NR; consumer population response) approaches to determining consumer impact, that is, the Total Response (TR = FR × NR), with; (ii) the ‘Parker–Lonsdale equation’ for invader impact, where Impact = Range × Abundance × Effect (per capita effect), into; (iii) a new metric, Relative Impact Potential (RIP), where RIP = FR × Abundance. The RIP metric is an invader/native ratio, where values >1 predict that invader ecological impact will occur, and increasing values above 1 indicate increasing impact. In addition, the invader/invader RIP ratio allows comparisons of the ecological impacts of different invaders. Across a diverse range of trophic and taxonomic groups, including predators, herbivores, animals and plants (22 invader/native systems with 47 individual comparisons), high-impact invaders were significantly associated with higher FRs compared to native trophic analogues. However, the RIP metric substantially improves this association, with 100% predictive power of high-impact invaders. Further, RIP scores were significantly and positively correlated with two independent ecological impact scores for invaders, allowing prediction of the degree of impact of invasive alien species with the RIP metric. Finally, invader/invader RIP scores were also successful in identifying and associating with higher impacting invasive alien species. Synthesis and applications. The Relative Impact Potential metric combines the per capita effects of invaders with their abundances, relative to trophically analogous natives, and is successful in predicting the likelihood and degree of ecological impact caused by invasive alien species. As the metric constitutes readily measurable features of individuals, populations and species across abiotic and biotic context-dependencies, even emerging and potential future invasive alien species can be assessed. The Relative Impact Potential metric can be rapidly utilized by scientists and practitioners and could inform policy and management of invasive alien species across diverse taxonomic and trophic groups. © 2016 The Authors.

We performed a spatial mismatch analysis, based on a spatially explicit correlation test, to investigate whether alien plant species hotspots in Germany and Austria correspond to areas of high density of roads and railways. We tested this independently of the effects of dominant environments in each spatial unit, in order to focus just on the correlation between occurrence of alien species and density of linear transportation infrastructures. We found a significant spatial association between alien plant species hotspots distribution and roads and railways density in both countries. As expected, anthropogenic landscapes, such as urban areas, harbored more alien plant species, followed by water bodies. However, our findings suggested that the distribution of neobiota is strongest correlated to road/railways density than to land use composition. This study provides new evidence, from a transnational scale, that alien plants can use roadsides and rail networks as colonization corridors. Furthermore, our approach contributes to the understanding on alien plant species distribution at large spatial scale by the combination with spatial modeling procedures. © 2017 Benedetti, Morelli.

Plant invasions have been predicted to further increase under ongoing global environmental change. Numerous case studies have compared the performance of invasive and native plant species in response to global environmental change components (i.e. changes in mean levels of precipitation, temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration or nitrogen deposition). Individually, these studies usually involve low numbers of species and therefore the results cannot be generalized. Therefore, we performed a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis to assess whether there is a general pattern of differences in invasive and native plant performance under each component of global environmental change. We compiled a database of studies that reported performance measures for 74 invasive alien plant species and 117 native plant species in response to one of the above-mentioned global environmental change components. We found that elevated temperature and CO2 enrichment increased the performance of invasive alien plants more strongly than was the case for native plants. Invasive alien plants tended to also have a slightly stronger positive response to increased N deposition and increased precipitation than native plants, but these differences were not significant (N deposition: P = 0.051; increased precipitation: P = 0.679). Invasive alien plants tended to have a slightly stronger negative response to decreased precipitation than native plants, although this difference was also not significant (P = 0.060). So while drought could potentially reduce plant invasion, increases in the four other components of global environmental change considered, particularly global warming and atmospheric CO2 enrichment, may further increase the spread of invasive plants in the future. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; effect size; global environmental change; meta-analysis; nitrogen deposition; plant invasion; precipitation; temperature","air temperature; atmospheric deposition; biological invasion; carbon dioxide; climate change; global change; introduced species; meta-analysis; native species; nitrogen; plant; precipitation (climatology); size effect; biodiversity; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; introduced species; meta analysis; plant development; temperature; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Introduced Species; Plant Development; Temperature",2-s2.0-85013420716

River systems are especially vulnerable to biological invasions, because waterways can function as invasion corridors. Understanding interactions of invasive and native species and their combined effects on river dynamics is essential for developing cost-effective management strategies. However, numerical models for simulating long-term effects of these processes are lacking. This paper investigates how an invasive alien plant species affects native riparian vegetation and hydro-morphodynamics. A morphodynamic model has been coupled to a dynamic vegetation model that predicts establishment, growth and mortality of riparian trees. We introduced an invasive alien species with life-history traits based on Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica), and investigated effects of low- and high propagule pressure on invasion speed, native vegetation and hydro-morphodynamic processes. Results show that high propagule pressure leads to a decline in native species cover due to competition and the creation of unfavorable native colonization sites. With low propagule pressure the invader facilitates native seedling survival by creating favorable hydro-morphodynamic conditions at colonization sites. With high invader abundance, water levels are raised and sediment transport is reduced during the growing season. In winter, when the above-ground invader biomass is gone, results are reversed and the floodplain is more prone to erosion. Invasion effects thus depend on seasonal above- and below ground dynamic vegetation properties and persistence of the invader, on the characteristics of native species it replaces, and the combined interactions with hydro-morphodynamics. © 2017.

We studied the impact of introduction of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to Medina and Zoñar lakes in SW Spain. Both lakes were protected as Ramsar sites because of their importance for waterbirds, particularly the globally threatened white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala IUCN Endangered) and common pochard (Aythya ferina IUCN Vulnerable). Two carp introduction events in Medina lake, with total eradication of carp in between, provided a unique opportunity to study the impacts of carp on the waterbird community (counted monthly from 2001 to 2013, with up to 69 species) and submerged macrophyte cover (quantified with satellite images). A comparison of waterbird abundance before and after carp eradication in the smaller Zoñar lake supported the results from Medina lake. Carp consistently led to the destruction of macrophyte beds and a radical change in the waterbird community. After controlling for the influence of depth fluctuations, the numbers and species richness of diving ducks were significantly reduced by carp, whilst the opposite effect was observed for piscivores such as herons. Negative impacts on O. leucocephala, A. ferina, red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) and herbivorous coots (Fulica spp.) were particularly pronounced. A significant negative impact of carp was also recorded on greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber), black-necked grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), little grebes (Tachybaptus ruficollis) and gadwall (Anas strepera). In contrast, carp presence had a positive impact on grey herons (Ardea cinerea). The ongoing expansion of alien cyprinids in the Mediterranean region constitutes a major threat for waterbirds and particularly for sedentary, threatened taxa such as the white-headed duck and red-knobbed coot (F. cristata). Of 22 key sites for the isolated Iberian population of white-headed duck identified in a European action plan in 1996, at least 14 have since suffered carp invasions.

Opuntia stricta was widespread and abundant in parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia and present at low densities in Uganda. In Laikipia County, pastoralists identified that O. stricta had been present for more than 10 years, and were of the opinion that it was still spreading and increasing in density.

In many regions of the world, public and domestic gardens contain a huge pool of non-native plants. Climate change may relax constraints on their naturalization and hence facilitate hybridization with related species in the resident flora. Here, we evaluate this possible increase in hybridization risk by predicting changes in the overlap of climatically suitable ranges between a set of garden plants and their congeners in the resident flora. Location: Europe. Methods: From the pool of alien garden plants, we selected those which (1) are not naturalized in Europe, but established outside their native range elsewhere in the world; (2) belong to a genus where interspecific hybridization has been previously reported; and (3) have congeners in the native and naturalized flora of Europe. For the resulting set of 34 alien ornamentals as well as for 173 of their European congeners, we fitted species distribution models and projected suitable ranges under the current climate and three future climate scenarios. Changes in range overlap between garden plants and congeners were then assessed by means of the true skill statistic. Results: Projections suggest that under a warming climate, suitable ranges of garden plants will increase, on average, while those of their congeners will remain constant or shrink, at least under the more severe climate scenarios. The mean overlap in ranges among congeners of the two groups will decrease. Variation among genera is pronounced; however, and for some congeners, range overlap is predicted to increase significantly. Main conclusions: Averaged across all modelled species, our results do not indicate that hybrids between potential future invaders and resident species will emerge more frequently in Europe when climate warms. These average trends do not preclude, however, that hybridization risk may considerably increase in particular genera. © 2017 The Authors.

Yet, despite their ecological importance, studies addressing the relevance of carrion originated from invasive alien species (IAS) in the interface between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are uncommon, especially those assessing belowground effects. In this study, we carried out a manipulative experiment to assess the impact of massive mortalities of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774) as a carrion subsidy evaluating possible effects on the terrestrial soil chemistry and the structure of a microbial (bacteria and fungi) community.

We also determined neonate larval preference of the specialist herbivore, Pareuchaetes pseudoinsulata Rego Barros (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) (a biological control agent) for shaded versus full-sun leaves. The study further evaluated the performance of the moth on C. odorata leaves obtained from both shaded and full-sun habitats. Leaves of C. odorata plants growing in the shaded habitat had higher water and nitrogen contents compared with full-sun leaves. Plants growing in shade had longer leaves but full-sun plants were taller and had greater aboveground biomass compared with shaded plants. Although neonate larvae of P. pseudoinsulata preferred to feed on full-sun foliage, development was faster when reared on shaded foliage. However, survival, pupal mass, growth rate, and Maw’s host suitability index of the moth did not significantly differ between full-sun and shaded foliage. Our inability to demonstrate significant differences in key insect performance metrics in P. pseudoinsulata between shaded and full-sun foliage, despite neonate larval preference for one of the foliage types, suggests that neither of the foliage types can be considered a superior host, and reiterate the fact that relationships between host plant quality (modulated by light intensity) and phytophagous insect performance are not simple. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Habitat condition; Herbivore performance; Herbivore preference; Invasive alien plant; Leaf characteristics; Pareuchaetes pseudoinsulata","flowering; foliage; herbivore; introduced species; invasive species; larva; leaf; Asteraceae; Chromolaena odorata; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera",2-s2.0-85013777312

A genetic study using different sequences (primarily COI, but also 16S, 28S, cytb and nuclear histone 3a) showed that only M. neglecta was present despite some morphological mismatches. A morphological description of the species according to the new data is presented, together with a revised table of variability of the key numeric characters.

Monodominant sites were also present. Its occurrence is 100% in recent surveys. Such a sharp increase seems to be due to a lack of detritophages in the bay; this is supported by the fact that M. neglecta has not formed its specific assemblage. The community structure, if M. neglecta is excluded, is equal to that before the invasion. In the Sea of Azov itself, M. neglecta is not as abundant, but occurs up to the Strait of Kertch and at some sites in the Black Sea.

We addressed this by analysing relationships between global trade networks and plant pest invasion. Location: Forty-eight countries in Europe and the Mediterranean. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Four hundred and twenty-two non-native plant pests (173 invertebrates, 166 pathogens, 83 plants). Methods: Ten types of connectivity index were developed, representing potential roles of trade networks, air transport links, geographical proximity, climatic similarity and source country wealth in facilitating invasion. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) identified the connectivity index that best explained both historical and recent invasion. Then, more complex GLMMs were developed including connectivity through trade networks for multiple commodities relevant for pests (live plants, forest products, fruit and vegetables and seeds) and species’ transport associations with those commodities. Results: Total import volumes, species’ global prevalence and connectivity measures based on air transport, geographical distance or climate did not explain invasion as well as connectivity through global trade networks. Invasion was strongly promoted by agricultural imports from countries in which the focal species was present and that were climatically similar to the importing country. However, live plant imports from nearby countries provided a better explanation of the most recent invasions. Connectivity through multiple trade networks predicted invasion better than total agricultural trade, and there was support for our hypothesis that species known to be transported with a particular network had greater sensitivity to its connectivity. Main conclusions: Our findings show that patterns of invasion are governed to a large extent by global trade networks connecting source areas for non-native species and the dispersal of those species through multiple trade networks. This enhances potential for developing a predictive framework to improve risk assessment, biosecurity and surveillance for invasions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate matching; crop pests; dispersal; introduction; invasive alien species; pest outbreaks; plant disease; plant health; transport","Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85021237535

Faced with the difficult task of identifying those species with the greatest need for management action, ecologists have turned to using predictive suites of ecological and life-history traits to provide reasonable estimates of fish invasion and extinction risk. Whether traits associated with invasiveness are the inverse of those associated with imperillment, known as the ‘two-sides-of-the-same-coin’ hypothesis, remains unclear. A global trait analysis (including maximum total body size, longevity, size at maturation, age at maturation, fecundity and egg size) for 6293 freshwater fishes was conducted to examine the trait correlates of species proneness to invasion or extinction. A meta-analytical procedure was deployed using univariate and multivariate trait analyses that accounted for the effects of shared phylogeny. Mean trait differences (measured as Hedges' d effect size) were found between invasive and threatened species when compared with native species, thus supporting the two-sides-of-the-same-coin hypothesis for freshwater fish. Invasive species were characterized by larger body size, greater longevity, delayed maturation and higher fecundity than threatened species. Furthermore, invasive species were found to display greater trait variability compared with threatened species, suggesting that different traits may be selected at different stages of the invasion process (from pathway entrainment to establishment) whereas more specific trait combinations may predispose species to higher extinction risk. The present study demonstrated a strong trait basis to global-scale invasion risk and extinction vulnerability for freshwater fishes. Given that both time and resources are too limited for detailed species-by-species assessments, the results suggest that trait correlates provide a reasonable estimate of invasion and extinction risk that can inform more targeted and proactive conservation strategies.

However, most examples of top-down effects of invasive predators in terrestrial systems stem from islands or similar low-diversity ecosystems. Snakes are an emerging guild of damaging invasive predators, but demonstration of ecosystem-level impacts of invasive snakes are limited to the single case of the brown treesnake on Guam. Invasive Burmese pythons are firmly established in southern Florida and have been linked to severe (80–100%) declines of several previously common mammal species (e.g. raccoons, opossums and rabbits). Specifically, spatiotemporal patterns of mammal declines in the Everglades mirror the spread of pythons and experimental reintroductions of rabbits to areas where they had been extirpated failed due to high (77% of mortalities) rates of predation by pythons. I evaluated the potential indirect effects of pythons on the nesting success of oviparous species by monitoring artificial turtle nests (N = 183) at 13 sites across the expanding range of the python population. I documented few mammals and low rates of nest predation (average score = 1·5 on a 1–5 scale) in the southern Everglades where pythons have been established the longest, intermediate (average score = 2·3) rates of nest predation at recently invaded sites, and very high (average score = 4·6) rates of nest predation at sites with few or no pythons. These findings represent the first documentation of potential indirect effects of pythons on non-prey species, and suggest that loss or decline of mammals is resulting in trophic cascades that threaten the Everglades ecosystem. Synthesis and applications. My results suggest that an introduction of non-native apex predators can result in trophic cascades that alter even complex, continental ecosystems. The Burmese python invasion of South Florida shows remarkable parallels with the catastrophic case of the brown treesnake in Guam, but in some ways is even more worrisome. Documentation of both strong direct impacts on prey and potential indirect effects on Everglades’ ecosystems within 15 years after being recognized as established emphasizes the need to integrate python management into restoration of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem. More broadly, non-native snakes warrant significant attention for their potential to become damaging invasive species. © 2017 The Author.

Agrilus planipennis (EAB) is a wood-boring beetle native to East Asia. Having caused massive damages on ash species in North America in the last decades, it was first recorded in Europe in 2003 in Russia (Moscow). All ash (Fraxinus) species native to Europe and North America are known to be susceptible to EAB attacks, which cause high tree mortality even among formerly healthy trees. Recorded expansion rates are between 2.5 and 80 km/year in North America and between 13 and 41 km/year in European Russia. Given current expansion rates, EAB is expected to reach Central Europe within 15–20 years. A combination of mechanical, biological and chemical control and phytosanitary measures may reduce its impact, which nevertheless most likely will be substantial. There is an urgent need to identify native enemies in Europe, to test suitable biocontrol agents and to develop early detection and management measures. Although it is obvious that EAB will become a major pest in Europe, early and dedicated response will likely be able to reduce the level of ash mortality, and thus improve the opportunity for long-term survival of ash as an important component in European forests. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","alien species; biology; ecology; Emerald ash borer; Fraxinus; impact; management","beetle; biocontrol agent; biological control; biological invasion; biological method; chemical control; deciduous forest; ecology; introduced species; mechanical control; mortality; natural enemy; new species; pest control; pest damage; pest species; Europe; Far East; North America; Agrilus; Agrilus planipennis; Coleoptera; Fraxinus",2-s2.0-84999673345

A comprehensive assessment of empirical and theoretical evidence identified how each of these processes is likely to be shaped by climate change for alien plants, animals and pathogens in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments of Great Britain. The strongest contemporary evidence for the potential role of climate change in the establishment of new alien species is for terrestrial arthropods, as a result of their ectothermic physiology, often high dispersal rate and their strong association with trade as well as commensal relationships with human environments. By contrast, there is little empirical support for higher temperatures increasing the rate of alien plant establishment due to the stronger effects of residence time and propagule pressure. The magnitude of any direct climate effect on the number of new alien species will be small relative to human-assisted introductions driven by socioeconomic factors. Casual alien species (sleepers) whose population persistence is limited by climate are expected to exhibit greater rates of establishment under climate change assuming that propagule pressure remains at least at current levels. Surveillance and management targeting sleeper pests and diseases may be the most cost-effective option to reduce future impacts under climate change. Most established alien species will increase their distribution range in Great Britain over the next century. However, such range increases are very likely be the result of natural expansion of populations that have yet to reach equilibrium with their environment, rather than a direct consequence of climate change. To assess the potential realised range of alien species will require a spatially explicit approach that not only integrates bioclimatic suitability and population-level demographic rates but also simulation of landscape-level processes (e.g. dispersal, land-use change, host/habitat distribution, non-climatic edaphic constraints). In terms of invasive alien species that have known economic or biodiversity impacts, the taxa that are likely to be the most responsive are plant pathogens and insect pests of agricultural crops. However, the extent to which climate adaptation strategies lead to new crops, altered rotations, and different farming practices (e.g. irrigation, fertilization) will all shape the potential agricultural impacts of alien species. The greatest uncertainty in the effects of climate change on biological invasions exists with identifying the future character of new species introductions and predicting ecosystem impacts. Two complementary strategies may work under these conditions of high uncertainty: (i) prioritise ecosystems in terms of their perceived vulnerability to climate change and prevent ingress or expansion of alien species therein that may exacerbate problems; (ii) target those ecosystem already threatened by alien species and implement management to prevent the situation deteriorating under climate change. © 2016 Cambridge Philosophical Society","biosecurity; exotic; globalisation; non-native; pathways; species distribution models; weed",,2-s2.0-84971577970

The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate three factors shaping abundance of the alien shrub species Cornus alternifolia: abundance of another alien (invasive) shrub species (Prunus serotina), type of tree stand (coniferous vs. broadleaved) and distance to propagule sources and (2) to assess the potential dispersal distance of the species studied. Densities of both species were assessed within 194 experimental plots (located in experimental plantations of trees) in Rogów Arboretum (Central Poland). P. serotina occurred on 79 and C. alternifolia on 33 of the 194 plots. The furthest distance of C. alternifolia from the propagule source was 338 m. C. alternifolia reached higher densities in coniferous than broadleaved tree stands. Density of C. alternifolia depended on tree stand type and distance from the propagule source, but did not depend on density of P. serotina. Density of C. alternifolia decreased with increasing distance from the propagule source; however, this relationship was modified by the type of tree stand: densities were lower in broadleaved than in coniferous stands. The presence of the invasive species seems to neither facilitate nor limit the dispersal distance of C. alternifolia, as these two species differ in shade tolerance. The study also provided the first information about C. alternifolia potential invasiveness, because earlier this species was noticed only as casually escaping from cultivation in Slovakia. © 2017, The Author(s).","Cornus alternifolia; Dispersal distance; Prunus serotina; Secondary invasion; Shade tolerance; Spread","coexistence; cultivation; deciduous tree; dispersal; ecological approach; introduced species; invasibility; invasive species; propagule; shade tolerance; shrub; Poland [Central Europe]; Slovakia; Cornus alternifolia; Prunus serotina",2-s2.0-85020062390

This study discusses the application of ichnology – the study of organism-substrate interactions – to the search for present and past life beyond Earth. Three main questions are addressed: (1) Why to look for biogenic structures (i.e. traces and ichnofabrics) beyond Earth? (2) What biogenic structures to expect on other planets, moons and asteroids? (3) How to study extraterrestrial biogenic structures? Review of terrestrial evidence highlights a set of properties that make traces and ichnofabrics important for the search of potential extraterrestrial life: trace fossils preserve the activity of soft-bodied organisms; biogenic structures are resilient to processes that obliterate other biosignatures (i.e. mechanical and chemical degradation, diagenesis, tectonism and metamorphism); traces are very visible biosignatures; traces indicate environment and behaviour; traces can be universal biosignatures, i.e., biosignatures ideally suited for detecting any type of life. A model of organism-substrate interactions beyond Earth is here proposed. Expected extraterrestrial traces are those that manifest behaviours that allow to maintain homeostasis: excavations, meandering traces and biodeposition structures. Most of the existing rovers and orbiters provide basic instruments for searching these traces. It is here suggested that the search for extraterrestrial biogenic structures by rovers would also benefit from artificial adjustable lighting, GPR, LiDAR, and drilling equipment with optical televiewer. In this study, open-access databases of rover and orbiter imagery have been searched for traces and ichnofabrics, but no unquestionable evidence of biogenic structures beyond Earth has been found besides those produced by humans. This sounds along the lines of the famous Fermi Paradox: if the universe is teeming with aliens, where are their traces? Results of this search show that habitable environments are not the only place to look for biogenic structures; non-habitable environments such as moons without atmosphere can favour the preservation of shallow-tier traces. The better preservation potential of traces compared to other biosignatures greatly widens the issue of planetary protection, including the interaction between astronauts or vehicles and the substrate may produce disturbances. Although this study highlights a new direction of study with the tools and concepts of ichnology, dialogue between the astrobiological and ichnological communities is needed to use its full potential and possibly answer one of the major questions of science: Does life exist beyond Earth? © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Astrobiology; Geology; Ichnology","biogenic structure; biology; database; ichnofabric; ichnology; imagery; substrate; trace fossil; Emmelichthyidae",2-s2.0-85029800342

In the present work, direct repetitive sequences of Arabidopsis telomere were used to study telomere-mediated truncation of chromosomes in Brassica napus. Transgenes containing alien Arabidopsis telomere were successfully obtained, and Southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results show that the transgenes resulted in successful chromosomal truncation in B. napus. In addition, truncated chromosomes were inherited at rates lower than that predicted by Mendelian rules. To determine the potential manipulations and applications of the engineered chromosomes, such as the stacking of multiple transgenes and the Cre/lox and FRT/FLP recombination systems, both amenable to genetic manipulations through site-specific recombination in somatic cells, were tested for their ability to undergo recombination in B. napus.

This study aims to demonstrate and explain conflicting genetic signals in a widespread invasive Ponto-Caspian mysid Paramysis lacustris using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers. Native Black Sea populations of P. lacustris are divided into three distinct phylogeographic groups: Danube–Dniester region, coastal Danube lakes, and Dnieper River delta. In the 1950s–1970s the species has been extensively used for relatively well documented transplantations in Eastern Europe. However, the populations in the newly established distribution area do not match any of the known native groups, and their genetic signal does not correspond with the recorded transplantation history. Using Bayesian Approximate Computation we explore alternative scenarios that could explain the unexpected mitochondrial and nuclear signals in the introduced populations. We suggest that reservoir construction and break-up of natural dispersal barriers on the River Dnieper have brought about a novel stock, probably admixed from a previously isolated and unknown “relict” population in the middle Dnieper and the genetically distinct Dnieper delta lineage. Through further intentional transfers this new P. lacustris lineage is now widely present in Eastern Europe and is likely to have new gene and trait combinations. The conflicting mitochondrial-nuclear signal in non-native populations also highlights the importance of using multiple genetic markers when tracing invasion sources and pathways. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Approximate Bayesian Computation; Genetic admixture; Intentional transplantations; Invasive species; mtDNA introgression; Ponto-Caspian phylogeography","Bayesian analysis; colonization; crustacean; dispersal; gene flow; genetic marker; introduced species; introgression; invasive species; mitochondrial DNA; native species; phylogeography; Black Sea; Dnieper River; Eastern Europe; Crustacea; Mysida; Paramysis lacustris",2-s2.0-85019552230

Life—the physical and biological basis of existence—is, in itself, bereft of culture and devoid of form. Through culture, however, the energies life harbors can become manifest. “We speak of culture,” Simmel writes, “whenever life produces certain forms in which it expresses and realizes itself; works of art, religions, sciences, technologies, laws, and innumerable others.” Life, in this way, produces something related to yet different from itself: “Life as such is formless, yet incessantly generates forms for itself.” Though form proceeds from life, conflict between them is unavoidable. Form struggles to liberate itself from the “pulse of life,” while life attempts to draw form back into its own “immediacy,” in a gambit to reduce culture's achievements to “direct manifestations of life.” The unprecedented character of modern culture, Simmel maintained, lies in the fact that life's forces were henceforth targeting the very “principle of form.” In the latest and most radical round of this conflict, life's cultural partisans assert that they no longer need the opaque and alien resources of form to express life's energies; form can be jettisoned, mediation dispensed with, and life can exist and relish its powers in their most unalloyed purity.

The number of species declined by 46–52% in the areas massively invaded by H. suaveolens. The richness, diversity, dominance and evenness of species were severely reduced in the invaded areas compared to uninvaded areas. The reasons for this strong impact may be attributed to the vigorous growth of the weed in the invaded areas. Invaded areas were characterized by high cover of the exotic species. Several economically important species like Justicia adhatoda, Anisomeles indica, Carissa carandas, Dioscorea deltoidea, Murraya koenigii and Paspalidium flavidum were conspicuously absent in the invaded areas, though present in the uninvaded areas. Absence of these species in the areas invaded by H. suaveolens may pose socio-economic problems for the local people. Further, alterations were also noticed in the pH, conductivity, organic carbon and organic matter of the soil of invaded areas. Based on these observations, it was concluded that invasion of H. suaveolens has a marked influence on the vegetation of periurban ecosystems, and causes depletion of several economically important species.

The ideal cellular labeling method is capable of realizing label-free, in situ, real-time, and long-term nucleus labeling in live cells, which can fully obtain the nucleus-relative information and effectively alleviate negative effects of alien probes on cellular metabolism. However, current established fluorescent probes-based strategies (e.g., fluorescent proteins-, organic dyes-, fluorescent organic/inorganic nanoparticles-based imaging techniques) are unable to simultaneously realize label-free, in situ, long-term, and real-time nucleus labeling, resulting in inevitable difficulties in fully visualizing nuclear structure and function in live cells. To this end, we present a type of bioinspired fluorescent probes, which are highly efficacious for in situ and label-free tracking of nucleus in long-term and real-time manners. Typically, the bioinspired polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles, served as fluorescent probes, can be readily synthesized in situ within live cell nucleus without any further modifications under physiological conditions (37 °C, pH ∼7.4). Compared with other conventional nuclear dyes (e.g., propidium iodide (PI), Hoechst), superior spectroscopic properties (e.g., quantum yield of ∼35.8% and high photostability) and low cytotoxicity of PDA-based probes enable long-term (e.g., 3 h) fluorescence tracking of nucleus. We also demonstrate the generality of this type of bioinspired fluorescent probes in different cell lines and complex biological samples. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Cell culture; Cells; Cytology; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Imaging techniques; Nanoparticles; Probes; Synthesis (chemical); Cellular metabolism; Fluorescence labeling; Fluorescent imaging; Fluorescent protein; Low cytotoxicities; Physiological condition; Relative information; Spectroscopic property; Fluorescence",2-s2.0-85026660317

We characterized the cold tolerance of the walnut twig beetle, Pityophthorus juglandis Blackman, a domestic alien invasive bark beetle that vectors a phytopathogenic fungus. The beetle and fungus cause thousand cankers disease in species of Juglans and Pterocarya. The disease is spreading in the United States of America (USA) and Italy. Contact thermocouple thermometry was used to measure the supercooling points of adults and larvae and lower lethal temperatures of adults from a population from northern California. Supercooling points ranged from -12.2 °C to-25.0 °C for adults and -13.6 °C to-23.5 °C for larvae; lower lethal temperatures of adults ranged from -14 °C to-23 °C. We found seasonal changes in adult supercooling points in fall, winter, and spring. The supercooling point for males was 0.5 °C colder than for females over all months and 1 °C colder in the winter than in other seasons. The cold-tolerance strategy shifted in P. juglandis adults from freeze intolerance (December 2013 and January 2014) to partial freeze tolerance (February 2014). An intermediate level of cold tolerance with a plastic response to cold partially explains survival of P. juglandis outside of its native range in the southwestern USA. In addition, we characterized the relationship between minimum air temperatures and minimum phloem temperatures in two Juglans spp. in northern California and Colorado and characterized portions of the native geographic range of eastern black walnut, J. nigra L., that may be too cold currently for this insect to persist. © The Authors 2017.

These evolutionary advantages may allow the invader to establish and persist when rare within a community and lead to its monodominance through positive frequency dependence, i.e. increasing per capita population growth rate with increasing frequency of conspecifics. However, this advantage could degrade through time due to evolutionary and ecological changes in the invasive and native plant and microbial communities. We investigated survival rates and individual biomass as proxies for per capita population growth rates for the invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum, across a gradient of conspecific frequencies (10–100% relative cover of M. vimineum) within 12 sites that varied in time since invasion. We expected M. vimineum frequency dependence to become more negative and its proxies for population growth at low conspecific frequency to decline across invasion history. We also explored the belowground fungal community associated with M. vimineum, since we hypothesized that changes in M. vimineum population dynamics may result from shifting microbial interactions over time. Microstegium vimineum frequency dependence changed from negative to neutral across invasion history and the shift was driven by a decline in survival at low frequency. Changes in M. vimineum root fungal community were associated with time since invasion. Our results do not support a shift in frequency dependence from positive to negative across invasion history. However, our results suggest M. vimineum populations may be less prone to persist at older invaded sites and thus more vulnerable to management intervention. © 2017 Cunard, Lankau.

For the first time in southern Europe, land snail communities are analysed in four urban habitats along a geographical gradient of three cities, using quantitative methods and assessing the relative roles of local environmental conditions (“distance from sea”, “distance from city centre”, “vegetation cover”) and spatial effects by principal coordinate analysis of neighbour matrices, redundancy analysis and variation partitioning. A total of 53 species was recorded, a richness similar to that of natural areas. At habitat level, species richness did not show a clear increasing trend from more to less urbanized habitats, but rather a homogeneous pattern. At city level, study areas hosted rather heterogeneous species assemblages and biotic homogenization did not seem to have any impact; indeed, only three species could be considered alien. Variation partitioning showed that land snail communities were mostly structured by environmental factors, even when spatial structures independent of measured environmental variables were included: “vegetation cover” and “distance from city centre” were the environmental variables that explained most of the variation in species composition. The lack of strong spatial structure also unexpectedly suggested that transport by humans aids dispersal of organisms with low mobility, which are usually limited by spatial constraints in natural environments. These results provide ecological and conservation implications for other invertebrate groups, suggesting to set priorities in management strategies that include habitat conservation at local scale. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Environment; Spatial filters; Terrestrial invertebrates; Urban biodiversity; Variation partitioning",,2-s2.0-85009238235

Here, we tested whether mycorrhizal responsiveness varies by plant invasive status while controlling for phylogenetic relatedness among plants with two large grassland datasets. Mycorrhizal responsiveness was measured for 68 taxa from the Northern Plains, and data for 95 taxa from the Central Plains were included. Nineteen percent of taxa from the Northern Plains had greater total biomass with mycorrhizas while 61% of taxa from the Central Plains responded positively. For the Northern Plains taxa, measurable effects often depended on the response variable (i.e., total biomass, shoot biomass, and root mass ratio) suggesting varied resource allocation strategies when roots are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In both datasets, invasive status was nonrandomly distributed on the phylogeny. Invasive taxa were mainly from two clades, that is, Poaceae and Asteraceae families. In contrast, mycorrhizal responsiveness was randomly distributed over the phylogeny for taxa from the Northern Plains, but nonrandomly distributed for taxa from the Central Plains. After controlling for phylogenetic similarity, we found no evidence that invasive taxa responded differently to mycorrhizas than other taxa. Although it is possible that mycorrhizal responsiveness contributes to invasiveness in particular species, we find no evidence that invasiveness in general is associated with the degree of mycorrhizal responsiveness. However, mycorrhizal responsiveness among species grown under common conditions was highly variable, and more work is needed to determine the causes of this variation. © 2017 The Authors.

The location of this study on a global scale is in Middle Eastern Countries. We compared the mechanistic model CLIMEX (CL) with the correlative models MaxEnt (MX), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Random Forests (RF) to project current and future distributions of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.). The Global Climate Model (GCM), the CSIRO-Mk3.0 (CS) using the A2 emissions scenario, was selected for making projections. Both indigenous and alien distribution data of the species were utilized in the modeling process. The common areas predicted by MX, BRT, RF, and CL from the CS GCM were extracted and compared to ascertain projection uncertainty levels of each individual technique. The common areas identified by all four modeling techniques were used to produce a map indicating suitable and unsuitable areas for date palm cultivation for Middle Eastern countries, for the present and the year 2100. The four different modeling approaches predict fairly different distributions. Projections from CL were more conservative than from MX. The BRT and RF were the most conservative methods in terms of projections for the current time. The combination of the final CL and MX projections for the present and 2100 provide higher certainty concerning those areas that will become highly suitable for future date palm cultivation. According to the four models, cold, hot, and wet stress, with differences on a regional basis, appears to be the major restrictions on future date palm distribution. The results demonstrate variances in the projections, resulting from different techniques. The assessment and interpretation of model projections requires reservations, especially in correlative models such as MX, BRT, and RF. Intersections between different techniques may decrease uncertainty in future distribution projections. However, readers should not miss the fact that the uncertainties are mostly because the future GHG emission scenarios are unknowable with sufficient precision.

Constitutional doctrines and democratic theories suggest contrasting responses: an insular one excludes both non-citizen immigrants and citizen-emigrants; a deterritorialised one includes all citizens wherever they reside; a postnational one includes all residents and only these. This article argues that none of these predicted responses represents the dominant pattern of democratic adaptation, which is instead a level-specific expansion of the national franchise to include non-resident citizens and of the local franchise to include non-citizen residents. This is demonstrated by analysing an original dataset on voting rights in 31 European and 22 American countries, and outlining a level-sensitive normative theory of citizenship that provides support for this pattern as well as a critical benchmark for current franchise policies. The findings can be summarised in two inductive generalisations: (1) Voting rights today no longer depend on residence at the national level and on citizenship of the respective state at the local level; (2) Voting rights do, however, generally depend on citizenship of the respective state at the national level and on residence at the local level. In the article, these are called the patterns of franchise ‘expansion’ and ‘containment’. The former supports the idea of widespread level-specific expansion of the franchise and refutes the insular view of the demos. The latter signals corresponding level-specific restrictions, which defeats over-generalised versions of deterritorialised or postnational conceptions of the demos. In order to test how robust this finding is, cases are analysed where the dominant patterns of expansion have been resisted and where unexpected expansion has occurred. With regard to the former, the article identifies constitutional and political obstacles to voting rights expansion in particular countries. With regard to the latter, the article shows that even where national voting rights have been extended to non-citizen residents, containment remains strong through indirect links to citizenship. © 2016 European Consortium for Political Research","emigrants; Europe: Latin America; immigrants; voting rights",,2-s2.0-84995446647

However, industrial production in regions where the insect is not native, like northwestern Europe, could lead to permanent establishment, which might entail environmental risks. In temperate climates, establishment depends on the insect's ability to overwinter. This study assessed the insect's cold hardiness by determining the supercooling point (SCP) and lower lethal time at 5 °C (LTime10,50,90) for different life stages. As diet or acclimation can influence cold hardiness, prepupae reared on different substrates and acclimated prepupae were tested in separate experiments. The SCP ranged from-7.3 °C for late-instar larvae to-13.7 °C for pupae. Prepupae reared on a highly nutritional substrate had a lower SCP compared with a control diet composed of chicken feed (-14.1 °C vs.-12.4 °C, respectively), whereas the SCP was unaffected by acclimation. Based on the LTime, prepupae and pupae were the most cold hardy life stages. Acclimated prepupae were most cold tolerant, with a LTime50 of 23 d. Based on an empirical relationship between LTime50 and field survival of various arthropods, it was predicted that H. illucens would survive about 47 d in the field during northwestern European winters. The results from this laboratory study suggest that H. illucens is rather unlikely to overwinter in northwestern Europe. However, caution is warranted given that diet and acclimation can influence the insect's cold hardiness and in the field the insect may survive in a diapausing state or in protected hibernacula. © 2017 The Authors.","black soldier fly; cold tolerance; environmental risk assessment; exotic species; Hermetia illucens","acclimatization; animal; cold; diet; Diptera; growth, development and aging; larva; physiology; pupa; Acclimatization; Animals; Cold Temperature; Diet; Diptera; Larva; Pupa",2-s2.0-85026910522

Taking into account the current effects of climate change and the exponential increase in visitors during the past 50 years, this ecosystem is very vulnerable to the arrival of non-native species. Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, is an area of high human impact due to the scientific and logistical activities that occur there making the area particularly interesting for the arrival of non-native species. In this study, we determine the spectrum of seeds arriving to the peninsula and being deposited in the topsoil. Soil samples were collected and analysed in order to identify and quantify plant material. The results indicate that there is a direct relationship between the sites where seeds were found and areas with higher levels of human activity on the peninsula. Eight species were identified, with the most common being Hypochaeris radicata and Senecio jacobaea. Seed quantification indicated that areas of high human activity are most vulnerable to the invasion and establishment of non-native species.

Yet, phenology effects on invasion success have generally been neglected. Here we study whether a phenological mismatch limits the non-native range of a globally successful invader, the Ring-necked parakeet, in Europe. Given the latitudes at which parakeets have established across Europe, they breed earlier than expected based on breeding dates from the native Asian range. Moreover, comparing the breeding dates of European populations to those of parakeets in the native Asian range, to five native breeding bird species in Europe and to the start of the growing season of four native European trees shows that the discrepancy between expected and actual breeding phenology is greater in northern Europe. In northern European populations, this temporal mismatch appears to have negative effects on hatching success, and on population growth rates in years that are colder than average in the first six months. Phenological mismatch also can explain why parakeets from African populations (that are more likely to breed in autumn) have been poor invaders compared to parakeets from Asia. These lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the reproductive phenology of the Ring-necked parakeet can be a limiting factor for establishment and range expansion in colder climates. Our results provide growing support for the hypothesis that the match between climate seasonality and timing of reproduction (or other important life cycle events) can affect the establishment success, invasive potential and distribution range of introduced non-native species, beyond the mere effect of climate similarity. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation; Climate; Invasive species; Parrots; Pet trade; Phenology; Urban environment","adaptation; biological invasion; bird; breeding population; climate effect; growing season; introduced species; life cycle; native species; phenology; population growth; reproductive biology; reproductive success; seasonality; urban ecosystem; Asia; Europe; Aves; Psittacidae; Psittacula krameri",2-s2.0-85017657896

We studied the influence of fire on invasion responses (assessing ‘serotiny’ and ‘time’ as key factors to determine invasion) based on a review of case studies performed in natural habitats of the SH. Our work showed that burned environments have no lag time with respect to invasion and are more susceptible to serotinous pine invasion than are unburned environments. Also, serotinous pines reached extremely high densities in burned habitats, exceeding records for the same species in unburned habitats, as well as for non-serotinous pines in any habitat condition. Therefore, burned environments are impacted by conifer invasion earlier and more intensively than unburned ones. Overall, our work indicates that fire is a leading driver of invasion, but only for serotinous pines. This highlights the importance of considering life history traits of introduced species to determine the probability and extent of invasion in relation to disturbance. We discuss the implications of introducing serotinous species in regions of the SH where serotiny is absent from native flora. Lastly, we provide suggestions for prioritizing management and further study. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Disturbance; Pinus spp; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Serotiny; Time lag; Tree invasion","biological invasion; coniferous tree; environmental disturbance; fire; life history trait; literature review; serotiny; Southern Hemisphere; timescale; Coniferophyta; Pseudotsuga menziesii",2-s2.0-85017436206

Within this examination, I contend that migration by African Caribbeans is a form of resistance to the ongoing evisceration of their life chances and choices as a result of colonization. The movement of African Caribbean people is tied to a legacy of centuries of resistance to European exploitation, extortion, and extraction of resources enacted through regimes of slavery, colonization, and globalization. This article briefly explores the history of social work values in what is now known as Canada, as it relates to understanding how social work is positioned in relation to African Caribbean migration to Canada through a decolonizing lens and draws on recent findings from research with African Caribbean participants in the city of Toronto, Ontario, to critically deconstruct the concept of a better life. This deconstruction is necessary to supporting decolonizing understandings of the contemporary social conditions endured by African Caribbean peoples in Canada and to transforming relations between social work and African Caribbean peoples. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","African Caribbean; colonization; migration; social work history; social work practice","African Caribbean; evisceration; extraction; human; Ontario; slavery; social status; social work practice",2-s2.0-85023750627

Location: Europe and North America. Methods: We updated a portion of the dataset originally compiled by Jeschke and Strayer (2006, Global Change Biology, 12, 1608) to model establishment success of 139 vertebrates (birds, mammals and bony fishes) introduced between Europe and North America. We used conditional inference trees (CITs) to classify introduced species as either failing or succeeding to become established. We then developed a conceptual hypothesis of hierarchical structure among invasion mechanisms in which species traits influence establishment success (1) directly, and (2) indirectly, by affecting propagule pressure (approximated by the number of introductions) and native range size. We evaluated this hypothesis using path analysis. Results: Conditional inference trees identified number of introductions as the most important classifier of vertebrate establishment success. Secondarily, several standardized species traits operated across taxa to predict establishment success. Likewise, number of introductions and native range size were the only direct predictors of vertebrate establishment success in path models. However, these variables were also directly affected by a suite of species traits. Species that were introduced more often had greater reproductive allocation, longer lifespans and broader diets; species with larger native range sizes had greater thermal tolerance. Cumulative indirect effects of most traits were 2–3 times stronger than direct effects of other factors. Main Conclusions: We show that vertebrates share several traits that contribute to invasiveness across taxa. Using a hierarchical approach to quantify indirect effects of traits on establishment success accounts for existing empirical disparity regarding the relative role of traits versus other factors contributing to establishment success of introduced vertebrates. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","conditional inference tree; functional traits; hierarchical structure; invasive species; path analysis; vertebrate","introduced species; invasiveness; path analysis; range size; temperature tolerance; vertebrate; Europe; North America; Aves; Mammalia; Osteichthyes; Vertebrata",2-s2.0-85019688752

Risk assessment is commonly used to prioritise INNS, but fails to take into account the feasibility of management. Risk management provides a structured evaluation of management options, but has received little attention to date. We present a risk management scheme to assess the feasibility of eradicating INNS that can be used, in conjunction with existing risk assessment schemes, to support prioritisation. The Non-Native Risk Management scheme (NNRM) can be applied to any predefined area and any taxa. It uses semi-quantitative response and confidence scores to assess seven key criteria: Effectiveness, Practicality, Cost, Impact, Acceptability, Window of opportunity and Likelihood of re-invasion. Scores are elicited using expert judgement, supported by available evidence, and consensus-building methods. We applied the NNRM to forty-one INNS that threaten Great Britain (GB). Thirty-three experts provided scores, with overall feasibility of eradication assessed as ‘very high’ (8 species), ‘high’ (6), ‘medium’ (8), ‘low’ (10) and ‘very low’ (9). The feasibility of eradicating terrestrial species was higher than aquatic species. Lotic freshwater and marine species scored particularly low. Combining risk management and existing risk assessment scores identified six established species as priorities for eradication. A further six species that are not yet established were identified as priorities for eradication on arrival as part of contingency planning. The NNRM is one of the first INNS risk management schemes that can be used with existing risk assessments to prioritise INNS eradication in any area. © 2017, The Author(s).","Contingency planning; Feasibility of eradication; Great Britain; NNRM; Resource management; Risk analysis","conservation management; conservation planning; environmental planning; feasibility study; invasive species; prioritization; resource management; risk assessment; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85019173251

The tool is designed to guide the user to divide the complex arrival of the arthropod into all its potential pathways, which in turn are further subdivided into individual pathway segments. These manageable pathway segments are then used to specify which detailed data the user needs to gather to input into the tool. This information is used to simulate the magnitude of the arthropod population during the successive pathway segments throughout each potential introduction pathway. The tool simulates the fluctuating propagule pressure throughout the successive segments of each pathway to calculate risk indices, which are then used to generate pathway risk maps of the arthropod for Belgium. The tool generates 2 types of pathway risk map: (a) a point of entry pathway (POE) risk map consisting of concentrated hotspots relating to the arthropod's entry at national borders, and (b) a point of appearance (POA) pathway risk map, succeeding the POE and visualizing the locations and level at which undetected propagules of the arthropod are exposed to the outside environment throughout Belgium.

After a presentation of the existing models, the paper discusses the new approaches, addressing both commercial and institutional markets. New concepts for the very high resolution markets, in Europe and in the US, are the main focus of this analysis. Two complementary perspectives are summarised: on the one hand, the type of system and its operational performance and, on the other, the related business models, concepts of operation and ownership schemes. Until now, Earth observation systems for the most critical institutional needs are mainly dedicated assets owned and operated by governments or public organisations, often at national level. Even in the case of dual use missions, the governmental and commercial operations are in general fully segregated for the very high resolution satellites. Recent evolutions could affect this paradigm. Firstly, the increased performance of commercial satellites has a high degree of convergence with defence needs: 25–30 cm resolution is now the benchmark or at least a very short term target for commercial missions. The second evolution is the development of hybrid procurement schemes, combining proprietary missions and data buy framework contracts, partly triggered by the budgetary constraints of public customers, some failures in the execution of large spy satellites contracts and by the willingness to foster the competitiveness of industry on the export market. New space is another trend, which is more disruptive. This trend begun in the Silicon Valley and spread worldwide, arousing our expectations, sometimes excessively. This new model involves not only start-ups but also big web actors with substantial investment capacity. Both aim to transforming space into a commodity, taking benefit from the convergence between Information technology and EO. Beside the massive constellations for broadband Internet access, some initiatives have been launched for Earth observation markets, targeting high resolution and high revisit. Last but not least, more and more countries, the newcomers, invest in their own EO capacity, confirming the soft power dimension of space but also opening new opportunities for international or regional cooperation. As many unpredictable events may occur, even in a short time frame, the last part of the paper has a prospective dimension. Based on market trends and industrial stakes, it discusses the realism and likelihood of possible scenarios and identifies their impacts on the EO landscape and the main stakeholders involved, in particular in Europe: – The governmental and institutional actors, using Earth observation data for their operational missions, with an evolving balance between sovereign assets and external services.– The commercial operators of very high resolution satellites, with the new market opportunities and the possible emergence of worldwide champions.– The satellite manufacturers and their competitiveness.– The role of nations and space agencies, including the non-dependence or national sovereignty and international cooperation dimensions.Based on the comparison of three “radical” scenarios, the conclusion shows that there are opportunities for service providers and satellite manufacturers. Even without clear answer to the future industrial, technical and political structure of EO systems, relevant indicators to be monitored during the next three-five years are identified. The last section focuses on Europe and the role of institutions in order to support European champions and small and medium companies in the new worldwide competition. © 2017 IAA","Business models; Constellations; Earth Observation; GEOINT; New space; Revisit; Services; Very high resolution","Benchmarking; Budget control; Commerce; Competition; International cooperation; Investments; Manufacture; Observatories; Satellites; Societies and institutions; Space surveillance; Business models; Constellations; Earth observations; GEOINT; New space; Revisit; Services; Very high resolution; Earth (planet)",2-s2.0-85019563813

Furthermore, this was accompanied by a rapid process of differentiation and distinction, labelling particular groups as suited to certain types of work. The research is based on a series of interviews with (often well-educated) A8 migrants working in low-skill roles in the region. Findings indicate that the trajectories that initial migrants follow into work have the effect of producing routes into certain sorts of work for future migrants. However, when such routes lead to low-skill employment (as with the case of the majority of young A8 migrants), this has the effect of halting labour market progression for these workers, whilst simultaneously giving rise to commonly held assumptions that A8 migrants were particularly suited to certain kinds of work in the low-skill sector. I conclude that the co-existence of structural constraints and processes of distinction give rise to a situation in which workers entering the bottom of a migrant labour market can become trapped, regardless of their relative skills or qualifications. Furthermore, such processes rapidly become normalised and established and, without ever becoming formalised or officially grounded, begin to effect and limit the actions of individuals. Whilst such normalised behaviour may be open to contestation and change, it is remarkably resilient. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Dual labour markets; Ethnic labour markets; International migration; Labour market segmentation; Stereotyping","European Union; immigrant; international migration; labor market; labor migration; mobility; skilled labor; England; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-84991080643

By analysing 131,394 occurrence records of 1,334 plant species collected over 20 years in the European Alps, we found that non-natives are spreading upwards approximately twice as fast as natives. Whereas the spread of natives was enhanced by traits favouring longer dispersal distances, this was not the case for non-natives. This was due to the non-native species pool already being strongly biased towards species that had traits facilitating spread. A large proportion of native and non-native species seemed to be able to spread upwards faster than the current velocity of climate change. In particular, long-distance dispersal events and proximity to roads proved to be key drivers for the observed rapid spread.

In the first experiment, groups of rabbitfish (15 fish per group) were maintained for 1 h in waters of various oxygen concentrations. They were then transferred to well-aerated tanks and observed for 72 h.

On Santa Cruz Island, the Argentine ant had invaded about 2% of the island's area in four distinct locations as of 2012. Given the negative ecological effects resulting from Argentine ant invasions, we sought to develop a cost-effective method of eradication. Here, we describe the results of large-scale, field-tested methods for Argentine ant eradication and post-treatment detection. Our eradication protocol employs a novel toxicant-delivery system: an aqueous solution of sucrose and 6 ppm of thiamethoxam mixed with hydrating polyacrylamide beads. Ants feed on the solution present on the bead's surface for about 24 h after which time bead dehydration prevents feeding. We distributed hydrated beads by helicopter over 74 ha of infested areas plus a 50-m buffer on 14 occasions between June 2013 and September 2014. Treatments reduced Argentine ant activity to subdetectable levels within four months. In 2014, we conducted a high-intensity detection protocol using lures (n = 55 363) in areas treated in 2013. This effort did not detect Argentine ants. In 2015, we conducted a medium-intensity detection protocol using lures (n = 2250) in areas treated in 2013 and 2014 but not searched in 2014; this sampling effort did not detect Argentine ant activity except for a single remnant infestation (c. 0.3 ha in area), which was retreated in 2015. The cost of treatments was approximately $1400 per ha; this cost is comparable to other ant eradication efforts. The cost of our preferred detection method, which used lures spaced every 10 m, was $500 per ha. These results demonstrate sufficient protocol efficacy to justify expansion of treatments to other infested areas in ecologically sensitive areas. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","detection; ecologically sensitive communities; helicopter dispersal; invasion; polyacrylamide hydrogels","ant; aqueous solution; biological invasion; chemical control; cost analysis; dehydration; detection method; dispersal; ecological impact; protected area; removal experiment; thiamethoxam; California; Channel Islands [California]; Santa Cruz Island; United States; Formicidae; Linepithema humile",2-s2.0-85012942183

We set up six study sites that had developed under different mean annual precipitation levels in the Ko'olau Mountains on the island of O'ahu, Hawai'i. Accumulated litter mass and soil pH decreased with precipitation in the native stands. Invasion by P. cattleianum increased the amount of litter and reduced the differences in soil water content and pH among the sites. We compared the decomposition process using the Tea Bag Index, which is determined by the difference in dry mass of commercially available green and rooibos teas in nylon mesh bags before and after 90 days of burial. Psidium cattleianum increased the initial litter decomposition rate irrespective of precipitation and other soil properties. On the other hand, P. cattleianum increased the long-term litter stabilization factor of the Tea Bag Index in wetter sites. The accumulation of litter was likely caused by indirect effects of P. cattleianum through the alteration of soil moisture properties. In summary, this study shows that invasion by P. cattleianum could alter the soil properties in both wet and mesic sites, suggesting the possibility of change in composition and/or function of decomposers. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Decomposer; Invasive non-native plant; Litter accumulation; Plant-soil interaction; Psidium cattleianum; Tea bag index","accumulation; angiosperm; decomposition; forest soil; fruit; invasive species; litter; soil ecosystem; soil moisture; soil property; soil test; soil-vegetation interaction; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Oahu; Aspalathus linearis; Psidium cattleianum",2-s2.0-85020671157

Also, it has been proved that urban flora differs from its surroundings, and at the same time reflects its richness. Our study focused on urban flora, structure and similarities, and the possible correlation with the urban attributes. Therefore, we selected 11 cities in Southeast Europe, which differ in the development of transportation networks (roads, rails and inland waterways) and population size. Next, we compared two sets of data (structure of urban flora and urban attributes) to define the correlation patterns. Analyzed urban floras were primarily distinguished by a total number of species, number of unique species and neophytes. Belgrade is a city with the highest urbanization level, the most species and the highest number of unique species and neophytes as well. Kosovska Mitrovica, Grocka and Požarevac stand out by floristic richness. These cities have a high number of species, yet a small proportion of neophytes. Other cities are characterized by similar floristic structure, with a relatively similar proportion of neophytes and approximately similar number of unique species in relation to the total number. It can be concluded that other factors beside the chosen urban attributes have additional effects on floristic structure, except for the factor - the presence of neophytes.

To address these problems, we compared the differences in 16 leaf functional traits related to light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Pmax) between 22 invasive and native plants in a nutrient-poor habitat in northeast China. The invasive plants had significantly higher Pmax, photosynthetic nitrogen- (PNUE), phosphorus- (PPUE), potassium- (PKUE) and energy-use efficiencies (PEUE) than the co-occurring natives, while leaf nutrient concentrations, construction cost (CC) and specific leaf area were not significantly different between the invasive and native plants. The higher PNUE contributed to higher Pmax for the invasive plants, which in turn contributed to higher PPUE, PKUE and PEUE. CC changed independently with other traits such as Pmax, PNUE, PPUE, PKUE and PEUE, showing two trait dimensions, which may facilitate acclimation to multifarious niche dimensions.

Given that Nakamura has focused on a range of new media but not webpages, we draw on analytic frameworks on visual racism from Van Leeuwen (2008) and interactivity and aesthetics by Adami (2014, 2015) to provide a detailed case study analysis of how the visual and verbal meaning-making strategies and the technological affordance of interactivity produce racialised and gendered cybertyping and Othering. Our analysis shows that racialised femininity is deployed to touristify a region seen by racist media to be criminalised, masculine and foreign.

Utilising direct provision as a ‘form of aftercare’ emphasises governmental policy preferences that privilege the migrant status of aged-out separated children, as opposed to viewing this group as young people leaving care. In this article, utilising a cross-disciplinary approach, we provide the first systematic exploration of the system of aftercare for aged-out separated children in Ireland. In doing so, we posit two core reasons for why the aftercare system for aged-out separated children has developed as it has. First, doing so ensures that the state is consistent with its approach to asylum seekers more generally, in that it seeks to deter persons from claiming asylum in Ireland through utilisation of the direct provision system. Second, while the vulnerability of aged-out separated children is well-documented, the state (and others) ignore this vulnerability and are reluctant to offer additional aftercare supports beyond direct provision. This is due, we argue, to viewing aged-out separated children as having a lesser entitlement to rights than other care leavers, solely based on their migrant status. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","aftercare; asylum seekers; direct provision; separated children; unaccompanied minors","asylum seeker; child care; social status; social work; state role; young population; adult; adulthood; aftercare; aging; asylum seeker; child; childhood; female; foster care; human; human experiment; Ireland; male; public policy; social work; young adult; Ireland",2-s2.0-85021373053

The model calculates the distribution of an imported infested/infected commodity along a pathway into and within the EU from source countries, based on Eurostat data and other data/information. The model determines the implications of global trade pathways for the potential arrival of the infested commodity in the EU28 Member States. Within each Member State, the calculation proceeds by distributing the commodity according to uses, notably retail or processing, to the vulnerable area of commercial host crops determined in each NUTS2 region and then quantifies the consequent potential for pest–host contact which could lead to pest transfer. Annual and monthly estimates of contact risk are tabulated and visualized for Member States and NUTS2 regions. The model was developed originally for the European Food Safety Authority using four case studies of specific pest–commodity combinations. These pests had relatively limited host ranges and the model has now been extended in the context of the EC FP7 DROPSA project for the multiple commodity pathways associated with the highly polyphagous fruit pest Drosophila suzukii. © 2017 The Authors.

Brazil has been spared, generically, of several destructive invasive species. Reports of invasive snakes’ populations are nonexistent, but the illegal pet trade might change this scenario. Despite the Brazilian laws forbid to import most animals, illegal trade is frequently observed and propagules are found in the wild. The high species richness within Brazilian biomes and accelerated fragmentation of natural reserves are a critical factors facilitating successful invasion. An efficient way to ease damages caused by invasive species is identifying potential invaders and consequent prevention of introductions. For the identification of potential invaders many factors need to be considered, including estimates of climate matching between areas (native vs. invaded). Ecological niche modelling has been widely used to predict potential areas for invasion and is an important tool for conservation biology. This study evaluates the potential geographical distribution and establishment risk of Lampropeltis getula (Linnaeus, 1766), Lampropeltis triangulum (Lacépède, 1789), Pantherophis guttatus (Linnaeus, 1766), Python bivittatus Kuhl, 1820 and Python regius (Shaw, 1802) through the Maximum Entropy modelling approach to estimate the potential distribution of the species within Brazil and qualitative evaluation of specific biological attributes. Our results suggest that the North and Midwest regions harbor major suitable areas. Furthermore, P. bivittatus and P. guttatus were suggested to have the highest invasive potential among the analyzed species. Potentially suitable areas for these species were predicted within areas which are highly relevant for Brazilian biodiversity, including several conservation units. Therefore, these areas require special attention and preventive measures should be adopted. © 2017 Fonseca et al.

We developed a MaxEnt model and employed weighted overlay analyses to detect the species’ potential distribution and generate risk maps for Italy. D. polymorpha has a greater probability of occurring at low to medium altitudes in areas characterised by fluviatile deposits of major streams. Northern and central Italy appear more at risk. Some hydroelectric power dams are at high risk, while most dams for irrigation, drinkable water reservoirs and other dam types are at medium to low risk. The lakes and rivers reaches (representing likely expansion pathways) at medium-high or high risk mostly occur in northern and central Italy.

One of the main goals of clearance is the restoration of native communities that were present pre-invasion. Little monitoring is typically carried out, however, to verify that native communities return without further management intervention in the years following invasive species removal. We investigated whether the epiphytic plant community of Atlantic oak woodlands, which principally consists of bryophyte species, returned after up to thirty years of recovery following the removal of the invasive non-native shrub Rhododendron ponticum. This community is of international conservation value and is particularly threatened by invasive Rhododendron. We revealed that the epiphytic plant community was able to recover effectively in sites that had been clear from Rhododendron for over fifteen years. This recovery included several species of particular conservation interest with highly restricted European distributions (i.e. ‘Atlantic species’ such as Plagiochila heterophylla). Total cover and species richness both returned to similar or even higher levels to those found in uninvaded control plots by fifteen or more years following clearance, despite being highly reduced within dense Rhododendron thickets. Overall community composition also recovered to resemble uninvaded control plots in the years following Rhododendron removal. These findings present an encouraging message that at least some native communities can return naturally in the years following invasive species removal and may not require further management interventions to speed their return. © 2017","Atlantic oak woodland; Bryophytes; Epiphytes; Invasive species; Restoration; Rhododendron ponticum","bryophyte; deciduous tree; epiphyte; invasive species; native species; restoration ecology; shrub; woodland; bryophytes; Plagiochila heterophylla; Quercus atlantica; Rhododendron; Rhododendron ponticum",2-s2.0-85020377252

This species is typically associated with human activity, including commercial and recreational vessels, aquaculture equipment, and both wave and tidal energy devices. It has also been observed in the natural environment, fouling rocks and boulders. The species has an extensive but widely discontinuous distribution in GB and Ireland. Although found frequently in marinas and harbours in Scotland, it inhabits only a few sites in England, Wales and Ireland, interspersed with wide gaps that are well documented as genuine absences.

The formation of at least one CO/chiasma between homologous chromosome pairs is essential for accurate chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division and genetic recombination. Polyploid organisms with multiple sets of homoeologous chromosomes have evolved additional mechanisms for the regulation of CO/chiasma. In hexaploid wheat (2n = 6× = 42), this is accomplished by pairing homoeologous (Ph) genes, with Ph1 having the strongest effect on suppressing homoeologous recombination and homoeologous COs. In this study, we observed homoeologous COs between chromosome 5Mg of Aegilops geniculata and 5D of wheat in plants where Ph1 was fully active, indicating that chromosome 5Mg harbors a homoeologous recombination promoter factor(s). Further cytogenetic analysis, with different 5Mg/5D recombinants, showed that the homoeologous recombination promoting factor(s) may be located in proximal regions of 5Mg. In addition, we observed a higher frequency of homoeologous COs in the pericentromeric region between chromosome combination of rec5Mg#2S·5Mg#2L and 5D compared to 5Mg#1/5D, which may be caused by a small terminal region of 5DL homology present in chromosome rec5Mg#2. The genetic stocks reported here will be useful for analyzing the mechanism of Ph1 action and the nature of homoeologous COs. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aegilops geniculata; Homoeologous recombination; Meiotic synapsis; Triticum aestivum; Wheat","centromere; chromosome 5; chromosome analysis; chromosome pairing; chromosome segregation; clinical article; hexaploidy; homologous recombination; human; nonhuman; promoter region; Triticum aestivum",2-s2.0-85000910704

The yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina was originally distributed throughout most of the Oriental region, but it has invasive populations in South Korea, Europe, and most recently, Japan. This species is a predator of honeybees, raising concerns about costs to beekeeping. A previous study concluded that South Korean and European populations originated from China. In this study, we investigate the genetic structure of V. velutina to infer the origin of Japanese populations. A maximum likelihood tree based on three mitochondrial genes (COI, Cytb, and 16S rRNA) revealed that V. velutina consists of an Indonesian–Malaysian clade and an Asian Continent clade, although some Indonesian samples are included in the latter clade. Sequences from individuals in the Japanese and South Korean populations were identical, suggesting that V. velutina in Japan came from South Korea. The single haplotype found in these introduced populations suggests that they originated from a very small number of founders from the natural distributional area. Nevertheless, their distribution continues to expand in introduced areas.

To disentangle the invasive plant impact on communities it is essential to combine experimental and observation approaches, which enable the correct interpretations of results and lead to the right decisions for management. We examined the invasion of southern Brazil's grasslands by Eragrostis plana, which is currently the most problematic invasive species in the region. By means of an experiment on invaded communities complemented by observation of non-invaded communities, we assessed E. plana impact on vegetation, evaluated community response to its removal and discussed the effectiveness of removal methods. Fifty permanent 1 × 1 m plots were located on natural grassland that was partially invaded by E. plana. Removal was done annually from 2012 to 2015 and consisted of five treatments (n = 10): (i) clipping above-ground biomass on one occasion; (ii) clipping above-ground biomass periodically; (iii) herbicide and (iv) hand-pulling, plus (v) control treatment with no-removal. In addition, 10 plots located in an adjacent non-invaded area were monitored. All removal treatments reduced E. plana cover across years, but were not enough to eradicate it. Our results revealed not only differences between invaded and non-invaded communities, but also an effect of E. plana removal on resident species richness and total cover. At the local scale, we demonstrated the impact of E. plana invasion on grassland vegetation, suggesting a reduction in resident species richness and total cover. Invasive species removal changed communities differently from invaded ones, but not resembling non-invaded references, suggesting that community recovery may need more time for reestablishment or that some restoration strategies are required. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrated the impact on vegetation of the most important invasive species in southern Brazil's natural grasslands. We highlighted the advantages of combining observations of non-invaded communities and experimental studies on invaded communities, with and without invasive removal, to help infer causal relationships in ecological invasion research. © 2016 The Authors.

The Washington State University perennial wheat breeding program has created several hundred interspecific progeny by crossing several different cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with Thinopyrum species and × Agrotriticum spp. Prior to the chromosome composition of these wheat-wheatgrass derivatives was not characterized, limiting their utility as stable breeding germplasm. We determined the mitotic chromosome number and species origin of chromosomes for eight breeding lines, and estimated their relatedness and population structure using AFLPs. Additionally, self-pollination and outcrossing rates were estimated for these breeding lines to gain an understanding of perennial wheat’s reproductive strategy. We intercrossed the lines with each other to produce 20 families and then measured the level of chromosome pairing during meiosis I in the F1 progeny. The lines contained between 44 and 64 chromosomes, of which eight to 16 were from Th. ponticum. Our analysis of molecular diversity indicated greater genetic diversity within, rather than across, breeding lines (88 and 12%, respectively). The outcrossing rate was estimated at 16%.

Racial exclusion has garnered a great deal of scholarly attention in recent years. This article builds on that historiography, but also questions its inattention to the British connection, and hence to considerations of imperial power. It analyses how the debate on immigration served as a canvas on which advocates and detractors of exclusion could paint competing concepts of empire, and seeks to understand how policymakers attempted to manage the migration question through a range of spatial and diplomatic solutions.

Only three of the seven buried soils in southwest Washington that can be reliably traced as buried soils or paleotsunami deposits in the coastal lowlands of south-central and southern Cascadia have well-dated counterparts in northern Cascadia. The three wide-ranging events date from Cascadia earthquakes Y (∼250 cal BP), U (∼1260 cal BP), and N (∼2520 cal BP). All three likely ruptured the entire plate margin, and therefore potentially qualify as “giants” (Mw ≥ 9). Deposits that may derive from tsunamis generated by earthquakes S (∼1570 cal BP), L (∼2870 cal BP) and J (∼3360 cal BP) can also be found in northern Cascadia, but the ages of these deposits are not yet well-enough constrained to determine whether they are coeval with their southern counterparts. Earthquake W (∼850 cal BP), appears to be present in the northern Cascadia paleoseismic record, but yields considerably older ages than in central Cascadia, and may be missing from southernmost Cascadia.

The evidence base to underpin this concern is, however, surprisingly limited and analysis is based on differing and often partial conceptualisations of integration. Through an examination of the evidence in recent studies, we interrogate the impact which spousal immigration can have within differing domains of integration.

Micropterus salmoides were sampled monthly between March 2010 and March 2012 from Wriggleswade and Mankazana impoundments using either angling or multi-meshed (35, 45, 47, 57, 65, 73, 77, 93, 106, 118, 150 and 153 mm) multifilament gillnet fleets, and a 1 m seine net.

Age at maturity (1.3–2 years) and length at maturity (232–254 mm FL) were similar to other temperate populations. A well-defined, spring spawning season conformed to findings in other temperate populations. Using sectioned sagittal otoliths it was shown that fish were long-lived (14 years). Growth rates differed significantly between the two assessed populations but both were slower growing than tropical and subtropical introduced populations. Growth performance (Φ′: 2.77–2.99) was similar to other temperate populations.

Introductions of fishes in freshwater ecosystems are often characterized as complex processes, yet an understanding of the nature of the introduction can inform management and conservation actions. Early in the twentieth century, two introductions of Largemouth Bass were made into South Africa for the establishment of a recreational fishery, and subsequent translocations have expanded their distribution to include much of southern Africa. In this study we quantified neutral genetic variation, modeled potential introduction scenarios, and identified potential source regions from within the native range. We documented limited levels of genetic diversity in nuclear microsatellite genotypes across populations (mean allelic richness = 1.80 and mean observed heterozygosity = 0.16) and observed low levels of genetic differentiation among four of the five focal populations (mean pairwise fixation index = 0.09), with a fifth population displaying greater levels of genetic divergence (mean pairwise fixation index = 0.27). A total of three cytochrome b haplotypes were recovered from South Africa samples and the single most common haplotype (93% of individuals) was identical to a haplotype from a population of Largemouth Bass in Maryland, USA. Using limited available stocking data along with outputs from Principal Component Analysis and approximate Bayesian evaluation of competing introduction scenarios we confirm the presence of multiple introductions. Despite evidence for multiple introductions, Largemouth Bass in South African water bodies harbor extremely low neutral genetic diversity, suggesting that even a very limited number of propagules can experience a high likelihood of success in invading nonnative waters. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Centrarchidae; DIYABC; Freshwater fish; Invasion reconstruction; Microsatellite","community dynamics; conservation management; ecological impact; freshwater ecosystem; genetic differentiation; genetic marker; genetic variation; invasive species; native species; perciform; predator; reconstruction; twentieth century; Maryland; South Africa; United States; Centrarchidae; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; Pisces",2-s2.0-85017612144

A frequent critique of invasion biology is the use of value-laden language that may indicate context bias. Here we use a systematic study of language and interpretation in papers drawn from invasion biology to evaluate whether there is a link between the framing of papers and the interpretation of results. We also examine any trends in context bias in biological invasion research. We examined 651 peer-reviewed invasive species competition studies and implemented a rigorous systematic review to examine bias in the presentation and interpretation of native and invasive competition in invasion biology. We predicted that bias in the presentation of invasive species is increasing, as suggested by several authors, and that bias against invasive species would result in misinterpreting their competitive dominance in correlational observational studies compared to causative experimental studies. We indeed found evidence of bias in the presentation and interpretation of invasive species research; authors often introduced research with invasive species in a negative context and study results were interpreted against invasive species more in correlational studies. However, we also found a distinct decrease in those biases since the mid-2000s. Given that there have been several waves of criticism from scientists both inside and outside invasion biology, our evidence suggests that the subdiscipline has somewhat self-corrected apparent biases. © 2017 Warren et al.

Although the wide hybrid between the two species is difficult to obtain, we overcome this difficulty by young embryo rescue. An obvious heterosis was primarily found for the plant height, tillering ability, vegetative vigor, etc. However, the hybrid panicle and culm traits were found to resemble that of the wild rice parent, O. ridleyi, for the long awns, exoteric purple stigma, grain shattering, dispersed panicles, and culm mechanical strength. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis was subsequently performed on the mitotic metaphase chromosome of the root tips, and we determined that the hybrid is an allotriploid with 36 chromosomes and its genomic constitution is AHJ. Chemical analyses conducted on the culm of O. sativa, O. ridleyi, and their interspecific hybrids showed that major changes occurred in the xylose, glucose, and arabinose concentrations, which are correlated with the specific hemicellulose polymer and cellulose components that are important in the primary cell walls of green plants. Meanwhile, the culm anatomical analyses indicated that additional large vascular bundles and an extra sclerenchyma cell layer were found in O. ridleyi. Additionally, further thickening of the secondary cell walls of the cortical fiber sclerenchyma cells and the phloem companion cells was discovered in O. ridleyi and in the interspecific hybrids.

In urban tree species selection, resistance evaluation system of tree pests and disease is one of the rational and effective approaches in the context of climate warming. According to the three levels of resistance screening, resistance evaluation and resistance management, an evaluation system of tree pests and disease resistance was constructed. Based on the explored literature, 32 urban tree species in Shanghai were evaluated by the evaluation system under climate warming. The evaluation system includes two aspects of disease resistance and pest resistance, among which, the disease resistance is catogorilized into four levels: non-lethal leaf disease, branch disease, root disease and lethal disease, and the pest resistance contains trunk borer pests, leaf-eating pests, sucking pests and underground pests. The results showed that 6 specices (Albizzia julibrissin, Phonex canariensis, Platanus acerifolia, Cinnamomum camphora, Rhododendron simsii, Cerasus serrulata) were in high fection level, 6 species (Cycas revoluta, Bischofia polycarpa, Salix babylonica, Euonymus japonicus, Osmanthus fragrans, Pittosporum tobira) were susceptible, 8 species (Ligustrum lucidum, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, Pterocarya stenoptera, Koelreuteria paniculata, Acer buergerianum, Malus hallian, Hibiscus syriacus, Ilex cornuta) were in low resistance, 10 pieces (Melia azedarach, Ginkgo biloba, Magnolia grandifolia, Cedrus deodara, Elaeocarpus decipiens, Distylium racemosum, Berberis thunbergii, Chimonanthus praecox, Fatsia japonica, Photinia serrulata) were in medium resistance, 2 species (Magnolia denudata, Camellia japonica) were in high resistance. Therefore, the evaluation system provides an effective method to evaluate the resistance of landscape trees from a case study of single or few pests and diseases to the multi-holistic research. Meanwhile, it has a certain reference value for the occurrence and development of tree pests and diseases in response to climate warming, and it is helpful for reasonable tree species selection and sustainable management. © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing Forestry University.

Invasive plants with fleshy fruits rapidly form associations with native and invasive dispersers, and may affect existing native plant-disperser associations. We asked whether frugivore visitation rate and fruit removal was associated with plant characteristics in a community of fleshy-fruited plants and whether an invasive plant receives more visitation and greater fruit removal than native plants in a semi-arid habitat of Andhra Pradesh, India. Tree-watches were undertaken at individuals of nine native and one invasive shrub species to assess the identity, number and fruit removal by avian frugivores. Network analyses and generalised linear mixed-effects models were used to understand species and community-level patterns. All plants received most number of visits from abundant, generalist avian frugivores. Number of frugivore visits and time spent by frugivores at individual plants was positively associated with fruit crop size, while fruit removal was positively associated with number of frugivore visits and their mean foraging time at individual plants. The invasive shrub, Lantana camara L. (Lantana), had lower average frugivore visit rate than the community of fleshy-fruited plants and received similar average frugivore visits but greater average per-hour fruit removal than two other concurrently fruiting native species. Based on the results of our study, we infer that there is little evidence of competition between native plants and Lantana for the dispersal services of native frugivores and that more data are required to assess the nature of these interactions over the long term. We speculate that plant associations with generalist frugivores may increase the functional redundancy of this frugivory network, buffering it against loss of participating species. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Frugivory; Generalist frugivores; Lantana camara; Mutualist network; Plant invasion","biological invasion; dispersal; flower visiting; frugivory; generalist; herbivore; invasive species; mutualism; native species; plant community; plant-herbivore interaction; population structure; semiarid region; shrub; Andhra Pradesh; India; Aves; Lantana; Lantana camara",2-s2.0-85020710305

For the first time in this study, we analyzed the distribution of V. velutina nests at a local scale to understand the pattern of nesting, and in 8 years of monitoring, a total of 528 nests were surveyed. With the exception of 2 years, the nests of V. velutina were randomly distributed within the monitored area, which suggested that intraspecific competition for nesting sites and/or food was unlikely. When the data for all years were combined, an aggregated distribution of nests at the seafront in the vicinity of the oyster farm and sportfishing activities was observed. This distribution suggested that seafood, attractive to vespids, might provide a valuable alternative food source that favored colony development. We also tested the effect of spring queen trapping of V. velutina on the distribution of nests in 2014, which was the year with the greatest number of colonies within the area; the position of the traps did not influence the distribution of the nests. For the first time, this study showed that (i) intraspecific competition was unlikely to be a mechanism for population regulation, (ii) some areas were more likely favored for hornet nests, and (iii) spring queen wasp trapping was inefficient as a method to limit the distribution of the V. velutina population. © 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","intraspecific competition; nesting habits; spring queen trapping; yellow-legged hornet","animal; devices; ecosystem; female; France; insect control; introduced species; nesting; physiology; wasp; Animals; Ecosystem; Female; France; Insect Control; Introduced Species; Nesting Behavior; Wasps",2-s2.0-84971556250

Yet invasion studies rarely control for the presence of these other disturbances, although their overlapping effects may influence the direction and magnitude of impacts attributed to the invader alone. Here, we ask whether controlling for the presence of a co-occurring disturbance, as well as the time since disturbance, yields different values of an invader's ecosystem effects than when these factors remain unaddressed. We used a chronosequence of six forest stands at a single site: five logged stands that each contained paired invaded-uninvaded plots of the forest understory invasive grass Microstegium vimineum, as well as one unlogged and uninvaded control stand. By controlling for the presence of both logging and invasion, we untangled the effects of each through time. We found that the co-occurring disturbance of logging can dramatically alter the measured effects of M. vimineum by amplifying, dampening, negating, or entirely reversing the direction of the invader's impacts. During its period of peak impact, logging amplified the invader's positive effect on the size of the soil microbial biomass pool by 24%, reduced the invader's positive effect on soil water holding capacity by 5%, negated the invader's positive effect on the particulate organic matter carbon pool (from a 9% increase to no significant effect), and reversed the direction of the invader's impact on net nitrogen mineralization rate from a 51% increase to a 52% decrease. Furthermore, the influence of logging on the invader's impacts was not static, but dynamic through time. The results from our site therefore demonstrate that failure to account for the impacts of a co-occurring disturbance, as well as the time since disturbance, can result in flawed inference about the nature of an invader's effects. Future research should determine how widespread such flawed inference might be among other invasive species and across different environmental contexts. To help guide such research, we describe a general framework for disentangling the overlapping effects of invasions and co-occurring disturbances through time. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","disturbance; ecosystem impacts; forest invasion; invasive species; Microstegium vimineum; nitrogen cycling; recovery; soil carbon; time since invasion","biological invasion; biomass; chronosequence; disturbance; ecosystem dynamics; grass; invasive species; nitrogen cycle; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil water potential; succession; understory; Microstegium vimineum",2-s2.0-85022343018

We aim at investigating and comparing the diversity of herbaceous species along main and secondary forest roads in a temperate-managed hornbeam-beech forest, north of Iran. Sixteen transects along main and secondary forest roads were established (eight transects along main roads and eight along secondary roads). To eliminate the effect of forest type, all transects were located in Carpinetum-Fagetum forests, the dominant forest type in the study area. The total length of each transect was 200 m (100 m toward up slope and 100 m toward down slope), and plots were established along it at different distances from road edge. The diversity of herbaceous plant species was calculated in each plot using Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and Pielou’s index. The results showed that diversity index decreased when distance from road edge increases. This decreasing trend continued up to 60 m from forest road margin, and after this threshold, the index slightly increased. Depending on the type of road (main or secondary) as well as cut or fill slopes, the area showing a statistical different plant composition and diversity measured through Shannon-Wiener, species richness, and Pielou’s index is up to 10 m. The length depth of the road edge effect found in main and secondary forest roads was small, but it could have cumulative effects on forest microclimate and forest-associated biota at the island scale.

We hypothesized that adults' verbal instruction (""testimony""), as well as emotions such as disgust, would influence children's moralization of apparently harmless actions. To test this hypothesis, 7-year-old children were asked to render moral judgments of novel, seemingly victimless, body-directed or nature-directed actions after being exposed to adults' testimony or to an emotional induction. Study 1 demonstrated that children became more likely to judge actions as ""wrong"" upon being verbally presented with testimony about disgust or anger-but not upon being directly induced to feel disgusted. Study 2 established that principle-based testimony is an even more powerful source of moralization, and additionally found long-term retention of newly formed moral beliefs. These studies also indicated that children frequently lack introspective insight into the sources of their newly acquired moral reactions; they often invoked welfare-based concerns in their explanations regardless of experimental condition.

Seventeen percent of the species require further evaluation before risk of invasion can be determined. Of the remaining 70 species, the WRA predicted that 70% were at high risk for invasion, but only 50% of the 84 species are currently invasive in Florida. The status and risk prediction were inconsistent for 27% of the species: 15 non-invaders were predicted to be of high risk for invasion (i.e., false positive) and 4 invaders were predicted to be of low risk (i.e., false negative). Longer residence time in the flora was significantly correlated with higher invasion risk. Further investigation is necessary to identify whether residence time explains inconsistencies between risk and status conclusions, or whether the WRA over-predicts invasion risk.

Episodic regeneration failure (“die-off”) has been observed in cheatgrass monocultures and can have negative ecosystem consequences, but can also provide an opportunity for restoration of native species and ecological function within the imperiled sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Proximate causes of cheatgrass die-off are uncertain, although several taxa of fungal soil pathogens have been implicated. Die-off occurrence is stochastic and can occur in remote areas. Thus, developing remote sensing indicators that are repeatable over long time periods, across extensive regions, and at relatively fine spatial resolution would be beneficial for accurately pinpointing events. We developed a remote sensing approach for mapping historical die-off from the Landsat archive (1985–2015), and used this to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of die-off occurrence annually at 30-m resolution. A Random Forests classification of image-derived spectral endmembers, trained on 2014 data, predicted die-off with 93% accuracy (κ = 0.845) when applied to independent validation data from 2009. Die-off extent varied greatly across years, though some areas experienced die-off multiple times during the observation period. We found a strong correspondence between die-off occurrence and winter drought conditions, with strongest negative associations with current-year winter precipitation and previous years’ lagged winter and annual precipitation. Die-off duration was heavily skewed towards single-year die-off (81.5% of events), even in localized areas of more frequent occurrence (‘die-off hotspots’). Our retrospective classification of the Landsat archive suggests that cheatgrass die-off occurrence is predictable as the intersection of particular site environmental conditions with annual weather conditions, possibly because they are favorable for disease expression. Associations with previous year conditions suggest that die-off may also depend upon feedbacks between cheatgrass dominance and litter production, suitable sites for seedling establishment, and abundance and persistence of pathogen inoculum. Remote sensing indicators such as those developed in this study are needed to develop hypotheses about die-off causal factors, as well as support improved management of cheatgrass, mitigation for negative consequences associated with die-off (e.g. wind erosion), and successful restoration of native plant communities on die-off areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cheatgrass; Great Basin; Invasive plants; Landscape pathology; Remote sensing; Seed pathogens","Decision trees; Ecology; Ecosystems; Mapping; Pathogens; Plants (botany); Reforestation; Remote sensing; Restoration; Seed; Stochastic systems; Cheatgrass; Ecosystem degradation; Environmental conditions; Great Basin; Invasive plants; Remote sensing approaches; Seedling establishment; Spatial and temporal patterns; Dies; abundance; grass; invasive species; Landsat; native species; pathogen; pathology; rangeland; remote sensing; seedling establishment; spatial resolution; Great Basin; United States; Artemisia tridentata; Bromus tectorum",2-s2.0-85018479080

There is little information on the life-history mechanisms used by native generalist insects to colonize exotic hosts and how these mechanisms are affected by host properties. We examined the ability of the generalist seed beetle Stator limbatus Horn to colonize an exotic species. We compared its host preference, acceptability, performance, and egg size when ovipositing and developing on two native (Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth and Senegalia riparia (Kunth)) and one exotic legume species (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)). We also analyzed the seed chemistry. We found that females recognize the exotic species as an unfavorable host for larval development and that they delayed oviposition and laid fewer and larger eggs on the exotic species than on the native species. Survivorship on the exotic host was 0%. Additionally, seeds of the native species contain five chemical compounds that are absent in the exotic species, and the exotic species contains three sterols, which are absent in the native legumes. Genetically based differences between beetles adapted to different hosts, plastic responses toward new hosts, and chemical differences among seeds are important in host colonization and recognition of the exotic host. In conclusion, the generalist nature of S. limbatus does not influence its ability to colonize L. leucocephala.

It poses a threat to agricultural productivity, biodiversity and social amenity values of aquatic environments. Significant research has been conducted internationally, regarding the efficacy of different herbicides for control of A. philoxeroides. However, no studies have looked at key aspects of control for effective management in an early stage of invasion of aquatic environments, hindering eradication and control programmes. This study evaluates the efficacy of herbicides and surfactants on key A. philoxeroides response metrics, including control of above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass and production of viable stem fragments. This study concluded that glyphosate (isopropylamine salt) minimises viable stem fragment production post-herbicide application, compared with imazapyr and metsulfuron, thus reducing the potential for dispersal throughout catchments and waterways. In contrast, imazapyr and metsulfuron provided more effective control than glyphosate for A. philoxeroides growing on exposed embankments. We propose that an effective management strategy for early invasion of aquatic A. philoxeroides, using herbicides, would be to conduct initial applications of glyphosate to control overwater biomass and limit dispersal of viable stem fragments.

We found that although overall trophic niche size or area of these species was not significantly different, P. leniusculus was significantly higher in trophic position than P. clarkii when also accounting for the effects of body size, sex, and lakes as random effects.

RESULTS: Two products, a glue (polyvinyl acetate) and an oil (raw linseed oil) were used as coatings and applied together with a repellent and two insecticides (teflutrin and chlorpyrifos) at different dosages on two species of palm (P. dactylifera and P. canariensis). Phytotoxic effects of the treatments were evaluated in a greenhouse on 260 potted palms (130 P. dactylifera and 130 P. canariensis) and no negative effects were observed. Afterwards, a trial lasting 400 days was carried out in a nursery located in Sicily (south Italy), treating 572 potted palm trees (286 P. dactylifera and 286 P. canariensis) with an average diameter at the base of 18–20 cm. After 400 days, 48% of the untreated palms were infested, while only 3% of date palms and 7% of Canary palms treated with insecticide at lower dosages were infested.

In this study, growth characteristics and herbicide sensitivity of C. esculentus clones collected in Belgian maize (Zea mays) fields were evaluated. In a morphology Experiment, 25 clones were screened for growth characteristics and ability to set viable seeds under outdoor conditions. Dose–response experiments were conducted in the glasshouse to evaluate the effectiveness of two foliar-applied herbicides (bentazon and glyphosate) and two pre-sowing soil-incorporated herbicides (S-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P) for controlling 14 C. esculentus clones. Response variables were aboveground dry biomass, tuber number, tuber dry biomass and individual tuber dry weight. Clones exhibited large differences in shoot number (up to 3.1-fold), tuber dry biomass (up to 4.7-fold), tuber number (up to 3.4-fold), individual tuber dry weight (up to 4.8-fold), inflorescence number and capacity to set viable seeds. Large interclonal differences in herbicide sensitivity (up to 8.3- and 4.0-fold for aboveground dry biomass and tuber dry biomass, respectively) were observed. Contrary to foliar-applied herbicides, soil-incorporated herbicides were very effective and provided season-long C. esculentus control at doses below the recommended maximum field dose.

We used a globally distributed ruderal, Centaurea solstitialis (Centaurea), to explore the possibility that the importance of those factors exhibits great variation between and within ranges. To test our hypothesis, we established seed addition experiments with soil disturbance (turnover and control) and biocide (fungicides, insecticide, and control) treatments in two regions within native (the Caucasus and south-western Turkey) and non-native (the western United States – US – and central Argentina) distributions. Also, we estimated the rate of vegetation recovery after disturbance (resilience) and related it to Centaurea density in experimental plots. Disturbance strongly increased Centaurea density in all regions. Density was similar between the native Caucasus and non-native Argentina and much greater in those regions than in the native Turkey and non-native US in biocide-free plots. Fungicides had positive effects on density in the US and negative ones in the Caucasus and Argentina, resulting in no differences between those three regions and greater density in the US than Turkey. Insecticide applications promoted Centaurea density in Turkey and Argentina, but inter-regional comparisons of density in treated plots were comparable to those in biocide-free plots. Overall, plants were smaller and less fecund in Turkey than the other regions, except the US. The greatest fungal attack was documented in Turkey, and herbivory was stronger there and in Argentina than in the Caucasus and US. The resilience of the local community explained a large proportion of variation in Centaurea density. These results support our hypothesis, and reveal that the speed at which competition is re-gained after disturbance may influence global variation in Centaurea abundance. Because many ruderals exhibit native and non-native distributions, our results are likely to be generalized to other systems. © 2016 The Authors",,"abundance; environmental disturbance; environmental factor; fungicide; herb; home range; hypothesis testing; introduced species; native species; population density; population distribution; Argentina; Caucasus; Turkey; United States; Centaurea; Centaurea solstitialis",2-s2.0-84987876563

Nonetheless, the potential of low abundance invaders to alter the resilience of native communities to disturbance has been poorly explored. On Mediterranean rocky reefs, we tested the hypothesis that (1) a pulse disturbance opening gaps within canopy stands formed by the fucoid seaweed Cystoseira brachycarpa facilitates the establishment of the non-native seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea and that (2), once established, the seaweed can reduce the recovery of macroalgal canopies. In July 2011, C. cylindracea was experimentally transplanted in small and large plots that were either cleared of the canopy or left untouched. After 45 months, the cover of C. cylindracea was greatest in small canopy-removal plots, without, however, achieving values exceeding ~10%. Nonetheless, such a low abundance of C. cylindracea caused a threefold reduction in canopy recovery. The establishment of C. cylindracea in canopy-removal plots did not alter the structure of the understory assemblages or the cover of turf-forming, erect and encrusting algae and sessile invertebrates. Our results suggest that some non-native species may be stronger competitors than natives, despite their low abundance. This property has important implications for control programs since not achieving the total eradication of the targeted invader would make little progress towards the mitigation of its impacts. Finally, our results show that non-native species acting as passengers of change can ultimately promote the persistence of alternative degraded states. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Caulerpa cylindracea; Disturbance; Macroalgal canopy; Mediterranean; Resilience; Seaweeds","abundance; algal community; biological invasion; ecological impact; ecosystem resilience; environmental disturbance; hypothesis testing; introduced species; macroalga; Mediterranean environment; persistence; seaweed; understory; algae; Caulerpa cylindracea; Cystoseira brachycarpa; Invertebrata",2-s2.0-85018845970

This expansion of urban land-covered areas is known to significantly reduce different components of biodiversity. However, the global evidence for this effect is mainly focused on a single diversity measure (species richness) with a few local or regional studies also supporting reductions in functional diversity. We have used birds, an important ecological group that has been used as surrogate for other animals, to investigate the hypothesis that urbanization reduces the global taxonomical and/or evolutionary diversity. We have also explored whether there is evidence supporting that urban bird communities are evolutionarily homogenized worldwide in comparison with nonurban ones by means of using evolutionary distinctiveness (how unique are the species) of bird communities. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify the effect of urbanization in more than one single diversity measure as well as the first time to look for associations between urbanization and phylogenetic diversity at a large spatial scale. Our findings show a strong and globally consistent reduction in taxonomic diversity in urban areas, which is also synchronized with the evolutionary homogenization of urban bird communities. Despite our general patterns, we found some regional differences in the intensity of the effect of cities on bird species richness or evolutionary distinctiveness, suggesting that conservation efforts should be adapted locally. Our findings might be useful for conservationists and policymakers to minimize the impact of urban development on Earth's biodiversity and help design more realistic conservation strategies. © 2016 The Authors.

Understanding a species’ ability to respond appropriately to novel threats may inform in situ management options for threatened island populations. In the presence of nest predators, physical characteristics of the nest site can influence the likelihood that eggs or chicks are lost to predation. Some birds that evolved under high nest predation pressure show predictable changes in nest-site selection following nest predation, but the ability of naïve island birds to alter nest-site decisions based on experience with novel nest predators has not been well studied. We examined nest-site choices of re-nesting Chatham Island black robins Petroica traversi following nest predation by invasive European starlings Sturnus vulgaris. Robins whose first nests were depredated re-nested in a new location that was significantly lower to the ground than pairs whose first nests were lost through other causes. As predation risk increases with nest height, the lower placement of re-nests is consistent with a movement towards safer nest sites. The cause of nest failure did not influence the choice of substrate for a replacement nest, nor did individual pairs re-nest further away from depredated nests. Changes in nest-site selection did not carry over into subsequent nesting seasons. Our results suggest that some evolutionarily naïve species may be capable of assessing immediate risk through individual experience with novel predators, and modifying their nest-site decisions accordingly. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London","invasive species; learning; nest predation; nest-site selection; Petroica traversi; predation risk; prey naivety; Sturnus vulgaris","endangered species; invasive species; nest predation; nest site; passerine; predation risk; predator; site selection; species conservation; Aves; Petroica traversi; Sturnus vulgaris",2-s2.0-85006001876

We evaluated the effect of climate and non-climate variables and the sensitivity to various spatial resolutions (i.e. 1 and 20 km) on niche changes during the invasion of Taraxacum officinale and Ulex europaeus in South America. We estimated niche changes using a combination of principal components analyses (PCA) and reciprocal Ecological Niche Modelling (rENM). We further investigated future invasion dynamics under a severe warming scenario for 2050 to unravel the role of niche shifts in the future potential distribution of the species. We observed a clear niche expansion for both species in South America towards higher temperature, precipitation and radiation relative to their native ranges. In contrast, the set of environmental conditions only occupied in the native ranges (i.e. niche unfilling) were less relevant. The magnitude of the niche shifts did not depend on the resolution of the variables. Models calibrated with occurrences from native range predicted large suitable areas in South America (outside of the Andes range) where T. officinale and U. europaeus are currently absent. Additionally, both species could increase their potential distributions by 2050, mostly in the southern part of the continent. In addition, the niche unfilling suggests high potential to invade additional regions in the future, which is extremely relevant considering the current impact of these species in the Southern Hemisphere. These findings confirm that invasive species can occupy new niches that are not predictable from knowledge based only on climate variables or information from the native range. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia","biological invasion; ecological niche models; Niche shift; Taraxacum officinale; Ulex europaeus","biological invasion; ecological modeling; environmental conditions; geographical distribution; herb; invasive species; legume; mountain region; niche breadth; range expansion; Southern Hemisphere; spatial resolution; Andes; Taraxacum officinale; Ulex europaeus",2-s2.0-85006515642

Recently, scientists have debated whether species richness on local and regional scales is mostly declining, but long-term changes in phylogenetic richness and divergence were largely disregarded. Space-for-time approaches revealed that plant phylogenetic divergence is lower in urban than in non-urban areas. However, such approaches cannot fully disentangle the relative importance of the biotic processes that drive temporal changes in diversity. Using a unique European urban flora covering 320 years in seven time steps, combined with a comprehensive plant phylogeny, we examined (i) how species richness changed with urbanization over time; (ii) whether trends in phylogenetic richness and divergence parallel trends in species richness; and (iii) whether species extirpation or immigration is driving these changes. We found that over time urban species richness increased, but phylogenetic richness and divergence decreased. Extirpations of phylogenetically distinct native species and immigrations of phylogenetically common native and non-native species caused a non-random loss of phylogenetic diversity. Our analyses suggest that if future extirpations and immigrations continue to follow the patterns observed over history, this loss will continue. Synthesis and applications. Measures to protect phylogenetic diversity should combine the protection of threatened habitats and their species with the maintenance of habitats that mitigate heat and safeguard evolutionary history.

The Cape Fold aquatic ecoregion (CFR) of South Africa supports an assemblage of range-restricted endemic freshwater fishes, the majority of which are conservation priorities because they are under severe threat of extinction. Effective conservation and management are constrained by the lack of readily available information on this imperilled group of fishes because research efforts over the last century have been temporally disjointed and relatively uncoordinated. This review provides an exhaustive appraisal of published literature on the taxonomy, biogeography, life history, ecology and physiology of freshwater fishes in the CFR, and the human impacts that affect them. Its aim is to direct future research needs for effective management and conservation of this imperilled group. Only 103 peer-reviewed articles on CFR fishes were recorded and the majority of available research is on taxonomy and biogeography (40.8%), followed by ecological investigations (22.3%), conservation (19.4%) and human impacts (17.5%). Despite a plethora of studies on taxonomy and biogeography, recent genetic evidence suggests that fish diversity in the CFR has been severely underestimated and requires urgent attention. Human impacts severely threaten the existence of many native CFR fishes and require further study. Information on the biology and ecology of CFR fishes is limited to studies on selected species; of particular note is the lack of physiological information which is particularly pertinent given projected climate change scenarios.

On the other hand, it can be a valuable resource with several unique properties. Water hyacinth contains more than 95% water but due to its fibrous tissue and a high energy and protein content, it can be used for a variety of useful applications. In order to achieve theoretical basis for large-scale treatment and disposal project that have overall solution of low cost and high efficiency with water hyacinth, a comparative study of different engineering pretreatment before dehydration and analysis of the processing cost were studied as the test platform of pilot demonstration project of water hyacinth. In this paper, the process of instant smash instant dehydration was used, and two kinds of water hyacinth salvage and water transportation (the water hyacinth loaded directly into the cabin, and the water hyacinth after coarse crushing for salvage ship loaded into 1 m3 nylon bags and transported to the shore by ship), two modes of shore transfer (tower crane airlines and shore based crane) and three methods of crushing (coarse crushing of salvage ship, smash again by turning the machine two times, and smash again after coarse grinding on salvage ship)were designed and experimented in this study. The results showed that the pretreatment method of two times after the salvage of coarse powder was helpful to reduce the energy consumption of processing dehydration of water hyacinth. The treatment of per tons for water hyacinth needed about 2.5 kW·h. Through analysis of energy consumption of different crushing methods, the results showed that the method of two times after the salvage of coarse powder reduced the transportation cost, along with the need for shore crushing. It improved the grinding and dehydration treatment ability, reduced operation cost and the volume by 70.61%, and increased the transport capacity by 3.4 times for the method of salvage ship coarse powder. After the separation of water hyacinth, the content of N and P were the main nutrients in the extrusion residue, while the K value was the main factor in the extrusion juice. With the increase of the degree of grinding for water hyacinth, the N, P, K nutrient in the extrusion residue was gradually transferred to the juice. The solid-liquid separation effect of water hyacinth after anaerobic fermentation was better than that of water hyacinth direct solid-liquid separation in terms of residue water content reduction and nutrient recovery, and the moisture content of the dewatering residue was reduce to 62.89%, and it was only about 0.06 hours and about 0.7 kW·h after dehydration of per tons with water hyacinth.

However, if host demography is density-independent, equilibrium coexistence is impossible. If at least one of the 1 host–parasitoid systems has an oscillatory dynamics (which happens under some parameter values), we found, through numerical bifurcation, that coexistence is favoured.

Total content of FAA in A. tonsa nauplii was around 17% of dry weight at first development stage, and declined to 6% for later stages. Relative to body-volume and biomass, the FAA content indicated possible volume-dependent changes. However, changes in FAA with osmolytic activity could not account for this decline in FAA content, but suggests that the decline reflected degradation of residual FAAs from the embryonic stage. Glutamic acid revealed the largest change in relative abundance during naupliar development and declined from 29.0% at first nauplius stage to 7.1% at later stages. The high FAA pool in early naupliar stages may be necessary for naupliar development due to an absence of feeding at first development stages. The high FAA content in early nauplii indicates that A. tonsa is a valuable source for nutritional energy for first-feeding fish larvae and should be further exploited for aquaculture purposes. Enhancements to FAA abundances in nauplii through manipulation of maternal diets could be of future interest, as copepod nauplii can contain a substantial pool of FAAs at first development stage. © 2017","Acartia tonsa; Body volume; Calanoid nauplii; Free amino acids; Glutamic acid; Live feed","amino acid; glutamic acid; methionine; valine; amino acid; Acartia tonsa; aquaculture; Article; biochemical composition; biomass; developmental stage; feeding; maternal nutrition; nauplius (larva); nonhuman; protein content; protein degradation; animal; copepod; Cryptophyta; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; Amino Acids; Animals; Copepoda; Cryptophyta",2-s2.0-85019055216

In this paper, we design a movement-based incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing, where participants are stimulated to move to the unpopular areas and complete the sensing tasks in these areas, which benefits both participants and the platform. We formulate a task allocation problem considering controlled mobility. Since the task allocation problem is NP-hard, we propose a greedy algorithm to solve it and design a critical payment policy to guarantee that participants declare their cost truthfully.

Going deeply, in the case of the athletes, we tested the effect of their personal racket, i.e., the one they regularly use during their sport activities, compared to a common one. When handling one of these objects or nothing, participants were requested to verbally respond to a tactile stimulus administered at the right wrist while hearing a task-irrelevant sound emitted by a speaker positioned either near to the hand (Near) or far from it (Far). Reaction time to a tactile stimulus associated with the Far sound were higher than those associated with the Near sound when tennis players and novices held the common racket, whereas this difference disappeared when the athletes handled the personal tennis racket.

A previous study showed that L. serricorne adults are attracted more to ultraviolet (UV) and blue light wave ranges more than others such as turquoise, green, yellow, red, and warm white. However, the previous study did not equalize the amounts of light. The study also evaluated the attractiveness by the numbers of L. serricorne individuals that were lured to LED lights in a small box in the laboratory. In some storehouses, damage by S. paniceum is more serious and establishment of an effective monitoring tool is required. Therefore, in the present study, attractions of these beetles to UV and blue light traps were compared to develop a tool to monitor the beetle pests. First, adult L. serricorne and S. paniceum beetles were provided with UV-A nd blue-LED panels whose light intensities were equalized in the laboratory, and the walking and flying paths of each adult were recorded and measured. As a result, adults were clearly attracted to the side of UV-LED panel by walking compared to the blue one. Second, we compared the numbers of cigarette beetles collected by sticky sheets that were set in the back of UV or blue-light LED traps in a real storehouse. The results showed that these beetles were significantly more attracted to UV than blue-light LED traps, indicating the UV-LED trap is a powerful tool to monitor these two pest species. © 2017 The Authors.","Cigarette beetle; drugstore beetle; LED; light trap; orientation behavior","animal; beetle; female; male; phototaxis; physiology; radiation response; ultraviolet radiation; Animals; Beetles; Female; Male; Phototaxis; Ultraviolet Rays",2-s2.0-85026917214

The parameters of SVM were tuned by using MPGA. Comparing previous reports of THz-TDS for GM crops detection, we used a larger sample size and more evaluation criterions (i.e. confusion matrix, average accuracy and 95th percentile of accuracy) in the experiment. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to reduce dimensions of THz absorbance spectra, and then used the result of PCA as the input of different classifiers. When the input dimensionality of MPGA-SVM was 12, recall, precision and F-score were more than 97.9%, 96% and 0.9796, respectively, and accuracy was 99%. To further study the performance of MPGA-SVM with different input dimensionality, different number of principal components (ranged from 2 to 16 at intervals of 2) was selected. In addition, the proposed method was compared with traditional classifiers (decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and discriminant analysis (DA)). All the results showed that MPGA-SVM has better performance than other classifier.

In addition, the population density of T. sibiricus was lower than those of other rodent species, and it has been reported that T. sibiricus is omnivorous and preys upon snails considerably less than on other food sources.

This species has become naturalized in many zones of Chile and southern Argentina, and may potentially invade other regions and countries in South America. These naturalized populations of B. terrestris have been associated with rapid population declines of the native bee B. dahlbomii Guérin-Méneville. We report new records of the exotic bee B. terrestris in the Region de Arica y Parinacota in the far north of Chile, which includes portions of the Atacama Desert. We used species distribution models (SDMs) and multivariate analyses to evaluate whether these occurrences represent new escapes from managed colonies or natural dispersal of the species from its southern invaded range. These reports of B. terrestris indicate a northward expansion of this bee. In our analyses, these new areas of occurrences have environmental conditions similar to those observed in the species’ southern invaded range, and our SDMs predict that B. terrestris dispersal through the Atacama is possible, although not likely given the occasional flower blooming in that region of Chile. These new occurrences in northern Chile reflect a potential for future invasion into other regions of South America by B. terrestris.

Despite numerous studies on the occurrence and chemical structure of steroidal saponins, their biosynthetic pathway in Allium species is poorly understood. The monosomic addition lines (MALs) of the Japanese bunching onion (A. fistulosum, FF) with an extra chromosome from the shallot (A. cepa Aggregatum group, AA) are powerful genetic resources that enable us to understand many physiological traits of Allium. In the present study, we were able to isolate and identify Alliospiroside A saponin compound in A. fistulosum with extra chromosome 2A from shallot (FF2A) and its role in the defense mechanism against Fusarium pathogens. Furthermore, to gain molecular insight into the Allium saponin biosynthesis pathway, high-throughput RNA-Seq of the root, bulb, and leaf of AA, MALs, and FF was carried out using Illumina’s HiSeq 2500 platform. An open access Allium Transcript Database (Allium TDB, http://alliumtdb.kazusa.or.jp) was generated based on RNA-Seq data. The resulting assembled transcripts were functionally annotated, revealing 50 unigenes involved in saponin biosynthesis. Differential gene expression (DGE) analyses of AA and MALs as compared with FF (as a control) revealed a strong up-regulation of the saponin downstream pathway, including cytochrome P450, glycosyltransferase, and beta-glucosidase in chromosome 2A. An understanding of the saponin compounds and biosynthesis-related genes would facilitate the development of plants with unique saponin content and, subsequently, improved disease resistance. © 2017 Abdelrahman et al.

Because invasive species may also use these waters, dispersing into previously inaccessible areas, the costs and benefits of artificial waters must be gauged and potential invasion- and climate change-management strategies assayed. Objectives: We present a network analysis framework to identify waters that likely contribute to the spread of invasive species. Methods: Using the Sonoran Desert waters network and the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus)—a known predator, competitor, and carrier of pathogens deadly to other amphibians—as an example, we quantified the structural connectivity of the network to predict regional invasion potential under current and two future scenarios (climate change and management reduction) to identify waters to manage and monitor for invasive species. Results: We identified important and vulnerable waters based on connectivity metrics under scenarios representing current conditions, projected climate-limited conditions, and conditions based on removal of artificial waters. We identified 122,607 km2 of land that could be used as a buffer against invasion and 67,745 km2 of land that could be augmented by artificial water placement without facilitating invasive species spread.

The study of highly specialized mutualistic interactions is crucial to predict the consequences of population declines and extinctions. Islands offer unique opportunities to study highly specialized interactions, as they often have naturally depauperated faunas and are experiencing high rates of human-driven extinctions. In this study, we assess the effect of seed dispersal on seedling recruitment of Ephedra fragilis (Ephedraceae) on a Mediterranean island ecosystem. We used field data and stochastic simulation modeling to estimate seed fate and recruitment patterns of this pioneer shrub typical of arid and semiarid areas, and to estimate the dependence of recruitment on the lizard Podarcis lilfordi (Lacertidae), its only known seed disperser. Ephedra fragilis recruitment highly depended on lizards: lizards produced 3.8 times more newly-emerged seedlings than non-dispersed seeds and no seedlings from undispersed seeds survived the study period. Seed dispersal by lizards was mostly to open sites, which was key for the increased success observed, while undispersed seeds, falling under mother plants, suffered higher predation and lower seedling emergence and survival. The ability of this pioneer shrub to get established in open ground is crucial for vegetation colonization and restoration, especially on degraded lands affected by desertification, where they act as nurse plants for other species. Lizards are key in this process, which has important consequences for community structure and ecosystem functioning. © 2017 Neghme et al.

Metabolic experiments conducted at 25 and 29 °C showed that G. holbrooki had at least four times the capacity for metabolic depression during hypoxia than N. australis. An increase in environmental temperature from 25 to 29 °C had no significant impact on the critical oxygen tension, Pcrit, of G. holbrooki, but significantly and strongly increased Pcrit of N. australis. Gambusia holbrooki also had a lower Q10 of standard metabolic rate than N. australis. Our results indicate that G. holbrooki have physiological traits conferring greater resistance to hypoxia than N. australis, and as temperature increases, the resistance of N. australis to hypoxia was more eroded than that of G. holbrooki. Intensive monitoring of the temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics of wetlands showed that contemporary heat waves are already causing conditions that might give G. holbrooki the edge over N. australis on Australian floodplains.

In this study, we decoded the waggle dances of Apis mellifera pollen foragers and used DNA barcoding of bee-collected pollen over 17 months to characterize spatio-temporal patterns in recruitment behavior and dietary breadth in a diverse yet fragmented Mediterranean scrub environment. Foragers danced for small, nearby patches of pollen resources during the cool dormant season but danced for 1.6–2.7-fold more distant and more widely dispersed resources during the hot dry season, a time of seasonal drought and floral dearth. Individual foragers collected pollen from a wide variety of species, but colonies focused recruitment on a small subset of common species in flower during each season: 2.7, 6.3, and 10% of all species in bloom during the dormant, growth, and dry seasons, respectively. Pollen foragers danced almost exclusively for cold-adapted native species during the dormant season, equally for native and non-native plants during the short growth season, and primarily for non-native ornamental species during the dry season. Our results suggest that honey bee recruitment behavior and dietary breadth may be influenced by seasonal changes in pollen resources. Furthermore, they indicate that honey bees may be useful in pollinating common native plants, and that non-native ornamental species can provide a major source of colony protein during a seasonal dearth of flowering native species. © 2017, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).","DNA barcoding; Foraging; Pollen; Seasonal","abundance; drought; dry season; flowering; foraging efficiency; genetic analysis; growth; honeybee; introduced species; Mediterranean environment; native species; ornamental species; pollen; pollination; scrub; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; wild population; Apis mellifera; Apoidea",2-s2.0-85018309236

D. villosus selected the lower salinity, whereas P. robustoides did not discriminate between salinities, suggesting that, the raised ionic content in large European rivers cannot explain their absence in small tributaries, as previously postulated. Gammarids never preferred flowing over stagnant water, but could stay in a flow ≤10 cm/s without behavioural changes. They avoided flow ≥15 cm/s. Gammarids selected warmer water than their acclimation temperatures. Temperature selection by D. villosus was related to its acclimation temperature. The choice of P. robustoides depended on the season: it preferred a lower temperature in summer than in autumn. Therefore, its thermal preferences were more stable throughout the year, which might be advantageous in shallow, thermally variable areas.

For instance, metal atom uptake affects the gas-phase chemistry of the Earth's mesosphere, and has been proposed to influence the agglomeration of matter into planets in protoplanetary disks. In this study the fate of Mg and K atoms incorporated into water-ice films, prepared under ultra-high vacuum conditions at temperatures of 110–140 K, was investigated. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments reveal that Mg- and K-containing species do not co-desorb when the ice sublimates, demonstrating that uptake on ice particles causes irreversible removal of the metals from the gas phase. This implies that uptake on ice particles in terrestrial polar mesospheric clouds accelerates the formation of large meteoric smoke particles (≥1 nm radius above 80 km) following sublimation of the ice. Energetic sputtering of metal-dosed ice layers by 500 eV Ar+ and Kr+ ions shows that whereas K reacts on (or within) the ice surface to form KOH, adsorbed Mg atoms are chemically inert. These experimental results are consistent with electronic structure calculations of the metals bound to an ice surface, where theoretical adsorption energies on ice are calculated to be −68 kJ mol−1 for K, −91 kJ mol−1 for Mg, and −306 kJ mol−1 for Fe.

The corollary of the emphasis on maintaining connectivity to enhance the movement of organisms is that disrupting connectivity should minimise it. Here, we evaluate the efficiency of an invasive species control strategy that targets the most connected habitats in a landscape. A network (spatial graph) provides an intuitive representation of a landscape, and the topology of this network can be used to identify the most connected patches. We implemented a simulation model of the spread of an invasive species on a network and used it to evaluate whether targeting the better-connected components of the landscape enhances control effectiveness. Control strategies based on network topology consistently outperformed both a null strategy of random habitat selection and one based on separation distance alone. The advantages of the connectivity-based strategy were strongest in the early phases of the invasion process, when a small number of habitats are occupied at low population density. However, if long-distance dispersal events were common, the advantages of the connectivity approach weakened. The performance of the connectivity-based strategy is robust to habitat-level demographic stochasticity. In fact, connectivity-based targeting outperforms a strategy focussing on source habitats, with the additional benefit that it requires less information to be implemented. Synthesis and applications. Our simulation model outcomes demonstrate that deliberately targeting the best-connected components of a landscape is an efficient control strategy for invasive species when long-distance dispersal is infrequent, and it is likely to be cheaper than other alternatives such as targeting population sources. Network scientists have developed a range of methods designed to identify the minimal set of nodes on a graph that will disrupt the network as a whole; these tools have potential to aid in the design of more effective control strategies. © 2016 The Authors.

Conservation of riparian vegetation requires knowledge on limiting factors in the biology of species preventing its spread along suitable areas. It needs to be assessed if an endangered species is trapped in an extinction vortex or whether it can recover from its current bottleneck situation by management measurements. We investigate the recovery potential of an endangered riparian shrub species of European rivers, the German tamarisk, Myricaria germanica, by combining field and lab experiments on seed production, germination and wind dispersal with a modelling approach on species distribution. While the seed potential is high, wind-mediated dispersal is average, with a majority of seeds falling next to the mother shrub. The modelled dispersal kernel shows highest goodness-of-fit with a polynomic function. Including this kernel in a model on the future distribution of the species based on identification of suitable habitat, limited spread to new areas in Switzerland after 20 and 50 dispersal events is predicted. Given the current limited distribution of the German tamarisk in Switzerland, conservation efforts are required to allow for the formation of new riparian habitat. Additionally, connectivity along river networks has to be enhanced to help the species to escape the extinction vortex it is trapped in. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Colonization; Dispersal kernel; Floodplain; Myricaria germanica; Riparia; Species distribution model (SDM)","anthropogenic effect; colonization; conservation status; dispersal; ecological modeling; endangered species; extinction; floodplain; germination; habitat restoration; limiting factor; plant community; riparian vegetation; river basin; seed production; shrub; Switzerland; Myricaria germanica; Tamaricaceae",2-s2.0-85017147304

Human-induced biological invasions have become important sources of environmental modifications. However, the extent to which invasive species affect the phenotypic syndromes of individuals in a native is currently unknown. Such knowledge has important implications for understanding ecological interactions and the management of biological invasions. Here, field monitoring in a natural stream were combined with standardized estimates of behavioral, physiological and morphological traits to address the hypothesis that coexistence with a non-native invader induces a novel environmental pressure that disrupts the adaptive integration among phenotypic traits of the native species. We compared the strength of integration among key phenotypic traits (i.e. aerobic scope, standard metabolic rate, body growth, activity, and body shape) and ecological niche traits (i.e. spring and summer diet, home range size, daily movements) of an allopatric group of native brown trout (Salmo trutta) with a group of brown trout living in sympatry with non-native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). We found that the integration of phenotypic traits was substantially reduced in the sympatric brown trout and that allopatric and sympatric brown trout differed in key phenotypic and ecological niche traits. Brown trout living in sympatry with non-native brook trout consumed more terrestrial prey, had smaller home ranges, and a stouter body shape. Sympatric brown trout also had lower specific growth rate, suggesting a lower fitness. The results are generally in line with our hypothesis suggesting that the reduction in fitness observed in sympatric brown trout is caused by the breakdown of their adaptive phenotypic syndrome. This may be caused by differences in the plasticity of the response of phenotypic traits to the novel selection pressure induced by the non-native species. Our results may help explaining deleterious effects of non-native species reported in the absence of direct competition with the native species.

Earlier studies have suggested that this pattern arises due to natural selection favouring generally or locally successful genotypes in new environments. Alternatively, as we show here, this pattern may result from neutral processes during species’ range expansions. We model a dioecious species expanding into a new area in which all individuals are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, and all individuals have equal survival rates and dispersal distances. Even under conditions that favour sexual recruitment in the long run, colonization starts with an asexual wave. After colonization is completed, a sexual wave erodes clonal dominance. If individuals reproduce more than one season, and with only local dispersal, a few large clones typically dominate for thousands of reproductive seasons. Adding occasional long-distance dispersal, more dominant clones emerge, but they persist for a shorter period of time. The general mechanism involved is simple: edge effects at the expansion front favour asexual (uniparental) recruitment where potential mates are rare. Specifically, our model shows that neutral processes (with respect to genotype fitness) during the population expansion, such as random dispersal and demographic stochasticity, produce genotype patterns that differ from the patterns arising in a selection model. The comparison with empirical data from a post-glacially established seaweed species (Fucus radicans) shows that in this case, a neutral mechanism is strongly supported. © 2017 The Authors.

African grasses are aggressive invasive species in Neotropical savannas, where their response to abiotic stress remains unknown. We assessed the role of waterlogging and canopy closure on the presence, abundance and reproductive tillering of African and native grasses in a Neotropical savanna in southeastern Brazil. We obtained abundance and reproductive tillering data of exotic (Melinis minutiflora, Melinis repens and Urochloa decumbens) and common native grasses in 20 sites. We also determined the groundwater depth, soil surface water potential and canopy cover at these sites. The grass species generally had a low frequency and performed poorly where soil remained waterlogged throughout the year, except for two native species. Most native species were exclusive to either well-drained savannas or better drained wet grasslands. However, two species (Loudetiopsis chrysothrix and Trachypogon spicatus) occurred in both vegetation types. Two exotic species (M. minutiflora and M. repens) were less common but demonstrated reasonable performance in wet grasslands, possibly due to their root system plasticity. Furthermore, U. decumbens had a lower occurrence, density and reproductive tillering at these sites, but was successful at sites where the groundwater level was slightly deeper. Although the favourable water regime in the savannas increases their invasibility in general, resistance to invasion by African grasses may be greater at microsites with high canopy closure, where these species showed lower performance and did not affect the abundance of co-occurring native grasses. In summary, the Brazilian savanna becomes more susceptible to the spread of African grasses when disturbances decrease canopy closure or lower rainfall associated with climate change reduces the average groundwater depth and consequently releases invasive species from soil waterlogging in grasslands. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia","canopy closure; climate changes; groundwater; invasive species; waterlogging","biological invasion; climate change; coexistence; generalist; global change; grass; invasive species; native species; Neotropical Region; root system; savanna; soil surface; waterlogging; Brazil; Loudetiopsis chrysothrix; Melinis minutiflora; Melinis repens; Poaceae; Trachypogon spicatus; Urochloa decumbens",2-s2.0-85006106077

These patterns can be explained by complex interactions between a highly heterogeneous historical biogeography and ecological processes related to diverse island conditions. Furthermore, most of the ups and downs of this biodiversity were closely linked with human pressures which have changed many times through the long socio-ecological history of these island landscapes since the Neolithic period. At present, insular plant biodiversity and rural landscapes are threatened by diverse global environmental changes related to urbanization, habitat fragmentation, unsustainable tourism and other practices (e.g. overgrazing, forest fires), and by other more recent drivers such as climate warming and aridification, sea-level rise and biological invasions. Some of these impacts will be exacerbated on islands because of no (or highly limited) adjacent areas of expansion, notably on the smallest ones (i.e. size < ca. 1000 ha). With regards to the biome crisis facing the Mediterranean basin and induced by human activities, islands constitute key ecological systems and ‘current refugia’ to ensure the long-term preservation of coastal plant biodiversity. They also represent fascinating ecological systems to disentangle the role of environmental versus human pressures on spatially simplified communities of the Mediterranean coastal areas. Future detailed studies of these ‘natural island microcosms’ could greatly improve our knowledge of the functional and evolutionary processes induced by rapid environmental changes in this region. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Coastal ecosystems; Human impacts; Insular biogeography; Land use changes; Mediterranean region; Sea-level rise",,2-s2.0-85015868606

A growing evidence base exists for the ecological value of introducing non-native species, yet urban policy and practice guidance continues to portray non-native species negatively, focusing on their assumed invasiveness. In this context there is a lack of research focusing on the cultural relevance of non-native species in the urban landscape. To address this gap we surveyed 1411 members of the UK public who walked through designed and semi-natural planting of three levels of visual nativeness: “strongly native”; “intermediate” and “strongly non-native”, whilst completing a site-based questionnaire. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were then carried out with 34 questionnaire participants. A majority (57.6%) of our respondents would be happy to see more non-native planting in UK public spaces, rising to 75.3% if it were better adapted to a changing climate than existing vegetation. Respondents recognised the three broad levels of nativeness, yet this was not a factor driving perceptions of the attractiveness of the planting. In addition to climate change, we identified four key factors driving acceptance and rejection of non-native planting: aesthetics; locational context; historic factors and inevitability; and perceptions of invasiveness and incompatability with native wildlife. Our research indicates that in the context of a changing climate, focus should be placed on the potentially positive role of non-invasive, climate-adapted, aesthetically pleasing species within urban planting schemes as these could be well-received by the public. © 2017 The Authors","Aesthetic; Climate change; Cultural relevance; Non-native; Public perception; Species; Urban planting design","Plants (botany); Surveys; Aesthetic; Cultural relevance; Non-native; Public perception; Species; Climate change; climate change; cultural influence; esthetics; greenspace; introduced species; invasiveness; landscape ecology; perception; public space; sustainability; tree planting; urban design; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85018491902

The use of pedigree assignments, aided by likelihood-based software, has become popular to estimate dispersal rate and distance. However, the partial sampling of populations may produce false assignments. Further, it is unknown how the accuracy of assignment is affected by the genealogical relationships of individuals and is reflected by software-derived assignment probabilities. Inspired by a project managing invasive American mink (Neovison vison), we estimated individual dispersal distances using inferred pairwise relationships of culled individuals. Additionally, we simulated scenarios to investigate the accuracy of pairwise inferences. Estimates of dispersal distance varied greatly when derived from different inferred pairwise relationships, with mother–offspring relationship being the shortest (average = 21 km) and the most accurate. Pairs assigned as maternal half-siblings were inaccurate, with 64%–97% falsely assigned, implying that estimates for these relationships in the wild population were unreliable. The false assignment rate was unrelated to the software-derived assignment probabilities at high dispersal rates. Assignments were more accurate when the inferred parents were older and immigrants and when dispersal rates between subpopulations were low (1% and 2%). Using 30 instead of 15 loci increased pairwise reliability, but half-sibling assignments were still inaccurate (>59% falsely assigned). The most reliable approach when using inferred pairwise relationships in polygamous species would be not to use half-sibling relationship types. Our simulation approach provides guidance for the application of pedigree inferences under partial sampling and is applicable to other systems where pedigree assignments are used for ecological inference. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","dispersal distance; genetic markers; pedigree inference; polygamous species; simulations",,2-s2.0-85019915530

Despite surveys in multiple large rivers and floodplain habitats, we only documented bullfrogs in a geothermal pond and 5 km of stream channel immediately downstream of this pond. In these waters, bullfrogs overlapped with native amphibians at the downstream end of their distribution, and we did not document native amphibians in bullfrog stomach contents. Larger bullfrogs (SVL ≥ 96 mm) primarily consumed native rodents (especially meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus), while smaller bullfrogs frequently consumed native invertebrates and less frequently consumed non-native invertebrates and fish. Taken together, these data indicate that the distribution and implications of the bullfrog invasion in Grand Teton National Park are currently localized to a small area, so these bullfrogs should therefore be vulnerable to eradication.","diet; invasion; Lithobates catesbeianus; occurrence; survey","Amphibia; Invertebrata; Lithobates; Microtus; Microtus pennsylvanicus; Rana catesbeiana; Rodentia",2-s2.0-85028462733

The net contribution of seed dispersers to plant establishment is known as seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) and is defined as the product of a quantitative (number of seeds dispersed) and a qualitative (probability of recruitment) component. In Galápagos, we studied the direct contribution to SDE (number of seeds dispersed and effect on seedling emergence) provided by the five island groups of frugivores (giant tortoises, lizards, medium-sized passerine birds, small non-finch passerine birds, and finches) in the two main habitats in this archipelago: the lowland and the highland zones, and found 16 vertebrate species dispersing 58 plant species. Data on frequency of occurrence of seeds in droppings and number of seeds dispersed per unit area produced contrasting patterns of seed dispersal. Based on the former, giant tortoises and medium-sized passerines were the most important seed dispersers. However, based on the latter, small non-finch passerines were the most important dispersers, followed by finches and medium-sized passerines. The effect of disperser gut passage on seedling emergence varied greatly depending on both the disperser and the plant species. Although the contribution to SDE provided by different disperser guilds changed across plant species, medium-sized passerines (e.g., mockingbirds) provided a higher contribution to SDE than lava lizards in 10 out of 16 plant species analysed, whereas lava lizards provided a higher contribution to SDE than birds in five plant species. While both the quantitative and qualitative components addressed are important, our data suggests that the former is a better predictor of SDE in the Galápagos archipelago. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","animal–plant interaction; frugivory; island ecology; ornithochory; saurochory; seedling emergence","amphibian; frugivory; interspecific interaction; life cycle; passerine; seed dispersal; seedling emergence; vertebrate; Ecuador; Galapagos Islands; Aves; Fringillidae; Passeriformes; Squamata; Testudinidae; Vertebrata",2-s2.0-85019991383

Pieris brassicae is a specialist herbivore of plants containing glucosinolates, a specific class of defensive secondary metabolites. Caterpillars of P. brassicae are known to actively spit on attacking natural enemies, including their main parasitoid, the braconid wasp Cotesia glomerata. Here, we tested the hypothesis that variation in the secondary metabolites of host plants affects the efficacy of caterpillar regurgitant as an anti-predator defense. Using a total of 10 host plants with different glucosinolate profiles, we first studied natural regurgitation events of caterpillars on parasitoids. We then studied manual applications of water or regurgitant on parasitoids during parasitization events. Results from natural regurgitation events revealed that parasitoids spent more time grooming after attack when foraging on radish and nasturtium than on Brassica spp., and when the regurgitant came in contact with the wings rather than any other body part. Results from manual applications of regurgitant showed that all parameters of parasitoid behavior (initial attack duration, attack interruption, grooming time, and likelihood of a second attack) were more affected when regurgitant was applied rather than water. The proportion of parasitoids re-attacking a caterpillar within 15 min was the lowest when regurgitant originated from radish-fed caterpillars. However, we found no correlation between glucosinolate content and regurgitant effects, and parasitoid behavior was equally affected when regurgitant originated from a glucosinolate-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutant line. In conclusion, host plant affects to a certain extent the efficacy of spit from P. brassicae caterpillars as a defense against parasitoids, but this is not due to glucosinolate content. The nature of the defensive compounds present in the spit remains to be determined, and the ecological relevance of this anti-predator defense needs to be further evaluated in the field. © 2017 The Authors.

Furthermore, among all tested concentrations of monosodium glutamate (MSG; 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10%), the highest number of ants were attracted by 1% MSG with 20% sucrose. The consumption of each bait solution was also measured, and the results were similar to those for ant number.

Their ecological functioning and potential to enhance biodiversity locally was assessed by comparing their macro-invertebrate community composition with nearby non-restored sites. Rehabilitation led to lower hydraulic impact on the littoral zone, which in turn led to the presence of otherwise missing macrophytes and the occurrence of organic mud habitats colonized by invertebrates typically rare in urban waterways. While the control sites were dominated by few, mostly invasive taxa in vast numbers, the rehabilitated sites exhibited a highly diverse community with 22 protected mollusc and insect taxa typically found in the oxbow communities of natural rivers. This major improvement was however not detected using the core metrics of the legally required national assessment tools of the EU Water Framework Directive. Overall results proved the success of this type of rehabilitation measure with respect to improving biodiversity, but they also showed the limiting and key factors influencing the macro-invertebrate communities of highly deteriorated urban waterways.

Australian and New Zealand S. spallanzanii show minimal genetic diversity (0.2% divergence) and were dominated by two main haplotypes suggesting a commonality. Our molecular data are insufficient by themselves to identify fine-scale invasion pathways in antipodean S. spallanzanii, but the similar, minimal haplotype diversity in combination with well-constrained field survey data suggests that the New Zealand incursion originated from southern Australia, rather than as a new incursion from the Mediterranean Sea. This highlights the importance of ongoing marine biosecurity surveillance and monitoring as well as improvements to biosecurity protocols for international and domestic vessels. The origin of the eastern Australian (Botany Bay) incursion is plausibly derived from either southern Australia or as a 'return' from New Zealand, and requires further, more detailed investigation. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2017.","Annelida; Australia; COI; invasive species; New Zealand; Polychaeta","annelid; enzyme; field survey; gene; genetic differentiation; invasive species; marine ecosystem; monitoring; native species; new record; pest species; phylogeography; polychaete; vessel; Australia; Botany Bay; Mediterranean Sea; New South Wales; New Zealand; Annelida; Polychaeta; Sabella spallanzanii",2-s2.0-85015844236

The traditional technique of meadow irrigation, formerly practised in large parts of Europe, may be a viable management option that meets both ecological and economical objectives. While studies on plant diversity of the meadow matrix exist, the role of other landscape components for biodiversity conservation is unknown. We quantify the role of irrigation and drainage ditches compared with field paths, and analysed the local and landscape plant species composition and diversity in a water-meadow landscape. The meadows are located in the river Queich catchment (Upper Rhine valley, Germany). We recorded plant species cover on 18 meadows, adjacent ditches and field paths and analysed alpha, beta and gamma diversity within and among these landscape components. Irrigation and drainage ditches were more species rich than meadows and more heterogeneous in their species composition compared with meadows and paths. Ditches contributed one-third of the landscape’s plant species numbers, habitat for wetland species and refuges for high nature value grassland species. Fertilization of the adjacent meadow had no negative impact on the ditch diversity, while well-maintained ditches were more plant species rich than ditches filled with sediments. Traditional flood meadow irrigation should be taken into account when sustainable grassland management techniques are discussed that meet economical and ecological needs. A major contribution to landscape richness arises from the ditch structures as crucial part of the traditional irrigation technique. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alpha diversity; Beta diversity; Ditch management; Edge structure; Grassland conservation; Landscape diversity; Traditional flood irrigation","biodiversity; catchment; conservation management; edge effect; grassland; habitat structure; irrigation; land management; landscape structure; meadow; species diversity; sustainable development; traditional agriculture; wetland; Germany; Rhine Valley; Upper Rhine Valley",2-s2.0-85021198930

In the current study, noble crayfish were fed in RAS with a commercial diet and relied on natural forage in an open pond system (OPS) for two months. Energy, lipid, and fatty acid (FA) content of available and alternative diets [Cyprinin K2 (CK2), Mytilus edulis Rafinesque, 1815, Elodea spp. Michx.) and crayfish tissue were determined. Crayfish from the pond system had significantly (P < 0.01 OPS versus all RAS treatments; Pairwise Wilcoxon) higher lipid content (8.51%) and more diverse FA composition than RAS crayfish. At least 15 partly combined FAs were present in crayfish whereas seven were provided by the diet CK2 and 10 by M. edulis and Elodea spp. In addition to the recommended lipid (<10%) and protein (>30%) proportions for commercial dietary formulation, analyses indicate that FA composition and amount play a key role in A. astacus growth, particularly in RAS. At least 15 measured FAs are required in an appropriate crayfish diet in sufficient amounts to achieve high growth rates while not losing energy and growth potential for FA synthesis. The FA profile of Elodea spp. and M. edulis indicate suitability as a feed or at least as a viable supplementary dietary component.","Astacus astacus; crayfish feed; fatty acid profile; lipid content; open pond system; recirculating aquaculture system",,2-s2.0-85028753907

In this study, the intra- and interspecies ITS genetic diversity of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Bursaphelenchus mucronatus was evaluated. Ninety-one isolates of the two nematode species collected from 14 Chinese provinces, Japan and Korea were used for ITS-PCR and sequencing. An unweighted pair group cluster analysis dendrogram clustered them as two B. mucronatus and one B. xylophilus independent clades. Principal component analysis showed the phylogenetic relationship of the two nematode species more clearly; B. mucronatus isolates were separated into more than four groups, whereas B. xylophilus isolates still clustered into a group. The results of the Mantel test indicated the correlation of genetic distance matrices and geographic distance matrices was significant for both nematode species. The genetic differentiation coefficient (Gst) and gene flow (Nm) of B. mucronatus were 0.341 and 1.091, respectively, suggesting the importance of landscape heterogeneity and considerable obstacles for genetic exchange among B. mucronatus isolates in China. However, Gst and Nm of B. xylophilus were 0.188 and 2.151, respectively, very different compared to B. mucronatus. This could be owing to the short-term introduction of B. xylophilus into China and a rapid spread through anthropogenic pathways.

In this study, we investigated the effects of food supplementation on Brandt’s vole population dynamics and plant community in eight large enclosures (0.48 ha each) from 2010 to 2014. Food supplementation showed significant positive effects on population density due to increases in recruitment; however, it showed a complex effect on survival of voles: positive in non-breeding seasons, but negative in breeding seasons. In addition, food supplementation increased the quality of plants (as reflected by increased crude protein content), but decreased the quantity of less preferred plants in experimental enclosures. Thus, food seems to have direct positive effects on small rodents through improvement of food supply and indirect negative effects through food-induced density-dependent effects, and may have long-term effects on rodents through altering plant community composition and abundance. © 2017, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","demographic parameters; direct and indirect effects; food quantity and quality; food supplementation; plant community composition; population dynamics; recruitment; survival; voles",,2-s2.0-85026460908

We investigated the influence of two important properties of islands-size and amount of resource subsidy-on the effects of an introduced predatory lizard (Anolis sagrei) on three groups of arthropod prey. Lizards were experimentally introduced to 16 islands that spanned gradients in vegetated area and seaweed deposition (a marine resource subsidy); 16 similar islands served as lizard-free controls. The abundance of web spiders, salticid spiders, and wasps was estimated prior to lizard introduction and again four months after lizard introduction. Lizard introduction reduced the average abundance of all three groups of arthropods. The effect of lizards on salticid spiders- which was very large (94% reduction in salticid abundance)-decreased with island size. In contrast, the effect of lizards on wasps-which was also very large (88% reduction in wasp abundance)-tended to increase with island size, but with only marginal significance. There was no evidence for variation in the effect of lizards on web spiders with island size. This variation between prey taxa may be related to the relative importance of environmental stress (such as wind and wave exposure, which tend to be more pronounced on smaller islands) in determining abundance. Salticids seem to tolerate the stressful environmental conditions that characterize smaller islands, allowing for larger lizard effects; wasps seem to be limited by these conditions (either directly or indirectly via reduced prey availability), minimizing lizard effects on smaller islands. There was a marginally significant tendency for the effect of lizards on salticid spiders to be weaker on islands with more seaweed deposition, suggesting that subsidies may play a role in reducing predator effects on islands. Our results highlight the importance of ecological context in determining the top-down effects of introduced predators and underscore the need to extend existing theories relating island area and community characteristics toward an explicit consideration of species interactions. © 2017 Piovia-Scott et al.","Context dependence; Food web; Predator-prey interactions; Resource subsidy; Top-down control",,2-s2.0-85028765944

The exploitation ecosystems hypothesis (EEH) was invoked to explain biogeographical trends in plant and consumer biomass, and differs from the top-down/bottom-up dichotomy by predicting that the relative strength of these processes will vary along gradients of primary productivity. Here we test the prediction of the EEH that herbivore biomass should increase with increasing primary productivity where predators are rare, but show a negligible response to primary productivity where predators are common due to population regulation by predators. Location: Boreal and temperate regions of North America and Eurasia, and deserts of Australia. Time period: 1970–2016. Major taxa studied: Cervids and kangaroos. Methods: We obtained abundance indices of cervids at 42 locations from the literature and conducted spotlight surveys at 27 locations to derive estimates of kangaroo abundance. For analyses, herbivore abundances were converted to biomass per km2. We tested our prediction using linear mixed effects models. Results: Herbivore biomass showed divergent responses to increasing primary productivity and the abundance of canid predators (grey wolves, Canis lupus/dingoes, Canis dingo). The slope of the relationship between herbivore biomass and net primary productivity did not differ between Australia and the northern boreal and temperate regions. Herbivore biomass increased in response to primary productivity where canid predators were rare, but showed muted responses to increasing productivity where canid predators were common. Main conclusions: Canid predators have strong suppressive effects on herbivore biomass that scale with primary productivity. Our study shows that the EEH has wide application to canid-predator–herbivore dynamics and may be relevant to the management of herbivores because it can provide an indication of how herbivore biomass and densities may vary in relation to ecosystem productivity and the presence and absence of canid predators. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","apex predator; bottom up; large herbivore; primary productivity; top down; trophic cascade","Canidae; Canis; Canis familiaris dingo; Cervidae; Macropodidae",2-s2.0-85019633291

We conduct a systematic literature review to present an overview of how the peer-reviewed academic literature recommends fisheries management frameworks should respond to the climate change-driven uncertainty, vulnerability and risk facing resource bases. Our review identifies 21 different potential management responses. Adaptive management was the most commonly identified strategy, with institutional capacity development and input/output controls also frequently cited. We contrast our findings with illustrative cases characterizing management practice and outcomes in RFMOs, and argue that the ability of RFMOs to implement the climate change mitigation strategies identified in our review is a function of an organization's decision-making rules. We argue that consensus-based decision-making policies limit adaptiveness, and that a ‘responsiveness gap’ exists between consensus and majority-based decision-making frameworks. This gap will become more evident, and increase in importance, as the impacts of climate change shift from potential to kinetic. Considering that decision-making rules in RFMOs are unlikely to change, we argue that increased analytical effort concentrated on institutional contexts and member state interest complexes may promote adaptive management, expediting the pace at which scientific recommendations and findings inform policy and practise in RFMOs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive management; Climate change; Decision-making; Fisheries management; RFMOs","Climate change; Fisheries; Management science; Societies and institutions; Adaptive Management; Climate change mitigation; Decision-making frameworks; Fisheries management; Institutional capacities; Institutional contexts; RFMOs; Systematic literature review; Decision making; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision making; environmental policy; fishery management; literature review; management practice; organizational framework; vulnerability",2-s2.0-85019956775

Crayfish represent one of the most imperilled animal groups on the planet. Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation, introduction of invasive crayfishes, and a lack of applied biological information have all been identified as agents thwarting crayfish conservation. 2. Cambarus callainus was warranted federal protection by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in April, 2016. As part of the USFWS listing procedure, a survey for C. callainus in the Big Sandy River catchment was conducted to determine points of occurrence with a secondary objective of determining reach level physical habitat and physicochemical correlates of C. callainus presence and absence. 3. At each site, physicochemical and physical habitat data were collected to determine the influence of abiotic covariates on the presence of C. callainus. Cambarus callainus presence or absence and associated site covariates were modelled using logistic regression. 4. Survey results recorded C. callainus at 39 sites in the Upper Levisa Fork (ULF) and Tug Fork (TF) drainages of the Big Sandy River; no C. callainus were collected in the Lower Levisa Fork (LLF). An additive effects model of physical habitat quality (Basin + Boulder presence/embeddedness) was the only model selected, supporting an association of C. callainus with slab boulders, open interstitial spaces, and moderate to no sedimentation. All sites lacking C. callainus were experiencing some degree of sedimentation. Physicochemical covariates were not supported by the data. 5. Results indicated that good quality habitat was lacking in the LLF, but was present in the ULF and TF catchments, with ULF supporting the most robust populations and most suitable habitat. Effective conservation for C. callainus should focus on efforts that limit sedimentation as well as restore good quality instream habitat in the greater Big Sandy catchment.

To investigate the adaptive nature of these spatial representations, we introduced a multisensory conflict between vision and proprioception in an immersive virtual reality. During individual bimanual interaction trials, we gradually shifted the visual hand representation. As a result, participants unknowingly shifted their actual hands to compensate for the visual shift. We then measured the adaptation to the invoked multisensory conflict by means of a self-localization and an external localization task. While effects of the conflict were observed in both tasks, the effects systematically interacted with the type of localization task and the available visual information while performing the localization task (i.e., the visibility of the virtual hands). The results imply that the localization of one’s own hands is based on a multisensory integration process, which is modulated by the saliency of the currently most relevant sensory modality and the involved frame of reference. Moreover, the results suggest that our brain strives for consistency between its body and spatial estimates, thereby adapting multiple, related frames of reference, and the spatial estimates within, due to a sensory conflict in one of them. © 2017, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Multisensory conflict; Multisensory integration; Peripersonal space; Spatial perception; Virtual reality","adaptation; adult; Article; brain function; controlled study; female; human; male; mental performance; multisensory conflict; priority journal; proprioception; sensorimotor integration; sensory analysis; spatial behavior; virtual reality; vision; visual field; visual information; visual orientation",2-s2.0-85016125650

Here, we examine how landscape composition affects the prevalence of a viral pathogen in host plants, and the role the arthropod vector assemblage plays in mediating landscape effects. We measured the effect of landscape composition (measured as percentage of cropland and unmanaged land) on the plant virus Potato virus Y (PVY), its aphid vectors, and their coccinellid predators during the 2012 and 2013 field seasons at 19–21 farms. In both years, we found a positive relationship between final virus prevalence and percentage of cropland within 500, 1000 and 1500 m surrounding study sites. Percentage of cropland also had a significant negative effect on aphid species richness, and the aphid community composition in turn affected PVY prevalence. By contrast, landscape composition had no measurable effect on coccinellid abundance or species richness in this study. Synthesis and applications. Our work demonstrates that landscape composition plays an important role in vector-borne pathogen spread, and that pathogen spread appears to be mediated by the effects of the landscape on the insect vector community. The small spatial scale (≤1500 m) of the effects seen in our study indicates that on-farm management practices have the potential to reduce virus prevalence on small-scale farms. Farmers may be able to reduce Potato virus Y prevalence by on-farm diversification, by isolating potato fields from other agricultural crops, and by not using saved potato seed. © 2016 The Authors.

The concept is rooted in a critical analysis of the compatibility of the harm reduction philosophy with Australia's international drug law enforcement practices. On a utilitarian level, the net benefits of international drug law enforcement are determined to be, at best inconclusive, arguably counterproductive and in most cases, incalculable. On a humanitarian level, international drug law enforcement is also determined to be problematic from a criminological standpoint because it generates secondary harms and it is indifferent to the vulnerability of individuals who participate in illicit drug trafficking. Accordingly, the article concludes that a philosophy of harm reduction grounded in the public health perspective is inadequate for mitigating secondary harms arising from Australia's efforts to combat international illicit drug trafficking. A tentative list of secondary harm mitigation principles is presented and the article argues that secondary harm mitigation should replace supply reduction as a core tenet of Australia's National Drug Strategy. The article also concludes that secondary harm mitigation may provide a viable framework for stimulating a productive dialogue between those who advocate prohibition and those who call for decriminalisation at the global level. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; Drug law enforcement; Harm reduction; LEPH; Policing; Secondary harm mitigation; Supply reduction","Article; Australia; conceptual framework; cost effectiveness analysis; drug legislation; drug traffic; feasibility study; harm reduction; health care policy; health hazard; human rights; law enforcement; philosophy; priority journal; public health; vulnerable population",2-s2.0-85021288606

They derive from a variety of purposes including law, history, culture, traditions, administration and local geographical characteristics. There is no uniform approach in addressing land disputes and each country implements different resolution techniques. Ecclesiastical and monastic institutions throughout the world are owners of immense real estate property to such an extent that can indeed affect land administration policies. Greece is in the limelight of international attention due to its economical crisis and actually under pressure to modernise its dysfunctional land policy framework and create a stable investment environment. Within this framework, this paper investigates issues hindering proper land administration in Greece through the examination of a the resolving process regarding a case study in the island of Crete; a complex legal land dispute between the Greek State, two ecclesiastical institutions, a monastery and a church, and squatters took place, lasting for nearly 40 years. In order to evaluate this procedure and its impact on the development of the disputed area, a variety of data sources were accumulated and processed through time-based analysis. In this direction, cadastral survey’s contribution was examined along with land use change analysis, indicating how uncertainties in securing property rights on land, result in illegalities and trespassing posing significant barriers in land administration and management in the course of time. Although old and ambiguous in describing land boundaries the monasterial documentation might be, it proved sufficient to prevail over other litigants claims; the monastery was even adjudicated more than twice the size of the area that was claiming. By this investigation process, the distinct role of ecclesiastical institutions in Greece regarding land acquisition and the defects and malfunctions within Greek Land Administration System are presented.

Data were collected through direct observations and through informal conversations on weekends in a public market between March 2014 and February 2015. In total, 206 species belonging to 40 families and 13 orders were recorded, with the family Turdidae having the largest species diversity observed (28 species). The number of individuals on sale was greatly variable among different species. Ashy-throated parrotbills (Paradoxornis alphonsianus) were the most encountered birds, mainly driven by the practice of bird fighting, followed by Acridotheres cristatellus, Garrulax canornus, Zosterops japonicas, Zosterops palpebrosa, Zosterops erythropleurus, Rhyacornis fuliginosus, Emberiza elegans, Leiothrix lutea and Phoenicurus auroreus, which are all common and native to Guiyang. Our data indicated that at least 2000 individuals have been traded in one year for each of these species. We argue that the current bird trade raises a serious potential threat of over-exploitation of these species, especially due to bird fighting and hunting during the breeding season, as well as raising further potential threats of invasive species spread and disease transmission. Measures to control the trade are discussed here, and environmental education could be the most effective.

Each month, we made 3 measurements of xylem Ψ in each tree: pre-dawn (Ψpd), midday (Ψmd), and late-afternoon (Ψla). We also measured pre-dawn hydraulic conductivity (K) and the percent loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) on the same trees. Flower parameters were estimated using tagged twigs. The total number of flowers produced by each plant, the number of pods per plants, number of fertile pods and the percentage of abortion of flowers and pods were estimated. Values of Ψ ranged from −2.7 ± 0.1 (July) to −0.8 ± 0.2 MPa (September). On a daily basis, individuals had maximal Ψ at pre-dawn and minimal Ψ at midday, with a recovery of Ψ during the late-afternoon likely due to the low evaporative demand at that time. Furthermore, the native conductance of the stems (Ki) had inverse trends in comparison with PLC data. Number of flowers per plant was strongly correlated with Ψmd estimated during October.

With the availability of topsoil frequently limited in mining, soil cover designs that maximise the use of this resource across the newly-created surfaces after mining should be considered. In this paper, we examine the use of different soil covers and their influence on seedling recruitment for restoration of a Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) with limited topsoil. The properties of a standard topsoil and topsoil diluted with waste-rock to optimise spread were compared between two topsoil sources with different textures and a fine-textured waste material that is a mining by-product. We studied the physicochemical and hydrological traits of five soil covers (unblended TEC topsoil; TEC topsoil mixed with waste rock; fines; fines mixed with waste rock, and waste rock) with two TEC topsoil sources (plateau and hillslope). Soil characterisation included texture, gravel content, soil surface crust strength, soil moisture and temperature, and surface infiltration. Finally, we quantified seedling emergence for four key taxa sown (Acacia acuminata, Allocasuarina acutivalvis Melaleuca nematophylla, Waitzia nitida) and the seedling community arising from the topsoil seedbank and naturally dispersed seeds, and related this emergence with the soil properties. The standard topsoil cover promoted the greatest seedling emergence showing marked differences between the two topsoil provenances. Importantly, the addition of waste rock to topsoil did not compromise the ability of topsoil to support seedling emergence and is therefore a useful strategy to maximise this resource. Overall, our results show the importance of hydrological properties of soil covers for seedling recruitment and highlight the importance of topsoil selection in restoration success. © 2017","Hillslope hydrology; Mining restoration; Seedling recruitment; Threatened Ecological Community; Topsoil","Bank protection; Ecology; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); Restoration; Rocks; Seed; Soil moisture; Hillslope hydrology; Mining restoration; Seedling recruitment; Threatened ecological communities; Topsoil; Soils; endangered species; environmental restoration; herb; hillslope; hydrodynamics; land reclamation; mining; recruitment (population dynamics); seedling emergence; semiarid region; shrub; soil cover; topsoil; Acacia acuminata; Allocasuarina acutivalvis; Melaleuca; Waitzia",2-s2.0-85019026970

In the present work, we seek to quantify the relative importance of abiotic (hydrologic and climatic), and biotic (primary productivity as represented by chlorophyll-a) descriptors of tidal creek DO. By fitting multiple linear regression models of DO to hourly chlorophyll-a, water quality, hydrology, and weather data collected in a tidal creek of a Chesapeake Bay marsh (Maryland, USA), temporal shifts (summer-early winter) in the relative importance of tidal creek DO descriptors were uncovered. Moreover, this analysis identified an alternative approach to evaluating tidal stage as a driver of DO by dividing stage into two DO-relevant variables: stage above and below bankfull depth. Within the hydrologic variable class, stage below bankfull depth dominated as an important descriptor, thus highlighting the role of pore water drainage and mixing as influential processes forcing tidal creek DO. Study findings suggest that tidal creek DO dynamics are explained by a balance of hydrologic, climatic, and biotic descriptors during warmer seasons due to many of these variables (i.e., chlorophyll-a, water temperature) acting as tracers of estuarine-marsh water mixing; conversely, in early winter months when estuarine and marsh waters differ less distinctly, hydrologic variables increase in relative importance as descriptors of tidal creek DO. These findings underline important distinctions in the underlying mechanisms dictating DO variability in shallow tidal marsh-creek environments relative to open water estuarine systems. © 2017.

As a general review on the biology of C. lanatus, this paper reviewed the current published literature (including our recent published studies) and also summarised extensive field and laboratory studies performed on its biology, phenology and management in the South-West Slopes of New South Wales. Recent population genetics studies conducted in Australia have shown that the species is monotypic, and was introduced as a single colonisation event in the mid 1800's. Our studies showed genetic diversity in C. lanatus to be non-existent across Australia and invasive ranges and highest in the native range in Africa. Further genetic analyses have shown the species in Australia is identical to Citrullus lanatus var. citroides, the citron melon, native to Africa and now naturalised across Africa, Asia and North America, where it is a weedy nuisance or occasionally a food source for livestock and humans. Although limited genotypic diversity may facilitate potential biocontrol strategies for Citrullus lanatus in Australia, biocontrol may be difficult due to its close genetic similarity to commercial watermelon, a major horticultural crop in Australia and more globally. In Australia, field germination was observed to occur during a two to three-month period between late spring and summer, when warm soil temperatures occurred and field establishment was typically observed after significant rainfall events and was associated with soil moisture availability. Controlled environment seed dormancy findings indicated that dormancy was significantly reduced by storage at ambient laboratory temperatures over eighteen months. Seed dormancy was transient and appeared to be both physical and physiological in nature, and was dependent on the period of after-ripening during the post-harvest period. Key reproductive attributes, including high seed production, self-compatibility and pollination facilitated by several non-specific pollinators have likely resulted in increased spread of this weed in Australia and more globally. Management of C. lanatus is achieved using IWM strategies including pre and post-emergent applications of herbicides as well as limiting fruit production by cultural practices including mowing, grazing and cultivation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biology; Emergence; Management and weed invasion; Seed dormancy","biocontrol agent; biological control; biology; emergence; fallout; fruit production; genetic analysis; genetic variation; monoculture; mowing; pesticide application; phenology; population genetics; sandy soil; seasonal variation; seed dormancy; seed production; soil moisture; vine; weed control; Africa; Asia; Australia; New South Wales; North America; Citrullus lanatus; Citrullus lanatus var. citroides; Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus; Cucumis",2-s2.0-85017562278

Edge influence often affects bird nest predation, but these effects are not ubiquitous and may depend on characteristics such as nest height and visibility. We performed an experiment on nest predation in a migratory passerine, Elaenia chiriquensis (Lesser Elaenia; Passeriformes: Tyrannidae), in a savanna vegetation of the Brazilian Cerrado biome in South-Eastern Brazil. We used 89 real E. chiriquensis nests, collected during previous reproductive seasons, with two plasticine eggs in each, and randomly distributed them at two locations (edge – up to 20 m from a firebreak edge and interior – approx. 150–350 m from the edge) and two heights (low – 60–175 cm and high – 190–315 cm above ground). We also measured leaf and branch density around each nest. We performed this study on two 15-days campaigns, checking the nests every 2–3 days and removing those with predation marks. We sorted the predation marks into those made by birds, mammals, or unidentified predators, and used generalized linear models to assess the effects of location, height and leaf density on survival time and predator type. Only four nests had not been predated during the experiment; 55 nests were predated by birds, 7 by mammals, and 23 by unidentified predators. Low nests in the interior tended to have larger survival times whereas high nests at the edge tended to be more predated by birds and less predated by mammals. Thus, even a low-contrast (firebreak) edge may significantly increase nest predation, which is also affected by the nest's height, mainly due to predation by birds. These effects may be due to predator movement along the edge as well as to edge-related changes in vegetation structure. We suggest that higher-contrast edges which may also be used as movement conduits, for example powerline openings, may have even stronger effects, demanding further studies. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS","Artificial nests; Edge effects; Firebreak; Model selection; Savanna","artificial nest; biome; cerrado; edge effect; mammal; migratory species; model test; nest predation; passerine; predator; savanna; vegetation structure; Brazil; Aves; Elaenia chiriquensis; Mammalia; Passeriformes; Tyrannidae",2-s2.0-85030463821

Most previous studies in this field focus on patterns of species richness but few consider species and trait compositions and how these are shaped by anthropogenic and environmental drivers. Such information, however, is critical for effective planning and management of urban species. We compiled published species lists from 71 Chinese university campuses. We also collected environmental data for each campus, including anthropogenic (campus age and area) and environmental variables (climate and topography), to explore the distribution patterns and the drivers of species richness, composition and traits. We found that university campuses in China maintain substantial plant diversity, including at least 1565 woody and 1614 herbaceous species. The distribution pattern of campus species richness was mostly driven by anthropogenic variables, being positively correlated with campus age and size. In contrast, campus species composition and leaf traits were mostly driven by climate variables. This was especially true for woody plants of which campus species composition and traits were more constrained by mean annual temperature than herb species. Our study provides a basic but diverse database for the selection of campus plants, which can benefit the management of urban ecosystems. Our results reveal that landscape design can influence urban species richness, species composition is still restricted by the natural environment. Hence, many endangered species can be protected in these human-friendly urban ecosystems if they have suitable traits adapted to local climatic conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic drivers; China; Plant traits; Species composition; Species richness; Urbanization","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Plants (botany); China; Plant traits; Species composition; Species richness; Urbanization; Population distribution; biodiversity; community structure; database; endangered species; environmental factor; herb; human activity; plant community; species richness; urban ecosystem; urbanization; China",2-s2.0-85018474328

Here, the progression of C. limbata in southern Brazilian waters is described using visual counts and genetic surveys and changes in the density of the native congener Chromis multilineata were also investigated. Underwater visual censuses of both Chromis species were carried out from 2009 to 2014. Chromis limbata tissue samples were collected and the mtDNA control region was sequenced and compared with mtDNA haplotypes from the natural range to confirm species identity, compare genetic diversity and to infer connectivity between newly established Brazilian populations. The Brazilian population of C. limbata increased significantly over the past 5 years and the effect on C. multilineata is still an open question, longer time-series data will be necessary to clarify possible interactions. The molecular analyses confirmed species identity, revealed strong haplotype connectivity among Brazilian study sites and showed a low genetic diversity in Brazil when compared with the native populations, suggesting few individuals started the invasion. Four hypotheses could explain this colonizing event: C. limbata was released by aquarium fish keepers; larvae or juveniles were transported via ship ballast water; the species has rafted alongside oil rigs; they crossed the Atlantic Ocean through normal larval dispersal or naturally rafting alongside drifting objects. The rafting hypotheses are favoured, but all four possibilities are plausible and could have happened in combination. © 2017 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles","biogeography; dispersal; invasion genetics; invasive species; reef fishes; south-western Ocean",,2-s2.0-85023630948

The Land Utilisation & Capability Indicator (LUCI) is a GIS framework that considers impacts of land use on multiple ecosystem services in a holistic and spatially explicit manner. Due to its fine spatial scale and focus on the rural environment, LUCI is well-placed to help both farm and catchment managers to explore and quantify spatially explicit solutions to improve water quality while also maintaining or enhancing other ecosystem service outcomes. LUCI water quality and agricultural productivity models were applied to a catchment in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources, sinks and pathways in the landscape were identified and trade-offs and synergies between water quality and agricultural productivity were investigated. Results indicate that interventions to improve water quality are likely to come at the expense of agriculturally productive land. Nonetheless, loss of agriculturally productive land can be minimised by using LUCI to identify, at a fine spatial scale, the most appropriate locations for nutrient intervention. Spatially targeted and strategic nutrient source management and pathway interception can improve water quality, while minimising negative financial impacts on farms. Our results provide spatially explicit solutions to optimize agricultural productivity and water quality, which will inform better farm, land and catchment management as well as national and international policy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural productivity; Land utilisation & capability indicator; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Trade-offs and synergies; Water quality",,2-s2.0-85006825693

Although Asian gypsy moth has similar morphology to that of European and North American gypsy moth, it has several traits that make it a greater threat, the most important being the flight capability of females. Asian gypsy moth is not yet established in North America; however, infestations have been detected multiple times in Canada and the United States. To facilitate detection and eradication efforts, we evaluated the effect of a range of temperatures on development time, survivorship, and fertility of eight populations of Asian gypsy moth. There were significant impacts of temperature and population on these life history characteristics. The larval developmental rate increased with temperature until it reached an optimum at 29 °C. Larvae experienced significant molting problems at the highest and lowest temperatures tested (10 °C and 30 °C). At 30 °C, female fitness was markedly compromised, as evidenced by reduced fecundity and fertility. This suggests that development and survival of Asian gypsy moth may be limited by summer temperature extremes in the Southern United States. We also determined the degree-day requirements for two critical life stages and two populations of Asian gypsy moth, which represent the extremes in latitude, to predict the timing for biopesticide application and adult trap deployment.

However, few successful campaigns have occurred on permanently inhabited islands. Cats are known for causing severe impacts on the native insular fauna, posing an important threat to biodiversity. Moreover, this species is also responsible for zoonosis maintenance and transmission. A thorough understanding of cat population structure (e.g., supervised vs. unsupervised) is strongly suggested as a management action on inhabited islands, as it might promote more efficient and effective management of this species. Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The total cat population on the main island was estimated at 1287 animals, most of them supervised and subsidized around inhabited areas. Free-roaming cats currently threaten the endemic terrestrial fauna of Fernando de Noronha, and the cat density found by the present work is among the highest ever recorded on an island. Using population dynamic simulations, the long-term effects of reproduction control and removal of cats from the archipelago were assessed. Removal of cats was also suggested as a necessary management strategy to achieve negative population growth. In addition, it was more cost-effective than reproduction control. However, applying both removal and sterilization strategies to this population resulted in a higher population decrease than removal alone. For these reasons, a combination of reproductive control and cat eradication should be implemented in Fernando de Noronha. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Cat; Conservation; Felis silvestris catus; Fernando de Noronha; Management","archipelago; biodiversity; conservation management; domestic species; felid; feral organism; habitat type; island biogeography; management practice; population growth; population structure; sterilization; tropical environment; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Tropical); Fernando de Noronha; Pernambuco; Animalia; Felis catus",2-s2.0-85019264021

Incorporating settlers and Africans as aggressors and victims alike, archives and ethnohistories depict raiding as thieving, subverting authority, and inciting conflict. Despite the in-depth anthropological attention given to 'Bushman raiding' and frontier commandos, comparatively little work has focused on the social and cultural function of cattle raiding within chiefdoms: that is, examining cattle raiding as socially embedded rather than simply transgressing authority and property ownership. This article explores how these narratives of 'disorder' have been constructed, and some alternative perspectives on nineteenth-century cattle raiding as a social institution. Through vignettes drawing on archival, archaeological, ethnographic and folkloric evidence, this article offers glimpses of what narratives of the recent past could look like if views of raiding-as-disorder were revisited and revised. I draw attention to where raids were illegal versus illicit, the role of cattle as social agents, and the logic underpinning designations of raiding as resistance. Developing a view of raiding as social practice permits us to interrogate archival perceptions of raiders as outlaws and raids as analogues for warfare, thus enabling more nuanced investigations of conflict in Southern Africa's past.

Yet, the conditions under which ecological dynamics are dominated by niche-based versus stochastic processes are poorly understood. Using a field experiment in early-successional temperate grassland and null models of beta diversity, this study investigates the effects of soil nutrient supply on the relative importance of niche-based selection versus stochastic dynamics for variation in species composition among sites. Nutrient availability was manipulated experimentally, individual seed mixtures with 25 species were sown in each experimental plot, and then stochastic and deterministic niche-based assembly processes were allowed to happen. We found that compositional variation among grassland plots with low nutrient supply was driven by stochastic immigration and extinctions. In contrast, nutrient enrichment reduced the importance of stochasticity and imposed a deterministic environmental filter that homogenized communities through the selection of few species with greater competitive ability for light. This demonstrates that soil nutrient availability is a critical environmental feature that dictates the degree to which terrestrial plant communities are controlled by niche-based selection versus stochastic assembly processes. Our study shows further that alternative states of eutrophic grasslands emerge from initial stochastic variation in the composition of a particular functional group of species that can become dominant at high nutrient supply. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying the shift from stochastic to niche-driven dynamics along soil nutrient gradients. © 2016 The Authors",,"competitive ability; ecosystem dynamics; grassland; nutrient availability; nutrient enrichment; plant community; resource availability; soil nutrient; temporal variation; terrestrial environment",2-s2.0-85017339151

Although sex determination in the Japanese subterranean termite Reticulitermes speratus depends on an XX/XY chromosome system, in which male-specific molecular genetic markers can be developed, no such marker has been developed. In this study, we developed male-specific genetic markers for R. speratus using RAD-seq with two restriction enzymes (i.e. double digest [dd] RAD-seq). We subjected 58 field-collected individuals per sex to ddRAD-seq and obtained around 210 million paired-end reads. Our in silico analysis of ddRAD-seq data detected 25 male-specific loci but no female-specific loci, thus confirming an XX/XY system. To verify the male specificity of those loci, we conducted PCR with primers designed for male-specific loci. Accordingly, we obtained male-specific PCR amplifications in six of the 25 loci. Furthermore, we examined whether these six male-specific markers were also applicable to individuals derived from four Japanese populations of R. speratus, including from the northern and southern ends of the distribution range in Japan. Of the six markers, five exhibited male-specific PCR amplifications in all four populations; the sixth was applicable to three populations. PCR amplification tests for cross-species applicability in R. kanmonensis found that none of these markers were cross-species applicable.

Monitoring this seasonal movement is important for management to control the population size and spread of the species. We examined if environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches could detect seasonal changes of these species. To do this, we developed a novel genetic marker that was able to both detect and differentiate bighead and silver carp DNA. We used the marker, combined with a novel occupancy model, to study the occurrence of bigheaded carps at 3 sites on the Wabash River over the course of a year. We studied the Wabash River because of concerns that carps may be able to use the system to invade the Great Lakes via a now closed (ca. 2017) connection at Eagle Marsh between the Wabash River's watershed and the Great Lakes’ watershed. We found seasonal trends in the probability of detection and occupancy that varied across sites. These findings demonstrate that eDNA methods can detect seasonal changes in bigheaded carps densities and suggest that the amount of eDNA present changes seasonally. The site that was farthest upstream and had the lowest carp densities exhibited the strongest seasonal trends for both detection probabilities and sample occupancy probabilities. Furthermore, other observations suggest that carps seasonally leave this site, and we were able to detect this with our eDNA approach. © 2017","Invasive species; Monitoring; Occupancy modeling; Presence/absence data; Wabash River","Monitoring; Population statistics; Probability; Rivers; Silver; Watersheds; Detection probabilities; Environmental conditions; Genetic markers; Invasive species; Population sizes; Presence/absence; Probability of detection; Seasonal changes; Lakes; abundance; biomonitoring; cyprinid; data processing; detection method; DNA; ecological modeling; genetic analysis; genetic marker; invasive species; population distribution; population modeling; population size; seasonal variation; trend analysis; Great Lakes [North America]; United States; Wabash River; Cyprinidae; Hypophthalmichthys; Hypophthalmichthys nobilis",2-s2.0-85020391384

A good mining project investment can improve economic efficiency and increase social wealth. Faced with the complexity and uncertainty of a mine's circumstances, there is great significance in evaluating investment risk scientifically. In order to solve practical engineering problems, this paper presents an extended TOPSIS method combined with linguistic neutrosophic numbers (LNNs). Firstly, considering that there are several qualitative risk factors of mining investment projects, the paper describes evaluation information by means of LNNs. The advantage of LNNs is that major original information is reserved with linguistic truth, indeterminacy, and false membership degrees. After that, a number of distance measures are defined. Furthermore, a common status is that the decision makers can't determine the importance degrees of every risk factor directly for a few reasons. With respect to this situation, the paper offers a weight model based on maximizing deviation to obtain the criteria weight vector objectively. Subsequently, a decision-making approach through improving classical TOPSIS with LNNs comes into being. Next, a case study of the proposed method applied in metallic mining projects investment is given. Some comparison analysis is also submitted.

Due to poor infrastructure and a limited capacity of PA managers, most of the PAs in developing countries fail to achieve their management targets. In this paper, the potential to integrate ecosystem services (ES) into land-use planning was assessed in order to better manage PAs in tropical countries. Firstly, we mapped the relative capacity of different land-use/land cover (LULC) to supply ES in and around the Satchari National Park (SNP) located in northeast Bangladesh. Two alternative scenarios to envisage the likely future supply of ES in the area were then analysed. The study reveals a relatively higher supply of supporting ES from LULC located inside the park compared to the ES supplied from surrounding forests, tea gardens, and oil palm and rubber plantations. Provisioning ES were greater in surrounding forests than from SNP. Both regulating and cultural ES were also higher in LULC within the park. Spatially explicit ES supply assessment and mapping was found to be useful for land use planning and the prioritization of future management actions. Based on our findings, we suggest that PA managers should consider the ES framework as an effective tool for the future-oriented PAs management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation planning; Land cover; National park; Participatory mapping; Stakeholders",,2-s2.0-85017334920

Although intensive research efforts have been advanced to address this threat in wheat, few studies have been conducted on barley, even though pathotypes such as TTKSK are known to attack the crop. The main objectives of this study were to assess the vulnerability of barley to pathotype TTKSK and identify possible sources of resistance. From seedling evaluations of more than 1,924 diverse cultivated barley accessions to pathotype TTKSK, more than 95% (1,844) were found susceptible. A similar high frequency (910 of 934 = 97.4%) of susceptibility was found for the wild progenitor (Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum) of cultivated barley. Additionally, 55 barley lines with characterized or putative introgressions from various wild Hordeum spp. were also tested against pathotype TTKSK but none was found resistant. In total, more than 96% of the 2,913 Hordeum accessions tested were susceptible as seedlings, indicating the extreme vulnerability of the crop to the African pathotypes of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. In total, 32 (1.7% of accessions evaluated) and 13 (1.4%) cultivated and wild barley accessions, respectively, exhibited consistently highly resistant to moderately resistant reactions across all experiments. Molecular assays were conducted on these resistant accessions to determine whether they carried rpg4/Rpg5, the only gene complex known to be highly effective against pathotype TTKSK in barley. Twelve of the 32 (37.5%) resistant cultivated accessions and 11 of the 13 (84.6%) resistant wild barley accessions tested positive for a functional Rpg5 gene, highlighting the narrow genetic base of resistance in Hordeum spp. Other resistant accessions lacking the rpg4/Rpg5 complex were discovered in the evaluated germplasm and may possess useful resistance genes. Combining rpg4/Rpg5 with resistance genes from these other sources should provide more durable resistance against the array of different virulence types in the Ug99 race group. © 2017 The American Phytopathological Society.",,"plant protein; Basidiomycetes; disease resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; Hordeum; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; plant disease; Basidiomycota; Disease Resistance; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Hordeum; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins",2-s2.0-85024113345

An important ongoing debate is whether environmental constraints limit the number of species that can coexist in a community (saturation), with recent findings suggesting that species richness in many communities might be unsaturated. Here, we propose that biodiversity models could address this issue by accounting for a duality: considering communities as unsaturated but where species composition is constrained by different scale-dependent biodiversity drivers. We identify a variety of promising advances for incorporating this duality into commonly applied biodiversity modelling approaches and improving their spatial predictions. The majority of biodiversity modelling approaches do not explicitly address the question of saturation. Theoretical and methodological implications of saturation or unsaturation in biodiversity modelling. Addressing saturation or unsaturation is vital to produce more reliable conservation strategies.

Honeybees are important pollinators in many crop systems, but recent declines in honeybee stocks in Europe and the US have caused concern about the sustainability of crop systems solely depending on honeybees. In addition, several studies have shown that honeybees might negatively affect native pollinator populations, bumblebees in particular. Here we have studied flower visitation to two raspberry farms and surrounding wildflower communities in SE Norway. Bumblebees were excluded from the raspberry field by means of exploitative competition from honeybees (> 97% of flower visits in the raspberry fields were conducted by honeybees). More than 55% of the visits recorded in wild plant communities surrounding the farms were conducted by bumblebees, showing that bumblebees were present in the system. Pollinator taxa were affected differently by temperature; honeybee visits showed a unimodal relationship with maximum flower visitation activity at a temperature of 24.1 °C, while flower visits by bumblebees showed a positive, linear relationship with temperature. The effect of temperature was much weaker for bumblebees than for honeybees (∼2.2% of the variation was explained by temperature, compared to ∼46% for honeybees). Farming practice affected flower visitation, as flowers within growing tunnels received fewer visits. However, the number of flower visits, also within the growing tunnels, was far above what other studies have shown to be sufficient for optimal pollination in raspberry. We conclude that the raspberry fields were sufficiently pollinated by honeybees but that the system should be considered vulnerable as it is solely dependent on this particular pollinator species. The honeybees were sensitive to ambient temperature suggesting that they might suffer more from future climate change than bumblebees. © 2017 The Authors","Bumblebees; Crop pollination; Exploitative competition; Honeybees; Temperature","climate change; competition (ecology); exploitation; honeybee; plant community; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; sustainability; temperature; vulnerability; Norway; Apis mellifera; Rubus glaucus",2-s2.0-85020829351

The goal of this study was to determine whether there were population-specific differences in the suitability of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta) as hosts for the parasitic glochidium larvae of FPM. We predicted that such differences would depend on the historical occurrence of these salmonid species in FPM habitats. We studied the potential host specificity both in the field and in laboratory by exposing salmonid fish to FPM glochidia originating from nine populations in different types of streams and rivers within three large river basins in northern Fennoscandia. The exposures showed remarkable population-specific differences in the suitability of host species. In large main channels, previously colonised by Atlantic salmon but mostly now dammed for hydropower production, the occurrence of FPM glochidia was always highest on salmon. Moreover, glochidia on salmon were often larger than the conspecifics on brown trout. Conversely, in small tributaries with no salmon history, brown trout was generally the best, or the only suitable, host for FPM. The adaptation of certain FPM populations to salmon is a highly significant finding, which offers — together with the hydropower dam construction and the salmonid stocking practices that often favour brown trout — an explanation for the collapse of FPM populations living in former Atlantic salmon rivers. This study illustrates the indirect but substantial effects that dams and changes in fish communities may induce, and emphasises the need to determine the most suitable host species for each FPM population in order to inform conservation and management actions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","affiliate species; glochidia; host–parasite; river damming; salmonid stocking",,2-s2.0-85019942387

In this context, we propose a reflection on the factors that currently hamper our ability to quantify these risks and argue that we are incapable of predicting future outbreaks. We base our reflexion on an ecological two-step filter concept that drives host–parasite interactions, namely the encounter and the compatibility filters. Global changes promote the establishment and spread of infectious diseases worldwide. Several tropical and subtropical vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in more temperate geographical areas, demonstrating that they need further considerations. An autochthonous urogenital schistosomiasis outbreak has recently been identified in Southern Europe (Corsica, France). The causative parasitic agent is a hybrid between a human-specific and a livestock-specific schistosome species. Quantifying the emerging risk of vector-borne disease requires knowledge of the ecological characteristics of parasites and their potential vectors as well as of the interactions between protagonists in Northern latitudes. Host–parasite interactions are driven by an ecological two-step filter concept (the encounter and the compatibility filters). Global changes and hybridization may affect both filters, hence hampering our ability to quantify the risk of future emergence.

For birds, nest site selection is crucial to offspring production because nests are exposed to extreme weather and predation pressure. Predators that forage using olfaction often dominate nest predator communities; therefore, factors that influence olfactory detection (e.g., airflow and weather variables, including turbulence and moisture) should influence nest site selection and survival. However, few studies have assessed the importance of olfactory cover for habitat selection and survival. We assessed whether ground-nesting birds select nest sites based on visual and/or olfactory cover. Additionally, we assessed the importance of visual cover and airflow and weather variables associated with olfactory cover in influencing nest survival. In managed grasslands in Oklahoma, USA, we monitored nests of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna), and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) during 2015 and 2016. To assess nest site selection, we compared cover variables between nests and random points. To assess factors influencing nest survival, we used visual cover and olfactory-related measurements (i.e., airflow and weather variables) to model daily nest survival. For nest site selection, nest sites had greater overhead visual cover than random points, but no other significant differences were found. Weather variables hypothesized to influence olfactory detection, specifically precipitation and relative humidity, were the best predictors of and were positively related to daily nest survival. Selection for overhead cover likely contributed to mitigation of thermal extremes and possibly reduced detectability of nests. For daily nest survival, we hypothesize that major nest predators focused on prey other than the monitored species’ nests during high moisture conditions, thus increasing nest survival on these days. Our study highlights how mechanistic approaches to studying cover informs which dimensions are perceived and selected by animals and which dimensions confer fitness-related benefits. © 2017 The Authors.

We predicted that carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values would not differ between piranha species. Additionally, we evaluated the abundance (CPUE) of both piranha populations along the years (1986–2015). Native and non-native Serrasalmus species have different δ13C signatures, likely exploiting different energy pathways on the food web. Overall, native and non-native piranhas have similar δ15N values and occupy the third trophic level in the food web. Regarding the two piranha population fluctuations, there was an inversion of dominance after the non-native species establishment, where S. marginatus became dominant over S. maculatus (after 1988). Our results showed that trophic niche dimension (revealed by trophic segregation) is not the reason of the observed inversion in the dominant species, and this could be a primary factor driving the persistence of the native species in the ecosystem. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Neotropical floodplain; Pre-adaptation; Serrasalmus; Species invasion; Stable isotopes","abundance; barrier (equipment); biological invasion; carbon isotope; coexistence; complexity; food web; introduced species; isotopic analysis; native species; nitrogen isotope; stable isotope; sympatry; teleost; trophic level; trophic status; Characiformes; Serrasalmus; Serrasalmus marginatus",2-s2.0-85015190045

This work was carried out in Mediterranean mixed forests where their dominant key species Q. suber is affected by a severe decline and mortality induced by the exotic soil-borne pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. Significant differences were not observed between defoliated and healthy trees, either in terms of water use efficiency or growth at the whole-tree scale. We found that limiting conditions, such as low soil depth and high pathogen abundance, induced trees to higher water use efficiency at local and landscape scales. Overall our findings point out that Q. suber trees subjected to soil drought and root pathogens increase water use efficiency to some extent, while this response might not be enough for the trees to overcome the physiological stress associated with the pathogen-induced dieback. We discuss the complex way by which adult Q. suber trees physiologically respond to P. cinnamomi-induced mortality, improving our understanding of the likely consequences of chronic oak decline in the future. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Carbon isotope; Cork oak; Cross-scale relationship; Defoliation; Ecophysiology; Exotic pathogen; Forest decline; Forest disease; Root pathogen; Secondary growth; Soil heterogeneity; Tree dieback","carbon isotope; defoliation; dieback; disease resistance; ecophysiology; forest health; host-pathogen interaction; mortality; pathogen; population decline; tree; Mediterranean Region; Phytophthora cinnamomi; Quercus suber",2-s2.0-85024473292

As diploid males are viable and their offspring are sterile, bumblebee populations can quickly fall in a vortex of extinction. In this article, we investigate for the first time a potential premating mechanism through a major chemical reproductive trait (male cephalic labial gland secretions) that could prevent monandrous virgin queens from mating with diploid males. We focus our study on the cephalic labial gland secretions of diploid and haploid males of Bombus terrestris (L.). Contrary to initial expectations, our results do not show any significant differentiation of cephalic labial gland secretions between diploid and haploid specimens. Queens seem therefore to be unable to avoid mating with diploid males based on their compositions of cephalic labial gland secretions. This suggests that the vortex of extinction of diploid males could not be stopped through premating avoidance based on the cephalic labial gland secretions but other mechanisms could avoid mating between diploid males and queens. © 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","bee decline; bumblebees; conservation; diploid males; premating recognition; reproductive traits","sex pheromone; animal; bee; chemistry; environmental protection; female; genetics; inbreeding; male; metabolism; physiology; ploidy; scent gland; secretion (process); sexual behavior; Animals; Bees; Conservation of Natural Resources; Female; Inbreeding; Male; Ploidies; Scent Glands; Sex Attractants; Sexual Behavior, Animal",2-s2.0-84978224206

This will result in an increased magnitude and duration of winter and spring flooding by rain-fed streams and rivers. Such climate-driven increases in flooding are likely to affect riparian plant communities, but future vegetation changes are hard to predict due to current lack of data. To fill this knowledge gap, we experimentally modified the hydrology of five streams across three countries in north-western Europe during late winter/early spring over a period of 3 years. We assessed the responses in riparian plant species richness, biomass, plant-available nitrogen and phosphorus and seed deposition to increased flooding depth (+18 cm on average at the lowest positions along the riparian gradient) and prolonged flooding duration (6 weeks on average). After 3 years of increased flooding, there was an overall decline in riparian species richness, while riparian plant biomass increased. Extractable soil nitrogen and phosphorus also increased and are likely to have contributed to the increased biomass. Increased flooding resulted in the arrival of more seeds of additional species to the riparian zone, thereby potentially facilitating the shifts in riparian plant species composition we observed. The results of our concerted experimental effort demonstrate that changes in stream riparian plant communities can occur rapidly following increased winter flooding, leading to strong reductions in plant species diversity. © 2017 The Authors.

Due to the resource allocation to defence, decreased feeding and higher stress, the costs of predator NCEs can be considerable. Therefore, the resistance to NCEs may be crucial for population growth and interspecific competition. We tested the resistance of Ponto-Caspian gammarids Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides to NCEs imposed by their predator, the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus. As D. villosus is often avoided by predators in the presence of alternative food, we hypothesised that it would bear lower behavioural and physiological costs of anti-predator responses. We tested gammarid feeding in short-time experiments (2–4 h) with food (chironomid larvae) located at various distances from the stony shelter (to enforce food searching, Experiment I) or in the direct gammarid proximity (no searching needed, Experiment II). Moreover, we checked the predator effect on gammarid growth in a 2-week Experiment III. Both gammarids exposed to predators reduced feeding efficiency outside the shelter (Experiment I). Contrary to our expectations, the response of D. villosus was stronger. When food was provided in their direct proximity (Experiment II), the feeding of both species was unaffected by predators, indicating that a shelter supplied with food can reduce predator NCEs. The growth of P. robustoides was reduced in the presence of predators (Experiment III), whereas that of D. villosus was unaffected. Although D. villosus has a more effective defence strategy than P. robustoides, it bears similar or even higher behavioural costs of NCEs. However, it exhibits the higher resistance to the long-term predator presence, sustaining its growth rate under such conditions. This may be one of the factors contributing to the great invasion success of D. villosus, currently taking place in European fresh waters. © 2017 Jermacz, Kobak.

Using a study site where wild dogs outnumbered lions for several years prior to lion population recovery, we aimed to investigate whether or not, and by which means, wild dog populations are regulated and influenced by lions. We used 38 pack-years of demographic and behavioural data across two 4-year periods where lion density differed 20-fold (pre-lion era: 1996–1999 and lion era: 2010–2013) to assess how lions may affect wild dog pack size and age structure, litter size and pup survival (n = 329 pups), as well as den site selection (n = 46 dens). Pack size was significantly greater during the pre-lion era. The pup to adult ratio was lower during the lion era and the change in pack composition was directly attributable to significantly greater lion-induced pup mortality. We also demonstrate a behavioural shift, with locations selected for the vulnerable denning period being in more rugged terrain and in areas with lower prey densities during the lion era, as compared with the pre-lion era.

Abstract: Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important grain legume providing edible oil and protein for human nutrition. Genome sequences of its diploid ancestors, Arachis duranensis and A. ipaensis, were reported, but their SSRs have not been well exploited and utilized hitherto. Shelling percentage is an important economic trait and its improvement has been one of the major objectives in peanut breeding programs. In this study, the genome sequences of A. duranensis and A. ipaensis were used to develop SSR markers, and a mapping population (Yuanza 9102 × Xuzhou 68-4) with 195 recombinant inbred lines was used to map QTLs controlling shelling percentage. The numbers of newly developed SSR markers were 84,383 and 120,056 in the A. duranensis and A. ipaensis genomes, respectively. Genotyping of the mapping population was conducted with both newly developed and previously reported markers. QTL analysis using the phenotyping data generated in Wuhan across four consecutive years and genotyping data of 830 mapped loci identified 25 QTLs with 4.46–17.01% of phenotypic variance explained in the four environments. Meta-analysis revealed five consistent QTLs that could be detected in at least two environments. Notably, the consistent QTL cqSPA09 was detected in all four environments and explained 10.47–17.01% of the phenotypic variance. The segregation in the progeny of a residual heterozygous line confirmed that the cpSPA09 locus had additive effect in increasing shelling percentage. These consistent and major QTL regions provide opportunity not only for further gene discovery, but also for the development of functional markers for breeding. © 2017, The Author(s).",,"Genes; Genetic engineering; Mapping; Oilseeds; Additive effects; Arachis hypogaea; Breeding program; Genome sequences; Mapping populations; Phenotypic variance; Quantitative trait locus; Recombinant inbred lines; Plants (botany); genetic marker; microsatellite DNA; Arachis; chromosomal mapping; genetic marker; genetics; genotype; phenotype; plant breeding; plant genome; quantitative trait locus; Arachis; Chromosome Mapping; Genetic Markers; Genome, Plant; Genotype; Microsatellite Repeats; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Quantitative Trait Loci",2-s2.0-85019209115

The invasion of the Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) into these lakes has changed several facets of black bass biology, but there is still much to learn about the relationship between these species. Previous dietary analyses have shown Round Goby to be important prey for bass, but have been limited by low visual identification rates of dissected stomach items. Within the present study, DNA barcoding and stable isotope analysis improve prey identification and provide a more quantitative dietary analysis of adult black bass in Lake Ontario, comparing the importance of Round Goby as prey between these two species. Eighty-four LMB (406mm fork length ±4mm SEM) and two hundred sixty-four SMB (422mm ±2mm) obtained as tournament mortalities had prey identified using DNA-based methods. Round Goby was the most prevalent prey species for both predators. The diet of LMB was three times more diverse than that of SMB, which almost entirely consists of Round Goby. Our results provide further support that recent increases in the size of Lake Ontario bass are a result of Round Goby consumption, and that the effects of this dietary shift on body condition are greater for SMB.

On large islands, rat eradication is often impossible and population control, defined as the local limitation of rat abundance, is now routinely performed on many of the world's islands as an alternative management tool. However, a synthesis of the motivations, techniques, costs, and outcomes of such rat-control projects is lacking. We reviewed the literature, searched relevant websites, and conducted a survey via a questionnaire to synthesize the available information on rat-control projects in island natural areas worldwide to improve rat management and native species conservation. Data were collected from 136 projects conducted over the last 40 years; most were located in Australasia (46%) and the tropical Pacific (25%) in forest ecosystems (65%) and coastal strands (22%). Most of the projects targeted Rattus rattus and most (82%) were aimed at protecting birds and endangered ecosystems. Poisoning (35%) and a combination of trapping and poisoning (42%) were the most common methods. Poisoning allows for treatment of larger areas, and poison projects generally last longer than trapping projects. Second-generation anticoagulants (mainly brodifacoum and bromadiolone) were used most often. The median annual cost for rat-control projects was US$17,262 or US$227/ha. Median project duration was 4 years. For 58% of the projects, rat population reduction was reported, and 51% of projects showed evidence of positive effects on biodiversity. Our data were from few countries, revealing the need to expand rat-control distribution especially in some biodiversity hotspots. Improvement in control methods is needed as is regular monitoring to assess short- and long-term effectiveness of rat-control. © 2016 Society for Conservation Biology","conservación en islas; control de plagas de roedores; island conservation; poison; Rattus exulans; Rattus exulans; Rattus norvegicus; Rattus norvegicus; Rattus rattus; Rattus rattus; rodent pest control; trampas; trampas; traps; veneno; veneno","abundance; chemical control; conservation management; cost analysis; endangered species; extinction; future prospect; invasive species; island biogeography; native species; poisoning; prioritization; rodent; trap (equipment); Australasia; Animalia; Aves; Rattus; Rattus exulans; Rattus norvegicus; Rattus rattus; Rodentia",2-s2.0-85018648314

Disease incidence is higher in tropical countries, especially in insular ecosystems. Our objectives were to determine the current burden of leptospirosis in Seychelles, a country ranking first worldwide according to historical data, to establish epidemiological links between animal reservoirs and human disease, and to identify drivers of transmission. Methods: A total of 223 patients with acute febrile symptoms of unknown origin were enrolled in a 12-months prospective study and tested for leptospirosis through real-time PCR, IgM ELISA and MAT. In addition, 739 rats trapped throughout the main island were investigated for Leptospira renal carriage. All molecularly confirmed positive samples were further genotyped. Results: A total of 51 patients fulfilled the biological criteria of acute leptospirosis, corresponding to an annual incidence of 54.6 (95% CI 40.7–71.8) per 100,000 inhabitants. Leptospira carriage in Rattus spp. was overall low (7.7%) but dramatically higher in Rattus norvegicus (52.9%) than in Rattus rattus (4.4%). Leptospira interrogans was the only detected species in both humans and rats, and was represented by three distinct Sequence Types (STs). Two were novel STs identified in two thirds of acute human cases while noteworthily absent from rats. Conclusions: This study shows that human leptospirosis still represents a heavy disease burden in Seychelles. Genotype data suggests that rats are actually not the main reservoir for human disease. We highlight a rather limited efficacy of preventive measures so far implemented in Seychelles. This could result from ineffective control measures of excreting animal populations, possibly due to a misidentification of the main contaminating reservoir(s).

Little information is available on immune system of B. tabaci to date. In this study, one of the Toll-like receptors (TLR; namely BtToll) was cloned in MEAM1 B. tabaci which contains an open reading frame of 3153 bp, encoding putative 1050 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BtToll is highly identitical with other members of the TLR family. Transcripts of BtToll detected through qRT-PCR were expressed in all developmental stages of B. tabaci and the highest expression level was observed in the 3rd nymphal instar. BtToll was highly expressed in response to immune challenge. RNA interference was used to knockdown the BtToll expression in adults through the oral route which resulted in significant reduction of BtToll transcript. When the adults were challenged with a mycotoxin from entomogenous fungi − destruxin A (DA) and RNAi, the median lethal concentration (LC50) decreased by 70.67% compared to DA treatment only. Our results suggest that BtToll is an important component of the B. tabaci immune system.

Exotic ants are a potential threat to H. a. ponceanus and other rare butterflies as they can attack immature stages. Ant surveys conducted in subtropical dry forests in Biscayne National Park documented ant species diversity and relative abundance. A caterpillar predator exclusion experiment using physical barriers in different combinations evaluated caterpillar survivorship of both early and late instar caterpillars exposed to different threats. Ant-caterpillar interactions were also documented by placing caterpillars on plants and observing physical interactions between caterpillars and ants. A total of 1418 ants comprising 25 ant species was captured and identified. In canopies of H. a. ponceanus host plants, 243 ants comprising 12 species were found. The four most common ants collected in the host plant canopies were Pseudomyrmex gracilis, Camponotus planatus, Cremastogaster ashmeadi, and Camponotus floridanus. The predator exclusion experiment revealed survivorship was significantly lower for early and late instar caterpillars without any physical barrier, as well as for early instars not protected by a mesh cage. Pseudomyrmex gracilis and C. floridanus were more aggressive towards caterpillars in comparison to other ant species; these two species ranked first and second in the “ant danger index” ranking predatory abilities of the four most common ant species.

We studied the effects of the emergent disease sudden oak death (SOD) and the resulting functional extinction of tanoak, a highly susceptible native tree with flammable litter, on future community flammability. We quantified four flammability metrics (flame height; flaming duration; smoldering duration; and fuel consumed) for litter from each of five species that co-occur with tanoak and for species mixtures with and without tanoak (n = 14). We combined these flammability metrics in a Principal Components Analysis to evaluate potential shifts in litter flammability from pre-SOD (with tanoak litter) to post-SOD (where tanoak was replaced equally with remaining species). Litter flammability changed following the loss of tanoak, but the differences were species- and community-specific. Mixed-evergreen fuels where coast Douglas-fir litter replaced tanoak experienced consistent declines in flammability. Few substantive changes occurred in communities where coast redwood or other hardwoods co-occurred. We found consistent synergistic flammability effects when multiple species’ litters were mixed; in cases where two or more species were mixed, most (75%) combinations burned with higher intensity (+8.1%) and fuelbeds flamed for a longer duration (+17.1%). Our work demonstrates that potential surface fire behavior in northwestern California may be dampened where Douglas-fir replaces tanoak, while those communities with other hardwoods or coast redwood may have redundant fuels and tanoak’s absence in future fires may be inconspicuous. These results underscore the potential for cascading effects of non-native pathogens on ecosystem function in fire-prone ecosystems. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Douglas-fir; Fire regimes; Functional extinction; Litter; Notholithocarpus densiflorus; Phytophthora ramorum; Sudden oak death","coexistence; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; disease prevalence; ecosystem function; eukaryote; evergreen tree; extinction; fire behavior; litter; mortality; pathogen; California; North America; United States; Lithocarpus; Phytophthora ramorum; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii; Sequoia sempervirens",2-s2.0-85018343369

It has a widespread distribution throughout the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, Mediterranean and Red Seas. We review its environmental tolerances, defence mechanisms and feeding habits to evaluate its potential to survive in changing ocean conditions, to increasingly emerge as a nuisance species and to invade new geographic areas. Hermodice carunculata tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions, including temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation and various types of pollution. It has few natural predators because it is protected by its sharp chaetae and probably by toxins. Hermodice carunculata is best known for consuming live cnidarians, and has been implicated in transmitting coral pathogens, but it also feeds non-selectively on detritus. In the short term, we predict that H. carunculata will be able to withstand many future ecological challenges and possibly contribute to coral reef decline. In the long term, ocean acidification may negatively impact its defence mechanisms and survival. Its invasive potential may be significant.

Thus, not only the spectrum of what is currently designated as CBD has expanded, but overlap with other degenerative and even secondary disorders has made clinical diagnostic certainty even more challenging in the absence of specific and readily-available markers.

Comprehensive prevention and effective early intervention are urgently needed. The occupational setting plays just as much a role as the interface between company and health care. A multi-professional standardised survey was carried out in 2014 to identify the perceived causes of CMDs and the possibilities for prevention and care. It was conducted among occupational health physicians, primary care physicians, psychotherapists and human resource managers. Until now, corresponding views of employees themselves were not known. In addition to a brief overview of the relevance of the topic, the article also describes how the study was designed and the sample access of an employee survey conducted in 2016. Contents and comparisons with the data collected in 2014 are reported elsewhere. Methods: By means of mostly self-constructed questions, a standardised instrument was developed for use within an online survey in a voluntary sample (""access panel"" of a market and opinion research institute). The following aspects were assessed: perceptions about the importance of different work-related requirements and of individual risks for the occurrence of CMDs, the relevance of different prevention approaches, and personal views about possibilities for coping and dealing with work-related CMDs. The answers of 300 ""white-collar"" or ""blue-collar"" workers were aimed at adequately depicting differences between different job types (manufacturing / processing / crafts, service professions and office work). Conclusions: The use of an online access panel has methodological limitations (e.g. lack of representativeness, 'volunteer bias'), but it also offers advantages compared to open internet surveys (closed population, targeted sector-specific recruitment).

Changes in climatic conditions, especially drought as envisaged by climate change projections, could affect the establishment of new individuals that are responsible for ensuring the persistence of species and plant communities. The aim was to study the main morpho-functional traits related to water use and drought resistance of native plant species from Ecuadorian ecosystems during imposed drought periods. Seedlings of six native species representative of the Ecuadorian Andes were studied: lower montane evergreen forest (Alnus acuminata and Cedrela montana), montane cloud forest (Podocarpus sprucei and Aegiphila ferruginea) and montane dry shrubland (Schinus molle and Caesalpinia spinosa). Morphological characterisation, a root growth capacity test and stomatal conductance measurements during two controlled drought periods were used to investigate biomass allocation patterns, the root system morphology and gas exchange patterns of species, respectively. The main results indicated that species-specific differences in morpho-functional traits and allocation patterns determined responses to water availability and drought conditions. Low relative growth rate, leaf area ratio and specific leaf area, and high specific root length, were related to drought-resistant species as P. sprucei and C. spinosa. In contrast, a high or moderate relative growth rate, leaf area and root biomass, but low specific root length as in A. ferruginea, S. molle, C. montana, were related to lower resistance to drought conditions. Despite A. acuminata showed high specific root length, it was reported as a species sensitive to drought. Overall, patterns of stomatal conductance, linked to biomass allocation patterns and root system morphology, especially specific root length, seemed to be related to differences in vulnerability to drought in these species. Drought response was independent of species habitats. Unexpectedly, P. sprucei, belonging to montane cloud forest showed higher drought resistance than S. molle, belonging to montane dry shrubland. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Gas exchange; Lower montane evergreen forest; Montane cloud forest; Montane dry shrubland; Stomatal conductance","climate change; cloud forest; drought; drought resistance; evergreen forest; functional morphology; functional response; gas exchange; montane forest; native species; persistence; plant community; seedling; shrubland; stomatal conductance; vulnerability; Andes; Ecuador; Aegiphila; Alnus acuminata; Caesalpinia spinosa; Cedrela; Podocarpus; Schinus molle",2-s2.0-85020031294

Several assays were used to determine if C. formosanus termite proteins cross-react with cockroach allergens. Expressed sequence tag and genomic sequencing results were searched for homology to cockroach allergens using BLAST 2.2.21 software. Whole termite extracts were analyzed by mass-spectrometry, immunoassay with IgG and scFv antibodies to cockroach allergens, and human IgE from serum samples of cockroach allergic patients. Expressed sequence tag and genomic sequencing results indicate greater than 60% similarity between predicted termite proteins and German and American cockroach allergens, including Bla g 2/Per a 2, Bla g 3/Per a 3, Bla g 5, Bla g 6/Per a 6, Bla g 7/Per a 7, Bla g 8, Per a 9, and Per a 10.

Using structural equation modeling we found that experience with classic psychedelics uniquely predicted self-reported engagement in pro-environmental behaviors, and that this relationship was statistically explained by people's degree of self-identification with nature. Our model controlled for experiences with other classes of psychoactive substances (cannabis, dissociatives, empathogens, popular legal drugs) as well as common personality traits that usually predict drug consumption and/or nature relatedness (openness to experience, conscientiousness, conservatism). Although correlational in nature, results suggest that lifetime experience with psychedelics in particular may indeed contribute to people's pro-environmental behavior by changing their self-construal in terms of an incorporation of the natural world, regardless of core personality traits or general propensity to consume mind-altering substances. Thereby, the present research adds to the contemporary literature on the beneficial effects of psychedelic substance use on mental wellbeing, hinting at a novel area for future research investigating their potentially positive effects on a societal level.

Data collection, data modelling and analysis, and data sharing have become core challenges in weed control and crop protection. We review the challenges and opportunities of Big Data in agriculture: the nature of data collected, Big Data analytics and tools to present the analyses that allow improved crop management decisions for weed control and crop protection. Big Data storage and querying incurs significant challenges, due to the need to distribute data across several machines, as well as due to constantly growing and evolving data from different sources. Semantic technologies are helpful when data from several sources are combined, which involves the challenge of detecting interactions of potential agronomic importance and establishing relationships between data items in terms of meanings and units. Data ownership is analysed using the ethical matrix method to identify the concerns of farmers, agribusiness owners, consumers and the environment. Big Data analytics models are outlined, together with numerical algorithms for training them. Advances and tools to present processed Big Data in the form of actionable information to farmers are reviewed, and a success story from the Netherlands is highlighted. Finally, it is argued that the potential utility of Big Data for weed control is large, especially for invasive, parasitic and herbicide-resistant weeds. This potential can only be realised when agricultural scientists collaborate with data scientists and when organisational, ethical and legal arrangements of data sharing are established. © 2017 The Authors.

We hypothesize that, in the time between these periods, extinction of local plant species and addition of exotic plants modified phylogenetic-α-diversity at different levels (deeper and terminal phylogeny) and increased phylo-β-diversity among islands. Based on floristic studies, we assembled a phylogenetic tree from occurrence data that includes 921 species, of which 165 and 756 were native or exotic in origin, respectively. Then, we studied change in the phylo-α-diversity and phylo-β-diversity (1 –Phylosor) by comparing pre-European and current times. Despite extinction of 18 native angiosperm species, an increase in species richness and phylo-α-diversity was observed for all islands studied, attributed to introduction of exotic plants (between 6 to 477 species per island). We did not observe significant variation of mean phylogenetic distance (MPD), a measure of the ‘deeper’ phylogenetic diversity of assemblages (e.g., orders, families), suggesting that neither extinctions nor introductions altered phylogenetic structure of the angiosperms of these islands. In regard to phylo-β-diversity, we detected temporal turnover (variation in phylogenetic composition) between periods to flora (0.38 ± 0.11). However, when analyses were performed only considering native plants, we did not observe significant temporal turnover between periods (0.07 ± 0.06). These results indicate that introduction of exotic angiosperms has contributed more notably than extinctions to the configuration of plant assemblages and phylogenetic diversity on the studied islands. Because phylogenetic diversity is closely related to functional diversity (species trait variations and roles performed by organisms), our results suggests that the introduction of exotic plants to these islands could have detrimental impacts for ecosystem functions and ecosystem services that islands provide (e.g. productivity). © 2017 Carvallo, Castro.

Its caterpillars feed on legumes, in contrast to Grass skippers (subfamily Hesperiinae) which feed exclusively on monocots. Results: To better understand the evolution and phenotypic diversification of Skippers (family Hes-periidae), we sequenced, assembled and annotated a complete genome draft and transcriptome of a wild-caught specimen of A. lyciades and compared it with the available genome of the Clouded Skipper (Lerema accius) from the Grass skipper subfamily. The genome of A. lyciades is nearly twice the size of L. accius (567 Mbp vs. 298 Mbp), however it encodes a smaller number of proteins (15881 vs. 17411). Gene expansions we identified previously in L. accius apparently did not occur in the genome of A. lyciades. For instance, a family of hypothetical cellulases that diverged from an endochitinase (possibly associated with feeding of L. accius caterpillars on nutrient-poor grasses) is absent in A. lyciades. While L. accius underwent gene expansion in pheromone binding proteins, A. lyciades has more opsins. This difference may be related to the mate recognition mechanisms of the two species: visual cues might be more important for the Eudaminae skippers (which have more variable wing pat-terns), whereas odor might be more important for Grass skippers (that are hardly distinguishable by their wings). Phylogenetically, A. lyciades is a sister species of L. accius, the only other Hesperiidae with a complete genome. Conclusions: A new reference genome of a dicot-feeding skippers, the first from the Eudaminae subfamily, reveals its larger size and suggests hypotheses about phenotypic traits and differences from monocot-feeding skippers. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.","Achalarus lyciades; Butterflies; Catalase; Cellulase; Lepidoptera; Opsin",,2-s2.0-85027849522

In primary tauopathies, there is a disassociation between tau (a microtubule-associated protein) and microtubules as a result of tau hyperphosphorylation. This disassociation between tau and microtubules results in tau fibrillization and inclusion formation as well as in microtubule dysfunction. There are different clinical syndromes associated with different primary tauopathies, and some clinical syndromes can be associated with multiple primary tauopathies. Hence, although some clinical syndromes are highly specific and almost diagnostic of a primary tauopathy, many are not, making it difficult to diagnose a primary tauopathy. Recently, radioligands that bind to tau and can be combined with positron emission tomography to detect fibrillary tau antemortem have been developed, although preliminary data suggest that these ligands may not be sensitive in detecting tau associated with many primary tauopathies. Another recent advancement in the field is evidence suggesting that tau may exhibit properties similar to those of prions, although infective transmission has not been shown. There have been a few clinical trials targeting tau and microtubule dysfunction, although none have had any disease-modifying effects. Understanding tau biology is critical to the development of pharmacological agents that could have disease-modifying effects on primary tauopathies. © 2017 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research",,"tau protein; animal; brain; degenerative disease; disease model; genetics; human; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phosphorylation; positron emission tomography; tauopathy; Animals; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Phosphorylation; Positron-Emission Tomography; tau Proteins; Tauopathies",2-s2.0-85027972937

Utilizing published knowledge on amphibian and aquatic invertebrate responses to environmental gradients and the effects of ash loss on forest structure and function, we provide a mechanistic framework to discuss how changes in hydrology, canopy structure, and litter inputs could affect wetland communities. Changes in leaf litter could affect primary production and food web structure in the aquatic environment; overall changes in habitat structure might shift the community to species with longer aquatic stages that prefer open-canopy habitats. Amphibians and aquatic invertebrates serve as linkages between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

Here, for the first time, we investigate the impact of climate change on both presence/absence and abundances of hoverfly species. We used generalized linear models to analyse the relationships of climatic and soil variables with the occurrence and abundance of Cheilosia species on the Balkan Peninsula. Our results show that the ranges of all and the abundances of many species are projected to decrease in the future. Climatically suitable conditions for mountainous species are predicted to generally shift northwards. Species adapted to high mountains are projected to almost vanish from the Balkans and only regions of the Alps would remain suitable for them. We found climatic variables were more important in determining abundance than occurrence. Given that environmental factors differed in terms of their impact on abundance and occurrence, we highlight the importance of monitoring both parameters to ensure effective conservation. Considering the different projected responses of hoverflies to future climate change, as well as their value as pollinators and the increasing threats they currently face, knowledge on their responses to the major drivers of their life-histories is indispensable for proper management and conservation action. We reveal that nationally-designated protected areas are insufficient to conserve the species considered here, both currently and under projected climate change.

The ventral sternites are typically green after molting, and turn red through prolonged intermolt, with a concurrent decrease in stress tolerance. In this study, whole animal and molecular physiology was evaluated at constant low salinity (12), and oscillating salinity (12-32 every 6 h). Performance in three whole animal measures revealed that the green phase is more tolerant than the red phase, and that females are more tolerant than the respective males under both salinity conditions. These differences result from larger increases in expression of the drivers behind ion transport (Na+/K+-ATPase, cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase) in green phase and female crabs. Low salinity exposure resulted in increased expression of these markers compared with oscillating salinity, demonstrating that low salinity is more strenuous, as more cellular regulation is required. This agrees with the crabs' natural environmental conditions where prolonged low salinity is rarely experienced. These findings are presented in context of a crab population survey conducted from May 2012 through November 2016 in southern Maine, USA. Female and red phase crabs were found at higher proportions in the intertidal than previously reported. In addition, gravid females were found year round, which is indicative of continuous reproduction.

Two competing explanations identify dingoes as causing human dietary composition to proportionally increase intake of small and medium-sized game, through competitive and assistive functions respectively. These scenarios are not mutually exclusive, but are in fact most convincing when working together. A new model combining this with three important ecological functions of dingoes is introduced, with specific mechanisms by which Holocene dingoes as apex predators and trophic regulators would have decreased large game abundance, and increased that of smaller game. This demonstrates how dingoes in both wild and domestic capacities created a suite of conditions that together made selecting smaller game a less risky, more attractive subsistence strategy for human foragers, thereby driving an archaeological smaller-fauna trend. Dingoes may also have been used to hunt large game reliably, but this was likely restricted to certain times and/or places. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Archaeofauna; Canids; Historical ecology; Hunting dogs; Small game",,2-s2.0-85019875348

These stars have at least one stellar companion within 2″, and the planets have measured masses and radii, allowing an estimate of their bulk density. The transit dilution by the companion star requires the planet radii to be revised upward, even if the planet orbits the primary star; as a consequence, the planetary bulk density decreases. We find that if planets orbited a faint companion star, they would be more volatile-rich, and in several cases their densities would become unrealistically low, requiring large, inflated atmospheres or unusually large mass fractions in an H/He envelope. In addition, for planets detected in radial velocity data, the primary star has to be the host. We can exclude 14 planets from orbiting the companion star; the remaining 15 planets in seven planetary systems could orbit either the primary or the secondary star, and for five of these planets the decrease in density would be substantial even if they orbited the primary, since the companion is of almost equal brightness as the primary. Substantial follow-up work is required in order to accurately determine the radii of transiting planets. Of particular interest are small, rocky planets that may be habitable; a lower mean density might imply a more volatile-rich composition.

Norway has an extensive coastline and a well-established aquaculture sector offering suitable preconditions for developing large-scale cultivation of seaweed biomass both in monoculture and in Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems. Recent efforts from research, industry and public authorities have been committed to develop a Norwegian bio-economy based on cultivated seaweed, focusing on cultivation and processing of the biomass. This review reports on the status of seaweed aquaculture in Norway, supported by production data collected since the delivery of the first commercial cultivation permits at sea in 2014. Although novel product developments are currently limited, future industrial perspectives based on cultivated biomass are being discussed. Upscaling from experimental cultivation schemes to commercial production requires a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits associated with seaweed aquaculture, as well as the development of a regulative framework adapted to this industry. Issues associated with upscaling the macroalgal production that needs to be addressed includes (i) genetic interactions between cultivated and wild crops, (ii) impacts of seaweed cultivation on surrounding ecosystems, (iii) epiphytes and diseases, (iv) area utilization and (v) threats from climate change. Addressing these issues and adapting production practices will ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of an emerging industry based on cultivated seaweed biomass in Norway. © 2017, The Author(s).","Bioeconomy; Integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA); Macroalgae; Regulation; Seaweed; Sustainability","aquaculture production; cultivation; industrial development; macroalga; regulatory framework; seaweed culture; sustainability; Norway",2-s2.0-85011632917

These species are widely distributed in diverse agro-ecosystems from temperate to sub-tropical regions due to their unique seed traits, successful germination ecology, high competitive ability, and allelopathic potential. A. fatua is more widespread, adaptable, and problematic than A. ludoviciana. Both these species infest major winter and spring crops, including wheat, oat, barley, canola, maize, alfalfa, and sunflower, causing up to 70% yield losses depending on crop species and weed density. Chemical control has been challenged by large-scale herbicide resistance evolution in these weed species. A. fatua is the most widespread herbicide-resistant weed in the world, infesting about 5 million hectares in 13 countries. The use of alternative herbicides with different modes of action has proved effective. Several cultural practices, including diverse crop rotations, cover crops, improved crop competition (using competitive cultivars, high seed rates, narrow row spacing, altered crop geometry), and allelopathic suppression, have shown promise for controlling A. fatua and A. ludoviciana. The integrated use of these cultural methods can reduce the herbicide dose required, and lower dependency on herbicides to control these grasses. Moreover, integrated management may successfully control herbicide-resistant populations of these weed species. The use of integrated approaches based on the knowledge of biology and ecology of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana may help to manage them sustainably in the future. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Cereals; Crop competition; Herbicide resistance; Weed management; Wild oats","agricultural ecosystem; alfalfa; biology; cereal; chemical control; competition (ecology); cover crop; crop rotation; grass; herb; herbicide; pesticide resistance; weed control; Avena fatua; Avena ludoviciana; Brassica napus var. napus; Helianthus; Hordeum; Medicago sativa; Poaceae; Zea mays",2-s2.0-85026538652

As they are vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation, a rapidly changing environment endangers peatlands and their carbon storage potential. Understanding the mechanisms of peatland carbon accumulation from studying past developments may, therefore, help to assess the future role of tropical peatlands. Using a multi-proxy palaeoecological approach, a peat core taken from the Sungai Buluh peatland in Central Sumatra has been analyzed for its pollen and spore, macro charcoal and biogeochemical composition. The result suggests that peat and C accumulation rates were driven mainly by sea level change, river water level, climatic variability and anthropogenic activities. It is also suggested that peat C accumulation in Sungai Buluh is correlated to the abundance of Freycinetia, Myrtaceae, Calophyllum, Stemonuraceae, Ficus and Euphorbiaceae. Sungai Buluh has reasonable potential for being a future global tropical peat C sinks. However, considering the impact of rapid global climate change in addition to land-use change following rapid economic growth in Indonesia, such potential may be lost.

To date, most efforts have concentrated on the study of exoplanetary atmospheres. Instead, we aim to investigate the possibility of characterizing an exoplanet (in terms of habitability, geology, presence of life, etc.) by studying material ejected from the surface during an impact event. For a number of impact scenarios, we estimate the escaping mass and assess its subsequent collisional evolution in a circumstellar orbit, assuming a Sun-like host star. We calculate the fractional luminosity of the dust as a function of time after the impact event and study its detectability with current and future instrumentation. We consider the possibility to constrain the dust composition, giving information on the geology or the presence of a biosphere. As examples, we investigate whether calcite, silica, or ejected microorganisms could be detected. For a 20 km diameter impactor, we find that the dust mass escaping the exoplanet is roughly comparable to the zodiacal dust, depending on the exoplanet's size. The collisional evolution is best modeled by considering two independent dust populations, a spalled population consisting of nonmelted ejecta evolving on timescales of millions of years, and dust recondensed from melt or vapor evolving on much shorter timescales. While the presence of dust can potentially be inferred with current telescopes, studying its composition requires advanced instrumentation not yet available. The direct detection of biological matter turns out to be extremely challenging. Despite considerable difficulties (small dust masses, noise such as exozodiacal dust, etc.), studying dusty material ejected from an exoplanetary surface might become an interesting complement to atmospheric studies in the future. © 2017 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Biosignatures; Exoplanets; Impacts; Interplanetary dust; Remote sensing",,2-s2.0-85027881158

They are a resource globally threatened by both intensive land uses and lack of recruitment. Their disappearance would involve not only the loss of majestic organisms with high intrinsic value, but may also result in the disappearance of rare and endangered species. Italy is currently implementing a new list of noteworthy ancient trees (i.e. monumental trees) and the preliminary results of this new inventory have been analysed as a case study of a national initiative. The provisional list included 950 complete records, corresponding to 65 genera and 118 species. The most abundant species was Quercus pubescens Willd while the most common genera were Quercus, Larix, Cedrus, Fagus and Platanus. Age and size were the most used criteria for inclusion of trees in the census. The fundamental novelty of the new inventory is that it is based on a set of well-defined criteria of monumentality and that it clearly recognised the ecological value of ancient trees. Preserving a tree for its ecological role requires a profound cultural shift. The value of microhabitats, structures that have historically been considered defects, should be recognised and managed accordingly. Ancient trees are often part of disappearing cultural landscapes: to preserve the richness and diversity of these habitats, new policies and regulations are needed. The preservation of landscapes, where there is still a high density of ancient trees, should be a priority for all European countries in order to conserve their unique associated fauna and for their irreplaceable functional value for biodiversity conservation.","Ancient tree; Deadwood; Microhabitat; Saproxylic; Veteran tree",,2-s2.0-85026651778

The 198 accessions were classified into three maturity groups, early, intermediate, and late based on heading data. In all three environments, the early accessions had the best agronomic performance, produced higher grain yield, thousand-kernel weight and grain volume weight, and had earlier heading date and shorter plant height. The intermediate accessions had similar grain yield and thousand-kernel weight as the early accessions in the irrigated environment, but had lower thousand-kernel weight in the terminal drought environments. Terminal drought had significant effects on grain yield, plant height, thousand-kernel weight, and grain volume weight. The positive correlation between GY and HD suggests that the 'late early' types in the early maturity were the most successful. Out of 198 accessions evaluated, twenty-three had high yield stability and drought tolerance according to the drought susceptibility index and membership function value of drought tolerance.

In Italy, the Po Plain is the most human-dominated land-scape of the country and, after decades of exploitation, old-growth forests have been reduced to small and isolated patches, often threatened by invasive tree species such as the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). In these habitats, the occurrence of many forest-dependent species is related to the quality and availability of suitable areas, as well as the connectivity between the remaining forested patches. Thus, recently developed species distribution models have been applied, namely the Ensemble of Small Models (ESMs), to identify areas of occurrence for a rare and protected saproxylic beetle species, the stag beetle Lucanus cervus and the inverse of the resulting distribution maps as resistance maps have been used to estimate landscape connectivity for this species. Response curves suggested that the probability of the stag beetle occurrence increased with habitat diversity, grassland coverage and native forests, especially oak and mixed forests. The other forest coverage, such as those with black locust, beech, chestnut and black cherry, showed a unimodal relationship peaking approximately at 70%, 8%, 55% and 13% respectively. The stag beetle occurrence was unimodal related to distance to watercourses and distance to human settlements and negatively related to shrub-lands, croplands, sparse and dense human settlements. Landscape connectivity showed similar patterns, except for oak forest coverage, which showed a negative relationship to landscape connectivity. In conclusion, stag beetles can persist in a human dominated landscape only in the presence of forest patches, including those with black locust trees. It is also inferred that ESMs may be suitable for modelling rare species distributions and estimating landscape connectivity to promote species conservation. Copyright Francesca Della Rocca et al.

Ecological processes, represented by the composition of pollination and seed dispersal traits in all of the habitats under restoration, were similar to the reference habitat. However, low tree density and an increase in IAP cover with an increase in restoration age were identified as threats to reforestation success.

Existing LBR schemes were originally designed for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Although they offer attractive efficiency and scalability, their privacy performance presents a vulnerability when being used in IoT. This is because, unlike a conventional WSN where all nodes are owned by the same user, an IoT network has an open architecture in which nodes owned by different users are mixed and work together. Therefore, when LBR is directly used in an IoT network, the sharing of location information among alien nodes allows one user to peek into the communication privacy of other users. HC-LBR overcomes this privacy weakness by computing efficient geographic routes directly based on Hilbert-Curve-encrypted location information. HC-LBR consists of two components: A Kademlia-tree-based routing algorithm that supports efficient geographic routing in HC encrypted space, and Rand-Mix, a lightweight traffic mixer that uses multiple traffic flows to enhance the privacy of HC routing. Our simulation-based evaluation verifies the high efficiency and privacy of the proposed methods. © 2017 IEEE.",,,2-s2.0-85028312470

Widespread misinformation is troubling, not just because it is wrong, but also because it can persist in the face of attempts to correct it, and thus becomes part of a larger culture of community-based pseudoknowledge (PK). Prior work has focused on the motivations and psychology of those who create and maintain PK but has neglected inspection of the dynamics of collective PK production itself. In this exploratory case study, we illustrate how the active participation of multiple collaborators adapts PK over time through a process we liken to participatory storytelling.

Citizen science may be a key method to bolster museum collections data, particularly from urban regions, where ongoing data collection is critical to our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in a highly modified and variable landscape. In this study, we compare data collected as part of the citizen-science project Reptiles and Amphibians of Southern California (RASCals), hosted on the platform iNaturalist (www.inaturalist.org), to data in the VertNet database (www.vertnet.org), which houses millions of museum collection records from over 250 natural-history collections, for four focal species, including a native lizard of conservation concern that has declined with urbanization, a native lizard that is widespread in urban areas, and two invasive aquatic species. We compared numbers of VertNet records over time to modern RASCals records, and the number of records collected from urban, suburban, and protected areas from both databases. For all species, citizen-science records were generated much more rapidly than museum records. For three of our four focal species, RASCals participants over 27 months documented from 70 to 750% more records than were added to the VertNet database after 1990. For the urban-tolerant southern alligator lizard, RASCals participants collected nearly 45 times more modern urban records than are contained in the VertNet database. For all other species, the majority of RASCals records were collected within suburban or other highly modified landscapes, demonstrating the value of citizen science for collecting data within urban and suburban ecosystems. As new museum acquisitions decline, citizen-science projects like RASCals may become critical to the maintenance of modern species-distribution data. © 2017 Spear, Pauly and Kaiser.","American bullfrog; Citizen science; Coast horned lizard; Museum collections; Red-eared slider; Southern alligator lizard; Southern California; Urbanization",,2-s2.0-85031701112

Prevalence and patterns of dispersal of the mosquito are of central importance for an effective control of the species. We used site-occupancy models accounting for false negative detections to estimate the prevalence, the turnover, the movement pattern and the growth rate in the number of sites occupied by the mosquito in 17 localities throughout Mallorca Island. Results: Site-occupancy probability increased from 0.35 in the 2012, year of first reported observation of the species, to 0.89 in 2015. Despite a steady increase in mosquito presence, the extinction probability was generally high indicating a high turnover in the occupied sites. We considered two site-dependent covariates, namely the distance from the point of first observation and the estimated yearly occupancy rate in the neighborhood, as predicted by diffusion models. Results suggested that mosquito distribution during the first year was consistent with what predicted by simple diffusion models, but was not consistent with the diffusion model in subsequent years when it was similar to those expected from leapfrog dispersal events. Conclusions: Assuming a single initial colonization event, the spread of Ae. albopictus in Mallorca followed two distinct phases, an early one consistent with diffusion movements and a second consistent with long distance, 'leapfrog', movements. The colonization of the island was fast, with ~90% of the sites estimated to be occupied 3 years after the colonization. The fast spread was likely to have occurred through vectors related to human mobility such as cars or other vehicles. Surveillance and management actions near the introduction point would only be effective during the early steps of the colonization. © 2017 The Author(s).","Invasion; Population dynamics; Range expansion; Site-occupancy model; Tiger mosquito",,2-s2.0-85026403225

Ten plots of 20 m × 20 m each were laid in each site to study woody vegetation and a total of forty quadrats (4 in each plot) of 1 m × 1 m were laid in each site for the understorey. Both sites showed remarkable variations in biomass and carbon accumulation patterns. Site I (213 Mg C/ha) had higher woody biomass carbon than site II (185.9 Mg C/ha). However, the latter had greater understorey biomass carbon (site I – 3.2 Mg C/ha; site II –20.7 Mg C/ha). Overall, the total vegetation carbon accounted to 216.2 Mg C/ha in site I and 206.6 Mg C/ha in site II. On the other hand, soil carbon was higher in site II (183.5 Mg C/ha) than site I (172.3 Mg C/ha). Soil bulk density increased with increase in soil depth in both sites. Cumulatively, even though both sites had almost equal carbon stocks, they show considerable variation in the amount of carbon stocked in their carbon pools. Woody biomass was the largest carbon pool, followed by soil and understorey biomass.

It is well known that invasive plants can affect native plants by producing novel allelochemicals but some exotic plant species may be also sensitive to allelochemicals released by native species, providing a tool to reduce growth and impacts of invasive exotic species. Here, using growth chamber experiments we tested the mutual potential allelopathic effects of Sesbania virgata (a native dominant species) and the alien Leucaena leucocephala seeds. S. virgata was unaffected by seed leachates of L. leucocephala, indicating that, under lab conditions, this legume presents resistance to the phytotoxic compounds produced by seeds of this alien species. In contrast, germination and seedling growth of L. leucocephala were strongly affected by the phytochemicals produced by seeds of S. virgata. A delay in endospermic mobilization of storage carbohydrates (raffinose-family oligosaccharides and galactomannan) was observed in the alien species. These potential allelopathic effects could not be attributed sole to the presence neither of the phytoxic catechin nor of ABA in seed leachates of S. virgata. Our findings indicate that the in vitro behavior of S. virgata is consistent with its aggressiveness in natural environment and suggest sesbanimide as a potential candidate as implicated in the noxious effects of S. virgata on the alien species. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Carbohydrates; Catechin; Legume; Phytochemicals; Seeds",,2-s2.0-85026921246

Here we investigate the status of the red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer), an Asian passerine bird. This species has been introduced widely across Pacific islands and is commonly blamed for its impacts on agriculture and biodiversity via dispersal of invasive plant seeds and competition with native fauna. This case study evaluates all available data on the impacts and management of this invasive species and identifies priorities for future research. We reviewed the scientific literature and information from three databases (ABBA, GAVIA, eBird) and highlight that the attention paid to this species by scientists and managers varied considerably between islands and contexts and was globally lower than the attention paid to other species on the IUCN-ISSG list. The red-vented bulbul has now established on 37 islands and in seven continental locations outside its native range. We show that three categories of effects are associated with this species: plant damage, seed dispersal and disturbance of fauna. We compiled lists of 110 plant species consumed, 33 plant species dispersed, and 15 species of bird that this bulbul interacts with. However, these lists were mainly made of opportunistic observations rather than specific assessments. Research outputs that focus on better ways to prevent or quantify the impacts of the red-vented bulbul remain scarce. We found very few references exploring potential positive impacts of this species, and only two examples of management actions undertaken against it. The latter are required to inform management actions, especially on sensitive tropical islands where invasions and dispersal of the red-vented bulbul are ongoing. Our analysis of the literature found no clear support for considering this species to be one of the “world’s worst” invasive alien species. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Biodiversity; Conservation; Impact; Invasive alien bird; Islands",,2-s2.0-85026897377

Monitoring of abiotic and biotic changes is essential to mitigating long-lasting effects, and the 23-year dataset from the Gabčíkovo Waterworks provided a rare opportunity to assess the impact of groundwater regimes on vegetation. The main aim of this study was to describe the effect of the Gabčíkovo Waterworks on vegetation structure and species composition of the adjacent riparian floodplain forests over the past 23 years. The results are based on studies of three permanent monitoring plots (PMPs) located in the Danube inland delta - two outside (PMP 1 and 3) and one (PMP 2) fully under the influence of the artificial supply system. Our results demonstrate that the Danube inland delta was negatively affected by the Gabčíkovo construction, particularly for sites outside of the artificial supply system. There was a significant decrease in soil moisture and increase in nitrogen at both external PMPs (1 and 3). Alter soil conditions were accompanied by negative changes in plant species composition demonstrated by decreases in the number of typical floodplain forest species that are characteristic for the alliance Salicion albae and either number or cover of neophytes. These changes resulted in slow degradation of the riparian floodplain forests. Vegetation in the artificially-fed PMP 2 was the most stable in terms of the evaluated parameters, however even this site did still experience negative trends in some site characteristics, including soil moisture fluctuations and the number and cover of neophytes. The artificial supply system is not sufficiently replacing previous natural floods, but in some aspects it helped to decrease the negative effect of the Gabčíkovo Waterworks on softwood floodplain forests in the studied area. © 2017 Institute of Botany, Slovak Academy of Sciences.","dam; dynamics; long-term monitoring; river; soil moisture; tree species",,2-s2.0-85028546086

It was hypothesized that isoprene biosynthesis evolved as an ancestral mechanism in plants adapted to high water availability, to cope with transient and recurrent oxidative stresses during their water-to-land transition. There is a tight association between isoprene emission and species hygrophily, suggesting that isoprene emission may be a favorable trait to cope with occasional exposure to stresses in mesic environments. The suite of morpho-anatomical traits does not allow a conservative water use in hygrophilic mesophytes challenged by the environmental pressures imposed or exacerbated by drought and heat stress. There is evidence that in stressed plants the biosynthesis of isoprene is uncoupled from photosynthesis. Because the biosynthesis of isoprene is costly, the great investment of carbon and energy into isoprene must have relevant functional reasons. Isoprene is effective in preserving the integrity of thylakoid membranes, not only through direct interaction with their lipid acyl chains, but also by up-regulating proteins associated with photosynthetic complexes and enhancing the biosynthesis of relevant membrane components, such as mono- and di-galactosyl-diacyl glycerols and unsaturated fatty acids. Isoprene may additionally protect photosynthetic membranes by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Here we explore the mode of actions and the potential significance of isoprene in the response of hygrophilic plants when challenged by severe stress conditions associated to rapid climate change in temperate climates, with special emphasis to the concomitant effect of drought and heat. We suggest that isoprene emission may be not a good estimate for its biosynthesis and concentration in severely droughted leaves, being the internal concentration of isoprene the important trait for stress protection. © 2017 Fini, Brunetti, Loreto, Centritto, Ferrini and Tattini.","Climate change; Drought and heat stress; Fast-growing plants; Isoprene biosynthesis vs Isoprene emission; Membrane protection; Stomatal conductance",,2-s2.0-85026466961

However, these data are often unavailable. This paper presents a method that relies on Random Forest (RF) models to distribute alien species presence counts at a finer resolution grid, thus achieving spatial downscaling. A bootstrapping scheme is designed to account for sub-setting uncertainty, and subsets are used to train a sufficiently large number of RF models. RF results are processed to estimate variable importance and model performance. The methodis testedwith an ∼8 ×8km2 gridcontaining floral alien species presence and several potentially exploratory indices of climatic, habitat, land use, and soil property covariates for the Mediterranean island of Crete, Greece. Alien species presence is aggregated at 16 × 16 km2 and used as a predictor of presence at the original resolution, thus simulating spatial downscaling. Uncertainty assessment of the spatial downscaling of alien species’ occurrences was also performed and true/false presences and absences were quantified. The approach is promising for downscaling alien species datasets of larger spatial scale but coarse resolution, where the underlying environmental information is available at a finer resolution. Furthermore, the RF architecture allows for tuning toward operationally optimal sensitivity and specificity, thus providing a decision support tool for designing a resource efficient alien species census. © 2017 Daliakopoulos, Katsanevakis and Moustakas.","Alien species; Crete; Data analytics; Downscaling; Hydro-ecological data; Random forests; Vascular plants",,2-s2.0-85027690709

Recent empirical work suggests that climatic mismatches between native and invasive ranges are pervasive. Whether these differences are due to adaptation to new climatic spaces in the invasive range or due to partial filling of the potential climatic space are still subject to debate. Here, we analyze climatic niche dynamics associated with the invasion of the two most common invasive plants in Brazilian semi-arid areas, Prosopis juliflora and Prosopis pallida. These species have been simultaneously introduced in the region, which creates a unique opportunity to compare their niche dynamics during invasion. Given that P. juliflora have a much wider native range size, we expect these species would present different dispersal potentials, which might translate into different unfilling levels. Using an ordination method with kernel smoother and null models, we contrasted climate spaces occupied by each species in both native and invasive ranges. We further used ecological niche models (ENMs) to compare reciprocal predictions of potentially suitable areas. Against our expectation based on differences in native range sizes, climatic niches of P. juliflora and P. pallida overlapped greatly, both in their native and invasive ranges. Our results support niche conservatism during the invasion process. Climatic mismatches among native and invaded ranges were exclusively attributed to unfilling of native climates in the invasive range. Both species showed similar unfilling levels. Likewise, ENMs predicted regions not yet occupied in the invasive range, revealing a potential for further expansion. We discuss colonization time lag and founder effect as potential mechanisms that may have prevented these species to fully occupy their native niches in the invasive range. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG","Alien species; Caatinga; Maxent; Mesquite; Niche shift; Sympatry",,2-s2.0-85025810575

Invasion dynamics generally show recursive patterns across species and regions, where initial lag is followed by spread and eventual dominance phases. However, timing and modes of these phases are highly variable, emerging from the interplay between traits of the invader and characteristics of the invaded landscape. Disentangling this interplay is particularly arduous in species with complex life-histories, where an individual passes through different life stages that alter physiology, behaviour and interactions with the environment. Here, we describe an age structured model that can be utilized to simulate population dynamics of invasive pond-breeding anurans. The model follows a spatially structured population approach, each pond representing a discrete habitat patch that exchanges individuals with other similar patches, and simulates change in survival and dispersal behaviour as a function of age. It also integrates dispersal with landscape complexity through landscape resistance modelling to depict functional connectivity across the pond network. Then we apply the model to a case study, the invasion of the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis in Cape Town, first detected in 2000. Age-structured demographic and spatial dynamics of the focal population are reconstructed in a network of 415 ponds embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. Parameterization is conducted through field and laboratory surveys, a literature review and data collected during an ongoing extirpation from 2010. We use the model to explore: i) occurrence and duration of lag phase; ii) whether the spatial spread fits an accelerating or a linear trend; iii) how simulated dynamics match field observations. Additionally we test model sensitivity to demographic and behavioural traits. We found a lag phase in both demographic and spatial dynamics; however the lag duration of these dynamics does not coincide, where invaders start to spread across the pond network five years before the demographic explosion. Also, we found that the spatial spread fits an accelerating trend that causes complete invasion of the network in six years. Such dynamics noticeably match field observations and confirmed patterns previously detected in other invaders characterized by high dispersal abilities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that it would have been preferable to quantify initial propagule size and post-metamorphic survival in the field; both timing and modes of invasion are particularly sensitive to these parameters. We conclude that the model has potential to forecast amphibian invasion dynamics and test management countermeasures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dispersal; Invasive amphibians; Lag phase; Sclerophrys gutturalis; Spatial spread; Spatially structured models","Complex networks; Lakes; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Sensitivity analysis; Dispersal; Invasive amphibians; Lag phase; Sclerophrys gutturalis; Spatial spread; Structured model; Dynamics; age structure; amphibian; biological invasion; dispersal; landscape change; literature review; pond culture; population dynamics; population structure; propagule; Cape Town; South Africa; Western Cape; Amphibia; Anura",2-s2.0-85018886924

The objective of this study was to assess long-term, net changes to upper canopy structure in sub-montane forests on the eastern slope of Mauna Kea volcano, Hawai‘i, in the context of continuing climate events, insect outbreaks, and biological invasion. We used high-resolution multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to quantify near-decadal net changes in forest canopy height and gap distributions at a critical transition between alien invaded lowland and native sub-montane forest at the end of a recent drought and host-specific insect (Scotorythra paludicola) outbreak. We found that sub-montane forests have experienced a net loss in average canopy height, and therefore structure and aboveground carbon stock. Additionally, where invasive alien tree species co-dominate with native trees, the upper canopy structure became more homogeneous. Tracking the loss of forest canopy height and spatial variation with airborne LiDAR is a cost-effective way to monitor forest canopy health, and to track and quantify ecological impacts of invasive species through space and time. © 2017 Balzotti and Asner.","Carnegie airborne observatory; Forest change; Forest gaps; Invasive species; Lidar; Remote sensing",,2-s2.0-85026450825

It can function as a wind break, and it stabilizes sand and soil, and it conserves water. Predicting the impact of climate change on the spatial distribution of V. trifolia var. simplicifolia may provide a scientific basis and reference for the sustainable use of this important plant. Using a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model, we simulated the geographical distribution of V. trifolia under the current climatic conditions in China based on species presence data at 126 locations and data for 22 environmental factors. Then, we used the model to predict the future distributions of V. trifolia in two periods (2050s and 2070s) under four different climate change scenarios. The results showed that the MaxEnt model was highly accurate (mean area under ROC curve, 0.988). The main climatic factors influencing the geographic distribution of V. trifolia were altitude, mean diurnal air temperature range, precipitation in the coldest quarter, and precipitation in the driest month. The model simulations indicated that, under the four scenarios, V. trifolia will widen its distribution because of a rapid increase in suitable habitat areas and a slow increase in marginally suitable habitat areas. During the period of 2041-2060, the potential distribution area of suitable habitat would increase from the current ratio of 5.03% to 15.88%, 17.00%, 17.59%, and 23.11% under scenarios 1-4, respectively. The potential distribution area of marginally suitable habitat would increase from the current ratio of 8.86% to 11.09%, 10.31%, 11.53%, and 12.96% under scenarios 1-4, respectively. During the period of 2061-2080, the potential distribution area of suitable habitat would increase to 21.22%, 22.21%, 24.57%, and 30.66% under scenarios 1-4, respectively, and the potential distribution area of marginally suitable habitat would increase to 11.85%, 12.07%, 13.99%, and 14.66% under scenarios 1-4, respectively. In terms of the spatial distribution of the potential habitat area of V. trifolia, both the distributional range and the center of distribution of suitable and marginally suitable habitat areas would shift from coastal areas to inland. The distribution of suitable habitat area in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces would increase rapidly. Especially in Sichuan Province, where there is only a small percentage of marginally suitable habitat area currently, the potential marginally suitable habitat area would increase, and the suitable habitat area would appear and increase rapidly under climate change.

Recurring introductions over the last 50 yr have led to the establishment of feral Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas populations throughout Europe. In the northern countries, Sweden and Norway, the species first occurred in large numbers in 2006. Here, we investigated the relative importance of introduction via re-laying of cultured oysters imported for consumption from France, Ireland or the Netherlands, and dispersal of oyster larvae by ocean currents from wild oyster populations in Denmark. Using microsatellite DNA markers, we estimated genetic differentiation among Pacific oysters collected at 4 Swedish locations, 3 Norwegian locations and 9 potential source locations in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and France. All Swedish samples and 1 Norwegian sample (Tromlingene) were genetically similar to each other and the Danish samples and showed significant genetic differentiation from all other populations. Consequently, it appears that the Pacific oyster populations in Sweden, Denmark and Tromlingene are closely connected and/or share a recent origin. The 2 remaining Norwegian samples (Hui and Espevik) differed from each other and all other populations, but showed similarities to wild oyster samples from Scandinavia and Ireland, respectively. Overall, the results underline a complex origin of Norwegian oysters, with gene flow from Swedish/Danish populations, as well as other unidentified sources. The apparent connectivity among most of the Scandinavian populations has implications for regional management of this invasive species, and highlights possible scenarios for other marine invasive species with a similar life history. © The authors 2017.

CS was first undertaken in 1978 to monitor ecological and land use change in Britain using standardised procedures for recording ecological data from representative 1km squares throughout the country. The same sites, with some additional squares, were used for subsequent surveys of vegetation undertaken in 1990, 1998 and 2007, with the intention of future surveys. Other data records include soils, freshwater habitats and invertebrates, and land cover and landscape feature diversity and extents. These data have been recorded in the same locations on analogous dates. However, the present paper describes only the details of the vegetation surveys. The survey design is a series of gridded, stratified, randomly selected 1km squares taken as representative of classes derived from a statistical environmental classification of Britain. In the 1978 survey, 256 one-kilometre sample squares were recorded, increasing to 506 in 1990, 569 in 1998 and 591 in 2007. Initially each square contained up to 11 dispersed vegetation plots but additional plots were later placed in different features so that eventually up to 36 additional sampling plots were recorded, all of which can be relocated where possible (unless the plot has been lost, for example as a consequence of building work), providing a total of 16992 plots by 2007. Plots are estimated to have a precise relocation accuracy of 85%. A range of plots located in different land cover types and landscape features (for example, field boundaries) are included. Although a range of analyses have already been carried out, with changes in the vegetation being related to a range of drivers at local and national scales, there is major potential for further analyses, for example in relation to climate change.

As a result, alien noise (including repetitive impulse noise) is the new dominant source of impairment for downstream (DS) VDSL. At the CPE, an additional common mode (CM) sensor can sense the electromagnetically coupled alien noise signal which can then be used to cancel the alien noise coupling into the differential mode (DM) signal. The intermittent and repetitive nature of the noise sources necessitates that the CM sensor based noise cancellation algorithm be capable of training and adapting during data mode in the presence of the useful data signal, since the presence of alien noise cannot be guaranteed during modem training phase. In this work, we propose a novel two stage frequency domain algorithm based on a per-tone cancellation model for this purpose. The proposed algorithm outperforms previously proposed time domain algorithms in terms of convergence speed in many practical scenarios due to the decision directed nature of the proposed algorithm. We also analyse the theoretical convergence of the algorithm, which is also validated by the simulation experiments.

An emerging issue, however, is that food wasted by humans is often accessible to wildlife, affecting wildlife ecology and behaviour, as well as ecological processes and community dynamics. Here we highlight the extent of such impacts, drawing on examples from mammalian predators and other taxonomic groups. We then develop two conceptual models. The first shows how wildlife access to food waste can exacerbate human-wildlife conflicts. The second highlights that when food waste is removed, the effects on wildlife and ecosystem processes should be monitored. The conceptual models are important when considering that large quantities of food waste are intentionally and unintentionally provided to wildlife around the world. We conclude there is an urgent need to change the way people currently manage the food we produce. © 2017 by the authors.","Conservation; Food waste; Human-wildlife conflict; Predator","community dynamics; conservation status; food waste; mammal; nature-society relations; predator; Mammalia",2-s2.0-85025472008

The current study measures 61 sustainable indigenous tourism indicators of the Mah Meri ethnic group that comprise three constructs, namely, community resources, community development and sustainable tourism. Simple random sampling was employed for data elicitation and a weighted average score using R software as the basis of analysis was used to produce a sustainable indigenous tourism barometer (SITB). The study identifies 11 sustainability dimensions from the initial three main constructs that are treated as the relationship aspects in this study. Based on the Sustainable Indigenous Tourism Barometer (SITB), community participation, empowerment, economic and socio-cultural sustainability are found to be the main influencing dimensions of sustainability of the Mah Meri ethnic group.

Modern animal breeding strategies predominantly based on marker-assisted and genomic selection, artificial insemination, and embryo transfer have led to significant improvement in the performance of domestic animals, and are the basis for regular supply of high quality animal derived food. However, the current strategy of breeding animals over multiple generations to introduce novel traits is not realistic in responding to the unprecedented challenges such as changing climate, pandemic diseases, and feeding an anticipated 3 billion increase in global population in the next three decades. Consequently, sophisticated genetic modifications that allow for seamless introgression of novel alleles or traits and introduction of precise modifications without affecting the overall genetic merit of the animal are required for addressing these pressing challenges. The requirement for precise modifications is especially important in the context of modeling human diseases for the development of therapeutic interventions.

We compare the temporal and spatial patterns of transpiration and the stem basal area increments of alder, black poplar, common ash and black locust, all of them co-occurring in a mixed riparian Mediterranean forest. Black locust presented the lowest transpiration values per basal area unit (4.0 mm·m−2·growing season−1). Although tree transpiration was mainly driven by energy availability instead of water, ash transpiration was constrained by water availability at soil water contents below 0.08 cm3·cm−3. Black locust was the only tree species growing all over the water availability gradient present in the study site, and it did not present any significant difference in sap flow values across this gradient. Furthermore, black locust and black poplar were the species with higher growth-based water use efficiency (5.4 g·cm−1·m−3 and 3.6 g·cm−1·m−3, respectively); ash and alder were the less efficient ones (2.8 g·cm−1·m−3 and 1.9 g·cm−1·m−3respectively).

Marine litter densities amounted to 43 ± 33 kg km−2 and 74 ± 28 items km−2, with plastics and fisheries derived litter being the most widespread categories. Litter densities generally decreased along the water depth axis. To identify possible drivers for the observed litter distribution we performed a generalised additive model, which explained 14.8% of the variance and pointed to densely populated areas, number of fishing ports, geographical sector and fishing activity as the main explanatory factors. The most important driver for the benthic litter distribution was human population, as litter density linearly increased along this variable. Similarly, the number of ports in neighbouring areas had a positive effect on litter densities. Fishing effort had a negative and non-linear effect on benthic litter density which could be explained by litter delocalization during fishing operations. We hypothesise that litter might accumulate preferentially on the periphery of rocky bottoms, out of reach for our sampling methodology. Litter distribution differed among geographical sectors, pointing to other variables such as shipping traffic and oceanographic currents, which were not explicitly considered in the analysis. Our study sets a reference level for benthic macro-litter in the southern Bay of Biscay and identifies factors driving its distribution, which can be extrapolated to other continental shelf seas.

Mastication converts trees into small pieces (e.g., wood chips), in the process creating canopy openings, redistributing fuel from the canopy to the surface, converting large diameter to small diameter fuels, and covering the ground with piles of woody debris. We measured vegetation and fuels at 192 sites in 24 pairs of 1–11-year-old mastication treatments and untreated adjacent controls in P-J woodlands of the Arkansas River valley, Colorado, and used paired t-tests, mixed-effects models, and gradient analysis (non-metric multidimensional scaling) to assess mastication effects. Treatments were associated with major, persistent ecological shifts relative to controls. Tree cover and canopy fuels were reduced in treatments; concomitantly, dead and down woody surface fuels, forb, and graminoid cover were elevated. Treatments exhibited much higher frequency, richness, and cover by a suite of non-native plant species including cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). Non-native plant expansion appears linked to the disturbance associated with treatment activities, reductions in tree canopy, and alterations to ground cover, and effective mitigation of increases by these species may necessitate both pre- and post-treatment control measures. Shifts from native-dominated woodlands to open, weedy, herb- and shrub-dominated communities are likely to change patterns of abundance and habitat use by woodland- and forest-dependent wildlife. Decreased canopy fuels and increased herbaceous surface fuels including exotic annuals are expected to alter potential fire behavior. We encourage managers carrying out P-J mastication projects to explicitly address potential trade-offs between desired treatment outcomes and potentially unwelcome impacts, and how these might be mitigated. It may also be worth considering whether or not tree removal treatments will be warranted given anticipated climate change impacts to these woodlands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cheatgrass; Chipping; Hydro-ax; Juniperus monosperma; Juniperus scopulorum; Mulching; Pinus edulis; Pinyon; Shredding; Wildfire","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Forestry; Managers; Mastication; Plant expansion; Plants (botany); Vegetation; Wood fuels; Wood products; Cheatgrass; Chipping; Hydro-ax; Juniperus monosperma; Juniperus scopulorum; Mulching; Pinus edulis; Pinyon; Shredding; Wildfire; Fuels; canopy gap; coarse woody debris; coniferous forest; environmental disturbance; fire management; forest management; grass; introduced species; mulching; wildfire; woodland; Chipping; Forest Fires; Pinus Edulis; Shredding; Arkansas Valley; Colorado; United States; Bromus tectorum; Juniperus; Juniperus monosperma; Juniperus scopulorum; Pinus edulis",2-s2.0-85018501418

Analysis of CSN1b mutant phenotypes revealed a requirement for the COP9 signalosome to prevent ectopic expression of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) target genes. It does so by protecting Capicua, a transcriptional repressor of EGFR target genes, from EGFR pathway-dependent ubiquitylation by a Cullin 1/SKP1-related A/Archipelago E3 ligase and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The CSN1b subunit also maintains basal Capicua levels by protecting it from a separate mechanism of degradation that is independent of EGFR signaling.

Plant pathogen detection is important as first step to manage a plant disease in greenhouses, field conditions and at the country boarders. Current immunological techniques used to detect pathogens in plant include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and direct tissue blot immunoassays (DTBIA). DNA-based techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time PCR (RT-PCR) and dot blot hybridization have also been proposed for pathogen identification and detection. However these methodologies are time-consuming and require complex instruments, being not suitable for in-situ analysis. Consequently, there is strong interest for developing new biosensing systems for early detection of plant diseases with high sensitivity and specificity at the point-of-care. In this context, we revise here the recent advancement in the development of advantageous biosensing systems for plant pathogen detection based on both antibody and DNA receptors. The use of different nanomaterials such as nanochannels and metallic nanoparticles for the development of innovative and sensitive biosensing systems for the detection of pathogens (i.e. bacteria and viruses) at the point-of-care is also shown. Plastic and paper-based platforms have been used for this purpose, offering cheap and easy-to-use really integrated sensing systems for rapid on-site detection. Beside devices developed at research and development level a brief revision of commercially available kits is also included in this review. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Antigen; Bacteria; Biosensor; DNA; Nanomaterial; Plant pathogen; Point-of-care; Virus","Antigens; Bacteria; Biosensors; Chemical detection; DNA; Losses; Microorganisms; Nanostructured materials; Polymerase chain reaction; Viruses; Dot-blot hybridization; Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Metallic nanoparticles; Pathogen identification; Pathogenic microorganisms; Plant pathogen; Point of care; Research and development; Pathogens; DNA; gold nanoparticle; metal nanoparticle; nanochannel; nanomaterial; Article; bacterium detection; biosensor; colorimetry; direct tissue blot immunoassay; DNA determination; DNA hybridization; dot hybridization; electrochemical analysis; electrochemical immunosensor; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorescence analysis; immunoassay; lateral flow immunoassay; microarray analysis; microfluidics; microorganism detection; nonhuman; optical biosensor; plant disease; polymerase chain reaction; potentiometry; quartz crystal microbalance; real time polymerase chain reaction; surface plasmon resonance; virus detection; bacterium; fungus; genetic procedures; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; pathogenicity; plant; plant disease; virology; virus; Bacteria; Biosensing Techniques; Fungi; Plant Diseases; Plants; Viruses",2-s2.0-85006100130

These factors are influenced by climate, age and stand structural attributes including stand density and tree species diversity or species composition. However, such covariates are rarely included in biomass and leaf area equations. We reviewed the literature and built a database of biomass and leaf area equations for 24 European tree species and 3 introduced species. The final dataset contained 973 equations. Most of the equations were site-specific and therefore restricted to the edaphic, climatic and stand structural conditions of the given site. To overcome this limitation, the database was used to develop regional species-specific equations that can be used in a wide range of stands and to quantify the effects of climate, age and stand structure on biomass or leaf area. The analysis showed considerable inter- and intra-specific variability in biomass relationships. The intra-specific variability was related to climate, age or stand characteristics, while the inter-specific variability was correlated with traits such as wood density, specific leaf area and shade tolerance. The analysis also showed that foliage mass is more variable than stem or total aboveground biomass, both within and between species, and these biomass components have contrasting responses to age and changes in stand structure. Despite the large number of published equations, many species are still not well represented. Therefore, generic equations were developed that include species-specific wood density instead of species identity. Further improvements may be possible if future studies quantify the stand structure of individual tree neighbourhoods instead of using the stand means for all trees sampled with the given stand. © 2017 The Authors","Allometry; Forest growth; Pseudo-observations; Shade tolerance; Specific leaf area; Wood density","Biology; Biomass; Carbon; Ecology; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Plants (botany); Allometry; Forest growth; Pseudo-observations; Shade tolerance; Specific leaf area; Wood density; Forestry; age; allometry; data set; database; equation; forest dynamics; growth; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; leaf area; phytomass; shade tolerance; stand structure; tree; wood; Forests; Growth; Wood Density; Europe",2-s2.0-85018883972

Because wildfires currently impact an increasing proportion of the total area burned, land managers need to better understand reburns – in which previously burned areas can modify the patterns and severity of subsequent fires. For example, knowing how long past fire boundaries can function as barriers to fire spread may empower decision-makers to manage some wildfires as large-scale fuel treatments, or alternatively, determine where prescribed burning or strategic wildfire management are required. Additionally, a clear understanding of how prior burn mosaics influence future fire spread and burn severity is critical knowledge for landscape and fire-dependent wildlife habitat planning under a rapidly changing climate. Here, we review published studies on reburns in fire-adapted ecosystems of the world, including temperate forests of North America, semi-arid forests and rangelands, tropical and subtropical forests, grasslands and savannas, and Mediterranean ecosystems. To date, research on reburns is unevenly distributed across the world with a relative abundance of literature in Australia, Europe and North America and a scarcity of studies in Africa, Asia and South America. This review highlights the complex role of repeated fires in modifying vegetation and fuels, and patterns of subsequent wildfires. In fire-prone ecosystems, the return of fire is inevitable, and legacies of past fires, or their absence, often dictate the characteristics of subsequent fires. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Fire regimes; Fire-dependent ecosystems; Grasslands; Savannas; Semi-arid forests; Wildland fire","Climate change; Decision making; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fire regimes; Grasslands; Savannas; Semi arid; Wildland fire; Fires; climate change; decision making; ecosystem management; fire; global change; grassland; habitat management; prescribed burning; research work; savanna; semiarid region; temperate forest; wildfire; wildlife management; Climates; Forest Fires; Forests; Africa; Asia; Australia; Europe; North America; South America",2-s2.0-85018958216

Yet current breath monitoring technologies are inconvenient and intrusive. For instance, typical breath monitoring devices need to attach nasal probes or chest bands to users. Wireless sensing technologies have been applied to monitor breathing using radio waves without physical contact. Those wireless sensing technologies however require customized radios which are not readily available. More importantly, due to interference, such technologies do not work well with multiple users. With multiple users in presence, the detection accuracy of existing systems decreases dramatically. In this paper, we propose to monitor users' breathing using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID systems. In our system, passive lightweight RFID tags are attached to users' clothes and backscatter radio waves, and commodity RFID readers report low level data (e.g., phase values). We track periodic body movement due to inhaling and exhaling by analyzing the low level data reported by commodity readers. To enhance the measurement robustness, we synthesize data streams from an array of multiple tags to improve the monitoring accuracy. Our design follows the standard EPC protocol which arbitrates collisions in the presence of multiple tags. We implement a prototype the breath monitoring system with commodity RFID systems. The experiment results show that the prototype system can simultaneously monitor breathing with high accuracy even with the presence of multiple users. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Distributed computer systems; Radio waves; Breath monitoring; Commercial off-the shelves; Detection accuracy; Existing systems; Monitoring accuracy; Physical contacts; Prototype system; Wireless sensing; Monitoring",2-s2.0-85027276405

The transpulmonary pressure-related side effects primarily account for ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) while the pleural pressure-related side effects primarily account for hemodynamic alterations. The changes of transpulmonary pressure and pleural pressure resulting from a given applied driving pressure depend on the relative elastances of the lung and chest wall. The term 'volutrauma' should refer to excessive strain, while 'barotrauma' should refer to excessive stress. Strains exceeding 1.5, corresponding to a stress above ~20 cmH2O in humans, are severely damaging in experimental animals. Apart from high tidal volumes and high transpulmonary pressures, the respiratory rate and inspiratory flow may also play roles in the genesis of VILI. We do not know which fraction of mortality is attributable to VILI with ventilation comparable to that reported in recent clinical practice surveys (tidal volume ~7.5 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ~8 cmH2O, rate ~20 bpm, associated mortality ~35%). Therefore, a more complete and individually personalized understanding of ARDS lung mechanics and its interaction with the ventilator is needed to improve future care. Knowledge of functional lung size would allow the quantitative estimation of strain. The determination of lung inhomogeneity/stress raisers would help assess local stresses; the measurement of lung recruitability would guide PEEP selection to optimize lung size and homogeneity. Finding a safety threshold for mechanical power, normalized to functional lung volume and tissue heterogeneity, may help precisely define the safety limits of ventilating the individual in question. When a mechanical ventilation set cannot be found to avoid an excessive risk of VILI, alternative methods (such as the artificial lung) should be considered. © 2017 The Author(s).","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; Mechanical power; Mechanical ventilation; Ventilator-induced lung injury","adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial lung; artificial ventilation; breathing rate; clinical practice; human; lung barotrauma; lung injury; lung mechanics; lung pressure; lung volume; mortality; negative pressure ventilation; nonhuman; peak inspiratory flow; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; Review; thorax pressure; tidal volume; ventilator induced lung injury",2-s2.0-85023195127

UAS are particularly useful in environmental monitoring and management because they have the capability to provide data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, data acquisition costs are lower than those of conventional methods such as extensive ground sampling, manned airplanes, or satellites. Small fixed-wing UAS in particular offer further potential benefits as they extend the operational coverage of the area under study at lower operator risks and accelerate data deployment times. Taking these aspects into account, UAS might be an effective tool to support management of invasive plant based on early detection and regular monitoring. A straightforward UAS approach to map invasive plant species is presented in this study with the intention of providing ready-to-use field maps essential for action-oriented management. Our UAS utilizes low-cost sensors, free-of-charge software for mission planning and an affordable, commercial aerial platform to reduce operational costs, reducing expenses with personnel while increasing overall efficiency.

This study aims to predict the global areas for potential distribution of this plant based on multiple ecological niche models. Methods A total of 220 global distribution points of G. elata and 19 ecological variables were compiled and eight environmental variables were selected for the model training. Three ecological niche models, including BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, and MAXENT, were used to predict the global areas for potential distribution of G. elata. The resulting data of different models were analyzed and compared with two statistical criteria: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Kappa value. Important findings The predictions of the three models are basically identical, showing that the global areas for potential distribution of G. elata are predominantly in the range of 20° N to 50° N in Asia, mainly in China, South Korea and Japan. A small proportion of the suitable areas occur in India, Nepal and the European countries near Mediterranean. The most suitable areas distribute in provinces close to the Sichuan Basin and the central East China, the mid-eastern parts of South Korea such as Chungcheongbuk-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeongsangnamdo, and the Kyushu region and the Shikoku region on Japan's main island. Therefore, these three countries can be used as the main production areas of G. elata for its commercial development. The AUC average values of the three models are all above 0.9 and the Kappa average values all above 0.65, justifying their applications for predicting the potential areas of G. elata.

Iran, the second-most accessed country for refugees from Afghanistan, has achieved maternal health improvement. However, Afghan women with near-miss morbidity faced pre-hospital delays and disparity in maternal care at hospitals. This study explores experiences of maternal care among Afghan women surviving near-miss morbidity to increase insight into healthcare improvements for migrants. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted at university hospitals in Tehran, from April 2013 to May 2014. A total of 11 Afghan women and 4 husbands were interviewed when women recovered from near-miss morbidity that occurred around the childbirth period. Mothers were identified prospectively using the WHO maternal near-miss approach. Thematic analysis was used along with a data-driven approach to organize data guided by the 'three delays model' theoretical framework. Results: Mistreatment in the form of discrimination and insufficient medical attention were key experiences. Participants commonly perceived poor women-professional communication and delays in recognizing obstetric complications despite repeated care-seeking. Financial constraints, costly care, lack of health insurance, and low literacy were experienced barriers to accessing care to a lesser extent. Non-somatic consequences of near-miss morbidity affected mothers and families for extended periods. Conclusions: Near-miss survivors' experiences provided remarkable insights into maternal care of Afghans in Iran. The challenge for the health system and professionals is to provide equitable care with dignity and improve communication skills with caring attitudes toward ethnic minorities. Antenatal visits provide the best and most appropriate opportunities to tackle health illiteracy in Afghan women. © 2017 The Author(s).","Afghan migrants; Care experiences; Discrimination; Iran; Maternal near miss; Mistreatment","communication; equity; health care; health insurance; health services; health status; health worker; immigrant; maternal health; morbidity; qualitative analysis; questionnaire survey; racial disparity; refugee; theoretical study; Afghan; Article; cesarean section; childbirth; conceptual framework; controlled study; ethnic group; female; health care; health care disparity; health care system; health insurance; human; income; interview; Iran; male; married person; maternal care; maternal mortality; maternal welfare; migrant; morbidity; Muslim; patient care; personal experience; pregnancy; priority journal; prospective study; qualitative research; refugee; survivor; thematic analysis; therapy delay; university hospital; verbal hostility; Afghanistan; Iran; Tehran [Iran]",2-s2.0-85022214599

We use historical data and current field data from introduced parasitoids that attack an endemic Lepidoptera species in Hawaii to validate a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) procedure for non-target impacts. We use data on known host range and habitat use in the place of origin of the parasitoids to determine whether contemporary levels of non-target parasitism could have been predicted using PRA. Our results show that reasonable predictions of potential non-target impacts may be made if comprehensive data are available from places of origin of biological control agents, but scant data produce poor predictions. Using apparent mortality data rather than marginal attack rate estimates in PRA resulted in over-estimates of predicted non-target impact.

From sci-fi alien women to teenage bad girls, filmmakers continue to draw on the notion of the sexy deadly woman in ways which traverse boundaries of genre and narrative. This book charts the articulations of the femme fatale in American cinema of the past twenty years, and contends that, despite her problematic relationship with feminism, she offers a vital means for reading the connections between mainstream cinema and representations of female agency. The films discussed raise questions about the limits and potential of positioning women who meet highly normative standards of beauty as powerful icons of female agency. They point towards the constant shifting between patriarchal appropriation and feminist recuperation that inevitably accompanies such representations within mainstream media contexts. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

It is based on the premise that both employer and employee are vulnerable to various social, economic, and political forces, although differently so. It demonstrates how in responding to those complementary institutional relationships of employer and employee the state unequally and inequitably favors employers over employees. Several chapters included in this collection also consider how the state shapes, creates and maintains through law the social identities of employer and employee and how that legal regime operates as the allocation of power and privilege. This unique and fundamental role of the state in defining the employment relationship profoundly affects the respective abilities and degree of resiliency of actual employers and employees. Other chapters explore how attention to the respective vulnerability and resilience of those who do and those who direct work in assessing the employment relationship can raise fundamental questions of social justice and suggest new avenues for critical engagement with labor and employment law. Collectively, these pieces articulate a framework for imaging what would constitute an appropriately ""Responsive State"" in the employment context and how those interested in social justice might begin to use the concepts of vulnerability and resilience in their arguments. © 2018 Martha Albertson Fineman and Jonathan W.

Photoperiods totaled 24 h, with three trials of 8:16, 12:12 and 16:8 light:dark hour regimes for the RIL population, and these plus 10:14 and 14:10 for the experiments with S. viridis alone. The response of S. viridis to light intensity as well as photoperiod was assessed by duplicating photoperiods at two light intensities (300 and 600 µmol.m−2.s−1). In general, day lengths longer than 12 h delayed flowering time, although flowering time was also delayed in shorter day-lengths relative to the 12 h trial, even when daily flux in high intensity conditions exceeded that of the low intensity 12 h trial. Cluster analysis showed that the effect of photoperiod on flowering time differed between sets of RILs, with some being almost photoperiod insensitive and others being delayed with respect to the population as a whole in either short (8 or 12 h light) or long (16 h light) photoperiods. QTL results reveal a similar picture, with several major QTL colocalizing between the 8 and 12 h light trials, but with a partially different set of QTL identified in the 16 h trial. Major candidate genes for these QTL include several members of the PEBP protein family that includes Flowering Locus T (FT) homologs such as OsHd3a, OsRFT1, and ZCN8/12. Thus, Setaria is a short day plant (flowering quickest in short day conditions) whose flowering is delayed by long day lengths in a manner consistent with the responses of most other members of the grass family. However, the QTL results suggest that flowering time under long day conditions uses additional genetic pathways to those used under short day conditions. © 2017 Doust, Mauro-Herrera, Hodge and Stromski.","Flowering time; Foxtail millet; Green foxtail; Heading date; Long day; Photoperiod; Setaria; Short day",,2-s2.0-85026470284

However, monocultures settled around the Park resulted in extensive open areas that facilitate the establishment of alien species on the PESB perimeter, which may threaten native species conservation therein, since biological invasion is the second main cause of global biodiversity loss. In this region, there are also farmers planting agroforestry systems (AFS), characterized by tree-based intercropping, which are structurally more similar to the Atlantic Rainforest reminiscent fragments present in the region and may limit local occurrence of potentially invasive exotic weeds for several reasons, such as the high levels of shade provided by trees, the groundcover that result from loss of tree leaves and the increased competition for belowground resources. This study aimed to test whether AFS limit exotic species establishment when compared to monoculture systems. Accordingly, three coffee monocultures and three agroforestry coffee plantations around the PESB were studied. In each of the six study areas, 30 plots of 1 m2 were established between the lines of coffee plantation, where all species present were surveyed. In both treatments, rarefaction curves were constructed to evaluate native and exotic richness, and diversity of these two categories was estimated through Simpson index inverse (1/D). All 13 sampled exotic species were present in monocultures, but only three of them occurred in AFS. Besides, alien diversity in monocultures ((Formula presented.) = 2.173 ± 0.011) was significantly higher than in AFS ((Formula presented.) = 1.031 ± 0.001). Such changes in alien plant community between land-use show that AFSs limit invasive species establishment.

Invasive plants that are highly attractive to Anopheles mosquitoes provide them with sugar that is critical to their survival. The effect on Anopheles mosquito populations was examined through a habitat manipulation experiment that removed the flowering branches of highly attractive Prosopis juliflora from selected villages in Mali, West Africa. Methods: Nine villages in the Bandiagara district of Mali were selected, six with flowering Prosopis juliflora, and three without. CDC-UV light traps were used to monitor their Anopheles spp. vector populations, and recorded their species composition, population size, age structure, and sugar feeding status. After 8 days, all of the flowering branches were removed from three villages and trap catches were analysed again. Results: Villages where flowering branches of the invasive shrub Prosopis juliflora were removed experienced a threefold drop in the older more dangerous Anopheles females. Population density dropped by 69.4% and the species composition shifted from being a mix of three species of the Anopheles gambiae complex to one dominated by Anopheles coluzzii. The proportion of sugar fed females dropped from 73 to 15% and males from 77 to 10%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates how an invasive plant shrub promotes the malaria parasite transmission capacity of African malaria vector mosquitoes.

In this view, the Berlin Wall mattered more than the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and the Soviet intervention in Hungary was vastly more significant than Soviet intervention in Korea. It was only the fine balance of power in the northern theatre that redirected the attentions of the USA and the USSR elsewhere, and resulted in outbreaks of proxy warfare elsewhere in the globe - in Korea, in Vietnam and in Africa. Odd Arne Westad's triumph is to look at the history of these times through the other end of the telescope - to reconceptualize the Cold War as something that fundamentally happened in the Third World, not the First. The thesis he presents in The Global Cold War is highly creative. It upends much conventional wisdom and points out that the determining factor in the struggle was not geopolitics, but ideology - an ideology, moreover, that was heavily flavoured by elements of colonialist thinking that ought to have been alien to the mindsets of two avowedly anti-colonial superpowers. Westad's work is a fine example of the creative thinking skill of coming up with new connections and fresh solutions; it also never shies away from generating new hypotheses or redefining issues in order to see them in new ways. © 2017 by Macat International Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-85031671789

In this important and highly revisionist work, historian Sheila Fitzpatrick explains that a reimagining of the Communist state as a provider of goods for the 'deserving poor' can be seen as a powerful metaphor for understanding Soviet life as a whole. By positioning the state both as a provider and as a relief agency, Fitzpatrick establishes it as not so much a prison (the metaphor favoured by many of her predecessors), but more the agency that made possible a way of life. Fitzpatrick's real claim to originality, however, is to look at the relationship between the all-powerful totalitarian government and its own people from both sides - and to demonstrate that the Soviet people were not totally devoid of either agency or resources. Rather, they successfully developed practices that helped them to navigate everyday life at a time of considerable danger and multiple shortages. For many, Fitzpatrick shows, becoming an informer and reporting fellow citizens - even family and friends - to the state was a successful survival strategy. Fitzpatrick's work is noted mainly as an example of the critical thinking skill of reasoning; she marshals evidence and arguments to deliver a highly persuasive revisionist description of everyday life in Soviet time.

Mahmood's book is a study of women's participation in the Islamic revival across the Middle East. Mahmood - a feminist social anthropologist with left-wing, secular political values - wanted to understand why women should become such active participants in a movement that seemingly promoted their subjugation. As Mahmood observed, women's active participation in the conservative Islamic revival presented (and presents) a difficult question for Western feminists: how to balance cultural sensitivity and promotion of religious freedom and pluralism with the feminist project of women's liberation? Mahmood's response was to conduct a detailed evaluation of the arguments made by both sides, examining, in particular, the reasoning of female Muslims themselves. In a key moment of evaluation, Mahmood suggests that Western feminist notions of agency are inadequate to arguments about female Muslim piety. Where Western feminists often restrict definitions of women's agency to acts that undermine the normal, male-dominated order of things, Mahmood suggests, instead, that agency can encompass female acts that uphold apparently patriarchal values. Ultimately the Western feminist framework is, in her evaluation, inadequate and insufficient for discussing women's groups in the Islamic revival. © 2017 by Macat International Ltd.",,,2-s2.0-85031681889

Some argue that responsibility could be attributed to a robot if it possessed human-like autonomy and metavolitionality, and that while such capacities can potentially be possessed by a robot with a single spatially compact body, they cannot be possessed by a spatially disjunct, decentralized collective such as a robotic swarm or network. However, advances in ubiquitous robotics and distributed computing open the door to a new form of robotic entity that possesses a unitary intelligence, despite the fact that its cognitive processes are not confined within a single spatially compact, persistent, identifiable body. Such a ""nonlocalizable"" robot may possess a body whose myriad components interact with one another at a distance and which is continuously transforming as components join and leave the body. Here we develop an ontology for classifying such robots on the basis of their autonomy, volitionality, and localizability. Using this ontology, we explore the extent to which nonlocalizable robots-including those possessing cognitive abilities that match or exceed those of human beings-can be considered moral and legal actors that are responsible for their own actions. © 2016 Marco Nørskov.

We found three amino acid variations between the two sequences. Kinetic analysis with recombinant proteins revealed that AcFLS-HRB exhibited approximately 2-fold higher catalytic efficiencies than AcFLS-H6 for dihydroflavonol substrates and that both proteins preferred dihydroquercetin to dihydrokaempferol. The expression patterns of flavonoid biosynthesis genes corresponded to the accumulation patterns of flavonoid aglycones in both onions. Whereas the other flavonoid biosynthesis genes were weakly expressed in the HRB sheath compared to that of H6, the expression of FLS was similar in both onions. This relatively enhanced FLS expression, along with the higher activity of AcFLS-HRB, could increase the quercetin production in the HRB sheath. The quercetin content was approximately 12-fold higher than the cyanidin content in the H6 sheath, suggesting that FLS has priority in the competition between FLS and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) for their substrate dihydroquercetin. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","anthocyanins; flavonoid biosynthetic pathway; flavonol; flavonol synthase; kaempferol; onion; quercetin","Anthocyanins; Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Gene expression; Genes; Phenols; Plants (botany); Proteins; Recombinant proteins; Substrates; Biosynthetic pathway; flavonol; Flavonol synthase; Kaempferol; onion; quercetin; Flavonoids; flavonoid; flavonol synthase; oxidoreductase; plant protein; biosynthesis; chemical structure; chemistry; color; comparative study; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; kinetics; metabolism; onion; Color; Flavonoids; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Kinetics; Molecular Structure; Onions; Oxidoreductases; Plant Proteins",2-s2.0-85021864233

Recurrent drought and invasive encroaching plants are taking out plants that have cultural importance, and threaten the biodiversity and the associated traditional knowledge. Thus, the aim of the current study is to conduct an ethnobotanical survey and document medicinal and edible plants in Yalo Woreda in Afar regional state. Methods: A cross-sectional ethnobotanical study was carried out in eight kebeles of Yalo Woreda from October 2015 to December 2016. One hundred sixty informants were selected using purposive sampling. The data on diseases, medicinal and edible plants were collected using semi-structure interview and group discussion. The statistical methods, informant consensus factor, fidelity level, and preference ranking were conducted to analyze the data. Results: One hundred and six plants were reported; gender and age differences had implication on the number of plants reported by informants. The knowledge of medicinal plants among informants of each kebele was not different (p < 0.5) and was not associated in particular with the religious establishment in the kebeles (informant*kebeles, Eta square = 0.19). Family Fabaceae was the major plant species, and shrubs (44%) were dominant plants reported. Leaf (52.94%) and oral (68%) were primary plant part used for remedy preparation and route of application, respectively. The plants with low fidelity values Indigofera articulata (0.25), Cadaba farinosa (0.22), Cadaba rotundifolia (0.19), and Acalypha fruticosa (0.15) were used to treat the category of diseases with high informant consensus value (0.69). Sixteen edible plants were identified that were consumed during wet and dry seasons. Balanites aegyptiaca, Balanites rotundifolia, and Dobera glabra were 'famine food' that were collected and stored for years. Conclusion: People in Yalo Woreda are more dependent on natural resources of the area for their livelihood. The threat of climatic change and encroaching invasive plants on medicinal and edible plants affects the traditional use of plants in the Yalo Woreda. The conservation of the plants in the home garden and natural habitat and integration of edible plants into agroforestry development programs in sub-arid and arid regions has to be encouraged to conserve plants of medical and economic importance. © 2017 The Author(s).","Afar people; Edible plants; Ethiopia; Ethnobotanical study; Medicinal plants; Traditional knowledge; Yalo Woreda",,2-s2.0-85021742170

Policy-makers have selected the year 1800 as a time delimitation: the use of plant species introduced later is to be regulated or even forbidden. Looking back in history, the perception of the introduction of plants between 1750 and 1900 differs from present attitudes. Introduced plants were once regarded as positive contributions that could be used to demonstrate botanic skills and wealth, as well as garden owners’ skills in cultivating them. At present, many of the plant species that were once desirable are now regarded as threatening ‘aliens’.

The conventional view is states have some authority in restricting its borders. Others reject this and argue for open borders. Two restrictionist perspectives are critically evaluated: Wellman’s (2011) and Macedo’s (2007). The former deontological view argues because legitimate states have a right to self-determination and freedom of association is integral to political self-determination therefore legitimate states have a right to exclude. The latter offers an iteration of the threats to the public order argument, namely, that because high levels of immigration contribute to the creation of poverty and increase levels of unemployment then the U.S. should restrict immigration. This paper thinks though some of the ways of avoiding the limits of the political ontologies undergirding their idealized notions of states which inform their analyses of political self-determination and the way immigrants get cast as causes of poverty (i.e. threats to the economic order of a state). As a way of opening up a more realist conceptual path that can reorient discussions in the ethics of immigration I suggest attention be given to the colonial histories that constitute the making of the borders circumscribing states. When colonial considerations are taken into account of discussions in the ethics of immigration I argue states should be conceived not so much in terms of thinly nonconsensual coercive institutions but in terms of states of violence. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","colonialism; Immigration; Latin America; race; violence",,2-s2.0-84974853391

The main arguments are (1) that the im/mobility of a social or cultural group has major impact on how identity narratives, a sense of belonging and relationships to ‘others’ are shaped, and vice versa, and (2) that these dynamics are closely interlinked with mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion between groups and power structures that involve a broad variety of actors. Mainly looking at patterns of internal mobility such as ‘traditional’ or strategic mobilities and mobilities enforced by crisis, conflict or governmental programmes and regimes, the contribution provides the conceptual background for a special issue that aims to go beyond currently predominant issues of transnational migration. Established or emerging dynamics of (non-)integration and belonging, caused by im/mobility, are analysed on a cultural and political level, which involves questions of representation, indigeneity/autochthony, political rights and access to land and other resources. Conflict situations in contexts of mobility involve changes in the social understanding and renegotiation, reconstruction or reproduction of group identities and narratives with reference to certain socio-political and historical patterns. The legitimation of rights and access to various forms of citizenship and mobility need to be understood against the backdrop of emerging or established mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion between groups, which trigger or settle conflicts and make social identities to be constantly renegotiated. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","belonging; citizenship; collective identities; conflict; inclusion and exclusion; indigeneity; Mobility; power","citizenship; conceptual framework; ethnic conflict; indigenous population; mobility; national identity; political power; social exclusion; social inclusion",2-s2.0-85011650551

There was no relationship between management scores and species richness, diversity and percentage native. Significant relationships were evident between woody plant species richness and course income, number of grounds staff, number of club members and greenkeepers’ years of experience. These results suggest a complex suite of factors that play a role in the woody plant composition of urban golf courses and their contribution to urban biodiversity. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biodiversity; green space; greenkeeper; management; out of play; urbanisation","biodiversity; GIS; golf course; greenspace; habitat management; perception; species richness; urban planning; urbanization; woody plant; Eastern Cape; South Africa",2-s2.0-85019584325

To better assess what adults might be learning, we employed a critical, qualitative approach to examine how contemporary news media constructed cultural understandings of teens’ relationship with social media. Our analysis of 339 print and online news articles from 2013–2014 found that the news media constructed a mediated reality that placed dysfunction as the defining characteristic of teens’ relationship with social media. The news articles consistently positioned teenagers and social media as at odds with one another, entwined in an unhealthy, frequently dangerous union. Discussions of the self-expressive, creative, and communicative practices of teen social media users were undermined or absent altogether. Altogether, the coverage created a mediated reality that denied teenage agency and obscured the diversity of teenagers’ experiences and social media practices.

Similarly, despite increasing interest in the ecological properties of man-made marine habitats, no large-scale comparisons of ecological processes in natural versus artificial habitats have been performed. Here, we used a simple, standardized consumption assay to test the BIH and its consistency in natural habitats and docks across 17° of latitude. We deployed 1205 'squidpops' underneath and 10-15 m away from marine docks in 4 midlatitude locations on the US east coast (Florida, North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Maine), and monitored the squidpops for consumption of the bait after 1 and 24 h. Consumption rates de - creased significantly with latitude and were consistently higher away from docks as compared to underneath docks after 24 h. Our results indicate that, when controlling for prey and habitat type, there is a consistent latitudinal gradient in consumption pressure for a specific group of consumers, which supports the BIH as a potential driver of the LDG. Furthermore, the geographically consistent reduced rates of consumption under docks compared to nearby habitats indicate generality in reduced predation pressure in docks vs. natural habitats, which has previously been reported at local scales. Our results suggest that, despite high local-scale variability, docks and squidpops may provide a useful avenue for future large-scale ecological studies and aid the understanding of ecological processes in highly developed coastal marine ecosystems. © Inter-Research 2017.","Anthropogenic habitat; Biodiversity; Ecosystem function; Fish; Latitudinal gradient; Pier; Predation; Top-down control","anthropogenic effect; bait; biodiversity; coastal zone; ecosystem function; fish; latitudinal gradient; predation risk; top-down control; Florida [United States]; Maine; Massachusetts; North Carolina; United States; United States",2-s2.0-85021795987

This paper employs the ontological security framework to demonstrate how New Zealand identity as a ‘small trading nation’ and ‘good international citizen’ has shaped its turn to Asia and response to the ‘rise of China'. It first analyses the origins of New Zealand's outward facing identity and resultant foreign policy positions long before China became an important aspect of New Zealand trade policy.

To address deficiencies in previously used methodologies, a dynamic approach is developed and applied to a case study on giant buttercup in dairy pastures. This approach accounts for probable temporal changes in both the geographic extent of the weed and in producer prices and indicates annuitized costs (over the period 2012–2030) of $166 million, $259 million and $592 million for rates of spread of 144, 60 and 20 years for giant buttercup to invade all dairy regions in New Zealand.

The northernmost population of the bivalve Mytilus trossulus is found in north Greenland, an area characterized by low temperature, prolonged winters and a short productive period. This population, therefore, provides a unique op - portunity to study whether a temperate bivalve species can sustain a population near its poleward distribution limit through reproduction. We assessed gametogenesis and biochemical composition in intertidal M. trossulus specimens during the ice-free period (July-September). Results showed that the qualitative traits of gametogenesis and oocyte production in this population were comparable to M. trossulus found in temperate regions. In addition, we found that M. trossulus larvae settle annually in the lowest intertidal zone, indicating successful fertilization of eggs and larval survival. Our combined results suggest that gonadal development or larval survival do not limit the northern distribution of this species, even in a region characterized by limited food supply and sub-zero water temperatures for 9 mo of the year. Instead, for this marine invertebrate with a larval life-stage, oceanographic conditions and dispersal barriers, rather than physiological constraints, could be more important in determining the northern range limit. © Inter-Research 2017.","Arctic benthos; Biochemical composition; Blue mussels; Gametogenesis; Glycogen; Oogenesis; Spawning; Temperature","benthos; biochemical composition; bivalve; dispersal; food supply; gametogenesis; physiological response; range expansion; spawning; survival; temperature effect; Arctic; Greenland; Bivalvia; Invertebrata; Mytilus edulis; Mytilus trossulus",2-s2.0-85020451259

Among the bone grafts employees, the autograft is defined as the gold standard, but with some limitations, principally related to morbidity at the site of its removal, with the need to search for other biomaterials as adjuvant in bone regeneration. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the use of Chenopodium ambrosioides as a bone graft substitute for the osseointegration of fractures in rabbits, compared to other bone grafts already employed in the surgical routine as Ricinus communis (castor oil) polyurethane and autogenous bone marrow. Methods: Forty-eight rabbits were divided into four groups. After anesthesia, a radius fracture was created and the animals were treated with the following grafts: C. ambrosioides graft, autogenous bone marrow, castor oil and saline (control). After 30, 60 and 90 days, the animals were submitted to radiographical and histological analyses and bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, biomechanical tension, and collagen were measured. We also realized a phytochemical screening and in vitro antioxidant activity including 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical. Results: The data showed that the growth of the bone callus was more expressive and biomechanical assessment showed better tensile strength in C. ambrosioides graft. The experimental results also revealed that there was significantly greater activity of the bone alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin during early fracture healing, similarly to the group receiving autogenous bone marrow. Histologically, immature bone was observed in C. ambrosioides graft at 30 days, whereas the formation of cartilaginous tissue predominated in the other groups. A higher amount of type I collagen was observed in C. ambrosioides graft throughout treatment. It was detected strong presence of flavonoids and appreciable antioxidant activity. Conclusions: The results indicate that C. ambrosioides graft and autogenous bone marrow have similar ability to enhance bone regeneration, higher than the castor oil graft, suggesting that the medicinal plant can provide therapeutic benefits for bone tissue. © 2017 The Author(s).","Bone regeneration; Chenopodium ambrosioides; Fracture healing; Heterograft; Plant biomaterials","1,1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl; alkaline phosphatase; antioxidant; biomaterial; Chenopodium ambrosioides extract; collagen; flavonoid; osteocalcin; plant extract; polyurethan; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; Article; autograft; biomechanics; bone graft; bone growth; bone marrow transplantation; bone radiography; bone regeneration; Chenopodium ambrosioides; controlled study; histology; in vitro study; male; nonhuman; Oryctolagus cuniculus; osseointegration; phytochemistry; radius fracture; Ricinus communis; tensile strength; treatment duration",2-s2.0-85021685599

Results Half of the sample showed serious deficits in functional cognition, which ultimately could be related to problems in their daily performance. Scores of ACLS-5 showed significant correlations with the severity of addiction, with those obtained with the MoCA, and with attentional symptoms on the PSI scale. Conclusions The data suggest the applicability of the ACLS-5 in assessing the degree of functional cognition in subjects treated for addiction, providing evidence to support ecological validity and facilitating the development of well-targeted cognitive rehabilitation programmes from an occupational perspective.

Phylogenetic trees were built by four techniques: Bayesian (BA), maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and neighbor-joining (NJ). Resolution of Cyt-b trees for species of two genera (Oreoleuciscus and Phoxinus) was quite distinct at all the approaches. For Tribolodon, the single gene trees were not well resolved; however, the mitogenome tree was resolved. Species identification on per individual basis (DNA barcoding) was high for both Cyt-b and Co-1 genes. The trees built using the data for 13 protein mitochondrial genes revealed a complicated phylogenetic pattern within the subfamily Leuciscinae. Scores of the average p-distances at three taxonomic levels were considerably different: (1) 1.16 ± 0.96, (2) 8.21 ± 1.01, and (3) 16.41 ± 0.85 for Cyt-b and (1) 1.04 ± 0.78, (2) 8.30 ± 0.92, and (3) 10.74 ± 0.79 for 13 protein genes of mitogenome, where (1) is intraspecies, (2) is intragenus, and (3) is intrasubfamily levels.

A concordant increase in distance score with growth of the rank of taxa (having the minimum score at the intraspecies level), both for a single gene and the whole mitogenome, substantiates the concept that speciation in the subfamily Leuciscinae in most cases follows the geographic mode.

Based on a large-scale spatio-temporal dimension, a biogeographic hypothesis on a Gondwanan scenario was tested. The objective of this study was to describe the geographic distribution patterns of Temnocephalida in a primary biogeographic homology context. A dataset of 793 temnocephalan records, distributed in 45 hydrological basins, and assigned to different hierarchical taxonomic levels was used to construct five presence/absence matrices. We analysed the matrices using Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) and Cladistic Analysis of Distributions and Endemism (CADE). Furthermore, we constructed generalized tracks based on area clades with phylogenetic support, i.e., two or more synapomorphies. Six generalized tracks were revealed: a general clade for Eurasia, plus a complex of four hybrid zones with monophyletic relationships included in a major clade with Gondwanan affinities. The results represent the first study using biogeographic analysis to disentangle the distributional patterns of temnocephalids around the world. Based on the integration of the results obtained by biogeographic pattern-based methods, we infer that the fragmentation of Gondwana affected the diversification patterns and distribution of Temnocephalida. © 2016, © The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London 2016.

What do anxieties about the group’s seditiousness–sexual and social–reveal about references to Cleopatra as a gypsy? What social appraisals and economic motives underpin early modern critiques of gypsies, informing Antony’s remorse that “a right gypsy hath at fast and loose / Beguiled me to the very heart of loss” (4.13.28–29)? The condemnation of gypsies, codified in social documents and royal edicts circulating in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, signals a local experience of the alien within one’s borders. As such, Shakespeare’s depiction of the Egyptian queen uniquely represents Cleopatra as a racialised figure of transnational and local significance. In developing the ways gypsies inform Shakespeare’s construction of Cleopatra’s foreignness, I also investigate the cultural representations mitigating the status and assessment of gypsies in early modern England. Ultimately, Shakespeare’s Cleopatra manifests gypsies’ refusal to heed, and performs the ways they threaten, industrious occupations. Far from simply decrying a vagrant population as a social nuisance, England’s preoccupation with gypsies turns into a racially marked discourse, villainising an alternative way of life that resists the state’s absorption of the surplus value of legitimate labour and rejects the social obligations essential to reproducing the principles and priorities of the commonwealth. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Antony and Cleopatra; foreignness; idleness; labour; law",,2-s2.0-84965036431

In Experiment 2, raters in group 1 used objective perception and raters in group 3 were asked to take the perspective for more time. Raters in group 3 assigned higher ratings than the other 2 groups but no difference was found between group 1 and 2. Overall, the results showed the effect of perspective taking on assessment of creative products. Possible mechanisms of the effect and implications for creativity assessment and creativity teaching practice were discussed. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-85029719573

The mean annual increment in these regions ranges from 20 to 45 m3 ha−1 y−1 depending on the level of environmental stress. Improving natural resource use efficiency by breeding and matching genotypes to sites and using appropriate site management practices is a key challenge to sustain or increase productivity. Climate change is emerging as a driving force behind many of the current issues facing natural resources, and is likely to intensify the water constraint. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted significant increases in surface air temperatures and decreases in rainfall (with more erratic rainfall patterns) over the tropics and subtropics, affecting drier regions in particular. To be truly sustainable, forest management practices must be environmentally friendly, prevent or reduce land degradation, improve biodiversity and increase resilience to climate variation and change. The main efforts should address the problems of water scarcity, low soil fertility and reduced biodiversity. Forest growers should take into account the inherent risks of different forest management systems on the regional water availability and consider reducing forest productivity in order to maintain both ecological and social equilibrium. The design and implementation of management techniques should be adapted to the specific production and protection objectives, which depend on the regional and local edaphoclimatic circumstances, water resources management, protection against soil erosion, diseases, pests, bushfires, strong winds and alien species. This paper addresses the basic requirements for integrating genetic and silvicultural strategies to minimise the water constraints in eucalypt plantations and surrounding water and native vegetation resources. We show several examples of effective forest management actions on the scale of forest stand and watershed in use in Brazil. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","climate change; drought; plantation; tolerance; water deficit; watershed",,2-s2.0-85018381903

While the collaboration of foreign personalities and the publication of book reviews fostered the knowledge of this issue in Spain, one of the most important initiatives were the sections entitled ‘Review of Reviews’, which began to collect articles from other countries.

Lastly, it attempts to connect the technologies and practices of techno to Kluge's televisual and digital projects.

It is in this context that the original contribution of the article is twofold. In methodological terms, it is argued that contemporary analysis of mainstreaming needs to examine the formative phase of policy implementation and the discourse between state elites and civil society organizations. This is integral to effective agenda-setting and coordinated action—and thus to securing successful gender-equality outcomes. In empirical terms, the study findings show how presently, across the Middle East, there are marked contrasts in state and civil society policy framing and issue prioritization.

In this paper we examine community engagement where volunteers participate by killing invasive animals. Most research to date focuses on the biological or management implications of volunteer efforts for the invasive species, with little attention to the people involved or the social acceptability of killing animals in this context. Here, we report on a survey and participant observations of community fishing events in south-eastern Australia, where volunteers fish for and kill carp (Cyprinus carpio). We examine who takes part in these events, their motivations for being involved and the implications for ongoing community engagement. Survey respondents were predominantly well-educated Australian-born men, motivated to fish by a desire to spend time in nature. However, we also noted a strong response from overseas-born men with different motivations. Our survey elicited complex responses regarding killing, illustrating contradictory, sometimes conflicted experiences, which jar with personal motivations. The implications are that questions of ethics must extend to the human volunteers, and that more direct communication of program outcomes and the proposed benefits for volunteers be more rigorously assessed. We argue that invasive species management must contend with the experiences of volunteers, otherwise meaningful dialogue and program objectives risk being undermined. © 2016 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.","citizen science; community engagement; Cyprinus carpio; Invasive species management; volunteer","conservation management; cyprinid; environmental policy; invasive species; local participation; participatory approach; policy approach; Australia; Animalia; Cyprinidae; Cyprinus carpio",2-s2.0-85004190346

Territory, Politics, Governance. This paper examines processes of border crossing and border policing within churches engaged in immigrant-outreach in the US South. Based on interviews with pastors and on focus groups with immigrant and non-immigrant congregants in 35 churches in the US South, we explore how border politics and anti-immigrant racialization intersect with the practice of faith. We argue that the complex border work undertaken by clergy members and congregants can be understood in terms of differential inclusion, that is, the extension of partial membership that may lead to a widening, rather than a diminution, of social inequalities. Immigrants themselves are cognisant of this border work and tread carefully in making claims of belonging in the church and in the state. Paying attention to the affective, emotional and performative dimensions of borders, we argue that border work needs to be understood as a diffuse set of practices undertaken by ‘ordinary’ people in the spaces of everyday life who position themselves and others as legitimate or illegitimate members of society in new immigrant destinations. © 2017 Regional Studies Association.","border work; churches; Immigration; new immigrant destinations; racialization; religion",,2-s2.0-85014467280

Veligers of the invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea in the Columbia River Basin: broadscale distribution, abundance, and ecological associations. Lake Reserv Manage. 00:00–00. The invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea was introduced to North America in the 1930s and now inhabits most regions of the conterminous United States; however, the distribution and ecology of C. fluminea in the Columbia River Basin is poorly understood. During 2013 and 2014, 5 Columbia-Snake River reservoirs were sampled monthly from May through September, along with 23 additional lakes and reservoirs sampled once each summer. Associations among C. fluminea veligers, other components of the plankton, and environmental variables were analyzed using non-metric multidimensional scaling and canonical correspondence analysis. Corbicula fluminea veligers were found in high abundances in all mainstem Columbia-Snake River reservoirs, with an annual mean abundance of 71.2 individuals per cubic meter (inds./m3). Only 3 of 23 lakes and (non-mainstem) reservoirs contained C. fluminea, with abundances considerably lower (maximum = 21.2 inds./m3) than in the mainstem reservoirs. A diatom-dominated community preceded the spawning of C. fluminea in early summer at all sites. Corbicula fluminea veligers characterized the plankton community in late summer and were associated with cyanobacteria and high water temperatures. A third community, characterized by cyanobacteria, was apparent in non-mainstem sites in July and August. Our analyses describe the relationship of C. fluminea to the plankton community and environment, which contributes to our understanding of the possible effects of C. fluminea infestations and which waterbodies in the Columbia River Basin are at risk for infestation. Understanding the effects and environmental determinants of invasive mollusks will be increasingly important in the future with the possible arrival of zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) or quagga (D. bugensis) mussels to the region. © 2017, © Copyright by the North American Lake Management Society 2017.","Corbicula fluminea, FlowCam; invasive species; nonindigenous bivalves; planktonic larvae",,2-s2.0-85016075165

The taxonomy of this genus is troublesome, with poor species delimitation and doubtful records in the literature. Dictyota dichotoma, the type species of the genus, was commonly accepted as a cosmopolitan species because of the inaccurate geographical distributional range as a consequence of misidentification in several parts of the world. Recent studies with molecular data revealed new species and a new understanding of the evolution and biogeography of the genus Dictyota. These studies confined natural populations of D. dichotoma to Europe (Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts) and Macaronesian islands (Azores, Madeira and Canary archipelagos). Also, they confirmed its presence in South Africa, but whether the species was native or introduced in South Africa could not be verified. In the present study two regions of cpDNA (psbA, rbcL) and one region of mtDNA (nad1) from Argentinian samples, identified morphologically as D. dichotoma, were analysed and compared to other Dictyota species. The identity of these samples as D. dichotoma was confirmed. A haplotype network analysis using all available psbA sequences distinguished seven haplotypes divided into two geographic groups: Atlantic–Mediterranean and Canarian. In Argentina and South Africa only the most common haplotype of the Atlantic–Mediterranean group was observed. According to the paleoceanographic currents and the presence of a European haplotype, the introduced nature of D. dichotoma is indicated. © 2017 The Royal Society of New Zealand.","Dictyotaceae; exotic species; nad1; psbA; rbcL; South Atlantic Ocean","biogeography; brown alga; DNA; evolution; gene; geographical distribution; invertebrate; mitochondrial DNA; morphology; new species; paleoceanography; taxonomy; Argentina; Atlantic Coast [Europe]; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Macaronesia; algae; Dictyota dichotoma; Dictyotaceae; Dictyotales; Invertebrata; Phaeophyceae",2-s2.0-85020295144

In this study, we compared digestive tract contents, foraging behaviour, and stable isotope values of Round Goby from sites of low and high sediment contamination in Hamilton Harbour. We also assessed prey availability by conducting sediment invertebrate abundance analyses at these sites. Regardless of site, Chironomids, Cladocerans, Copepods and Dreissenids were the most common food items found in Round Goby digestive tracts, and females always had heavier gut contents compared to males. Fish from the high contamination site consumed fewer prey items, had lower gut fullness scores, and fed at a lower trophic level based on lower δ13C and δ15N values.

Agriculture destroys biodiversity by converting natural habitats to intensely managed systems and by releasing pollutants, including greenhouses gases. Food value chains further amplify impacts including through energy use, transport and waste. Reducing the food system’s toll on biodiversity is a critical challenge. The ‘sparing or sharing’ debate contrasts two response pathways: intensifying agriculture to release other land for protection versus biodiversity-friendly farming over larger areas. Most conservation policies focus on intensification and set-aside but recent research challenges these assumptions. The Global Land Outlook of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification highlights how modern farming is undermining the sustainability of large land areas. Intensification has not solved the biodiversity crisis and has often made it worse. Effective responses must involve both producers and consumers, and require a mixture of conservation, sustainable management and restoration. Agricultural land serves many purposes beyond food production and mechanisms are needed to pay farmers for wider stewardship of land resources. A multifunctional landscape approach balances different needs at a landscape scale while incorporating site-level specificity on land use, demand, and condition. At the same time, consumers play a critical role in reducing unsustainable food waste.

Transnational corporations make extensive use of regulatory arbitrage and corporate structures in order to avoid or mitigate the reach of legal and regulatory governance. Moreover, international soft law standards that encourage multinational corporations to be more responsible are not always effective or enforceable. Against this context, we explore an emerging regulatory trend in corporate regulation that has the potential to overcome some of the currently perceived limitations in the regulatory governance of transnational corporations. There is an intensifying trend in adopting procedural regulatory strategies for corporations. This involves prescribing various control systems and processes that corporations have to institute, such as compelling them to develop due diligence requirements within their commercial operations. We suggest this is a new milestone in ‘new governance’ design that we call ‘procedural legalisation’. Procedural legalisation is being adopted at an unprecedented level in financial sector and corporate regulation, and offers a new promise in changing corporate culture and behaviour, possibly addressing longstanding limitations in effectively regulating corporations. We present two case studies to explore how procedural legalisation is applied to regulate corporations in the financial sector and in anti-bribery. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anti-bribery; Due diligence; Financial regulation; Internal control; New governance",,2-s2.0-85018490554

Using review and synthesis of published literature, we examined these risks in temperate eucalypt and radiata pine plantations in Australia from the perspectives of individual pest and host responses to climate change and the response of the host-pest system to climate. The pests vary in their patterns of damage caused, host tissues affected, season of damage and the stage of stand development targeted. Twenty-one major pests were identified, the majority of which (71%) are defoliators and pests of eucalypt plantations rather than radiata pine plantations. Documented distributions of these pests are presented. The possible consequences of climate change for pest risk are examined in relation to effects on (1) pest lifecycles, (2) pest distribution, (3) frequency and severity of outbreaks, and (4) host susceptibility to damage. An integrated approach for managing pest risk under future climates, that combines these four elements, is desirable. Use of models is necessary to examine species distribution and abundance, and to integrate damage levels with impact on the host. Field monitoring should play an important role, providing data for model validation and to provide a critical link between data on pest species distribution, abundance and damage on the ground.

Because it is frequently suggested that common species, and particularly invasive alien species, are phenotypically highly plastic, they might benefit more from these fluctuations than rare native and rare alien species. Experimental tests, however, are still lacking. Here, we tested whether alien plant species take more advantage of increases in resource levels and fluctuations therein than native species, and whether common species do so more than rare species. Therefore, we grew seven common alien, seven rare alien, nine common native and six rare native herbaceous plants, in one treatment with constantly low nutrient availability and five treatments with high nutrient availability that differed in temporal availability of nutrients (constant, increasing, decreasing, single large pulse, multiple smaller pulses). We found that all species produced more biomass and longer roots, and had a lower root mass fraction under high nutrient conditions than under low nutrient conditions, irrespective of their origin and commonness. Among the high nutrient treatments, the temporal pattern of nutrient supply also influenced biomass production, root allocation and root thickness, but the magnitude and/or directions of these responses varied among the groups of species. Particularly, we found that alien plant species, irrespective of whether they are common or rare, produced more biomass, and had a higher root mass fraction when nutrients were supplied as a single pulse in the middle of the growth period instead of supplied at a constant rate, whereas the reverse was true for the native species. Synthesis. Our study suggests that species origin does not drive differences in plant biomass production, root morphology and allocation in response to changes in mean environmental nutrient availability. However in our study, alien plant species, in contrast to native plant species, benefited from a large nutrient pulse. This suggests that increased fluctuations in nutrient availability might promote alien plant invasions. © 2017 The Authors.

Patients with the AHS typically complain about a loss of agencyassociated with a feeling of estrangement for actions performed by the affected limb. The present studyexplores the integrity of the body representation in AHS, focusing on 2 main processes: multisensoryintegration and visual self-recognition of body parts. Three patients affected by AHS following a righthemispherestroke, with clinical symptoms akin to the posterior variant of AHS, were tested and theirperformance was compared with that of 18 age-matched healthy controls. Method: AHS patients and controlsunderwent 2 experimental tasks: a same-different visual matching task for body postures, which assessed theability of using your own body schema for encoding others' body postural changes (Experiment 1), and anexplicit self-hand recognition task, which assessed the ability to visually recognize your own hands (Experiment2). Results: As compared to controls, all AHS patients were unable to access a reliable multisensoryrepresentation of their alien hand and use it for decoding others' postural changes; however, they could relyon an efficient multisensory representation of their intact (ipsilesional) hand. Two AHS patients also presentedwith a specific impairment in the visual self-recognition of their alien hand, but normal recognition of theirintact hand.

We also sought to determine whether alien species' success in disturbed Pine Barrens soil differs from that of the non-Pine Barrens North American plant species whose presence in the region is associated with anthropogenic soil disturbance. In the field, species richness of native Pine Barrens species, non-Pine Barrens species, and alien species was determined along with current-year aboveground biomass production and soil pH along transects extending from concrete block buildings and from paired control transects without concrete block buildings. Soil inorganic nitrogen was measured near and far from buildings. Additionally, a pot study using native soil amended with ground concrete was conducted to determine its effect on pore-water pH. Richness was significantly greater near buildings, with alien species concentrated within 6 m of buildings. Alien plant biomass was greater within 3 m of buildings than farther along the transects; however, productivity along the transects did not vary. Soil pH was elevated within 7.5 m of buildings and soil nitrate concentration was greater near buildings. The ground-concrete soil amendments were found to significantly elevate pore-water pH. We conclude that disturbed habitats with acid soil conditions possess a degree of ecosystem resistance to alien plant species establishment. However, this may be overcome by raising the soil pH.

Location: Great Britain. Time period: Data collected 1995–2015. Major taxa: Vascular plants. Methods: We calculated the species richness of terrestrial native and alien vascular plants (6,932 species in total) across the island of Great Britain at grain sizes of 1 km2 (n = 219,964) and 100 km2 (n = 2,121) and regional extents of 25–250 km diameter, centred around each 100-km2 cell. We compiled geodiversity data on landforms, soils, hydrological and geological features using existing national datasets, and used a newly developed geomorphometric method to extract landform coverage data (e.g., hollows, ridges, valleys, peaks). We used these as predictors of species richness alongside climate, commonly used topographic metrics, land-cover variety and human population. We analysed species richness across scales using boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling and compared models with and without geodiversity data. Results: Geodiversity significantly improved models over and above the widely used topographic metrics, particularly at smaller extents and the finer grain size, and slightly more so for native species richness. For each increase in extent, the contribution of climatic variables increased and that of geodiversity decreased. Of the geodiversity variables, automatically extracted landform data added the most explanatory power, but hydrology (rivers, lakes) and materials (soil, superficial deposits, geology) were also important. Main conclusions: Geodiversity improves our understanding of, and our ability to model, the relationship between species richness and abiotic heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales by allowing us to get closer to the real-world physical processes that affect patterns of life. The greatest benefit comes from measuring the constituent parts of geodiversity separately rather than one combined variable (as in most of the few studies to date).

The apple snail, Pomacea maculata, recently established in the Ebro delta in Spain resulting in a serious threat to rice production and wetlands, having also a high risk to spread to other European wetlands.

The effects of ecosystem resistance, resilience and pest management on snail population abundance are estimated for the short (5 years) and the long (30 years) term. Expert judgment was used to evaluate the impacts on selected ecosystem services in a worst-case scenario. Our study shows that the combined effects of apple snails are estimated to have profound effects on the ecosystem services provided by shallow, macrophyte-dominated ecosystems in Europe.

Though the Maxver produced a higher overall accuracy and Kappa estimate than the Bhattacharya classifier, the Maxver Kappa estimate of 0.8305 is not significantly (statistically) greater than the Bhattacharya Kappa estimate of 0.8088 at a 95% confidence interval. The area based accuracy assessment results show that the Bhattacharya classifier estimated the spatial extent of H. pomanensis with an average mapping accuracy of 86.1% whereas the Maxver classifier only gave an average mapping accuracy of 65.2%. Based on these results, the Bhattacharya classifier is therefore recommended for mapping H. pomanensis.

Focusing on wind dispersal, this study assessed the spatial and quantitative extents to which a remnant natural fen receives the seeds of alien species dispersed from adjacent hay meadows in Hokkaido, northern Japan. I established a total of 80 funnel seed traps in the fen at distances of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 m from the meadows. The proportion of alien species in the seed rain at each distance was quantified, and the 99th-percentile dispersal distance from the meadows was estimated for each alien species by constructing dispersal kernels. Despite the presence of a marginal ditch and an elevational difference between the fen and the meadows, five alien species, including four grasses that do not have modified seed structures for wind dispersal, dispersed their seeds into the fen. These alien species accounted for up to 65.9% of the seed rain in terms of quantity. The 99th-percentile dispersal distances of the alien species ranged from 3.8 m to 309.3 m, and these distances were longer than the values predicted on the basis of their functional traits, such as terminal velocity. The results of this study demonstrated that numerous seeds of farmland-derived alien species were transported into the remnant vegetation via wind dispersal, and that simple predictions of dispersal distance based on functional traits could underestimate the potential area that alien species can reach. Continuous management both in farmland (to reduce seed escape) and in remnant vegetation (to prevent the establishment of alien species) is necessary to protect native vegetation from biological invasion in agricultural landscapes. © 2017 The Author","Agricultural landscape; Biological invasion; Propagule pressure; Remnant vegetation; Wind dispersal",,2-s2.0-85018760583

Our aim was to review the current literature on alien mammals that have established feral populations in Brazil and to systematize the existing knowledge. Furthermore, we evaluated the current distributions of all invasion mammals and discuss different management actions, including eradication techniques for island populations. We found 17 species of alien mammals living in the wild in Brazil. Based on the current literature and databases regarding invasive species, Lepus europaeus and Sus scrofa had the largest distributions in the Brazilian territory and seem to continue expanding their geographic distributions. Feral dogs and cats were the main alien predators threatening wildlife conservation, especially in protected areas. Further, we call attention to the invasion of Bubalus bubalis, a large species that currently thrives in isolated populations but seems to be quickly expanding its distribution. In conclusion, alien mammals are widespread in Southern and Southeastern Brazil, but at least four ungulate species (Indian sambar, horse, goat, and axis deer) still have small and isolated populations.

To maximize their fitness, mothers should preferentially care for their own offspring. However, the majority of studies of mother–offspring recognition have focused on herd- or colony-living species and there is little information on maternal discrimination in more solitary-living species. Olfaction has been found to play a major role in mother–offspring recognition across various taxa. Therefore, our aim was to study this in a species evolved from a solitary-living ancestor, the domestic cat. We asked whether cat mothers distinguish between their own and alien offspring when providing maternal care, and whether cat mothers use olfactory cues in the offspring discrimination process. Results of Experiment 1 showed that cat mothers do not discriminate between own and alien young when retrieving them to the nest. They treated own and alien young similarly with respect to latency and order of retrieval. However, the results of Experiments 2 and 3, where we used an olfactory habituation-discrimination technique, showed that mothers were able to distinguish between the odours of their own and alien kittens. We discuss what ecological and/or behavioural factors might influence a mother’s decision when faced with discriminating between own and alien young, and why mothers might not discriminate between them when they are able to do so. Our findings support the view that maternal care alone should not be used as a measure of offspring recognition, and equal maternal care of own and alien young should not be immediately interpreted as an inability to discriminate between them. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Domestic cat; Felis silvestris catus; Habituation-discrimination technique; Mother–offspring discrimination; Olfactory communication; Retrieval test",,2-s2.0-85019579288

Hull heathlands have declined across Europe and nowadays their conservation is particularly challenging at the southern edge of their distribution. In the Nature Reserve of Vauda (north-western Italy), six restoration treatments were applied (extensive annual goat browsing, one-off mowing, annual mowing, one-off fire without and with annual browsing, and annual fire) and their effects on plant diversity and the cover of C. vulgaris, its competitor grass Molinia arundinacea Schrank, woody, and alien species were monitored between 2005 and 2011. In the short-term, most of the treatments changed the vegetation community, reducing C. vulgaris cover according to a gradient of increasing biomass removal. In the mid-term, C. vulgaris, M. arundinacea, woody and alien species cover followed different trajectories according to the treatment and functional group. Annual fire shifted the vegetation towards a M. arundinacea-dominated community, while extensive annual browsing did not affect the heathland community and resulted in the lowest increase in M. arundinacea, which showed a remarkable fitness in these environments. Moreover, annual burning and mowing were effective in reducing woody species encroachment (p < 0.05), and fire treatments triggered a peak in alien species cover (mainly Panicum acuminatum Swartz) in the short-term. Six years after treatment, species richness and Shannon index did not differ between treated and control sites (p > 0.05).

This article considers some of those implications through a study of a landmark case in which 10,000 Philippine victims of torture and other abuses sued Ferdinand Marcos in US courts under the Alien Tort Statute. Analyzing Marcos from the perspective of critical approaches to TJ reveals that while victim groups used the lawsuit in empowering ways in the Philippines, their claims also conflicted with the state's transitional policy seeking economic redistribution. Ironically, enforcement difficulties mediated the conflict, leading to the enactment of a law compensating and recognizing a broader range of victims while preserving the redistribution policy. This analysis exposes some of the benefits and risks of transnational tort litigation against foreign state officials, and offers a novel perspective on the enforcement of transnational remedies for human rights violations. © The Author (2017).

There it leads to serious changes in coastal ecosystems and replaces native plant species. This paper presents the distribution and habitat preferences of R. rugosa in and near Archipelago Sea National Park in SW Finland. We identified 205 stands in the study area, 58% of them in protected areas. Systematic inventories do not cover the whole study area, so it is likely that dozens of stands remain undiscovered. Stands of the species were concentrated on the outer islands, where the archipelago's most characteristic flora and fauna occur. Data on the shore type and area of all stands were collected. The total area covered by R. rugosa was 7277 m2 before control work started in 2008. The largest stand occurred on Örö Island, covering ca 2500 m2 before its eradication, and the median size of all stands was 6 m2.

These programmes are most often based on pheromone-bailed traps, which allow the early detection and monitoring of invasive species. This approach is expensive because it entails the processing and accurate identification of large numbers of specimens. One of the most often suggested solutions to this problem is citizen participation in the monitoring of invasive species. Such an approach has the potential for reducing costs as well as providing data from a larger number of sites. However, citizens vary in taxonomic expertise and experience which can result in identification errors. This may be particularly important in the case of wood borers which include many morphologically similar species. In this study, we develop and discuss a semi-automated method of identifying four morphologically similar and invasive Tetropium spp. wood borers as a potential tool for citizen-based monitoring programmes. Identification is based on wing measurements and requires neither specialist knowledge nor expensive equipment. The method correctly identified the species of Tetropium with an error ranging from 1.3% for T. fuscum to 7.5% for T. cinnamopterum. We found that experience level of the individual user was not essential for correct identification; on average, inexperienced volunteers correctly identified the Tetropium species in 93% of cases.

Location: Rivers distributed throughout mainland Britain. Methods: We quantified change in river bank vegetation using survey data collected approximately 20 yr apart and assessed the contribution of major IAPs (Impatiens glandulifera, Heracleum mantegazzianum and Fallopia japonica) to these changes. We also determined the importance of abiotic factors such as flow regime and land use in driving these changes. Results: Comparing data from pre- and post-1990 surveys revealed that IAPs occurred mainly on lowland rivers (<200 m a.s.l.), regardless of time period, and their probability of occurrence increased over time and with rising frequency of high flows. Native plant species diversity declined over time with increasing IAP cover, along lowland rivers and along all rivers that experienced extended low flows during the growing season. These conditions particularly favoured native dominant species, whereas native subordinate species responded both positively and negatively to increased flood frequency depending on survey period. Over time, Salix spp. and larger native hydrophilic species, such as Sparganium erectum, increased along lowland rivers, replacing smaller-statured ruderal species and driving a shift towards increased shade tolerance of subcanopy and groundcover species. Smaller compositional changes occurred in the uplands and these changes lacked a clear environmental signature. Conclusions: National-scale changes in native riparian vegetation are likely driven primarily by environmental changes and land-use effects, rather than invasion by IAPs. However, IAPs, and indeed native species that benefit from abiotic changes, in turn, likely exert secondary effects on native riparian vegetation. The trend towards reduced diversity, increased shade tolerance and increased dominance of some native species and IAPs is likely linked to a set of interacting factors, including drier summers, wetter winters, increased riparian tree cover, reduced livestock access to river banks and increased fine sediment input. Determining combined effects of land use, IAPs and climate-related changes in flow regime over decadal time scales (i.e. ~20 yr) is important for predicting ecological responses of vulnerable habitats under future disturbance scenarios. © 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science","Agriculture; Climate change; Competition; Diversity; Flow regime; Impatiens glandulifera, Invasive species; Model averaging; Riparian vegetation",,2-s2.0-85010191176

We calculated plant community types and their area in some historical periods when related data were reported, and analyzed the relationship between changes in plant communities and water pollution. In Dianchi Lake, 12 community types of native plant communities, covering over 80% of the surface in the 1950s and 1960s, were reduced to four types covering 2.4% by the late 2000s. Alien plant communities started to appear in the lake in the late 1970s, and have since come to cover 4.9% of the lake surface, thereby becoming dominant. In Erhai Lake, 16 community types of native plant communities, covering 47.1% of the lake surface in the late 1970s, declined to 10 community types, covering 9.3% of the surface, by the late 2000s. Alien plant communities appeared in the middle 1980s, and at present cover 0.7% of the surface area.

Are alien woody species more successful than natives in their resprouting after the two treatments proposed to control shrub encroachment? Is resprouting influenced by age of the individuals? Does resprouting differ between cutting and burning?. Location: Temperate grasslands encroached by shrubs, Transylvania, Romania. Methods: We investigated the resprouting after cutting or burning of four shrub species (Cornus sanguinea, Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa and Rosa canina) encroaching grasslands in field sites 3 yr following treatments. We compared the resprouting ability of shrubs between species and treatments and analysed the relationship between the number of resprouts and stump diameter, as a proxy for age. In a common garden experiment on 1-yr-old individuals we compared resprouting after cutting and burning between three native (C. sanguinea, C. monogyna and P. spinosa) and three alien woody species (Ailanthus altissima, Elaeagnus angustifolia and Hippophae rhamnoides) during one growing season. Results: C. monogyna produced the largest number of resprouts in the field study, and H. rhamnoides in the experimental study. Overall, resprouting ability of alien woody species did not differ from that of natives. In the field study, we found an increasing number of resprouts with increasing stump diameter, and the rate of increase in the number of resprouts was highest in C. monogyna. We detected no difference in the resprouting of woody species between cutting and burning treatments either in the field or in the experimental study. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the success of encroachment control in grasslands does not depend on treatment type, but on the woody species composition and age of individuals. Grasslands encroached by C. monogyna or H. rhamnoides will be more labour-intensive to restore and maintain free of shrubs. Restoration measures should be implemented in the early stage of shrub encroachment since younger shrubs have lower resprouting ability. Burning and cutting may be equally effective in controlling shrub encroachment, but treatments should be more intensive than in the current study in order to damage the resprouting buds and arrest resprouting. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","Alien; Clipping; Crataegus monogyna; Fire; Grassland conservation; Hippophae rhamnoides; Invasive; Romania; Shrub; Stump diameter; Tree; Woody encroachment",,2-s2.0-85012076987

The raccoon’s flexibility and capability in coping with environmental changes have made it the most successful invader compared with other species. In 1991, a raccoon was recorded in Iran for the first time. Since then, knowledge about the distribution, expansion range, and influences of this species on native ecosystem has remained unclear. The importance of environmental variables for the distribution of raccoons might vary widely across different spatial resolutions; therefore, we developed a robust statistical framework to predict the raccoon distribution across different spatial resolutions in Iran. Our predictions made by species distribution models (ENFA, GARP, and MaxEnt) highlighted the importance of food availability at a small spatial resolution and water resources, settlements, and population density at a large spatial resolution. The models indicate particular areas, mostly located in forests and rangelands near to the Caspian Sea, that can be a potential habitat for raccoons. We observed that the distribution of the raccoon population in Iran almost entirely overlaps with protected areas, which consequently brings about some conflicts with conservation practices and management plans. It is therefore imperative that the local knowledge be strengthened to adequately respond to the threats posed by raccoon invasions of special protected lands. © 2016, International Consortium of Landscape and Ecological Engineering and Springer Japan.","Alien species; Environmental variables; Species distribution model",,2-s2.0-85006488882

Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the interaction between salt concentration and duration of exposure on the physiology and growth of Carpobrotus edulis, an important invasive plant species growing in coastal dune habitats. In this study, four salinity treatment cycles of different length (three, six, twelve and twenty-four days) at salinity of 0 M, 0.1 M, 0.2 M and 0.3 M were imposed. A significant response in plant growth was elicited after 24 days of treatment. The main shoot length (MSL) and stem biomass (SBMS) increased by 11% and 4%, respectively at 0.1 M and by 25% and 6% at 0.2 M compared with the control. At 0.3 M MSL did not significantly differ from the control while SBMS was 18% lower. Moreover, C. edulis showed a high photoprotection mechanism efficiency resulting in a high carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio increase which was two, three and four times higher than the control at 0.1 M, 0.2 M and 0.3 M, respectively. Photochemically, the quantum yield of photosynthesis (ΦPSII) was 17%, 50% and 52% lower than the control at 0.1 M, 0.2 M and 0.3 M. The ΦPSII decrease was associated with a low leaf nitrogen content (NL) decrease (16%, 21% lower than the control at 0.1 M and 0.2 M, respectively). By contrast, NL had the highest decrease (41% lower than the control) at 0.3 M, which constrains the growth capacity. Overall, C. edulis was able to modulate its response to salinity. The salt stimulated shoot elongation at low or moderate salt concentrations could confer a competitive advantage making C. edulis even more efficient in establishing within the areas which it colonizes. Since the expansion of C. edulis may be enhanced by the forecasted increase in soil salinity, it will be of paramount importance to apply effective management practices in areas invaded by C. edulis to limit its expansion and preserve the native plant biodiversity. © 2017 SAAB","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Invasive alien plant species; Leaf nitrogen content; Leaf photosynthetic pigment content; Salt stress; Shoot elongation","biodiversity; carotenoid; chlorophyll; concentration (composition); dune; growth; introduced species; invasive species; leaf area; management practice; nitrogen; photochemistry; photoprotection; photosynthesis; physiology; salinity; salt; shoot; Carpobrotus edulis",2-s2.0-85016444306

In a former limestone quarry (northeastern Italy), we explored the effects of a technical reclamation on the plant community using changes in cover of vegetation layers and two sensitive plant traits (i.e. exotic status and life span), with a chronosequence approach. Four reclaimed areas of different ages (from 8 to 35 years old) and natural vegetation in the surroundings were investigated with seven permanent plots each, for a total of 35. Changes in vegetation layers and species richness of both exotic status and life span were analyzed by generalized linear (mixed) models. Relations with plant community assembly were also considered, using a multivariate approach. Both vegetation layers and plant traits were affected by the age of reclaimed areas, evidencing the main changes in plant succession. Annual and exotic species decreased toward the mature stages of reclamation and target vegetation, whereas overall plant diversity (species richness) was stable. Our findings show that both vegetation layer changes and plant traits can be used to assess the degree to which reclamation efforts produce results that approach the restoration of a natural vegetation reference. Implementation of management practices aimed at favoring native perennial species (e.g. appropriate seed mixtures, mowing, tree, and shrub planting) could limit weed-control efforts, representing a reasonable trade-off between biodiversity promotion and invasive plant control. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration","alien species; ecological restoration; limestone quarry; plant community; plant trait; species richness","introduced species; limestone; plant community; quarry; reclaimed land; restoration ecology; species richness; succession; vegetation structure; Italy; Mimosa",2-s2.0-85025140799

Location: Northern France. Methods: The non-equilibrium distribution of invasive species with the environment within the invaded range affects the environmental representativeness of species presence–absence data collected from the field and introduces uncertainty in observed absences as these may either reflect unsuitable sites or be incidental. To address these issues, we here propose an environmental systematic sampling design to collect presence–absence data from the field and a probability index to sort and subsequently separate environmental absences (EAs: reflecting environmentally unsuitable sites) from dispersal-limited absences (DLAs: reflecting sites out of dispersal reach). We first conducted a comprehensive test based on a virtual species to evaluate the performance of our framework. Then, we applied it on different life stages of a non-native tree species (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) invasive in Europe. Results: Regarding the potential distribution, we found higher model performances for both the virtual species (true skill statistics (TSS) > 0.75) and P. serotina (TSS ≥ 0.68) after carefully selecting absences with a low probability to be DLAs compared with classical models that incorporate both EAs and DLAs (e.g. TSS = 0.11 for P. serotina with 80% of DLAs). On the contrary, both EAs and DLAs as well as dispersal-related covariates were needed to capture the realized distribution of both the virtual species and P. serotina. Main Conclusions: Our framework helps overcoming the conceptual and methodological limitations of the disequilibrium in species’ distribution models inherent to invasive species and enables managers to robustly estimate both the realized and potential distributions of invasive species. Although more relevant for modelling the distribution of non-native species, this framework can also be applied to native species. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alien species; biological invasions; dispersal limitations; potential niche; realized niche; species distribution modelling; virtual species","biological invasion; dispersal; ecological modeling; environmental conditions; home range; invasive species; niche; range expansion; sampling; software; spatial distribution; woody plant; Prunus serotina",2-s2.0-85018962117

We investigate the effects of household and road proximity, and of dog population size in the surroundings on the invasion of cacao agroforest by dogs, and evaluate if dogs raised in the vicinity are more likely to invade agroforests than dogs of unknown origin. The study was conducted in a landscape dominated by agroforests, within the cacao growing region of Southern Bahia, Brazil. Dogs were recorded by camera-traps in 15 agroforest sites, and we identified dogs inhabiting the vicinity of each sampled agroforest site by visiting all households up to 800 m from sampling sites. We obtained 115 photographic records of 47 individuals, and identified 213 dogs inhabiting the site surroundings. The number of individuals and frequency of visit of dogs tend to be higher in agroforests located nearer a household, but were not associated with the distance to the nearest road or the dog population size in the surroundings. The frequency of visits in agroforests did not differ between dogs residing in the surroundings and dogs of unknown origin. Our results indicate that the surroundings are not the main source of dogs invading agroforests, most likely because dogs perform long-distance movements in association to humans.

Remote sensing time series can inform decision-making, improving management strategies. Acacia longifolia is one of the most widespread invasive plants in Portuguese coastal areas. We used this species to test a new approach to assess how different management practices and disturbances may influence invasive plants' distribution. The Mann-Kendall statistical test was applied to a 15-year time series (2000-2015) of Landsat TM/ETM+ derived normalized difference vegetation index to detect statistically significant vegetation trends. These maps were interpreted together with a land-cover map derived from a combined rule-based and supervised classification of a Landsat OLI image from November 27th 2013; this interpretation was then complemented with information about management practices and disturbances allowing to identify the processes influencing the current distribution of A. longifolia. The overall accuracy of the classification was 0.785 (Kappa 0.753) and A. longifolia was detected in 9% (8691 ha) of the study area. Of the nine processes of land cover change identified, ""vegetation cover intensification"" and ""vegetation recovery after removal"" were the main drivers of expansion. Pine forests were vulnerable to invasion but offered resistance to conversion into A. longifolia monospecific stands, while herbaceous and shrub habitats seemed less resistant to invasion. Some interventions aiming to control A. longifolia were shown to aggravate the invasion. This approach facilitates monitoring the invasion and allows managers to allocate resources to areas where management may be most effective. © 2017 IEEE.","Acacia longifolia; Landsat; management of invasive alien plants (IAPs); Mann-Kendall test; multitemporal imagery","Classification (of information); Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Time series; Vegetation; Current distribution; Effective management; Landsat time series; Management practices; Management strategies; Normalized difference vegetation index; Supervised classification; Vegetation recovery; Decision making; environmental disturbance; imagery; introduced species; invasive species; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; management practice; remote sensing; resource allocation; testing method; time series analysis; tree; Portugal; Acacia longifolia; Intracisternal A-particles",2-s2.0-85015705309

We examined the movement patterns of an introduced population of C. auratus in a south-western Australian river using passive acoustic telemetry. The study population had a high residency index within the array (i.e. proportion of all days at liberty that, on average, each fish was detected by a receiver) with fish being detected on 64% of days. The individuals were also reasonably mobile, travelling a mean of 0.30 km (linear river kilometres).day-1 within the array, and one fish moved 231.3 km over the 365-day study period (including 5.4 km in a 24 hr period). Importantly, C. auratus displayed significant seasonal movement patterns including a clear shift in habitats during its breeding period with most mature individuals being detected in an off-channel wetland during that time.

On Santa Cruz Island, the abundance of introduced plant species is low in the arid lowlands of the Galapagos National Park, but increases with elevation into unprotected humid highlands. Two common alien plant species, guava (Psidium guajava) and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) occur at higher elevations yet their seeds are dispersed into the lowlands by migrating Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.). Tortoises transport large quantities of seeds over long distances into environments in which they have little or no chance of germination and survival under current climate conditions. However, climate change is projected to modify environmental conditions on Galapagos with unknown consequences for the distribution of native and introduced biodiversity. We quantified seed dispersal of guava and passion fruit in tortoise dung piles and the distribution of adult plants along two elevation gradients on Santa Cruz to assess current levels of ‘wasted’ seed dispersal. We computed species distribution models for both taxa under current and predicted future climate conditions. Assuming that tortoise migratory behaviour continues, current levels of “wasted” seed dispersal in lowlands were projected to decline dramatically in the future for guava but not for passion fruit. Tortoises will facilitate rapid range expansion for guava into lowland areas within the Galapagos National Park where this species is currently absent. Coupled with putative reduction in arid habitat for native species caused by climate change, tortoise driven guava invasion will pose a serious threat to local plant communities. © 2017 Ellis-Soto et al.

The synthesis of this species built a bridge for cucumber improvement through gene introgression. Allotriploid and introgression lines (ILs) have previously been produced and characterized with respect to morphology, cytology, and molecular markers. However, no clear evidence of how the chromosomal segments of C. hystrix were introgressed and inherited was found owing to the small size of chromosomes. In the present study, cucumber-C. hystrix introgression lines were developed by backcrossing the allotriploid to North China cucumber breeding line “P01” followed by self-pollination. The introgressed segments of C. hystrix in the ILs were revealed by meiotic pachytene chromosome analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on pachytene chromosomes using fosmid clones from cucumber, which confirmed that introgression occurred in the long arm of chromosome 7. Molecular analysis using a set of 53 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) indicated that the chromosomal segments of C. hystrix were introduced into 4 cucumber chromosomes, the short arms of chromosomes 2 and 6, and long arms of chromosomes 3 and 7. The inheritance of alien sequences in the long arm of chromosome 7 was investigated with 21 SSRs in self-pollinated progenies. C. hystrix-specific bands of several SSRs were still present in some individuals, indicating that the introgressed segment was partially preserved.

Plant assemblage composition was significantly influenced by time since last fire, grazing intensity and vegetation structure (live vegetation cover and vegetation height). Indicator species of species-poor, heavily grazed sites included alien species, such as Cirsium vulgare and Conyza bonariensis. Conclusion: Response of species richness to grazing intensity conforms to the predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Burning and moderate grazing should be part of grassland management. To prevent species loss and influx of alien species, heavy grazing should be minimized. As development of grassland ecological networks in a timber matrix is being pioneered in South Africa, these findings indicate a way forward for the management of similar systems elsewhere in the world. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science","Afromontane grassland; Assemblage composition; Cattle grazing; Dominance; Fire disturbance; Indicator; Intermediate disturbance hypothesis; Natural disturbance; Plant species richness; Spatial scale",,2-s2.0-85017624934

These public functions are highly dependent on specific design principles, including the composition and diversity of tree species within the urban forest. Consequently, it is important to understand the patterns and correlates of street tree distribution and diversity to assess benefit flows. This requires sampling across and within towns. This paper reports on an assessment of the distribution, composition and diversity of street trees between and within multiple South African towns, and ascertains the correlations between tree density and composition with social contexts. Randomly selected streets were sampled in the affluent, township and low cost housing suburbs of ten Eastern Cape towns. Sixty-nine out of 300 sampled transects had street trees, with 888 trees enumerated, spanning 97 species. Alien tree species accounted for 71% of all the enumerated trees while indigenous trees species accounted for 12%. Tree density and composition were significantly lower in smaller towns and those marginalised during the previous racially-based political regime. Within towns, the poor areas had fewer street trees, with many streets having none. Collaboration and constant communication between the various government departments involved in suburb development is crucial to ensure a more rigorous incorporation of green infrastructure into the building and development plans of new housing developments. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Composition; Density; Former homelands; Street trees; Town size","community composition; greenspace; infrastructure planning; population density; population size; urban development; urban ecosystem; Eastern Cape; South Africa",2-s2.0-85018245827

To address this issue, we developed a method to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which is now being used for personal identification in forensics. We designed a panel of 153 Korean-specific high-performance multiplexed SNPs and performed NGS using 233 DNA samples collected from eight different ethnic groups around the world. Eight Korean-specific genetic markers (rs28777, rs1010872, rs6043841, rs6034433, rs885479, rs2503107, rs4530059, and rs214955) that were screened showed significant variability among the ethnic groups. Three markers were novel SNPs that were absent from our multiplexed SNP panel, and two markers were associated with specific phenotypes. Our high-performance multiplexed SNP panel allows efficient screening of Korean-specific SNP alleles in populations that are genetically similar to the Korean population (e.g., Japanese and northeast Asians including Chinese and Eurasians), which will be useful for personal identification, paternity testing, and forensic investigations. © 2016, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer-Science and Media.","Forensic DNA identification; Genomic variation; Ion PGM; Massively parallel sequencing; Multiplexed SNP panel","DNA; genomic DNA; African; Article; Asian; bioinformatics; Cambodian; Caucasian; Chinese; controlled study; DNA determination; DNA sequence; ethnic group; forensic genetics; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic background; genetic marker; genetic screening; genotype; human; Japanese (people); Korean (people); multiplex polymerase chain reaction; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; normal human; paternity test; phenotype; sensitivity analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; skin color; species difference",2-s2.0-85019766172

In some regions of North America, T. latifolia and T. angustifolia hybridize to produce T. x glauca, which is invading and dominating wetlands around the Laurentian Great Lakes. However, in other regions such as China and the maritime provinces of Canada, hybrids are either non-existent or maintained at very low frequencies, and cattails are not considered invasive. Little is known about cattail hybrids in Europe. We used microsatellite markers to characterize T. latifolia, T. angustifolia, T. laxmannii, and T. domingensis sampled from 63 sites across nine European countries. Hybrids were very uncommon (<2% of all sampled plants), and resulted from crosses involving two of T. latifolia, T. angustifolia and T. domingensis. Infrequent hybridization may partly explain why Typha does not dominate European wetlands. However, we identified two distinct genetic clusters within T. angustifolia, broadly corresponding to eastern and western Europe. In addition, our T. laxmannii samples were from countries where it is considered alien, and populations show a high degree of genetic differentiation that is consistent with independent introductions.

We analyzed sequence data from one mtDNA locus and four nuDNA introns to infer the origin(s) of the Saint Croix and Panamá City populations and quantify their genetic diversity. Saint Croix and Panamanian populations do not share any haplotypes, and they cluster with different native populations, suggesting that they are derived from separate sources in the Puerto Rican Bank. Patterns of population structure trace the probable sources of E. antillensis in Saint Croix to islands off Puerto Rico's eastern coast, which include Vieques, Culebra, Saint Thomas, Saint John, Tortola, and Virgin Gorda, and possibly to eastern Puerto Rico as well. In contrast, Panamá City E. antillensis probably originated from either western or eastern Puerto Rico.

We used a framework to present the effect of the two fundamental social, political and economic changes on the biodiversity and ecosystems of Hungary from 1989 until recently. First, following the democratic transformation in 1989 social, political, economic and institutional drivers led to the increase in farmland biodiversity, improvement of water quality due to less chemical use and decrease of habitat loss within protected areas. At the same time, land privatisation and uncertain ownership led to habitat degradation, abandonment and fragmentation. These changes were coupled with the spread of alien species and re-ploughing. The second change was joining the European Union in 2004. This resulted in the establishment of the Natura 2000 network, the application of the relevant EU policies, and access to conservation related EU funds, which contributed to successful habitat restorations increasing of some charismatic species' populations. Meanwhile, however, disappearance of extensive farming practices, agricultural intensification and infrastructural developments driven by some increasing EU funds led to a net habitat loss, degradation and decline in biodiversity, with more than half of the species of European importance having unfavourable conservation status. Increased support for conservation institutions, adaptive and extended agri-environment schemes and further research and monitoring to establish, refine and supervise sustainable management practices, including water management, are needed to prevent further biodiversity loss in the coming years. © 2017","Conservation institutions and governance; European Union; Farmland; Forest; Freshwater; Grassland; Habitat changes","agricultural intensification; agricultural land; biodiversity; conservation status; environmental monitoring; European Union; farming system; grassland; habitat loss; habitat restoration; habitat structure; infrastructural development; Hungary",2-s2.0-85019229171

Our analysis draws attention to the consequences of the genre of methodology-as-technique which relate to a narrowing and displacement of research goals, erasure of context, and devaluation and marginalization of alternatives. By providing insight into how methodology-as-technique comes to dominate in peripheral locations such as India, we suggest that these normative constraints also present an opportunity for denaturalization, by making what is increasingly seen as normal appear alien or strange.

Contemporary developments suggest that the future of warfare will not be 'robots' as technological, individualised substitutions for idealised (masculine) warfighters, but warfighters understood as swarms: Insect metaphors for non-centrally organised problem-solvers that will become technologies of racialisation. As such, contemporary feminist analysis requires an analysis of the politics of life and death in the insect and the swarm, which, following Braidotti (2002), cannot be assumed to be a mere metaphor or representation of political life, but an animating materialist logic. The swarm is not only a metaphor but also a central mode of biopolitical and necropolitical war, with the 'terrorist' enemy represented as swarm-like as well. In analysing the relations of assemblage and antagonism in the war ontologies of the drone swarm, I seek inspiration from what Hayles (1999, p. 47) describes as a double vision that 'looks simultaneously at the power of simulation and at the materialities that produce it'. I discuss various representations and manifestations of swarms and insect life in science/speculative fiction, from various presentations of the 'Borg' in Star Trek (1987-1994, 1995-2001, 1996), Alien (1979) and The Fly (1958, 1986) to more positive representations of the 'becoming-insect' as possible feminist utopia in Gilman's Herland (2015 [1915]) and Tiptree's Houston, Houston, Do You Read? (1989 [1976]). Posthuman warfare also contains the possibilities of both appropriating and rewriting antagonisms of masculine and feminine in the embodiment of the subject of war in the swarm.

As part of formulating a conservation strategy for the species in Swaziland we sought to determine its distribution and population status and to revise its national conservation status. Field surveys were conducted in all physiographic regions of Swaziland. Eighteen locations of species presence were found, of which 14 were new records. Three were within protected areas, and seven were in areas worthy of protection. The largest subpopulations occurred in two of the latter areas, Ngudzeni and Sitsatsaweni (351 and 230 individuals, respectively), and one unprotected area, Bulunga (250 individuals). Warburgia salutaris has a severely fragmented distribution and an area of occupancy of 192 km2. Of 700 mature individuals 38% were ring-barked and 7% felled, and some subpopulations had ring-barked juveniles. This indicates a plausible decline in number of mature individuals. Most localities in unprotected areas are eroded and invaded by alien plants, indicating a decline in habitat quality. Our findings indicate that W. salutaris should be categorized as Endangered nationally based on criteria B2ab (iii,v). Although this status implies a lower level of threat than the previous national categorization as Critically Endangered, it does not imply an improved conservation effort in the country, but rather a more accurate assessment based on more data. We have clarified the conservation status of W. salutaris in Swaziland, discovered some previously undocumented subpopulations and identified potential conservation interventions. We recommend that this information be used in setting priorities to ensure conservation of the species.

Individuals with xenomelia typically experience one of their limbs as over-present and aversive, leading to a desire to amputate the limb. Similarly, many transgender individuals describe their untreated sexed body parts as incongruent and aversive, and many experience phantom body parts of the sex they identify with (Ramachandran, 2008). This experience may relate to differences in brain representation of the sexed body part, as suggested in xenomelia (McGeoch et al., 2011). We utilized magnetoencephalography imaging to record brain activity during somatosensory stimulation of the breast—a body part that feels incongruent to most presurgical female-to-male (FtM)-identified transgender individuals—and the hand, a body part that feels congruent. We measured the sensory evoked response in right hemisphere somatosensory and body-related brain areas and found significantly reduced activation in the supramarginal gyrus and secondary somatosensory cortex, but increased activation at the temporal pole for chest sensation in the FtM group (N = 8) relative to non-transgender females (N = 8). In addition, we found increased white matter coherence in the supramarginal gyrus and temporal pole and decreased white matter diffusivity in the anterior insula and temporal pole in the FtM group. These findings suggest that dysphoria related to gender-incongruent body parts in FtM individuals may be tied to differences in neural representation of the body and altered white matter connectivity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","Body image; Body representation; Gender dysphoria; Gender identity; Parietal lobes; Transgender","adult; diagnostic imaging; female; human; magnetoencephalography; male; middle aged; pathology; Perceptual Disorders; psychology; statistics and numerical data; transgender; white matter; young adult; Adult; Female; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Middle Aged; Perceptual Disorders; Transgender Persons; White Matter; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84988419344

In this study, we assess the invasive flora of nine islands in the West Indies to identify invasion patterns and evaluate whether invasive species diversity is related to geographical, ecological, and socioeconomic factors. We compiled a database of invasive plant species including information on their taxonomy, origin, pathways of introduction, habitats, and life history. This database was used to evaluate the similarity of invasive floras between islands and to identify invasion patterns at regional (West Indies) and local (island) scales. We found a total of 516 alien plant species that are invasive on at least one of the nine islands studied, with between 24 to 306 invasive species per island. The invasive flora on these islands includes a wide range of taxonomic groups, life forms, and habitats. We detected low similarity in invasive species diversity between islands, with most invasive species (>60%) occurring on a single island and 6% occurring on at least five islands. To assess the importance of different models in predicting patterns of invasive species diversity among islands, we used generalized linear models. Our analyses revealed that invasive species diversity was well predicted by a combination of island area and economic development (gross domestic product per capita and kilometers of paved roadways). Our results provide strong evidence for the roles of geographical, ecological, and socioeconomic factors in determining the distribution and spread of invasive species on these islands. Anthropogenic disturbance and economic development seem to be the major drivers facilitating the spread and predominance of invasive species over native species. © 2017 The Authors.

Also the Ligurian Sea has witnessed in several episodes (surface water warming, benthic mucilage developments, etc.) linked to the climate change that have influenced the structure of the benthic communities. In order to evaluate possible changes inside the benthic upper infralittoral community (4–7 m depth) living along the southern cliff of the Portofino MPA, sets of macro-photographs, realized in 2002–2003 and repeated 10 years later (2013), were analysed. The community structure, diversity, and species abundance were studied in 9 stations placed in three different localities (Ca'dell'Oro Bay, Punta Chiappa Point and St Fruttuoso Bay) at different levels of protection, although considered potentially affected only by natural stressors and not by direct human impacts. Over 10-years, a significant change in the macroalgal coverage and composition was observed in all considered stations and localities, with a reduction of the habitat complexity, being the frondose and habitat-forming macroalgae (Fucales, Dyctiotales) significantly decreased. In contrast, as regards the sessile zoobenthos, there has been an increase of branched bryozoans and a drop in the presence of barnacles and mussels. A significant emergence of some alien species (Asparagopsis armata,Caulerpa cylindraceaand Paraleucilla magna) linked to warmer waters was recorded too. In conclusion, the benthic upper infralittoral community (4–7 m depth) of the Portofino MPA seems to have being influenced by several climatic large-scale events that occurred in recent years in the Ligurian Sea and the change of its structural composition could be considered as a warning signal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Effects of global changes; Infralittoral community; Marine benthic community; Marine biodiversity; Mediterranean Sea",,2-s2.0-85019013636
